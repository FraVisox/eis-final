If so, you aren’t alone. The fear of a Friday that falls on the 13th day of a month is thought to be the most widely held superstition in the English-speaking world. It’s so common that two distinct words have been coined to describe it: paraskevidekatriaphobia; and friggatriskaidekaphobia. These tongue-twisting terms can lend a bogus scientific cachet to an irrational belief, conjuring up white coats and clipboards. And sure enough, there have been studies. Serious studies. One of the most widely cited, published in the British Medical Journal in 1993, noted that traffic on a section of M25 on Friday the 13th was 1.4% lower than on the previous Friday (suggesting that some people had stayed at home) – while hospital admissions for road accidents in the M25 region were higher. The authors concluded: “The risk of hospital admission as a result of transport accident may be increased by as much as 52%. Staying at home is recommended.” Stay at home? On Friday the 13th? It’s the last place you want to be – as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents never tires of reminding us: “More accidents happen at home than anywhere else.” Your lounge and living room are particularly hazardous. You’re far safer outside. This is the Dutch solution, and according to reports, it works. On a typical Friday in Holland, insurers expect to be notified of 7,800 traffic accidents, but when Friday falls on the 13th it drops to 7,500. It could be that Dutch drivers are staying at home more carefully than their British counterparts, or are driven by superstition to drive with more caution. In other words, Friday the 13th could be said to provide an excellent example of confirmation bias. If we walk down the street half-expecting something terrible to happen, we almost feel rewarded if it does. This makes the bad event more memorable and intensifies the superstition around the conjunction of date and day. Usually you’d just chalk it up to experience. But on Friday the 13th? Never. Imagine how gratified the 13 people in this article felt when their worst dreams came true. Psychologists link this bias to the human need to feel in control of events. If something bizarre or random occurs, it’s easier to blame the calendar than to face up to difficult truths. Would the City’s “Black Friday” of 1989 still be name-checked so frequently if hadn’t also been 13 October? Worryingly, according to a 2008 study published in Science magazine, it’s precisely when things like a stock market crash happen that we humans are most likely to try to form patterns, correlations and conspiracies. When we arrive at the limits of our understanding, we reach for the comfort provided by superstition to maintain the illusion of control. This is where religion comes in, and the most commonly cited origins of the Friday the 13th myth go back to the number of diners at Christ’s Last Supper. However, we know that ancient Egyptians and Romans had both previously taken a dim view of the number 13. Modern Romans, by contrast, have no strong feelings about it. In Italy, 17 is the number to watch out for, while in Greece and many Spanish-speaking countries it’s Tuesday the 13th that you need to be wary of. So, the next time there’s a Friday the 13th – April 2018 – you may be better off taking a city break in Madrid. Or perhaps that would be tempting fate? • Nigel Kendall is a freelance journalist and former senior content manager at Guardian Labs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/13/whats-your-experience-of-sexual-harassment-at-work-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T17:02:16Z","webTitle":"What's your experience of sexual harassment at work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/13/whats-your-experience-of-sexual-harassment-at-work-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/13/whats-your-experience-of-sexual-harassment-at-work-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"What's your experience of sexual harassment at work?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thousands of people marched in Los Angeles on Sunday in support of victims of sexual assault and harassment, inspired by a social media campaign that has exposed the extent of sexual abuse in everyday life. The #MeToo march along Sunset Boulevard follows a relentless series of accusations by men and women who say they were victimised by high-powered figures in the entertainment industry. Oscar-winning actor Emma Thompson is one of several high-profile women who has branded Harvey Weinstein a bully and a predator, and warned that there are many more men like him in Hollywood. Thompson described Weinstein as “the top of a very particular iceberg” in “a system of harassment and belittling and bullying and interference” that has exposed a culture of silence in the film industry. As the scandal surrounding the disgraced film producer deepens, more and more women are coming forward to share their own experiences of harassment and abuse in their own industries, with many calling for this to be a moment for change. We’d like you to share your experiences of sexual harassment at work. Did you report it – if not, why? What action did your company take? And how did the people around you react?

Well, here’s the truth: I watch what people put in their baskets at the supermarket and use the sight of something unusual as an excuse to start a conversation. I use innocent social occasions such as an appointment at the hairdressers and time waiting in post office queues to ask people what they cook for themselves in comfort, to celebrate with, or when they have no time at all. I go into Chinese, Sri Lankan and Italian shops and scour the shelves, taking items up to the shopkeeper to ask what possible use they could have for dried kelp slices, long, thin onion flowers or fat-stemmed caper berries. All this information stacks up like Tetris blocks to weave a picture of how other people live; where they’re from and what they care about. It is partly, or mostly, why I write about food. And, when I’m at my kitchen table, it spurs me to the stove. Today’s recipe sprung to life from a chat with a Ghanaian woman in an African greengrocer. We were both looking at the same packet of melon seeds, which Indians use thriftily to add protein to and thicken dishes. She said Ghanaians and Nigerians use them in the same way, to make egusi, a leafy vegetable stew spiced with ginger, garlic and scotch bonnet. From a quick conversation and a rough recipe, I took the plunge once again into someone else’s life and loved it. A little reminder to keep talking to strangers, I thought. Chickpea, chard and sunflower seed egusi with polenta dumplings This stew is traditionally made with spinach and ground melon seed, but here I’ve used seasonal chard and more readily available sunflower seeds. Be sure to buy quick-cook polenta for the dumplings. You’ll need a food processor. Serves four. 150g sunflower seeds Salt 200g quick-cook polenta 1 tbsp rapeseed oil 2 brown onions, peeled and finely sliced 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 3cm ginger, peeled and grated 1 scotch bonnet chilli, deseeded and finely chopped ½ tsp hot-smoked paprika 500g chard, leaves and stalks separated – leaves roughly chopped, stalks chopped into 2cm pieces 2 tbsp tomato puree 400g tinned chickpeas, drained Blitz the sunflower seeds to a coarse dust in a food processor, then mix with 150ml of water to make a paste. Line an oven tray with greaseproof paper and bring a pan filled with 800ml water to a rolling boil. Add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, pour in the polenta, then cook, stirring constantly, until the polenta takes on the consistency of stiff mash potato or dough – about eight minutes. Leave to cool for five minutes or so, then take a tablespoon dipped in very cold water and scoop out dumpling-sized portions of the polenta mixture – you should end up with about 15 dumplings. Place these on the tray and leave to one side. Heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium flame, and once it’s hot fry the onions, garlic, ginger, chilli and a teaspoon of salt, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onions are completely soft and browning. Add the paprika, chard stalks and tomato puree, leave to cook for two minutes more, then stir in the chickpeas and cook for a minute. Add 500ml hot water to the pan and bring up to a steady simmer. Once the mix is simmering, stir in the sunflower seed paste. The sauce will appear grainy and have the look of scrambled eggs at this stage, but don’t be alarmed: that’s exactly what you want. Lay the chard leaves on top of the sauce and scatter over half a teaspoon of salt – do not stir the leaves in. Cover the pan and leave the chard to steam for five minutes. Remove the lid, stir once or twice to incorporate the cooked leaves, and season to taste. Add the dumplings to the pot briefly, to warm through, then serve the stew in a rimmed plate with the dumplings on the side. This article was edited on 8 November 2017, to clarify that the dumplings need warming through in the stew before serving."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/13/bertie-wooster-returns-as-a-spy-in-jeeves-sequel-by-schotts-miscellany-author","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T14:48:08Z","webTitle":"Bertie Wooster returns as a spy in Jeeves sequel by Schott's Miscellany author","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/13/bertie-wooster-returns-as-a-spy-in-jeeves-sequel-by-schotts-miscellany-author","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/13/bertie-wooster-returns-as-a-spy-in-jeeves-sequel-by-schotts-miscellany-author","fields":{"headline":"Bertie Wooster returns as a spy in Jeeves sequel by Schott's Miscellany author","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bertie Wooster, PG Wodehouse’s “mentally somewhat negligible” English gentleman with a heart of gold, is set to be reimagined as a British spy by Ben Schott, the author of the bestselling collection of trivia Schott’s Original Miscellany. Schott, whose forthcoming Jeeves and the King of Clubs is sanctioned by the PG Wodehouse estate, called it “an incomparable honour to follow in the patent-leather footsteps of the greatest English-language humorist”. He admitted to a certain amount of nerves: “It’s like being lent the Crown Jewels.” Out next November from Hutchinson, the novel will not only reimagine Wooster as a spy, it will also turn the Junior Ganymede, that club for the gentleman’s gentleman where a butler must contribute to a book all of the “latest information concerning the fellow he’s working for” (18 pages are devoted to Bertie), into a branch of the British Secret Service. “[It] is set within the Wooster universe; sharing the same characters, locations, and interwar period. However, it skews this firmament by a couple of degrees,” said Schott. “The result can be summed up in two words: high jinks.” Schott’s miscellany and its sequels, as well as his six volumes of Schott’s Almanac, have sold three million copies around the world. But the author admitted that taking on the inimitable voice of Wodehouse (“He had the look of one who had drunk the cup of life and found a dead beetle at the bottom”) was “definitely a diagonal step”. “I think the secret is not to mimic the Wodehouse voice, but to find its unique rhythm. The best impersonators don’t caricature, they inhabit,” said Schott, pointing to a Wodehouse-inspired sketch he recently wrote that saw Donald Trump meet Wooster. After Trump’s suggestion that he play golf is nixed, Bertie suggests a game of croquet. I made the universal gesture of a man swinging a mallet. ‘Cricket?’ ‘Croquet.’ ‘What’s the difference?’ It’s jarring to encounter such a world-view so early in the morning, and it took every ounce of the Wooster grey matter to marshall a coherent answer. ‘Croquet is a little like chess,’ I explained, ‘played on grass. With balls.’ “I was amazed not only by how much fun it was to write, but also that people did not recoil in horror. It was this piece that set the cogs turning,” said Schott, adding that he had been “enthralled by PG Wodehouse ever since an aged relative placed a well-thumbed copy of Carry On, Jeeves into my tender, unsuspecting hands. “That book, and the characters therein, opened up an empire of comic writing on which the sun has never set. I am beyond delighted to be commissioned to write a new Jeeves and Wooster novel, and to play with the pulleys, levers, gears, cranks, and knotted ropes of Plum’s creative genius,” he said. Schott’s experience writing his earlier books, he hoped, would help in the writing of his first novel. “The miscellanies gave me a deep love of detail, and I think detail is the key to writing a book like this. It’s not enough to have the broad sweep of Wodehouse – every phrase, every word, must ring true.” Jocasta Hamilton at Hutchinson, which acquired the novel for a six-figure sum, called Jeeves and the King of Clubs “a testament to the characters that Wodehouse created … With great wit and skill, it shows that the axis can tilt in such a way to make his characters feel fresh without altering the qualities that have made them so loved and so enduring,” she said. “Ben’s knowledge of, and affection for, Wodehouse is infectious. He absolutely understands what makes Wodehouse so special: the combination of clever plotting and deliciously surprising language.” Wodehouse was the author of more than 90 novels and around 300 short stories. But appetite for more writing set in the worlds he created remains strong, with Schott following in the footsteps of Sebastian Faulks’s well-received novel Jeeves and the Wedding Bells, which was published in 2013. The Wodehouse Estate said: “We are delighted by the prospect of Ben Schott’s imaginative and witty novel about two of the best loved Wodehousian characters. We anticipate that this will encourage yet further readers … and remind existing fans to revisit Wodehouse’s impeccable library.” Schott’s novel is the latest in a stream of recent sequels authorised by estates, from Eoin Colfer’s follow-up to Douglas Adams’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy books to Sophie Hannah’s Poirot books, and Anthony Horowitz’s takes on Sherlock Holmes and James Bond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-unveils-relief-plans-for-rohingya-muslims-myanmar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T14:29:48Z","webTitle":"Aung San Suu Kyi unveils relief plans for Rohingya Muslims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-unveils-relief-plans-for-rohingya-muslims-myanmar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-unveils-relief-plans-for-rohingya-muslims-myanmar","fields":{"headline":"Aung San Suu Kyi unveils relief plans for Rohingya Muslims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has announced plans to set up a civilian-led agency, with foreign assistance, to deliver aid and help resettle Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. A close adviser, speaking with Aung San Suu Kyi’s knowledge, said the proposed body had been long planned, and was part of an attempt to show the civilian government she leads, rather than the Burmese military, can deliver humanitarian relief, resettlement and economic recovery. The Nobel laureate has been criticised for failing to denounce a brutal army crackdown on the Rohingya in Rakhine state, which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. Thousands of refugees have continued to arrive in recent days from across the Naf river separating the two countries, even though Myanmar insists military operations ceased on 5 September. Aid agencies estimate that 536,000 people have arrived in Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh, straining scarce resources of aid groups and local communities. About 200,000 Rohingya were already in Bangladesh after fleeing persecution in Myanmar, where they have long been denied citizenship and faced restrictions on their movements and access to basic services. The adviser said Aung San Suu Kyi had been deeply affected by the crisis in her country, and was determined to fix it, but needed to be careful not to inflame the situation further. “She is appalled by what she has seen. She does care deeply about this. I know that does not always come across. But she really does,” said the adviser, who asked not to be named. “What was not clear to her [before now] was how to fix it, and how to give the civilian government the powers it needed”. In a speech carried by state TV late on Thursday, Aung San Suu Kyi said: “There has been a lot of criticisms against our country. We need to understand international opinion. However, just as no one can fully understand the situation of our country the way we do, no one can desire peace and development for our country more than us.” Many of Aung San Suu Kyi’s former allies have been exasperated by her failure to criticise the military, but the adviser said she was treading a fine line, knowing her government could become under threat of being overthrown by the military. The adviser added her speech marked an attempt to wrestle Buddhism out of the hands of extremists. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power ending years of military rule in a compromise that left the military with sweeping powers. In her new proposal, she said she was setting up a new body to deliver relief and resettlement on the ground, as well as implement projects in all sectors of the region. “It is going to be an implementation unit and will introduce a degree of transparency into the government that will allow the international community to participate and provide aid”, the adviser added. The aim is for the body to be a vehicle through which recovery aid, including that delivered by the UK, can be funnelled. Her adviser said Aung San Suu Kyi understood the moral priority of humanitarian assistance, the need to build new homes for those who had to flee as well as the need for economic development in the region. “She has put herself front and centre of this and said ‘I will lead this’ ”. The adviser added: “She is someone who through her whole life has been committed to the values of human rights. That has not gone away, but she is very focused on fixing the problem, rather than identifying it. “She recognises there have been particular tragedies amongst the Muslim communities, and amongst other small minority groups. But, yes, she does see this latest and most dreadful upsurge of violence as stemming from carefully timed political attacks on police stations.” Aung San Suu Kyi’s speech made no mention of the allegations levelled against security forces, over which she has no formal control under the military-drafted constitution. State media in recent weeks, however, has offered repeated denials of the human rights allegations, often blaming misreporting by the west. In her speech, she said: “Rather than rebutting criticisms and allegations with words, we will show the world by our actions and our deeds. In the Rakhine state, there are so many things to be done.” Her adviser said: “She is trying to move away from inflammatory and divisive remarks towards a coherent national solution that is civilian-led. The perilous state of the democratic transition in her country is understood.” Aung San Suu Kyi listed repatriation of those who have fled to Bangladesh as a top priority, a task that faces political and practical hurdles, notably due to the fact that tens of thousands of Muslim refugees who fled to Bangladesh do not have the documentation likely to satisfy the military that they have a right of return. However, detailed work remains on possible forms of new registration to allow the Rohingya to return. In another attempt to respond to western criticisms, Myanmar’s military has launched an internal investigation into the conduct of soldiers during the army’s offensive in Rakhine, which was launched after attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security posts in late August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/15/marys-household-tips-and-tricks-by-mary-berry-digested-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T16:00:35Z","webTitle":"Mary’s Household Tips and Tricks by Mary Berry – digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/15/marys-household-tips-and-tricks-by-mary-berry-digested-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/15/marys-household-tips-and-tricks-by-mary-berry-digested-read","fields":{"headline":"Mary’s Household Tips and Tricks by Mary Berry – digested read","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’ve had a lot of time to gather tips and hints about cooking and how to run a home because I’ve lived in a house for quite a long time. This book is a collection of some of the ones you’ve probably already thought of yourself. The kitchen This is the heart of any home and will normally contain a fridge, a cooker, a sink and some cupboards. When planning a kitchen, try to make sure all these items are in the places you want them. The fridge Having a freezer compartment can be very useful for storing food that you don’t want to eat immediately. I always think a bag of frozen peas can cheer up any meal. Rather than have a tomato soup for supper, why not put in a bit more effort and make a tomato and pea soup? When cleaning your fridge, it is a good idea to wait until there is not much food in it. If you wait until you have just done a big shop, you will have to take everything out again. The cooker My assistant, Lucy, and I always like to use an Aga. Do check out some of my Aga cookbooks for recipes. But if you don’t have the space or a few thousand pounds to spare, you can always buy a cheaper gas oven. The sink Always remember to situate your sink near a water supply. There is nothing more frustrating than turning on a tap and finding nothing coming out of it. The store cupboard I always make sure my jars of spices have their labels pointing towards the front. That way, I don’t have to turn them round to make sure I have picked up the right one. • Don’t believe the old housewives’ tale that a watched saucepan never boils. Providing the gas is turned up high enough, a watched saucepan will boil. • Keeping a list of things you need to buy is a good way of making sure you don’t either forget to buy something or buy something you already have. • When baking, don’t use any of Prue Leith’s cookbooks. She really doesn’t have a clue what she is doing. Cleaning Every house gets a bit dirty from time to time, so it is important that you have the right utensils to clean. Never use a yellow duster as they can dye all your clothes yellow when you come to wash it. Instead, use a white one. When dusting shelves that are out of reach from ground level, either use a stepladder or attach the duster to a stick. Cleaning carpets can be hard work, which is why I normally get Lucy to do it for me. Before cleaning a carpet, it can be a good idea to think about vacuuming it first. • If you have a Hoover on every floor of your house, it saves you having to carry one up and down the stairs, which can get a bit tiring. The living room When buying a sofa, make sure you choose one that fits into your living room. Not all sofas are the same size and it can be hugely disappointing to order one that you have to leave outside on the pavement. To measure a sofa properly, use a measuring tape. For many people, the television is the focal point of the room. Try to choose one that doesn’t get Channel 4. It’s gone downhill dreadfully recently and features programmes with that awful, money-grabbing Paul Hollywood. • A coffee table doesn’t have to be just for coffee mugs. You can also use it to store newspapers and the remote control devices. Personal possessions Hats and coats can be hung on hooks in the hallway. If you have small children, it can be useful to situate some hooks at a lower level so that they can reach them. Books can be stored on bookshelves. It’s also useful to have a spare set of keys in case you lose your main set. If you label the spares as “Spare set of keys”, you won’t confuse them with the main set you use in your day-to-day life. The bedroom At the centre of the bedroom is the bed. The bed should be comfortable, so make sure you test one out before buying. If you want to read in bed at night, it can be useful to have a bedside light. Otherwise you will have to get out of bed when you’ve finished reading, to switch off the main overhead light. The garden This is the patch of land outside the house. The green bit is a lawn and the side bits are the flowerbeds. Though you can also grow vegetables in them if you want. When choosing what plants to grow, it is always a good idea to select ones you quite like. • Don’t worry if you don’t have a garden. You can always buy some flowers from the local garage to cheer you up.

The causes of this devastating event are complex, from a changing climate to local sea-ice factors, but one thing penguins, whales and other marine life don’t need is additional strain on food supplies. Over the next year we have the opportunity to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary – the largest protected area on Earth – which would put the waters off-limits to the industrial fishing vessels currently sucking up the tiny shrimp-like krill, on which all Antarctic life relies. In 1990, the Voyager 1 space probe looked back at Earth from six billion kilometres away and took a historic selfie of our solar system. What it saw, according to renowned astrophysicist Carl Sagan, was a “pale blue dot”. “Our planet is a blue planet,” echoed David Attenborough, in his opening words to the BBC’s landmark Blue Planet series. With over 70% of our world covered by water, this is no exaggeration. Our oceans can be seen from across the solar system. The majority of this water falls outside of national borders. In fact, almost half of our planet is a marine natural wonder outside the boundaries of flags, languages and national divisions. These vast areas cover 230 million square kilometres, and they belong to us all. To give a sense of scale, that’s the size of every single continent combined, with another Asia, Europe and Africa thrown in for good measure. The size of our oceans may seem overwhelming. Our collective responsibility to protect them, however, should not. It wasn’t long ago that the oceans were thought to be too vast to be irrevocably impacted by human actions, but the effects of overfishing, oil drilling, deep sea mining, pollution and climate change have shown that humans are more than up to the task of imperilling the sea and the animals that live there. All of us who live on this planet are the guardians of these environments, not only to protect the wildlife that lives in them, but because the health of our oceans sustains our planet and the livelihoods of billions of people. Here’s the good news. The tide of history is turning. We on the blue planet are finally looking seriously at protecting the blue bits. Just a few months ago, in a stuffy room far from the sea, governments from around the world agreed to start a process to protect them: an ocean treaty. This ocean treaty won’t be agreed until at least 2020, but in the meantime momentum is already building towards serious and binding ocean protection. Just last year a huge 1.5 million sq km area was protected in the Ross Sea in the Antarctic. In a turbulent political climate, it was a momentous demonstration of how international cooperation to protect our shared home can and does work. Over the next two weeks, the governments responsible for the Antarctic are meeting to discuss the future of the continent and its waters. While limited proposals are on the table this year, when they reconvene in 12 months’ time they have a historic opportunity to create the largest ever protected area on Earth: an Antarctic Ocean sanctuary. Covering the Weddell Sea next to the Antarctic peninsula, it would be five times the size of Germany, the country proposing it. The Antarctic is home to a great diversity of life: huge colonies of emperor and Adélie penguins, the incredible colossal squid with eyes the size of basketballs that allow it to see in the depths, and the largest animal on the planet, the blue whale, which has veins large enough for a person to swim down. The creeping expansion of industrial fishing is targeting the one species on which practically every animal in the Antarctic relies: krill. These tiny shrimp-like creatures are crucial for the survival of penguins, whales, seals and other wildlife. With a changing climate already placing wildlife populations in the Antarctic under pressure, an expanding krill industry is bad news for the health of the Antarctic Ocean. Even worse, the krill industry and the governments that back it are blocking attempts at environmental protection in the Antarctic. Ocean sanctuaries provide relief for wildlife and ecosystems to recover, but it’s not just about protecting majestic blue whales and penguin colonies. The benefits are global. Recovering fish populations spread around the globe and only now are scientists beginning to fully understand the role that healthy oceans play in soaking up carbon dioxide and helping us to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Sanctuaries encourage vital biodiversity, provide food security for the billions of people that rely on our oceans, and are essential to tackling climate change.

It’s a little more complex than that, it seems: the findings could potentially resolve one of cosmology’s most perplexing problems. Scientists have also discovered that dwarf planet Haumea, a rugby ball-shaped planet which lies beyond Neptune, has a ring around it. Until now, ring-like structures had only been found around Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Returning to Earth, there’s optimistic news from a trial using psilocybin – the psychoactive compound that occurs naturally in magic mushrooms – to treat patients with depression. The study suggests that it might “reboot” the brain, although more trials are needed, and the researchers have warned against self medication. Also intriguing on the brain front is a piece of research that appears to confirm the stereotype that women are kinder and less selfish than men. Apparently our reward system is geared towards more “prosocial” and generous behaviour. That said, another study out this week seems to show that there is one area in which women are unwilling to compromise: household temperature. And on that chilly note, we’ll end with the cool news that in the wake of the loss of iceberg A68 from the Larsen C ice shelf, British Antarctic Survey researchers will study the damaged area, which has been hidden for up to 120,000 years.

While this is astonishing in itself, it has important biological implications as well. Oviraptor eggs are often found in distinct arrangements: in overlapping circles, partially stuck in nesting material and with the blunt ends exposed and pointing upwards. They were likely laid this way deliberately. In modern birds, blue-green eggs are found in emus and cassowaries. These birds lay their eggs on the ground covered with leaves and vegetation; the blue-green colour of the eggs allows them to blend in with the vegetation. This may have been the case in oviraptors as well; evidence from sedimentology and palaeoclimate reconstructions from the Late Cretaceous of China suggests that a subtropical vegetation may have covered the sites where the nests were found, thus necessitating suitable camouflaged eggs for ground nesting birds.

It’s important to know that we are different,” former British Museum director Neil MacGregor said about Britain last week. “We are a very unusual society. We are trying to do something that no society has really done.” Get off the fence, Neil! Are you for Brexit or against? He wasn’t talking about Brexit. I mean, he’s bound to be against, isn’t he? If Neil MacGregor is pro-Brexit then all bets are off and it probably turns out David Attenborough has a personalised numberplate and Paris Hilton collects Toby jugs. Brexit wasn’t what he was talking about. He was speaking at the launch of his Radio 4 series Living With the Gods, an artefact-led programme on the A History of the World in 100 Objects model, which charts “40,000 years of believing and belonging” through the beautiful and wacky items we humans have fashioned over the centuries – Zoroastrian tiles, mammoth-ivory lion gods, John Paul II bottle openers that play a tune, etc – to honour whatever impossible things any given culture was in the habit of believing before breakfast. Religion, then. MacGregor believes that in western Europe, and nowhere more than in Britain, society is extremely unusual because it really doesn’t have an overarching shared religion. “We are trying to live without an agreed narrative of our communal place in the cosmos and in time,” he said. “Our society is, not just historically but in comparison to the rest of the world today, a very, very unusual one in being like that.” That sounded quite grand. I was impressed with us: ooh, get Britain! Living without a shared religious narrative! All cynical and dubious and sceptical and multicultural – getting through life without any agreed view regarding the undisprovable void that lies at the end of it. It felt valiant and pioneering and futuristic, like the Crystal Palace or Concorde or trying to get by without owning a printer. Is it true, though? To me, Britain in the early 21st century feels normal, not unusual. Then again, it’s the only society I’ve ever lived in apart from Britain in the late 20th century, to which it displays striking similarities. Though there’s a bit less striking. But it certainly doesn’t seem very religious. Many people are religious but it feels like an opt-in. It’s a not particularly unusual quirk about a person, like an allergy or a nose ring or Camra membership. “Is it a family thing?” you ask, hoping so, as that’s a less unsettling explanation than “No it’s a something-I’ve-concluded-in-my-head thing”, which advances the unavoidable implication that they think you should have concluded it too. Personally, I haven’t definitely not concluded it. I always say I’m agnostic because I’d like there to be a God – a nice liberal one – but I can’t be sure there is and the idea of regular religious observance unnerves me because it would be unusual in my peer group. Not a very well thought-through philosophy, I know. But in the absence of family or societal pressures, in a context of almost complete religious freedom, many of us rely on similar back-of-an-envelope answers to eternal questions, because adopting the answers thousands of full-time ponderers have come up with over thousands of years feels like squandering that freedom. It’s strange. We live in a world of increasing and intensifying specialisation and industrialisation. We don’t grow our own food, make our own furniture or cut our own hair – some of us don’t even plan our own parties or select our own music collections. Yet more and more of us, maybe most of us, cobble together our own belief systems in spare moments while holding down other jobs. And it all leads to vacuous assertions of being “spiritual” and record sales of wind chimes and yin and yang symbol tea towels. But is it, as MacGregor claims, very unusual? What about all the communist countries of the 20th century? They were avowedly atheist, while Britain ostensibly has a state religion. Then again, communism fulfilled the role of a religion – it was an “agreed narrative”, publicly at least. And I suspect more conventional religious observance is at a higher level in those places post-communism than it is here. What about America – the land of the free and constitutionally guaranteed religious liberty? I don’t know why I even bothered posing the question. It’s clear that being religious, and predominantly being Christian, is still the orthodoxy there. Even the Simpsons go to church; it’s quite a big part of their lives and it’s absolutely not represented as odd – everyone seems to go except Apu. In a British comedy, someone becoming Christian might be a storyline, but there would never be an assumption that everyone is. So I think MacGregor must be right. And that really is massive. An enormous deal has been made over various significant changes in the UK over recent decades: decimalisation, joining the EEC, leaving the EU, privatisation, Aids, etc. I even remember a bit of a flurry when they closed down Ceefax. In comparison, our collectively sliding, in a historical heartbeat, from being a religiously oriented country, like every other human society there’s ever been, to the first one without a shared religious standpoint, has been unmarked. There wasn’t even a leaflet. Only a bigot would deny the advantages of freedom of religion, and irreligion, and of a society in which the evidence of science, and comparative lack of evidence of God, are no longer suppressed. It’s a development that’s both caused by and causes greater understanding, justice and compassion. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t cost us something. The vast majority of humans throughout history have grown up in contexts where questions like “Is there a God?” and “What happens when people die?” were answered with the same confidence with which a teacher today would explain gravity, and those answers were reassuring. I know in my heart that had I been brought up in such a setting – say, in Anglican Victorian England – I wouldn’t have quibbled with those answers and would’ve been comforted by them. I’d have puffed away at what Karl Marx called opium and felt enormously relaxed. To change so quickly from a society where most people took comfort from the establishment telling them, loudly and clearly, that death is not the end, to one where many proclaim that it is, and few are totally convinced otherwise, will have had an incalculable impact on our state of mind. It’s not a development I regret, but it’s a more persuasive explanation than smartphones or commuting of why we feel so stressed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/former-london-church-becomes-a-one-stop-wedding-shop","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T15:04:06Z","webTitle":"Former London church becomes one-stop wedding shop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/former-london-church-becomes-a-one-stop-wedding-shop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/former-london-church-becomes-a-one-stop-wedding-shop","fields":{"headline":"Former London church becomes one-stop wedding shop","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With its grand Ionic portico and belfry tower, Grade I-listed Number One Marylebone is an imposing building. The deconsecrated former Holy Trinity Church, just across the road from Regent’s Park in the heart of London, was built in 1828 to the design of Sir John Soane to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon. Now, however, it is being refurbished to cash in on the fast-growing business of wedding celebrations. The building, which has also been used as offices and, more recently, fashion shows, will reopen at the end of October as the UK’s first dedicated wedding department store, a one-stop shop the size of a supermarket, selling everything from tiaras to cake toppers. According to the wedding planning website Hitched, which surveyed 4,000 couples, the cost of the average wedding is now £27,000 – almost double the amount that it was four years ago, with venue hire, honeymoons and food soaking up the most cash. Growth is also being fuelled by a surge in same-sex marriages and record numbers of over-45s, and especially pensioners, tying the knot. Aside from the usual paraphernalia – dresses, top hats and tails – shoppers at the 1,860 sq metre (20,000 sq ft) Wedding Gallery will be able to book photographers, flowers and order wedding stationery. It will also offer cakes and catering, with an on-site kitchen for taste tests, and an insurance package in case one partner has a last-minute change of heart. DJs and speechwriters will be on hand, and there is a room called “the hub” where couples can put on headphones and watch wedding singers and bands on a big screen. If they like what they see and hear, they can book the musicians. Couples who fall in love with the shop can even hold their ceremony there, because it is attached to a 400-capacity venue. George Hammer, a beauty and retail entrepreneur, believes his one-stop shop will take the hassle out of wedding planning. “Our plan is to take all the sweat out of it. You know, turn the process into something that’s a pleasure not a torture”, he said. Hammer, who founded the Urban Retreat beauty salon business, said he had invested “several millions” in the store but acknowledged it was a new venture and was a risk: “It’s not like we can look at what Harvey Nichols or Harrods or John Lewis are doing. There’s no benchmark for this kind of business.”The store will not be cheap. The dresses start from £800, for a Needle &amp; Thread gown, and go up to more than £100,000 for high-end couture. A mile south, on Oxford Street, one bride-to-be was finishing off her wedding shopping. “It’s not like I’ve been trying to overspend,” said Hannah, a 34-year-old police detective who is marrying her partner, Laurie, in December. “But ‘wedding currency’ isn’t like normal sterling pounds – everything just costs so much. It’s crazy.” Having ticked off almost everything on her wedding to-do list, Hannah said that a one-stop wedding department store sounded like a good idea. “But not if it’s all really posh stuff. That’s not for the likes of me and Laurie – it’s probably more for your west London crowd.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/13/exeter-tony-rowe-chiefs-europe-champions-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T11:24:49Z","webTitle":"Exeter and Tony Rowe make it their priority to become Chiefs of Europe | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/13/exeter-tony-rowe-chiefs-europe-champions-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/13/exeter-tony-rowe-chiefs-europe-champions-cup","fields":{"headline":"Exeter and Tony Rowe make it their priority to become Chiefs of Europe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There cannot be another office anywhere in Europe quite like Tony Rowe’s in Exeter. Running down one wall are shelves storing more than 300 miniature fire engines, a passion that extends to a museum full of vintage models at his Devon home. Downstairs in reception sit a Bakelite phone and an antiquated manual switchboard, a reminder of how far technology has come since Rowe’s communications company was born 35 years ago. The Exeter Chiefs chairman does not favour orthodox holidays either. This summer, at the age of 68, he rode a motorbike through Latvia, Russia – “The Russian border guards were like something out of a James Bond movie” – Finland and Norway. Prior to his involvement in rugby, Rowe was also a British powerboating champion: a photo of him bombing around Bristol dock – “I was 11 stone dripping wet in those days” – is tucked away beside the fire engines. All of which is worth remembering when asking if Exeter can conceivably go higher than they have already. The champions of England are about to launch their European Champions Cup campaign against Glasgow Warriors; as with Rowe’s Russian border interrogators, some stern obstacles need overcoming simply to escape Pool Three. Their chairman, nevertheless, believes his Chiefs can conquer Europe one day. “I don’t believe you can do anything in life unless you’ve got an ambition,” he says matter-of-factly. “You have to put a stake in the ground.” It may not happen this season, or even next. To rule it out, though, would be to underestimate what has brought Exeter this far. In the foyer at Sandy Park sit the trophies they have accumulated – fourth division, third division, Championship, LV Cup, Premiership – during their ascent. “There’s only one missing now,” says Rowe breezily. “What we’re not going to do is plateau out.” He has not overseen the rise from the ramshackle County Ground to Europe’s top table without thinking bigger than most. So how can he – and his valiant team – take the final step? The budgets of the top French sides are colossal, while other English teams have classier European pedigrees. What Exeter do possess, though, is a very clear idea of where they want to go. They are particularly aware that, until now, they have slightly meandered into Europe’s opening rounds. This time the tournament has become a specific priority, with Rob Baxter urging his squad to “enjoy being champions rather than hanging on by our fingernails”. It seems to have worked, as most things involving Baxter tend to do. “I don’t think Eddie Jones would have done as good a job as Rob has done here,” says Rowe, equally firm on whether he believes Baxter will succeed Jones as England’s head coach after the 2019 World Cup. “I’m sure the RFU will come knocking on the door but I’m fairly confident Rob will stay. It’s a poisoned chalice, isn’t it? What would he do afterwards? We’ve also got unfinished business here. The European thing … we will get there and he wants to be the coach who takes the club there. The grass isn’t always greener.” It would certainly tug at Baxter’s heart because Exeter is no faceless modern franchise. The club was founded in 1871 and, as last week’s sponsors’ evening underlined, still breeds players who believe they can have a laugh AND win trophies. It is not every day the south-west’s top solicitors and accountants are taught the art of boiled or raw egg roulette, how to manoeuvre wafer thin mints from forehead to mouth with no hands and how to differentiate between a water buffalo and Dave Ewers. To cap it all, there was a closely fought contest to identify the Chiefs player with the longest nose. Fortunately an outsized ruler was available and the prop Carl Rimmer’s impressive 5cm conk emerged the proud winner. This happy bunch, let it be reiterated, are the reigning champions of England. Beneath it all, though, the Chiefs are smarter than they let on. Experts from the University of Exeter have been recruited to analyse the data spewing from the squad’s GPS monitors to enhance player well-being. Some French clubs seem to sign certain players on a whim, or simply because they can. Exeter are the opposite. “We don’t want drones, we want people who can think and play rugby,” says the forwards coach, Rob Hunter. The same ethos applies to the club’s academy, according to their quietly spoken but tactically cute head coach, Ali Hepher: “There’s no point producing a drone or a robot. You might get physically massive players coming through but they can’t survive within the way we work. You soon find out the guys who get it.” So it is that their young forward Sam Skinner has just graduated from the University of Exeter with a first-class degree in business economics, and tight forwards such as Jack Yeandle and Mitch Lees have as intuitive a feel for a game as their half-backs. “Last week they were the ones talking and commentating across the pitch,” says Hepher. “They’ll be able to tell you what the role of, say, the full-back should be in a certain situation and understand what’s going on around them. As soon as you have that clarity then pace can kick in. Once you slow up you can’t manipulate anything.” This all-court recipe, built on an equally remorseless forward platform, has worked a treat domestically. Rather than trying to be something they are not or signing overpriced galácticos, Baxter wants Exeter to be Exeter in Europe as well. Rowe has no interest in entering an unwinnable arms race with Clermont or Montpellier: “I don’t think we’re too bothered about them. Our local lads would probably go the extra mile where their journeyman wouldn’t. Sometimes it’s those extra little bits that get you over the line.” Not that Exeter are oblivious to the bottom line. Far from it. They make a modest profit, with turnover set to increase in this financial year to around £19m. Planning permission is awaited for a £25m hotel beside the ground with a further £35m south stand development, incorporating a 1,000 seater auditorium, in the pipeline. “I’ve always approached Exeter with a commercial view,” stresses Rowe. ”If we can’t make money why are we doing it? I’m a bit old-fashioned, I don’t like discount. If you give someone 20% off, they’ll want the same next time.” Customer satisfaction, he insists, is good. “More and more people are saying: ‘I used to watch the round ball game but I enjoy it more here.’” Of course, nothing is ever perfect. Attracting consistent sell-out autumn crowds to Sandy Park remains a challenge, as do rising wage costs. “The Saracens chairman Nigel Wray’s first comment to me was: ‘Well done on winning the Premiership,’” says Rowe. “His second was: ‘Now you’ll find the agents want twice as much money for your players.’” It does not help, either, that the Chiefs’ home European kick-off times have apparently been designed by the Marquis de Sade. “Much as I complain, nobody listens,” says Rowe, sighing. “Who wants to watch rugby at quarter to eight on a Saturday evening?” Not that he will care if the floodlights are blazing when the Chiefs eventually conquer Europe: “It’s not a dream, it’s an ambition. I always think that if you’re realistic about your ambitions you can achieve them. I know Rob would like to do it and I’d like to do it.” Forget the fire engines, the egg roulette and the nose measuring; what a fabulous sports story that would be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/15/catalan-secession-incubated-media-cocoon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Catalonia’s dreams of secession were incubated in a media cocoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/catalan-secession-incubated-media-cocoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/15/catalan-secession-incubated-media-cocoon","fields":{"headline":"Catalonia’s dreams of secession were incubated in a media cocoon","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"We know what happens first when coup leaders strike. They take control of the state TV and radio station. We know what the SNP would have done if they’d won their referendum. Set up a Scottish Broadcasting Corporation on the grave of the BBC. So here’s one additional factor to note after Spain’s tumultuous week. Catalonia has had its own television and radio services since 1983, delivering Catalan-only language programmes and – guess what? – paid for by the same government that declared quasi independence a few days ago. Bias comes naturally, perhaps inevitably, in the reporting of poor anti-separatist demonstrations, in the constant flashbacks to civil guard police wielding batons and throughout the hours of political discussion. Two regular participants in those discussions – voices against independence, hired in the supposed name of fairness and balance – wrote an article for El País the other day, explaining why they wouldn’t be appearing any longer. “The official thesis in Catalonia is that this is a natural, essentially good nation that for at least three centuries has been living in a situation of unsustainable colonial oppression within an artificial, perfidious Spain, from which we must escape,” Joan López Alegre and Nacho Martín Blanco declared. “But when reality is reduced to a single theme, secession… then the presence of a single voice opposed to the thesis of the talk – facing three or four participants plus to the moderator … only serves to project the idea that it is a minority position, even a marginal one in Catalan society. Goodbye. We’ve been ‘useful fools’ too long.” Their argument can be pursued in two ways. One, filled with the emotion that surrounds the independence vote; the other more reflectively. Let’s take the high road. Language is a wild card when you try to define nationhood. The areas of inland Catalonia most committed to independence are also the likeliest to use Catalan as their first, and sometimes only language. They depend on TV3 and its four sister channels for their news, soaps and drama series, and rely on Catalan radio round the clock. The algorithms of their social media follow the same route. And the picture they’ve drawn for all of this is often at odds with the complexities you find in Barcelona. They have lived in a media cocoon of settled opinion, convinced that the EU will welcome their new nation into its midst, that the economic outlook is untroubled, that “taking control” will solve all problems. Passion becomes ingrained. No need to draw parallel conclusions closer to home, but this mingling of fact and conviction crosses many borders. If you can make the rest of the world go away, then doubt becomes a stranger. No one watching Spanish TV through this crisis should pretend that it’s not had its own biases. Nor should anyone believe that the BBC, charting its lugubrious, legally mandated way through the thickets of bias, can ever achieve consensual calm. The more open the windows, the easier it is to breathe. Scotland’s own cocoon of devolution has weakened because SNP and now Tory success – as represented in parliament – make the national picture more relevant again. Brexit, too, is gradually opening eyes and horizons. But the language factor comes with an added twist. How did Catalonia wander so close to the edge of a cliff? Because – on screen, on the airwaves, in cosseted print – there was no real debate. Because (think Fox News) the semblance of real debate was quite enough, thank you. Think of the little boxes of diversity; then think adversity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/live/2017/oct/13/bruce-dickinson-webchat-post-your-questions-now","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T12:37:02Z","webTitle":"Bruce Dickinson webchat – your questions answered on supergroups, sex scenes and comic books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2017/oct/13/bruce-dickinson-webchat-post-your-questions-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2017/oct/13/bruce-dickinson-webchat-post-your-questions-now","fields":{"headline":"Bruce Dickinson webchat – your questions answered on supergroups, sex scenes and comic books","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"toffeedoug asks: Do you have days when you are happy to be doing absolutely nothing?

You need to get to know him in Ronny Chieng: International Student (BBC3). He and his show are immensely likable. Ronny plays himself in this comedy based on his experience of being a student in Australia. Mom, back home in Malaysia, is phoning him all the time and spying on him on social media, checking he’s not drinking or doing drugs, making sure he’s studying hard and rolling the condom all the way down. (Mrs Chieng is not ready for grandchildren just yet – and is quite pushy.) A few stereotypes flying around, then? Hell, yeah. But though Ronny might not be very good at drinking, he gives better than he gets. To the obnoxious Aussie equivalent of a preppy frat boy who comes to lectures dressed like he’s captaining a yacht. To his fellow mahjong-playing Asians. To Mick the idiot activities officer. Mick tries constantly to get everyone “pumped” and [making beer-drinking signs] to “give it some of these ones” . Also known as “rubbing the old laughing gear round a couple of frothies”. Ronny needs translation too, from Asher. That’s nice Asher, who will later become the subject of a Facebook video post: “Hot chick drinks giant beer … you won’t believe what happens next!” What happens next is projectile vomiting (witnessed by Mrs Chieng back home, obviously). Yes, Ronny Chieng: International Student is base at times and nicely rude. But it’s also smart. Weirdly sweet, too. Hey, maybe you don’t always need to be nasty and squirmy to be funny. And this is hilarious. It rings true – the situation, the language, everything. Plus there are some interesting camera angles, like the one from inside the space left after the solitary copy of the library book required to do Professor Dale’s assignment was taken out; and the one from the bottom of Ronny’s pint glass during Mick’s boat-race drinking game. That’s what not enjoying beer looks like, up close. Sold? You should be. I’ve watched three episodes, and it continues to be fresh and funny. And – slight spoiler alert – if you need further incentive to get involved, there’s a swearing baby to look forward to. Nothing is better than a swearing baby."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-03T06:45:46Z","webTitle":"The three-degree world: cities that will be drowned by global warming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"The three-degree world: the cities that will be drowned by global warming","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When UN climate negotiators meet for summit talks this month, there will be a new figure on the table: 3C. Until now, global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement have tried to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. However, with latest projections pointing to an increase of 3.2C by 2100, these goals seem to be slipping out of reach. “[We] still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said Erik Solheim, the UN environment chief, ahead of the upcoming Bonn conference. One of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea-level rise, caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles. Scientists at the non-profit organisation Climate Central estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming. Asian cities will be worst affected The regional impact of these changes is highly uneven, with four out of five people affected living in Asia. Although sea levels will not rise instantaneously, the calculated increases will be “locked in” at a temperature rise of 3C, meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down. Osaka, Japan 5.2 million people affected At the end of a month in which it has been battered by unseasonably late typhoons and relentless rain, Japan is already confronting the threat posed by climate change-induced flooding. Image modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world, threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region’s 19 million residents. As a result of global sea-level rise, storm surges and other factors, economists project that coastal flooding could put almost $1tn of Osaka’s assets at risk by the 2070s, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. “The costs of protecting cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise - as are the costs of repairing storm damage,” it said. “Decisions we make today could have a profound impact on the security and culture of the people of this ancient city.” Like much of Japan, Osaka already has a network of seawalls and other coastal defences in place to combat tsunami – although their effectiveness was disputed in the aftermath of the 2011 triple disaster. Osaka city authorities are investing in other infrastructure to mitigate the effects of flooding, but public education is also vital, according to Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government’s environment bureau. “In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming, but given that climate change is inevitable, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow,” Nakaaki said. “We anticipate that Osaka will be affected by natural disasters caused by climate change, but we have yet to establish exactly what might happen or how much financial damage they would cause. “It’s not that we expect sea levels to rise at some point in the future – they are already rising.” Keiko Kanai has long been aware that her home city is susceptible to natural disasters. “I’d heard that historically, tsunamis caused by earthquakes put many parts of Osaka underwater, and I knew that some parts of the world were at risk from rising sea levels,” said Kanai, who teaches at a local university. “But I didn’t put two and two together. Until now I haven’t given much thought to the idea that Osaka too could be engulfed by rising sea levels.” Kaori Akazawa, a nursing care consultant, said flooding was a consideration when she was deciding where in Osaka to live. “When I moved here I talked to my colleagues about the risks,” she said. “That’s why I’ve always rented apartments on the fourth storey or higher. “It’s worrying, but I’ve never considered moving.” Justin McCurry in Tokyo Alexandria, Egypt 3 million people affected On the Alexandria Corniche, waves slowly lap at a shoreline dotted with plastic chairs and umbrellas from the beachside cafes. Students perch on the steps of the imposing Alexandria library. But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming. The IPCC reported that Alexandria’s beaches would be submerged even with a 0.5-metre sea-level rise, while 8 million people would be displaced by flooding in Alexandria and the Nile Delta if no protective measures are taken. A 3C world threatens far greater damage than that. Yet for many residents, there is little public information to connect the increasingly chaotic weather and floods with climate change. “The vast majority of Alexandrians don’t have access to knowledge, and that’s what worries me. I don’t expect the government to raise awareness of this problem until it’s already happening,” said 22-year-old student Kareem Mohammed. “Everyone thinks we should act on this problem 50 or 80 years from now,” agreed his friend, Hazem Hassan, a student in marine biology at the nearby Alexandria University. Officials maintain that protective measures are being taken, but with little fanfare. “Egypt spends 700m EGP [£30m] annually to protect the north coast,” said Dr Magdy Allam, head of the Arab Environmental Experts Union, who was previously part of the Egyptian environment ministry. Allam cited the Mohammed Ali sea wall built in 1830 as a key protection, as well as the concrete blocks lining the shoreline designed to “detour flood water away from residential neighbourhoods”. But critics say that this is far from enough given the scale of the problem. “There are studies indicating that our city is one of many coastal human settlements around the world which will be partially submerged by 2070 if nothing is done,” said Ahmed Hassan, of the Save Alexandria Initiative, a group that works to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on the city. Ruth Michaelson in Alexandria Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1.8 million people affected Residents of Brazil’s postcard city have plenty of reasons to fear global warming – even if they don’t quite know it. According to Climate Central, a temperature rise of 3C would cause flooding of not just Rio’s famous beaches such as Copacabana and its waterfront domestic airport, but also inland areas of the Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood, where last year’s Olympic Games were held. Barra is built around a network of heavily polluted lagoons that empty into the sea. The prospect of it being underwater alarmed resident Sueli Gonçalves, 46, who runs pensioners’ health projects, as she and her 23-year-old son Yuri Sanchez carried their shopping past the Olympic Park. “My God. Oh Jesus,” she said, with a nervous laugh. “I will leave here. I will go to the United States. To Canada.” The family knew about global warming but were unaware of the potential scale of the impact on their upscale neighbourhood of smart condominiums and a shopping mall. “Nobody takes it seriously. People do not think long term,” Gonçalves said. Storm surges recently destroyed hundreds of metres of beachfront pavement overlooking the Macumba beach, a popular surfing spot on Rio’s western fringes. Last year, heavy waves in another storm surge felled an elevated, clifftop cycle path between Leblon beach and Barra de Tijuca which had not been built to survive such high seas, killing two people. Last year, Rio’s city government and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro produced a study entitled Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change. “The current challenge consists in deepening knowledge and monitoring of oceanic phenomena and the evolution of the sea bed and coast,” a spokeswoman for the city’s secretariat of the environment said in an email. An “adaption plan” for climate change produced with professors from the federal university suggested strategies to deal with vulnerabilities in areas such as transport, health and housing. But so far little has been done. Nara Pinto, 38, who lives in the sprawling Rocinha favela and sells snacks on the pavement overlooking Copacabana beach, said the loss of Rio’s famous beaches would cost a lot of jobs. “The beach is a tourist point,” she said. “What can be done to stop this? Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Shanghai, China 17.5 million people affected “Shanghai is completely gone – I’d have to move to Tibet!” says resident Wang Liubin, when he is shown projections for the city after 3C of global warming. When it comes to flooding, the coastal city is one of the world’s most vulnerable. Now one of the world’s biggest ports, the former fishing village is bordered by the Yangtze river in the north and divided through the middle by the Huangpu river; the municipality involves several islands, two long coastlines, shipping ports, and miles of canals, rivers, and waterways. In 2012, a report from a team of UK and Dutch scientists declared Shanghai the most vulnerable major city in the world to serious flooding, based on factors such as numbers of people living close to the coastline, time needed to recover from flooding, and measures to prevent floodwater. According to Climate Central projections, 17.5 million people could be displaced by rising waters if global temperatures increase by 3C. Projections show the vast majority of the city could eventually be submerged in water, including much of the downtown area, landmarks such as the Lujiazui skyline and the historical Bund, both airports, and the entirety of its outlying Chongming Island. Since 2012, the government has been making steady inroads to tackle the threat, including building China’s largest deepwater drainage system beneath the Suzhou Creek waterway, made up of 15km of pipes to drain rainwater across a 58 sq km area. It has also rolled out a 40bn yuan (£5bn) River Flood Discharge project which will stretch for 120km between Lake Taihu and the Huangpu river to try and mitigate the risk of the upstream lake flooding. Flood prevention walls are being built along the waterfront – in places so high the river is blocked from view – and 200km more are promised across the city’s outlying districts. Flood controls have been put in place along the famous Bund waterfront, where the walkway has been raised to help counter a flood risk, as well as a series of water controls and dams. Helen Roxburgh in Shanghai Miami, US 2.7 million people affected Few other cities in the world have as much to lose from rising sea levels as Miami, and the alarm bells sound ever louder with each successive “king tide” that overwhelms coastal defences and sends knee-deep seawater coursing through downtown streets. Locals consider this the “new normal” in the biggest city of Florida’s largest metropolitan area, which would simply cease to exist with a 3C temperature rise. Even at 2C, forecasts show almost the entire bottom third of Florida – the area south of Lake Okeechobee currently home to more than 7 million people - submerged, with grim projections for the rest of the state in a little more than half a century. In Miami-Dade county alone, almost $15bn of coastal property is at risk of flooding in just the next 15 years. A sense of urgency is evident at city hall, where commissioners are asking voters to approve a “Miami Forever” bond in the November ballot that includes $192m for upgrading pump stations, improving drainage and raising sea walls. “We have a really precious city that many people love and are willing to invest in right now, but it’s going to take some funds to protect it,” said Ken Russell, the city commission’s vice-chair. Last year, the city of Miami appointed sea-rise expert Jane Gilbert into the newly created role of chief resilience officer with instructions for a robust stormwater management plan that also looks at storm surge, such as that from Hurricane Irma in September which brought significant flooding to downtown Brickell and neighbouring Coconut Grove. Proposals include elevating roads and even abandoning neighbourhoods to the water to protect others. “We need universal recognition that we’re all in this together, to protect this amazing global city that we’ve become,” she said. Natalia Ortiz, who grew up in Miami, fears the future. “It’s very scary,” said Ortiz, who works with Cleo, a climate change advocacy group. “My son is 11 and my daughter is nine, so they’re young but I think about their future, will they be able to raise their children in Miami the way I had the luxury of raising mine?” Richard Luscombe in Miami Methodology Flood maps were created using sea-level rise estimates from Climate Central and digital elevation data.

The Liberal Democrat leader said a repeated failure to publish the minutes of board meetings amounted to “a growing lack of transparency” at both state-funded organisations. Network Rail’s board meets eight times a year, but the most recent set of publicly available minutes are from a September 2016 meeting. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Cable wrote to its chief executive, Mark Carne: “Network Rail is an organisation of crucial importance to the daily lives of millions of people and is owned by the taxpayer. Britain’s railways are currently under extreme pressure, carrying more passengers than at any time since the 1920s, while Network Rail is being forced to restructure following cost overruns and delays to crucial projects. “I appreciate such transparency results in political, media and public scrutiny that can be difficult for Network Rail. However, it is all for these reasons that it must show its commitment to openness and regularly publish minutes that explain the difficulties you face and the reasons behind executive decisions. Your organisation must not be secretive.” A spokesperson for Network Rail said: “There has been an unfortunate delay in publishing our past board minutes which has been caused by several factors, both external and internal. For the future we expect more punctual publication.” HS2 Ltd, the publicly funded company building Britain’s new high-speed rail link, states online that the board “typically meets on a monthly basis”. The latest available minutes are from its April 2017 meeting. “HS2 is one of the most politically controversial infrastructure projects of recent times and must be opened up to public scrutiny,” Cable said in a letter to the company’s chief executive, Mark Thurston. “This is not always comfortable – and can be problematic given the requirement to protect commercial interests – but is vital, particularly given construction of the first phase will soon start in earnest.” A spokesperson for HS2 blamed staffing changes for the failure to publish minutes. “We are committed to being an open and transparent organisation and regularly publish huge amounts of information on how we are developing and delivering Europe’s largest infrastructure project. “In this instance we have fallen short of this commitment due to staffing changes. We were aware of this issue and were in the process of improving our approach to ensure board minutes are published in a more timely fashion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/13/the-fiver-liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-sigh","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T14:56:36Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Some evil paranormal force that bears an unfounded grudge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/13/the-fiver-liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-sigh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/13/the-fiver-liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-sigh","fields":{"headline":"Some evil paranormal force that bears an unfounded grudge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"COUNTING DOWN TO THE BIG ONE AT BEVEREE STADI … OH, ANFIELD José Mourinho does not pick the Premier League fixture list. Because, of course, the schedule is usually chosen by some evil paranormal force that bears an unfounded grudge against him, just like everyone else. But if the two-time Big Cup winner with the most powerful Mr 15% in football did have any kind of influence, he could hardly have chosen a more gentle way to ease his team into this domestic season after that harsh Super Cup lesson at the hands of Real Madrid. So far United have hit four goals past: (1) a West Ham side so submissive that they turned up at Old Trafford in g1mp suits; (2) a Swansea team that clocked off after 80 minutes; (3) a blue excuse offered up by Ronald Koeman; and (4) a Crystal Palace outfit so down-on-its-luck that it turned to Mr Roy for a confidence boost. Throw in a 2-0 win over Leicester and a 1-0 victory at Southampton and United have beaten five of the Premier League’s bottom six teams so far and a side whose attacking plan consists of placing Shane Long, Nathan Redmond and two banjos in close proximity to some cattle and seeing what the pair manage to hit. No wonder United are many people’s favourites for the title and lots of folks think Mourinho is building a ravishing thrill-machine. Let’s see where he parks it at Anfield on Saturday, eh? “We’ve prepared very well,” chirped Mourinho’s midfield disciple, Nemanja Matic, adding: “The manager got some videos for us to see what they have in their team and how we can stop them so I’m sure we will be ready for them.” Not much there about how United plan to get on the front foot but perhaps that is understandable given that knack has deprived them of Marouane Fellaini, who would have been, after Simon Mignolet, the player most likely to spook a Liverpool defence notoriously nervous at set-pieces. Jürgen Klopp has no doubt also spent much of this week watching videos. But sobbing over images of Sadio Mané pulling up lame while on international duty will get Liverpool nowhere on Saturday. They need someone to step into the Senegalese’s shoes and do what he does. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, perhaps? It’s the most hyped-up match of the season so far, but both managers would probably take another 0-0 right now. QUOTE OF THE DAY “I understand why some people think footballers are selfish. But people also underestimate football. When good comes out of it then it is a very fair sport. If you have the talent and dedication you can do well no matter where you come from.

Your wife’s most recent childbirth and the associated surgery mean she avoids anything that might lead to a repetition of such painful experiences. That means she now connects lovemaking with unpleasant consequences. You must try to help her enjoy the things she previously associated with sex, such as a romantic dinner, a sensual massage or cheeky moments in the car. After childbirth, some women acquire negative body images and a sense of themselves as mothers rather than lovers – struggling to combine both roles. Again, you can help by giving reassurances and compliments, and by trying to do things you did when you were courting that triggered an erotic response.

She took a support team that included her mother, a film crew, and her swimming coach. Their destination was the Farallon Islands, a remote outcrop about 30 miles off the coast of San Francisco. Once there, Chambers would attempt something no woman had ever done: an unbroken, solo swim from the islands back under the Golden Gate. With the area’s icy waters, strong winds, heavy swells and one of the largest concentrations of great white sharks, it’s been called the toughest swim in the world. The boat motored out in a little over two hours, arriving at the rocky islands at 11pm. Ten minutes later, Chambers jumped. “It sounds completely nuts,” she recalled, “but when I went to the Farallones, I prepared not to come back. I did my laundry because I wanted my place to be decent when they came to collect my stuff.” But she did come back, 17 hours and 12 minutes later. It was a triumph that made headlines and prompted Outside Magazine to dub her “the world’s most badass swimmer”. Now, a documentary, Kim Swims, chronicles Chambers’ Farallones swim, and tells the story of how a 38-year-old who had only been swimming seriously for four years became one of the world’s top marathon swimmers. She said it started with an accident. “It was just a regular day,” explained Chambers, who moved to the San Francisco Bay Area from her native New Zealand when she was 17. “I was wearing heels that were probably too high. I slipped down the staircase on my way to work, and I hit my leg.” At the hospital, Chambers was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome as a result of blunt force trauma. Skin was grafted from her thigh to patch over the wounds on her swollen shin. “The doctors said I was 30 minutes from amputation and had a 1% chance of ever walking unaided again,” she said. “You wouldn’t think that [fall] would be a defining moment in your life. You think it would be a car crash or something. But I learned what I was made of.” Chambers spent two years in physical therapy and started swimming to find “a sense of freedom”. The pool let her hide the scars left from the fall. “I was so self-conscious, especially about my thigh,” she says. “I didn’t want to be labeled as disabled. But standing in the shallow end, people would talk to me and no one was looking at my scars.” Soon Chambers met members of the Dolphin Club, a group of hardcore swimmers who have traversed the frigid waters of the San Francisco Bay since the club’s founding in 1877. “It was like this secret society of adventurers,” she recalls. “I was just alive.” In the film, Chambers’ swimming coach, Vito Bialla, jokes about how terrible she was in those early days. “He said I couldn’t swim my way out of a paper bag with flippers on, which was true.” But she persisted, beginning with a crossing to the famous Alcatraz prison. As years passed she notched up bigger victories, eventually becoming the third woman, and only the sixth person, to complete the Oceans Seven – a series of hazardous straits and channels around the world that is considered marathon swimming’s equivalent of mountain climbing’s Seven Summits. But the allure of the Farallones remained. She described her first swims at the islands as like being “in a wonderland, like another world”. “We would go out there and jump in like it was some tropical destination, and fishermen would look at us like we were absolutely crazy. It became a place of pushing myself.” It’s easy to understand the Farallones’ uncanny pull. Its skeletal form haunts San Francisco like a ghost, appearing and disappearing with the fog. To approach by boat takes hours, as waves pound like fists and seasickness grips your guts. The waters around the islands, which sit on the edge of a continental shelf, sink down to more than 10,000ft deep at spots. In that vast space, a swimmer seems naked and out of place. The vulnerability was not lost on Chambers. Just 10 days before her attempt, a fellow swimmer took the same route only to have his swim cut short by a circling great white shark. As she rode out that night, she wondered if she would have the courage to get in. “The adrenaline was indescribable.” English Channel rules – the marathon swimmers’ code – stipulated she must wear only a bathing suit and goggles and could not touch her support boat. She paused every 30 minutes to tread water and drink a liquid “feed” thrown overboard in a bottle on a rope. What does one think about while swimming for 17 hours? Chambers says there are periods she can’t recall – “You enter this dream state. I tell people it’s like being in space” – but that she calmed her nerves by thinking of those she loved on the boat beside her. “I’ll run through a scenario where I was hanging out with each of them. I’ll replay that day in my head. People say these swims are 80% psychological and 20% physical.” She admits it’s a lonely sport. More than 4,000 climbers have summited Everest; Chambers was just the fifth person to complete the Farallones swim. Her training regimens are brutal. In preparation for the North Channel, between Ireland and Scotland, she gained 65lb and refused to take a hot shower for six months; before her unsuccessful 2016 attempt to swim 93 miles down the Sacramento river, she swam the equivalent of an English Channel every Friday night for three months, staying up through Saturday to prepare for sleep deprivation. Despite the extraordinary endurance, Chambers says she doesn’t consider her swims athletic events. “They are personal journeys of the self. When I get out of the water, I’m a different person than the one who jumped in.” “Crazy” is a word she hears a lot. “I don’t see myself as crazy,” she says. “I’m just Kim and I like to swim.” Kim Swims debuted at the Mill Valley film festival, where it won the audience choice award for best documentary. It will next screen at the Portland film festival and the Rocky Mountain Women’s film festival, in Colorado Springs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/14/hinkley-point-radioactive-mud-dumped-cardiff-severn-estuary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T19:13:46Z","webTitle":"Hinkley nuclear site radioactive mud to be dumped near Cardiff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/14/hinkley-point-radioactive-mud-dumped-cardiff-severn-estuary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/14/hinkley-point-radioactive-mud-dumped-cardiff-severn-estuary","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley nuclear site radioactive mud to be dumped near Cardiff","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"More than 300,000 tonnes of “radioactive” mud, some of it the toxic byproduct of Britain’s atomic weapons programme, will be dredged to make way for England’s newest nuclear power station and dumped in the Severn estuary just over a mile from Cardiff. Politicians in Wales have denounced the move, with one accusing the Welsh government of selling out to London and the nuclear lobby. They have called on ministers to commit to further radiological tests before giving consent for the process, which is crucial for the construction of Hinkley Point C across the estuary in Somerset. In 2013, an assessment by the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences found that tests on the mud, carried out under International Atomic Energy Agency procedures, revealed only minimal levels of radioactivity, well within safety guidelines. “From radiological considerations, there is no objection to this material being dredged and dumped,” the assessment concluded. But John Thomas, leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said concerns had been raised about the adequacy of the assessment. He has called for an urgent meeting with Natural Resources Wales, which approved the dredging licence, and the Welsh government. An independent marine pollution researcher, Tim Deere-Jones, who is also a prominent nuclear power critic, has warned that the dumped sediment could re-concentrate into more powerful radioactive material and be washed ashore in storm surges. “We know sediment in mudflats can dry out and blow ashore and that fine sediment with radioactivity attached can transfer to the land in marine aerosols and sea spray,” Deere-Jones said. Studies of north Wales tidal surges, he added, had revealed that the deposited mud and sand were heavily contaminated with radioactivity from Sellafield. The mud to be dredged contains 50-year-old deposits from Hinkley Point A, where radioactive material for Britain’s atomic weapons was produced. Nuclear historian Dr David Lowry said some of the plutonium produced at the plant was sent to the US in a controversial and confidential exchange. “That deal is coming back to haunt today’s nuclear industry as plans for the third generation of nuclear plants at Hinkley are literally running into the sparkling radioactive mud,” Lowry said. The dredging licence was granted to EDF, the company building the new plant, in 2013. It gives the French energy giant the right to discharge materials at Cardiff Grounds, a sandbank in the Bristol Channel. EDF needs to clear the sediment to allow barges to bring in construction materials. Neil McEvoy, Plaid Cymru Welsh Assembly member, who has received a briefing from Deere-Jones, said dredging should be suspended until a full environmental impact assessment had been carried out. A petition has gained enough signatures to force the assembly to debate the issue. “The problem lies with the unknown,” McEvoy said. “No dose of non-naturally occurring radiation is safe. What we have here is big business trampling over Wales, with a Welsh government doffing its cap to London and the nuclear industry,” he said. “The Welsh national interest is not being served here. The public is outraged that this material will be dumped in Cardiff’s waters, and washed around the Welsh coast, with transfer of radioactivity from sea to land.” An EDF spokesman said: “We have undertaken a number of assessments as part of this application which concluded the activities pose no threat to human health or the environment. All activities on our sites are strictly controlled and regulated by a number of statutory bodies to ensure the environment and public are protected.” John Wheadon, of Natural Resources Wales, said: “There are strict conditions in the licence to test the sediment, including a radiological assessment, before it can be deposited. We will only allow the work to start if we’re confident the activity will not harm people and the environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/14/why-are-we-all-being-so-polite-lets-start-stomping-eminem-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:05:14Z","webTitle":"Oh, why are we all being so polite?

Start stomping","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If public protest is any guide to public feeling, what can we learn from the Autumn of Discontent? That, for anyone in doubt, is the series of anti-Brexit demonstrations that began in London in September, and were due to continue on Saturday with regional rallies in each of the UK’s 12 European parliament constituencies. For sense and civility, the remainers’ approach has, as always, much to teach the idiot rhetoricians of Brexit, recently heard blithering about a “tiger in the tank”. The latest round of anti-Brexit rallies will, say the organisers of the Cambridge event, “send a message to all our political representatives that the time has come to rethink the damaging path that the UK is now on, and say to them that we can and we must stop Brexit”. Presumably, political representatives who insist that 52% of an advisory vote on an unknown outcome represents the settled will of the people are nonetheless believed – if they notice it’s happening – to be capable of a rally-induced epiphany. Possibly, even without the added magic of an Alastair Campbell or an AC Grayling, regional rallies can change hearts and minds. Perhaps the sort of people who have committed to this catastrophe could still contemplate a mild-looking crowd with interesting banners and feel something other than relief, that British disgust for irresponsible leadership expresses itself so differently from Eminem’s. Is this the worst that can happen? Not Eminem’s “Fuck walkin’ on eggshells, I came to stomp” but, in the words of the remainers’ self-styled saviour Vince Cable, “We accept the negotiations are taking place, but at the end of it we want the British people to have a say.” Not “I’m drawing in the sand a line: you’re either for or against”, but a sequence of walks with a title referencing the opening line of Shakespeare’s Richard III. For any Brexit-engineers with the emotional wherewithal to fear the scale of the public backlash – supposing the blame for their failures cannot be passed on – there may be actual consolation in these marches. There’s even something very British, for people who like to keep things very British, about activism that maintains the old protest tradition of being utterly disregarded. If media bias explains, up to a point, why the most prominently reported demonstration at the party conferences was Rees-Mogg- rather than Brexit-related, it’s also possible that anti-Brexit protesting, for all the energy and commitment of its participants, needs work. Somewhere between the poll tax riots and hand-coloured signs saying “Don’t go Brexit my heart”, there must be non-violent forms of protest that demonstrate, less ignorably than rallies, that almost half the population – assuming it has not lapsed en masse into the approved “just get on with it” mindset – is feeling something stronger than piqued. If remainers can’t borrow the American musicians who have transformed mockery of Donald Trump into a ubiquitous art form, it shouldn’t be impossible for the inventiveness that creates playful signs on British marches to evolve into something more ambitious – and of more enduring embarrassment to its targets. But since time for effective Brexit-shaming is, as Michel Barnier regularly reminds the British, running out, some protesting plagiarism could be unavoidable. Leaving until last a general strike by non-emergency-service remainers, it could be worth bearing in mind that, at 222 miles – according to Google Maps – the walk from Trafalgar Square to the European commission’s Berlaymont building in Brussels is not much shorter than the distance (240 miles) covered in Mahatma Gandhi’s 1930 Salt March, one of the most successful protests in history. That’s 66 hours start to finish, excluding breaks and the ferry. A Brexit version of Gandhi’s satyagraha, all the more forceful if it were completed by people under 30, would have the advantage, as with the Eminem video, of reminding the world how much of the country is being traduced, in our case by the Conservatives’ little battalion of thrill-seekers. Then again, one possible explanation for the level of apparent Brexit resignation, among young individuals with most to lose from it, is that so many of them have committed, above all, to Jeremy Corbyn, whose negligence helped make it happen. Either way, the NUS website is currently prioritising the campaign “Say NO to single-use straws”. The recent unsympathetic treatment of a young British remainer, Madeleina Kay, protesting as Supergirl, also hints at possible security issues in Brussels were several thousand more to arrive. Just when it might be needed, there’s further inspiration in an exhibition at New York’s Whitney Museum, An Incomplete History of Protest, which greets visitors with WH Auden’s poem September 1, 1939: “The enlightenment driven away, / The habit-forming pain, / Mismanagement and grief: / We must suffer them all again.” Along with political art exhibits, the show details how artists have removed their work from galleries in protest, or demanded that it be shown only if accompanied by a specified text. In the case of the American artist Al Held, protesting against the Vietnam war in 1970, a black-bordered sign, 18in by 24in, was to read: “ART FOR LIFE … STOP THE WAR”. His point, he told the gallery, “is that paintings, rather than being removed, should be used affirmatively”. Anti-Brexit musicians and other performers might want to build, if it wouldn’t destroy their careers, on the more recent affirmative actions of the New York Hamilton cast when they addressed Mike Pence, and of Daniel Barenboim, at this summer’s BBC Proms. The threat posed by Brexit to British orchestras was no excuse, the Sun indicated, for an intervention by this “anti-Brexit fanatic” on European culture. Not only that, his shameless conducting of Elgar was, you gathered, the Proms equivalent of taking a knee. A Spectator writer reeled from “the sheer discourtesy” and “left profoundly disappointed in him”. Splendid. If they are to remind politicians – British and European – of their undiminished opposition to Brexit, Britain’s 48% or so need actively to generate this sort of intervention, along with equally discourteous activism by thousands of individuals not easily ridiculed as intellectuals, snowflakes or experts, and who won’t – unlike the Mail’s detested luvvies and metropolitan deplorables – just make things worse. In the absence of national representation the option is to surrender, or to protest with such gentility, or behind such clapped-out figureheads, that no one even notices. True, any observable passivity might be a faithful reflection of genuine indifference. Alternatively, the very size and variety of the remainer vote could be what militates against effective organising, including of sustained pressure on local MPs. Activism, as Malcolm Gladwell once argued in a New Yorker article that exposed the limitations of social media, is hard work. “The civil rights movement was more like a military campaign than like a contagion.” That was in 2010: before the NFL protests, the bringing down of confederate statues, and a profusion of creative savagery of which Eminem’s is only the latest, if most triumphant, example. The preference here for planning petitions and Saturday marches does not, mercifully, have to be the end of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/13/ulster-wasps-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T21:23:16Z","webTitle":"Jacob Stockdale launches Ulster campaign and adds to Wasps’ early-season pain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/13/ulster-wasps-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/13/ulster-wasps-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Stockdale sends Ulster on the way and underlines Wasps’ early-season pain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wasps have endured a tough start to the domestic season and the Champions’ Cup is not yet easing the pain. Belfast on a Friday night is never an easy place to travel and a sharply improved second-half display duly yielded Ulster’s 14th victory in their last 18 home games against English opposition in Europe. For a while, when Wasps held a 9-3 lead in the third quarter, it seemed they might just be on course for a remarkable success given the logistical difficulties of a five-day turnaround and first-half injuries to three more players, including the hooker Tom Cruse with a broken thumb and Thomas Young with a strained groin. They reckoned without the inspirational Charles Piutau, once a Wasp himself, who created a brace of Ulster tries in as many minutes to transform the contest. There was a certain inevitability about Wasps’ second-half travails, the visitors having played and lost at Saracens only last Sunday. Ulster, though, were ultimately good value for their victory, with the wing Jacob Stockdale and centre Stuart McCloskey scoring the all-important tries towards the end of the third quarter. There were also two crucial late penalties from Ulster’s Christian Leali’ifano, the Wallaby back diagnosed with leukaemia only last year, to deny Wasps even a consolatory bonus point. To be plying his trade again far from home in Europe’s premier club tournament shows extraordinary mental resilience and puts even this result into sharp perspective. Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby, could at least take some comfort from his players’ spirit in adversity but the continuing injury toll and a run of five straight defeats in all competitions is testing everyone’s resolve. “When you’re down people run and kick you in the nuts, don’t they?” said Young, suggesting his son’s injury was an accident waiting to happen given Wasps were required to play two games in such rapid succession. “The bounce of the ball is not going our way at the minute. We’ve just got to dust ourselves off, keep going and at some point I’m sure our luck will turn.” The short turnaround was far from the only issue facing Wasps in the first European meeting between these sides since a distant contest at Loftus Road 16 years ago. Their spectacular success against Leinster in Dublin two years ago represented their only competitive win on Irish soil in their last seven attempts, although Ulster were also missing their injured Lions Rory Best and Jared Payne. The home team, however, could still field the richly talented Piutau, an adopted Ulsterman for the rest of this season before his big-money move to Bristol. Every time the All Black had the ball the game received an extra surge of electricity and his former employers looked genuinely apprehensive. After Elliot Daly and John Cooney had swapped early penalties, a scrappy first-half was duly illuminated when Piutau burst thrillingly out of defence and set his half-backs John Cooney and Leali’ifano free, only for the ball to bounce agonisingly away from the Australian at the crucial moment. With both Cruse and the centre Brendan Macken departing early after heavy knocks, Wasps needed all the breaks they could get. It was not proving a stellar contest in terms of quality, although Ulster’s forwards did well to snuff out two close-range Wasps drives. Iain Henderson, captaining his province for the first time, was at the heart of his side’s determined resistance, with his counterpart Joe Launchbury equally busy for the visitors. It took a penalty for wheeling the scrum seconds before half-time to break the deadlock, Jimmy Gopperth knocking over the 35-metre kick with the same nonchalance he used to show in the colours of Leinster. The drizzle by this time had eased off but, for all the players’ good intentions, a greasy ball did little to assist the rhythm of either side. When Young Jr also failed to appear after half-time it made Wasps’ task even trickier. In the circumstances another Gopperth penalty in the 46th minute was a major plus, as was the hairline TMO decision not to award Leali’ifano a close-range try when it looked to the naked eye as if he had stretched successfully for the line. Ulster’s increasingly animated fans were not left to grumble for long. First a rampaging Piutau split the defence to create enough space for Stockdale to squeeze outside Willie le Roux and Christian Wade to the left corner, and the All Black was again the instigator two minutes later, releasing Stockdale, whose looping inside ball found the grateful hands of the supporting McCloskey. Cooney could convert neither try but Wasps were trapped helplessly on the ropes long before Josh Bassett was sin-binned in the 74th minute for a high tackle. Next week’s home game against Harlequins suddenly has a must-win feel to it. Ulster: Piutau; Ludik, L Marshall (Bowe, 69), McCloskey, Stockdale; Leali’ifano, Cooney (P Marshall, 64); McCall, Herring, Herbst (Ah You, 65), Treadwell, Henderson (capt), R Diack, Reidy, Deysel (Ross, 65).

Sale and Toulouse play out thrilling draw Sale began their European Challenge Cup campaign with a thrilling 20-20 draw with Toulouse at AJ Bell Stadium. The Sharks, having lost four of their opening six Aviva Premiership matches, looked set for another defeat when tries from Semi Kunatani and Sebastien Bezy – both converted by the latter – put Toulouse 14-3 up heading into half-time. However, Sale hit back and built a 17-14 lead after the winger Denny Solomona and Bryn Evans crossed either side of the interval, with Faf de Klerk adding the extras. Then it became a battle of the boot, with Bezy and De Klerk exchanging penalties to leave Sale holding a narrow 20-17 lead going into the closing stages. But Bezy had the final say after Sale had been penalised for offside at a ruck, the France fly-half nailing his 74th-minute kick to earn the four-times European champions a draw."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/14/hermes-couriers-rebel-christmas-workload","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:04:14Z","webTitle":"Hermes couriers rebel over 20 days non-stop Christmas workload","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/14/hermes-couriers-rebel-christmas-workload","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/14/hermes-couriers-rebel-christmas-workload","fields":{"headline":"Hermes couriers rebel over 20 days non-stop Christmas workload","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Couriers working for Hermes, which delivers for major retailers including Amazon, Asos and Next, claim they face pressure to work 20 days without a break in the run-up to Christmas. Unions say this would be illegal under the working time directive were the drivers not deemed to be self-employed. Hermes rejects the claim, insisting that the couriers can choose when they work. It says that last year – when similar concerns were raised – nearly two-thirds of its couriers chose not to work on all 20 days, proving that they could opt out. However, this year couriers have been alarmed by a letter from Conor Ormsby, the firm’s head of courier services, asking them to “ensure that a substitute or cover is available to deliver on our normal service days if you are unable to provide service” during the peak period. The firm says it has 4,500 couriers who provide normal cover and has drafted in an extra 6,000 relief couriers who will be in place over the Christmas period. But many couriers are sceptical and fear they will have to work 20 days consecutively if and when cover cannot be found – or risk losing their contracts. Now, in one of the first signs of workers in the “gig economy” rebelling against employers’ working practices, the GMB union has written a letter on their behalf telling Hermes they are not prepared to work such long schedules. The letter states: “I write to confirm that I will not be working 20 days non-stop for Hermes over the upcoming peak period. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HSWA), I have a personal duty to ensure that I take care of my own health and safety.” Last week, a parliamentary inquiry was told that one Hermes driver had his contract cancelled after being unable to work as he was in hospital because his wife had given birth prematurely. The GMB is bringing a legal case against Hermes that will be heard next year. The union says that by classifying its couriers as self-employed, Hermes avoids giving them basic rights such as holiday pay and the national living wage. “The reality is that Hermes are more focused on their own profits than considering the health and safety of their own drivers and the general public,” said Maria Ludkin, the GMB’s legal director. Many of Hermes’ 15,000 couriers have expressed support for the company and say they enjoy working the peak delivery season because it means they earn more. However, a courier who spoke to the Observer said he expected the amount of parcels he would deliver each day in the peak period – which begins on 26 November – to double from around 100 to 200. He said some couriers might expect to do considerably more than this following the online discount days, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. “We run a six-day round, but because of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Hermes say they can’t cope in their depots so they need to open on Sundays,” he said. “They don’t want to use Sunday couriers, they want the everyday couriers doing it, so it means we have to work the middle Sunday. We say it’s dangerous, they say ‘get cover’. Some have cover but the vast majority don’t.” Hermes director of legal affairs, Hugo Martin, told MPs on the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committe last week that its couriers earn a minimum of £8.50 an hour and an average of £12.20 – or £10.60 once expenses such as fuel are taken into account. However, this was disputed by the courier, who requested anonymity. “I’m on about £6.50 an hour and last month, if you average it over the month, I’ve dropped to about £5.80 an hour.”In a statement, Hermes said: “It is entirely unfounded and irresponsible to suggest Hermes would require couriers to put themselves or the public at risk. No courier is expected to work longer hours, more days or handle bigger volumes – and there is absolutely no penalty for choosing not to do so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/13/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-leave-if-doubt-ability-win-league-title","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T21:30:44Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp: I’ll leave Liverpool when I doubt my ability to win league title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/13/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-leave-if-doubt-ability-win-league-title","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/13/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-leave-if-doubt-ability-win-league-title","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp: I’ll leave Liverpool when I doubt my ability to win league title","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp has claimed he would quit as Liverpool manager the moment he harboured any doubt over his ability to end the club’s prolonged wait for the Premier League title. Liverpool trail Manchester United by seven points before their early clash at Anfield on Saturday having won once in seven matches in all competitions, albeit while producing stronger performances than results would suggest. Klopp’s prospects of delivering a first league championship to Liverpool since 1990 have also not been helped by the financial power and early‑season form shown by the two Manchester clubs. But having returned Champions League football to Anfield in his first full season in charge, Klopp remains convinced Liverpool “are on a good way” and can compete with wealthier rivals. He would not be Liverpool manager, he insisted, if he suspected otherwise. “In the moment when I think we cannot be successful, and there is only consolation, I go,” Klopp said. “Why should I be here as some kind of caretaker until the world creates a manager who can be more successful? That makes no sense. I am really convinced. Other managers have different ways to do it, other clubs have different ways to do it. We have our way. I don’t think I am the perfect manager, I only think I am the perfect fit for this club. And I feel already much more responsible than maybe I should. I don’t even think about going from my side or saying ‘That’s it’. I really think we are on the right way. “Doing things like this [spending money] makes it more likely. Yes, we need to be a little bit luckier but to do that you have to carry on working. I know we are on a good way. If we could start again now by bringing me in, I would still have the same fire and the same passion, absolutely no problem. I know people don’t want to wait. We cannot change this. If you don’t want to wait, don’t wait. It’s like, if you have a really good situation in your private life, then enjoy it. But if your neighbour has a better situation, does that mean you can’t enjoy your own situation? ‘But he’s got one more car, he gets to go on one extra holiday.’ It’s not about others. It’s about us becoming happy.” Klopp admitted he did not open a bottle of champagne to toast his two-year anniversary as Liverpool manager last Sunday as he is “not overly happy” with the team’s results. Though he cautioned: “If they [Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owner] sacked me now, there would not be a lot of managers who would do the job better than I do. I don’t think I am perfect but, as long as 98% of Liverpudlians are behind us, then we are on the right way and we will succeed.” In 24 months at Liverpool the two‑times Bundesliga winner has spent £148m on new players and recouped £116m. His opposite number at United, José Mourinho, has spent £306m and recouped £41m in 17 months at Old Trafford. Yet Klopp insists the financial disparity is not reflected in Liverpool’s quality or ambition. He said: “Can we dominate them for the next 20 years without spending the same amount of money? Probably not. But can we still be there? Yes, of course we can and we want to force this. “We want to be consistent, constantly at our high level and improve it. Even when we lose a player in the future we want to bring in other players. That’s the benefit of a long-term project. I know the owners are not in doubt about me, about us, about anything. It’s really OK but of course we know we have to deliver. “At Newcastle I was close [to losing it after the 1-1 draw]. It was too much for me for a second. It felt unfair after the game. We were the better side, we had more chances. They had one chance and scored. A journalist asked me: ‘Do you think it’s a fair result?’ I said ’What do you think?’ When he said ‘Yes’, I was close to saying, ‘Come on, get up!’ As a human being I’m not proud of this. When I went out, I thought, ‘Come on, go back, shake hands. It’s not his fault ...’ But it’s how the world is. They aren’t interested. It’s about results. Deliver: we know that.” Klopp predicted United “will not be as passive” as they were in the goalless draw at Anfield last season. He also admitted Liverpool’s collective confidence suffered more than it should have done after the 5-0 defeat at Manchester City on 9 September when Sadio Mané, who will miss the next six weeks with a hamstring injury, was sent off.

Those are big victories, and they are important. But on the biggest argument, that any such discrimination always hurts girls more than boys, the court ruled two-to-one against. The dissenting judgment of Lady Justice Gloster is both a powerful advertisement for the immense importance of diversity in the courts, and essential reading for anyone interested in the complex relationship between faith and state. Al-Hijrah school is a voluntary aided co-educational Islamic faith school in Birmingham that teaches children aged four to 16. From the age of nine, boys and girls are separated on arrival and spend the whole day apart. Last year, Ofsted put the school in special measures because of concerns about school management, but it also found that the segregation was discriminatory even though both sexes had almost identical access to the full curriculum. The high court supported the school’s right to segregate its pupils. But on Friday the court of appeal overturned the high court and backed Ofsted’s argument that every boy and girl was discriminated against on the grounds that they did not have the chance to mix with the opposite sex. As a result, their social development and the extent to which they were prepared for interaction with the opposite sex when they left school was hampered. They were not properly educated. It was not a question of separate but equal treatment, but of discrimination against every individual. So far, so groundbreaking. But this was a case that hinged on perception, and where the three-judge court disagreed – on the disproportionate discrimination suffered by the girls – it was as segregated as the playground at the al-Hijrah school. The two male judges accepted the school’s contention that since the girls had equal access to the curriculum, there could be no practical discrimination. While they acknowledged that out in the real world, women are generally less powerful than men, they rejected the argument that segregation at school served to build a sense of inferiority that was simply reinforced as soon as they went on to sixth-form college. It was left to the single female judge, Lady Justice Gloster, to point out some of the indicators of their inferiority to which the girls were exposed every day at school. They had to wait, for example, until after the boys’ break before they were allowed to go out; Ofsted found on more than one inspection that the school library displayed books underlining in the most extreme language the inferior role of women in the home; and the inspectors also reported that there was a patent sense of stereotypical gendered roles and subordination present in the girls’ schoolwork. Segregation was not being turned to the girls’ advantage. It was not preparing them for an independent, empowered life. In a week when each day revelations of film mogul Harvey Weinstein’s allegedly predatory private life emerged along with the clamour for fundamental change to stop it ever happening again, the appeal court majority ruling, written admittedly weeks ago, appears insensitive to the kind of conditioning that plays such a significant part in creating the circumstances in which a powerful man can operate with impunity. Progress towards gender equality proceeds at a crawl. Racial diversity advances even more slowly. Yet in those early years, any school ought to enable its female students to make free, informed choices about how to take part in British society. Such decisions may well be rooted in her cultural, religious or community experience – but they should not be determined by it. Segregating young pupils on the basis of their sex in a co-education school does just that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/14/leicester-city-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Leicester City v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/14/leicester-city-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/14/leicester-city-west-bromwich-albion-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leicester have had a tricky start to the season in terms of fixtures but their ambitious owners would still have hoped for more than five points from seven matches.

He listed his demands at the front of the score: simplicity of execution, clarity of diction, swift moving action and no pauses for scene changes. Opera North, in a stylish new production by Matthew Eberhardt, conducted by Tobias Ringborg, delivered exactly that, as part of the latest offering in the company’s Little Greats festival of short operas. This small but almost perfectly formed musical – Bernstein returned to it late in life, merging it into the less effective A Quiet Place – steers headlong into the American dream. A married couple, Sam and Dinah, live in a little white house with a little white fence in sub-ur-bi-a. She’s a frustrated housewife, he a gym-crazy businessman, a winner with no worries about getting dinner or thinner. Love has gone. They loathe each other in a grey way. Bernstein wrote it on honeymoon, which must have gone down well. Dutch baritone Quirijn de Lang and Canadian mezzo-soprano Wallis Giunta, spirited and vocally crisp, led the five-strong cast. A swing-style vocal trio provide a Greek chorus born of the advertising age. This trio, Bernstein instructs, “must be as conventionally handsome as possible, and must never stop smiling”. Fflur Wyn, Joseph Shovelton and Nicholas Butterfield crooned beautifully. Charles Edwards’s fluid designs, switching from radio studio to a domestic paradise of yellow Formica and tubular steel, allowed the action to glide easily through its seven scenes. Ringborg kept the wind-dominated ensemble taut and infectiously jazzy. West Side Story would follow five years later. From such seeds. The evening opened with Janáček’s 1907 rarity Osud (Destiny), a score of glorious amplitude to a libretto – again the composer’s own – of chaotic opacity. Even with all its problems, this three-act, 90-minute work, here sung in English, makes essential listening. The plot follows a long opera-within-an-opera tradition. A composer, Živný, falls for Míla, whom he meets at a spa. A child and eventually an opera are born. Míla’s increasingly mad mother drags her daughter to a window, causing both their deaths. That’s not the end. Students then debate the subject matter of the opera and guess, no shrewdness needed, that it’s about the composer himself. It ends abruptly and inconclusively. Annabel Arden’s clear-as-possible production, handsomely designed in a 1930-40s setting by Charles Edwards, was blessed with fine principals. John Graham-Hall, a connoisseur of Janáček’s difficult, high-tenor roles, handled the challenging part of Živný elegantly, with Giselle Allen tender, obsessive and voluptuous as Míla, the muse-wife. Rosalind Plowright was luxury casting as Míla’s nightmare Mother. Christopher Nairne, a member of the chorus of Opera North, stood out in the cameo role of student Verva. Martin André, conducting, and the large ensemble cast and Opera North orchestra put the strongest case for this irresistible oddity. A little gilt had worn off in the last stages of Valery Gergiev’s eight-year tenure as principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, which he left in 2015. How exhilarating to have him back in the UK, full of that old quixotic flair, in two concerts with his Mariinsky Orchestra at Cadogan Hall. His relationship with the St Petersburg musicians goes back nearly three decades. These players, notably youthful and drawn from a larger Mariinsky collective that provides orchestras for the ballet and opera, know what Gergiev wants, and deliver. This Russian repertoire suits them. There’s a rawness and virility – whether in strings, brass or woodwind – that harnesses the listener and keeps them gripped, even in the hall’s dry and unyielding acoustic. Gergiev, conducting as usual with a tiny spillikin (far too small to call a baton) in his right hand, and with that hallmark, tremulous shuddering of his left, seemed less balletic than in the past, yet just as intense and commanding. This year the theme was Rimsky-Korsakov and his dazzling student Stravinsky. As tends to happen, the pupil for a while played down his debt both to his Russian homeland and to his master. Yet the friendship was close. Stravinsky wrote the recently rediscovered Funeral Song after his teacher’s death in 1908. Rimsky was one of the greatest of orchestral colourists and a generous supporter of many composers, including those with greater talent than his own – not just Stravinsky but Mussorgsky too. In the first of last week’s concerts the emphasis was on Rimsky. His four “musical pictures” from his satirical opera The Golden Cockerel (1907) inject folk styles into orchestral tradition, just as Stravinsky would with such revolutionary force, especially in his ballets. Despite the irony and the noisy, brassy outbursts here, Rimsky seems incapable of writing a nasty or negative note. His music conjures pleasure. His Scheherazade (1888), offset by Stravinsky’s astringent, neoclassical Symphony in C, was laid bare in all its exotic and erotic detail, with expert solo work form the orchestra’s leader (one of the Mariinsky’s six concertmasters), Alexei Lukirsky. Monday’s concert reversed the balance in favour of Stravinsky. Kristóf Baráti was the steely, virtuosic soloist in the Violin Concerto, showing his considerable expressive range with encores by Ysaÿe and Bach. The 1945 suite from The Firebird offered a brilliant conclusion, bassoon tender and mawkish in the “Lullaby”, horn and harp rising out of the quietest shimmer of strings you could hope for, into the huge crescendo with which the work ends. If that’s not one of the most incredible finales in all music I’d like to know what is.

The app, developed by the San Francisco startup Life On Air, has been a hit with teenagers – an audience Facebook is desperate to woo. After months of sniffing around its tiny competitor and even inviting the team to its headquarters last summer, Facebook launched its own group video chat tool within Messenger in December 2016. In February, it invited teens to its headquarters to quiz them, in return for $275 Amazon cards, on how and why they used video-chat apps. By July, Facebook was demonstrating a Houseparty clone, Bonfire, to employees and by early September the app launched in Denmark. “They see we’re having traction,” Sima Sistani, co-founder of Houseparty, told the Wall Street Journal in August. “That’s why we’re pushing so hard.” Pushing hard might not be enough when you’re going up against some of the world’s most powerful companies keen to cling to their empires. Startups drive job creation and innovation, but the number of new business launches is at a 30-year low and some economists, investors and entrepreneurs are pointing their fingers at big tech. For one thing, the deep pockets and resources of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple – with a combined value of almost $2.5tn – make it increasingly difficult for startups to compete or attract investment. “People are not getting funded because Amazon might one day compete with them,” said one founder, who wished to remain anonymous. “If it was startup versus startup, it would have been a fair fight, but startup versus Amazon and it’s game over.” Even multibillion-dollar startups like Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, struggle to compete against these tech titans. Like Houseparty, Snap was nipping at the heels of Facebook. At first, Facebook played nicely, making an offer to buy Snapchat – a strategy that worked with Instagram and WhatsApp. When that failed, Facebook cloned all of Snapchat’s features, awkwardly at first but relentlessly and with the resources of a $510bn company, until Snap’s potential slice of the advertising market shriveled to a sliver. While there’s a clear correlation, it’s hard to say for sure whether concentration of money is the cause or effect of the startup decline. On one hand, the existence of fewer new startups makes it easier for incumbent firms to accumulate more power. However, as industries become more concentrated, it also raises the barriers to new entrepreneurship, choking off innovation elsewhere in the marketplace. “They are financing the next generation research at a scale that no one else can afford,” said Tomasz Tunguz, a venture capitalist, citing Google’s experimental projects Loon (balloon-powered internet), Fiber (high-speed internet) and Waymo (self-driving cars). “They are playing in big markets, making big bets. Historically, that’s been the domain of startups.” As those companies get more powerful and staff salaries get higher, there’s even less of an incentive for workers to leave and set up on their own, which used to be a common pathway for entrepreneurs. If they do leave, the endgame is often to be acquired by their previous employer rather than grow large enough to compete with it. “If your strategy from the outset is to be acquired by Google, that’s just fueling consolidation,” said Ian Hathaway, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Jonathan Frankel was thrilled when Amazon’s investment arm funneled $5.6m into his startup Nucleus after a year of discussions. He was less thrilled when, a year later, Amazon launched its latest voice-controlled device, the Echo Show: an almost perfect clone of the Nucleus product. Nucleus was an Alexa-powered tablet computer that focused on video conferencing and communication, with a plan – that Amazon’s investment arm would have seen – to move into other areas. When the Echo Show launched, it too focused on communication, the core of Nucleus’s vision, instead of other key features like e-commerce or connected home elements. Frankel, who declined to comment for this piece, was furious, telling Recode earlier this year: “Their thesis is what our thesis was: communication is that Trojan horse to get those devices throughout the home and throughout the extended family’s home. “The difference is, they want to sell more detergent; we actually want to help families communicate easier.” These kinds of tactics have rattled investors, some founders said, making it harder for startups to raise money even if they’re in an adjacent market – particularly those skirting Amazon and Facebook. A venture capitalist confirms this, describing Amazon’s launch of an almost identical product as a “very, very strange coincidence”. “At the end of the day, Amazon could be theoretically in nearly any consumer business in the world,” he said, adding that he was frequently in meetings where investment decisions are informed by the question: “Can Amazon do that?” “Amazon can do anything,” he noted. It’s not just a problem within the tech industry. Since 1980, the share of companies less than a year old has almost halved – from 15% of companies to just 8.1%, according to Census Bureau data. The total number of startups formed in 2015 (the last year surveyed) was 414,000 – a huge drop from the pre-recession figure of 558,000 in 2006. “It’s been a persistent and fairly precipitous decline,” said John Dearie, the founder of the Center for American Entrepreneurship, an organization set up to address the decline. “The reason why this is so troubling is that new businesses account for virtually all new job creation and account disproportionately for disruptive innovations.” “It’s not a coincidence that at a time when the startup rate is in a long-term decline, the economy has not grown at 3% or better,” said Dearie. “We are in a growth emergency.” Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/14/the-resistance-now-dianne-feinstein-left","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"The Resistance Now: leftwingers plan challenge against 'out of touch' Dianne Feinstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/the-resistance-now-dianne-feinstein-left","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/the-resistance-now-dianne-feinstein-left","fields":{"headline":"The Resistance Now: leftwingers plan challenge against 'out of touch' Dianne Feinstein","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Is time up for no left-lean Dianne Feinstein?

But that does not mean the Frenchman is not tittering away to himself at this very moment. And who could blame him if he is? Puel was let go in June despite leading Southampton to their first major final for 14 years and an eighth-place finish in the Premier League. But apparently his style was too boring and some players and many fans disliked his method, so he had to go – fair enough but look at them now. As they prepare for Sunday’s telling match with Newcastle, Southampton are 12th in the table and their new manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, has introduced such pizzazz that they have mustered five goals in seven league matches. Puel’s fate was sealed when his team failed to score in six of their final seven home games of last season. Hey presto, they have failed to score in four of their first five home games under Pellegrino, including the 2-0 defeat by Wolves that meant they were eliminated immediately from the EFL Cup in which they were runners-up last season, and by a Championship side. Puel may or may not be guffawing; season-ticket holders at St Mary’s are definitely still groaning. Puel was not the problem, then. But nothing so far suggests that Pellegrino is the solution. The Argentinian has tended to play the same formation as his predecessor, made similar selections and substitutions and presided over a similar possession-based style. Yet Southampton still struggle to score. It is too early to conclude that Pellegrino will flop but is it unreasonable to have expected progress on the attacking front? Kind of, yes. It is not a question of what has changed at the club so much as what else has remained the same. The answer, of course, is Southampton’s forwards. Last season the south coast club delivered more crosses (albeit of varying quality) than any other team but none of their strikers got close to a double-digit goal tally in the Premier League. Charlie Austin struck six before suffering an injury; Manolo Gabbiadini fired in four goals in his first three league matches but then he, too, was injured. The Italian has been back in action for months but his sharpness has not returned. Austin is a natural finisher but not mobile enough to serve as a lone striker in the formation that both Puel and Pellegrino prefer, so he has not started a league game this season. Gabbiadini is also a classy finisher when at his best but he, too, has not been dynamic enough to be entrusted with a regular starting spot. Pellegrino has alternated between the Italian and Shane Long, who drags defences all over the place and gets much more involved in play (averaging 39 touches per match this season compared with 13 for Gabbiadini) but has never been a regular scorer. Graziano Pellè used to endure barren patches but Southampton still miss the striker who left for China in July last year. Southampton spent a club record £18.1m in the summer on the tidy midfielder Mario Lemina, and the club’s chairman, Ralph Krueger, said that retaining Virgil van Dijk was “a statement we need to make” but, bearing in mind that they also signed the centreback Wesley Hoedt, a more important declaration of intent would have been to improve their firepower by buying a striker who can thrive in the system that they apparently want to play. Either that, or Pellegrino has to find another system, perhaps by playing with two strikers, which he has been reluctant to do. The attackers behind the strikers remain no more reliable than the players in front of them. They shine in spells but there seems no way of knowing how they will ration their magic. Nathan Redmond, last season’s top scorer in the league with seven goals, has scored once this season and his ratio of good performances to bad is worsening. Dusan Tadic started this campaign glumly but has perked up recently. Sofiane Boufal has looked bright in a couple of appearances off the bench but not shown enough since his arrival in January to earn a regular start. Steve Davis had been a paragon of consistency for years until this season, stirring fears that, at 32, he is dwindling. Other erstwhile stalwarts are also wavering. Southampton had two of the best full-backs in the league last season but Ryan Bertrand has been below par this season and Cédric Soares made an uncharacteristic lapse that led to Stoke’s winning goal in Southampton’s last outing. Fraser Forster has become fallible in goal and Van Dijk has been reintegrated into the team but to what effect remains unclear, other than pushing Jack Stephens to the margins. Stephens’s emergence was one of the gains of Puel’s tenure. Now, with James Ward-Prowse’s form sagging, Southampton’s successful assimilation of homegrown players looks to be in jeopardy. These are uncertain times for a club whose vision has been mostly true in recent years. Maybe Pellegrino will work out a way to coax more consistency from talented players, and maybe Gao Jisheng, the Chinese real estate tycoon who bought 80% of the club in August, will sanction investment in January. If not, a club that has earned the right to aspire to hobnobbing with European competitors could find itself brawling against relegation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/13/sunil-gulati-us-soccer-bruce-arena","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T19:22:12Z","webTitle":"Bruce Arena is gone.

Should US Soccer president Sunil Gulati be next?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bruce Arena’s failure was not an individual failure. It’s a systemic failure that shows the United States does not yet have the soccer culture tens of millions of its citizens want. US Soccer could not be “fixed” in Arena’s 11-month stint as the men’s national team coach. The realistic hope was that he could do what he did at the 2002 World Cup – get the most out of a couple of exceptional talents, paper over the team’s weaknesses and hope for the best. In 2002, the stars aligned. Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley were fresh from their starring run at the 1999 U-17 World Cup. Claudio Reyna and John O’Brien were healthy and in good form – at the same time. Brad Friedel and Eddie Pope were as steady as anyone at the back, and Tony Sanneh was having the best 18 months of his career. Then Portugal melted down against South Korea, and the referee missed an obvious handball by O’Brien in the grand round of 16 matchup against Mexico. Not that it was all luck. Arena had his team well-prepared for their opener against Portugal and knocked in three first-half goals in a 3-2 win, and his tactics frustrated a talented but temperamental Mexican team to make the quarter-finals. No stars were aligning this year. Arena took the helm while the ship was listing. The USA had lost the first two qualifiers – admittedly difficult games against front-runners Mexico and Costa Rica – and players were lost under the direction of Jurgen Klinsmann, who had five years to instill his vision for the national team ... and failed. Through seven months of 2017, it looked as if Arena was doing just enough to keep the team afloat. The USA won the Gold Cup, perhaps with a bit of good fortune but still a notable accomplishment. They earned a draw in Mexico’s fearsome Azteca. Just a week ago, a 4-0 drubbing of Panama made the team a virtual lock to qualify. But the good luck dried up. Against Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Omar Gonzalez shanked a clearance that found the one spot goalkeeper Tim Howard couldn’t cover in his own goal. Honduras rallied to beat Mexico with the help of a bizarre own-goal off goalkeeper Memo Ochoa’s head. Panama’s win was even less likely, rallying past Costa Rica with a phantom goal that joins Diego Maradona’s “Hand of God” and the Thierry Henry handball that knocked out Ireland in the ranks of dubious World Cup refereeing lapses. Once again, the USA simply didn’t have enough time. Not enough time on Tuesday night to find the equalizer to save the team’s World Cup campaign. Not enough time in 11 months to instill the mix of flair and grit that is necessary to win consistently in Concacaf. So Arena, who was never intended to carry the team into another World Cup cycle, resigned on Friday. A single game or two won’t tarnish his legacy too badly, and he still stands as the USA’s most accomplished men’s coach. On the same day, someone who has had much more time in his role – US Soccer president Sunil Gulati – calmly but emphatically rejected calls to resign immediately or to declare that he would not seek reelection in February. He didn’t officially say he was running again, but under a stern interrogation, he conceded that he has been reaching out to people to nominate him under the federation’s new election rules. Gulati has been president since 2006 and vice president for six years before that. By many metrics, his reign has been successful – the once-underfunded federation is swimming in money, the women’s team has won two more Olympic golds and one more World Cup, strides have been made in coaching education, and the federation’s governance has been brought up to modern standards. On the other hand, US teams have been failing to qualify for tournaments – Olympics, youth international events (even on the women’s side) and now the World Cup. But the presidency may be a more difficult job than national team coach. For one thing, it’s unpaid, a factor in keeping out viable candidates such as Julie Foudy. On the international level, the president is required to go to Fifa meetings and shake hands with a lot of dubious people. On the national level, the US Soccer board is required to expend a lot of energy on disputes between state associations and the many organizations competing for youth soccer players and dollars. Bruce Arena couldn’t fix the U.S. national team in 11 months, and there was no reason for him to continue. Sunil Gulati has improved the US soccer culture in 12 years, but is there any reason to give him more time to take it to the next level? Or is it someone else’s turn?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/13/talking-horses-cesarewitch-newmarket-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T23:05:45Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Tony Bloom’s gamble on Withhold may pay off at Newmarket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/13/talking-horses-cesarewitch-newmarket-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/13/talking-horses-cesarewitch-newmarket-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Tony Bloom’s gamble on Withhold may pay off at Newmarket","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Saturday’s TV races Just as Dolphin Vista won the Cambridgeshire a fortnight ago on his second run for a new trainer, so Withhold (3.40) may land today’s Cesarewitch at Newmarket for Roger Charlton, having had only one previous run for the Wiltshire man. Available at 12-1 on Friday, Withhold showed enough quality for a race like this with a couple of wins at the end of last year and his prep run last month was most encouraging. Sold off by Khalid Abdullah last October, Withhold was knocked down to Tony Bloom, professional gambler and the Brighton and Hove Albion chairman, and it seems likely that this race has been the target from that moment. On his previous start before that sale he beat the useful London Prize and now meets that rival on 8lb better terms. The cheekpieces he wore that day for the first time are now back on, having been left off when he was third over too short a distance last month.

Crystal Palace will benefit from the return of Wilfried Zaha on Saturday, a player “with the X factor” who has been absent since the opening-day defeat by Huddersfield. “He can dribble and beat people but most of all he has a special place in the hearts and minds of the supporters,” said the manager. “They will feel more comfortable now that he is back, believing he is the type of person who can change a game and turn a defeat into a draw or a draw into a victory. There is a big psychological factor with him being able to play again.” Then, in keeping with a campaign littered with lows, came the inevitable reality check. Zaha has not played for two months and must hit the ground running against the champions, Chelsea’s visit completing a brutal set of fixtures which have left Palace floundering scoreless and pointless at the foot of the division. There is no recognised striker fit and available and the allocated back-up, Bakary Sako, returned to training only on Thursday after his latest injury issues. The first-choice goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, faces a fitness test, with Julian Speroni on standby to start his first top-flight game since the season before last. The 38-year-old’s last league appearance at Selhurst Park was in May 2015. Then come the statistics, the kind to have Palace supporters rolling their eyes, closing their social media accounts and making plans to emigrate. This side have endured 11 scoreless defeats in their past 12 league games, stretching back into Sam Allardyce’s tenure two managers ago. No English team have lost nine successive league games without scoring but that is a record Palace will set should they succumb without reward against Chelsea, taking into account the final-day loss at Old Trafford. In the grim circumstances, it is just as well gallows humour prevails. The fanzine Five Year Plan ran a spoof online goal of the month competition for September where all four contenders were Sako’s header against Huddersfield in the League Cup. Pape Souaré was voted the club’s player of the month on Friday and, while the Senegalese’s recovery over the past year from a serious car accident has been the uplifting story of Palace’s season, he played only 45 minutes. It is no wonder that much of the pre‑match talk with Hodgson revolved around psychology and the need to rebuild confidence within a group which feels battered from pillar to post. This squad worked one day a week with the sports psychologist Jeremy Snape under Alan Pardew, and had a similar arrangement with Lee Richardson under Allardyce. Hodgson used Steve Peters during his time with England but, for now at least, his priorities at Palace are more mundane. “Personally, I think the best people to repair confidence are the coaching staff and those around the club: the people close to the football who work with them every day on the training field,” he said. “Psychologists can play a part, but first of all you need to have made certain that the people you’re working with are singing off the same hymn sheet. That there is a unity of ideas in things we’re trying to achieve. “Secondly, having someone just pop in and out … I’m not 100% certain that works. It might do for an individual but, as a team, you have to be very careful to make certain you have got the right format for this psychologist to work with. At the moment, all my thoughts and all my work are really involved in the tactical and technical side of the game on the training field. Using a psychologist regularly would have to be for something going forward when we’ve established some sort of base, which we’re in the throes of trying to establish. “I’m not anti it, by any stretch of the imagination. Steve Peters was very good and played a useful role, not least of all with the coaching staff and how we addressed the players in our meetings. But, at the moment, it could muddy the waters even further when we’re trying to make it clear for players: ‘To survive we have got to do these things.’ To do those things we need the training field, we need the day-to-day contact between manager, coach and player.” He fell short of suggesting Palace have gone back to basics to rebuild belief but his rhetoric suggested as much. A behind‑closed‑doors friendly was arranged last week against Queens Park Rangers at Selhurst Park, where Palace’s form has actually been horribly patchy ever since promotion in 2013. The game was drawn 2-2. At least the team scored. The real boost comes from Zaha, a scorer against Chelsea in April and a player who can inspire those around him. Hodgson was the manager who handed the winger his England debut as a Championship player almost four years ago, and who picked him against Scotland at Wembley once he had joined Manchester United. He was also the manager who overlooked Zaha once the player’s career had stalled at Old Trafford, with a player born in Abidjan committing instead to Ivory Coast at the tail end of last year. “I have seen him change a game,” Hodgson said. “I know he has the ability and capability. But we have to be careful. We have a lot of things to do at Crystal Palace before I am satisfied we are a good team who know exactly what it is doing on the field, a team that is going to be difficult to beat and are capable of winning games and getting the points we need. “At the moment, to put all that on Wilfried Zaha’s plate would be totally wrong. If we’re not careful, he’ll be trying too hard; trying to do it all by himself. Once players start to do that, their own game suffers. He’s got to be an important cog in a well-oiled machine and our job is to make certain that the machine is well enough oiled to produce that X factor.” For now, the manager would be happy to spy evidence of progress. And Chelsea are a daunting prospect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/13/nevada-must-enforce-its-own-background-check-law-legal-suit-demands","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T19:04:59Z","webTitle":"Nevada must enforce its own background-check law, legal suit demands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/nevada-must-enforce-its-own-background-check-law-legal-suit-demands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/nevada-must-enforce-its-own-background-check-law-legal-suit-demands","fields":{"headline":"Nevada must enforce its own background-check law, legal suit demands","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Advocates in Nevada filed a lawsuit on Thursday seeking to compel the state to enforce an enhanced gun-purchase background check law that has been on the books since January but has so far been pushed aside. “This case is about the refusal of the governor of Nevada to discharge one of his most fundamental constitutional obligations – to see that the laws of this state are faithfully executed,” the group, Nevadans for Background Checks, argued in its filing. The suit has been threatened for months and was being prepared before Las Vegas saw the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history earlier this month. Fifty-eight people died and nearly 500 were injured when a gunman opened fire on a music festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. The shooting has however refocused public attention on Nevada’s gun laws and put pressure on Brian Sandoval, the governor, to consider how his state might be able to come into compliance with a law he has all but ignored for 10 months. “Clearly the attention that’s now been brought to the failure to implement the law seems to have awakened the governor to at least ask the question, ‘Can this be implemented?’” said an attorney familiar with the suit. In November 2016, by a razor-thin margin, Nevada voters approved a ballot measure to require background checks on all private firearm purchases. Shortly after its passage, however, state attorney general Adam Laxalt, a strong supporter of the National Rifle Association, wrote an opinion concluding that the law was “unenforceable” as written. That opinion was one Sandoval seemed willing to accept, at least until after the 1 October shooting. He then sent a letter to Laxalt, asking if a path to enforcement could be revisited. Both Republicans had been against the ballot initiative. Nevadans for Background Checks wanted to keep the checks free to minimize the burden of the law and likely to pre-empt a potential argument by opponents. To accomplish this, the measure passed in 2016 required that background checks conducted on private gun transactions be executed through the FBI’s criminal background system, which is free. However, in the late 1990s Nevada became one of 12 states to host its own criminal background check system for retail firearm purchases. In so-called “point-of-contact” (POC) states, a state agency – in Nevada’s case the department of public safety – conducts the FBI search as well as a search of its own state and local records. Such records often include items federal checks are bound to miss. Shortly after the 2016 election, the FBI sent a letter to the Nevada state government, informing it that as Nevada was a POC state, the bureau would not conduct checks for individuals. In Laxalt’s view, this made the law impossible to enforce. “The law does not require impossible acts,” the attorney general’s office wrote in a letter announcing it would not enforce the background check law. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. Mark Ferrario, lead counsel for Nevadans for Background Checks, said: “All that is required of the governor is that he engage directly with the FBI, confirm Nevada’s choice of partial POC status, and take the steps necessary to implement the law.” According to Ferrario and Nevadans for Background Checks, the answer is simply for the state to reach out to the FBI and ask to become a “hybrid” state, where retail checks are done through the state system and private checks are done through the FBI. “The path forward was presented to [Sandoval] months ago,” Ferrario said. “He should immediately engage with the FBI to implement the law.” Nevadans for Background Checks argues that nine of the other 12 POC states have this arrangement. Essentially, the group is accusing the governor and attorney general of playing dumb to avoid enforcing a law they do not support. The law would not have applied to the Las Vegas shooter, as most if not all of his weapons were purchased from authorized dealers. He would have passed an FBI or state background check without issue. Furthermore, the law has so far had the opposite effect of its intent. Before its passage, unauthorized sellers could seek out a background check but were not required to. Now, with no avenue to conduct them, all background checks on guns sold by unlicensed sellers have been halted. The suit says this has left “law-abiding citizens who want the assurance of a background check prior to selling a gun to another citizen without any mechanism to obtain one”. Elizabeth Becker, a volunteer with the Nevada chapter of Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America, said: “Our governor and attorney general now face a clear choice: will they keep dragging their feet on enforcing the law voters passed last year, or will they start working with the FBI to implement it? “Last week was a terrifying wake-up call about why strong gun laws matter, and parents like me won’t sit idly by as our leaders refuse to their jobs. Our volunteers will be doing all we can to urge the governor and attorney general to take action to enforce the law Nevadans voted for.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/18/nature-and-necessity-by-tariq-goddard-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Nature and Necessity by Tariq Goddard review – debauchery and class war in the country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/18/nature-and-necessity-by-tariq-goddard-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/18/nature-and-necessity-by-tariq-goddard-review","fields":{"headline":"Nature and Necessity by Tariq Goddard review – debauchery and class war in the country","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For a genre rooted in the 19th century, the country house novel has proved amazingly durable. Tariq Goddard has set his latest book in a North Yorkshire house called The Heights, “once an Arts and Crafts cottage, now arguably the most attractive dwelling in the county”. It is quite a departure for a writer best known for his novels about men in wartime, such as his 2002 debut Homage to a Firing Squad, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread first novel prize. Nature and Necessity opens in the 1970s and ends roughly around the present day. The lady of the house is Petula Montague, who married into money in the form of her second husband, Noah. She has two children from her previous marriage whom she alternately dominates and neglects; Evita eventually runs away and becomes a drug-addled hippy, whereas Jasper, or Jazzy as he is known, stays on the family estate as a disgruntled labourer, “like a cross between Arthur Scargill and Bill Sikes”. Petula lavishes all her attention on her daughter with Noah, Regan (the King Lear reference is entirely relevant). She encourages people to refer to them as “the sisters”, and we are told “there had never been a point in her life where she considered her daughter’s property or affairs separate from her own”. This is a novel about women, with the men largely cowed or absent. “Men were like children to Petula: it was not good to let them make decisions for themselves ... ” Yet her position is not secure; she is reliant on her husband, and as in a good 19th-century novel, the source of his wealth – “factory farms in the Philippines” – is not something she wants to be widely known. It quickly becomes apparent that Nature and Necessity isn’t such a departure for Goddard, because Petula approaches her family and social life as warfare: “Having [Evita] and Jasper at large was like having to fight America and Russia at the same time.” With her plots against family, friends and neighbours, and battles with local tradesmen, Petula is reminiscent of one of PG Wodehouse’s aunts, or Mapp and Lucia from EF Benson’s novels. But though he can be very funny, Goddard takes Petula’s battles to their logical conclusions. People get hurt, and not just emotionally. There is class war as well as interfamily conflict. Goddard peppers the text with references to contemporary events such as the miners’ strike. There’s more than a little bit of Thatcher in Petula. She says at one point: “Life isn’t fair on those of us whose backbones are made of self-pity.” Where Goddard excels is in splicing country house novel conventions with contemporary mores. Regan’s debutante ball turns into a drug-fuelled debauch with perhaps the funniest description of taking ecstasy for the first time that I’ve ever read. In fact, few people write about intoxication as well as Goddard. Sometimes the humour is rather broad. The local town is called Shatby, Petula’s first husband is called Anycock and there is an apple press called Genocider. But the author also comes out with elegant aphoristic lines such as his description of Aunt Royce, Noah’s sister: “As with many spinsters of her generation she kept her spirits up with hobbies, the Mail on Sunday, gardening and regular interference in the lives of younger relatives.” Goddard can do tenderness as well as humour. The best scenes are moments of thwarted intimacy, such as when Evita comes home strung out on heroin and her mother looks after her in the attic – the Jane Eyre parallels are made explicit. There is no reconciliation: “doing things had always been preferable to forming emotional connections” for Petula. Evita fails in her mother’s eyes because she’s not a good actor: “Evita lacked the guile and strength to convince the world she was right, which, in Petula’s book, was not different to being wrong.” The Heights is a stage set with Petula as director, producer and leading lady. She surrounds herself with actors and, obsessed with appearances, lets terrible things happen to her children. Petula sucks the life out of those around and then discards them when she is bored. Nature and Necessity is not perfect, by any means; at nearly 600 pages, it could have done with a prune. But there’s a ferocious energy here that will keep you reading through to the bitter end. Goddard has reinvigorated the country house novel and in Petula Montague he has created a great new monster of English fiction. • Nature and Necessity is published by Repeater.

At a much-documented meeting in Sochi, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov gave Vladimir Putin a Central Asian shepherd puppy for the Russian president’s 65th birthday (and perhaps to see if Putin might not feel like resurrecting Turkmen natural gas exports). Proudly dangling the puppy by the scruff of its neck in front of assembled statesmen and media, Berdymukhamedov said the ancient breed, also known as the alabai, was a “common friend” of Russia and Turkmenistan. It is not only a popular pet and guard dog in Turkmenistan, but officially listed as part of the national heritage, alongside the revered Akhal-Teke breed of racehorse. Exporting alabai is prohibited, and since February they have been used as police and sniffer dogs by the state security services, under Berdymukhamedov’s orders. But only alabai are held in presidential favour in Turkmenistan, notorious for its brutal treatment of strays and even pets mistaken for them. This dates back decades to the days of its first president, Saparmurat Niyazov, who banned dogs from the capital city, Ashgabat, on grounds of their “unappealing odour”. (The dictator did, however, reportedly look to them for guidance on dental hygiene: “I watched young dogs when I was young. They were given bones to gnaw. Those of you whose teeth have fallen out did not gnaw on bones. This is my advice.”) Alabai notwithstanding, Berdymukhamedov shares his predecessor’s revulsion for dogs. “There’s nothing that gets [the] president more crazy than stray dogs and cats,” wrote one reporter of the multiple mass culls carried out under Berdymukhamedov’s orders. Last year municipal workers planted poisoned food around the city, with many pets counted as collateral damage. The killings increased in the lead-up to the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, which Ashgabat hosted last month – and for which the Turkmen delegation saw no irony in naming an animated alabai, Wepaly, as its mascot. (Berdymukhamedov had input into him, too.) Under the grimly brilliant headline “Turkmenistan: It’s Murdering Cats and Dogs”, Eurasianet quoted activist Natalya Shabunts’s public appeal to the president “to put an end to the bloodbath”: “The barbaric execution of these unfortunate animals by numerous hunting squads has turned Turkmenistan into a nation of executioners and murderers.” Sanitation workers, she pointed out, were not nearly so motivated to rid the city of actual vermin such as bedbugs or rats. Shabunts (one of the few activists in Turkmenistan to campaign under her real name) was reportedly later abused for her dog-friendly activism while out walking her two pekingese. State media subsequently published a report on a new “island of hope” for stray dogs: Turkmenistan’s first animal shelter, apparently set up with the support of government bodies. No such fate is likely to await Putin’s new pup, however. The Russian president already has two dogs: a Bulgarian shepherd called Buffy and an akita named Yume; he reportedly turned down the Japanese government’s offer last year of a “bridegroom” for Yume. Cradling his acquisition and giving it a kiss on its head, he named it Verny (“faithful” in Russian). Not only the name was considered ripe for analysis. The Times quoted a commentator on Moscow’s Kommersant FM radio station who interpreted the whole affair as a veiled threat. In Putin’s gentle receipt of poor Faithful, the analyst said, was a message to Russian voters ahead of elections in March: “Make the right choice and you will receive fatherly care. After all, we could do it differently, like in Turkmenistan: grab you by the scruff of the neck and give a good shaking.” Do you live in one of the Stans cities, or have you spent time there?

Princess Nokia makes films for Maybelline. And Red Bull is the new school of rock. Have brand partnerships destroyed counterculture? Or are they all that’s keeping it alive? Is it possible, in 2017, to sell out? Not so long ago, cosying up to big business was considered the gravest sin an underground artist could commit – but these days new and leftfield musicians seem to spend their days hoovering up cash provided by brands while fans barely bat an eyelid. It’s not simply a case of moral bankruptcy, but rather literal bankruptcy: new and independent artists have had their potential income slashed by streaming and have been forced to mine money from an alternative source. But what’s in it for the brands – why have massive companies like Budweiser, Versace and Adidas invaded the alternative music scene? And can an underground even exist when so many of its artists are in cahoots with multinationals? It’s true that corporations and musicians have been shacking up together for decades – since the Vans Warped tour began in the mid-90s, even anti-establishment punk types have been in bed with them. But over the past decade companies have descended on musicians more zealously than ever. “There’s a real demand for authenticity at the moment,” explains Jamie Brett from Youth Club, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to archiving youth culture. “So I think brands are more keen than ever to reconnect with their subcultural heritage – if they have any – or try to forge some subcultural anchoring if they don’t.” In other words, in order to cut through the onslaught of obvious online advertising, companies are attempting to siphon off some of the exciting cool that alternative music radiates by posing as tastemakers and champions of the underground. In the past few months alone, that’s resulted in shoemaker Timberland hosting a grime gig; Brooklyn rockers Public Access TV modelling for Levi’s; Skepta teaming up with Rolls-Royce; Bang &amp; Olufsen sponsoring a show by renegade artist Dean Blunt; leftfield pop band Rhythm Method playing at a Topman fashion show and rising rapper Princess Nokia starring in a short film for Maybelline. This quest for credibility in a world of stealth advertising can also look bewilderingly philanthropic. Why, for instance, has Red Bull been funding Red Bull Music Academy, an organisation – not particularly famous outside of hipster circles – that hosts lectures, gigs and workshops and supports hyperlocal scenes, for two decades? A slight increase in positive associations with its taurine cocktail, presumably, but the decision doesn’t scream business nous. The financial nonsense of the project, however, only adds to the impression it is motivated by genuine enthusiasm for culture, something brands are desperate to cultivate. “Red Bull is not in the world of music to make money off music,” says RBMA co-founder Many Ameri. “We are entering this with no need to make everything work financially – we can focus on presenting things that are interesting and use that freedom.” It is true that Red Bull has little commercial stake in the music its endeavours produce and support; while record companies encourage commercial success, brands aren’t looking to recoup in that straightforward sense. It’s easy to understand why an independent artist like rapper Little Simz would describe Red Bull, which allowed her to record her debut album for free in its studios, as “very kind”. It may sound naive, but Little Simz’s claim that the drinks giant let her retain full artistic control – there was “no interfering with the music at all” she told the Guardian at the time – is a genuine reflection of how many artist/brand partnerships work. Little Simz’s association with Red Bull didn’t lead to overexposure – in fact, her album failed to chart. Other kinds of collaborations, such as gig sponsorships, or musicians modelling for brands, are usually small-scale and high turnover – meaning that brand partnerships do not tend to give alternative artists such huge amounts of publicity they no longer qualify as underground; often the musicians will merely receive a modest bump in social media followers in addition to their fee. It’s not even in the brand’s interest to make the artist famous. Collaborating with more obscure musicians, says Steven Appleyard of Boiler Room, a streaming site that hosts events worldwide with underground musicians from Hudson Mohawke to Nina Kraviz, ensures the brand doesn’t get overshadowed by its artist associates. “Working with top 10 artists can be a bit of a false economy,” he explains, “because the awareness and engagement that the brand gets off the back of it is kind of transient.” From a certain angle it looks like brand partnerships are the only thing perpetuating underground music. “If you’ve got some batshit-crazy idea, your avenues towards getting that idea brought to life are limited,” says Appleyard. “Unless there’s an obvious commercial kickback through record sales, it’s doubtful that your record label’s going to back it.” Yet in exchange for some associative “vibes”, a brand might. Brand collaborations also prop up Boiler Room, which began in 2010 as a way to broadcast the London bass scene. Like NTS – an online radio station that broadcasts alternative music, and is funded by brands such as Uniqlo, Carhartt and Drambuie – Boiler Room’s content is free in order to compete with the rest of the internet. “Right from the very start we did partnerships with brands,” says Appleyard. “It was the only way we were able to exist.” Brands are paying to appropriate the cutting-edge sensibilities of these platforms, but they will normally also have input into the content they fund. “Of course Boiler Room has more in-depth knowledge when it comes to the right artists,” says Sascha Cordes from Budweiser, which sponsors numerous Boiler Room events. “But we will sit together to figure out from the bigger pool of preselected [artists] what is the best lineup – what fits the story of Budweiser in London.” It’s a narrative that’s officially based around the beer’s amusingly strident slogan – Budweiser is “brewed on its own terms, for people who live on their own terms” – but the brand is clearly more focused on mood than the sound of the music. Cordes seems to be especially keen to associate with “euphoria”, explaining Budweiser is not interested in “one specific genre, it’s really about the energy”. Those sorts of values are arbitrary enough to be largely meaningless – but because brands aren’t particularly interested in the music itself, there can be other, more insidious factors at play when they decide which artists to promote. Rina Sawayama is an unsigned, self-funded musician who makes leftfield pop, and says brand partnerships have been crucial to her existence as an artist. She featured in the recent Versace Versus campaign alongside rapper Tommy Genesis and singer Cosmo Pyke among others – and appreciates that her striking look is what makes brands keen to work with her. “I’m very aware that [these collaborations] come with the privilege of brands thinking you’re good-looking enough,” she says. “I’m under no illusion that when we turn up to these jobs that, of course we’re artists, but also we possess the look that they want.” In these scenarios, alternative musicians are being vetted for attractiveness before they are given the means to make music – presumably the Falls and Pogues of tomorrow are being starved out of the industry as we speak. Superficiality aside, the commodification of counterculture seems like less of a problem when anti-consumerism is no longer a major tenet of the underground (the free party scene excluded). Representation and identity politics are instead the causes du jour, and, theoretically, commercialism is not anathema to social justice – it can even help spread the word. Indeed, brands often attach themselves to political crusades via a softening musical filter, as proven by Smirnoff’s recent Equalizing Music campaign – which aims to double the number of female festival headliners by 2020 – or Timberland’s grime gig – timed to coincide with the review of the 696 risk assessment form that has been accused of unfairly discriminating against black musicians. Yet as keen as they are to appropriate these causes, controversies in other industries have proven that brands behave conservatively despite outward appearances. The case of Monroe Bergdorf, the transgender model whose comments on racism led to her being fired from a L’Oréal campaign, is proof that brands are not always prepared to tolerate controversial views or ideas – for artists not wanting to bite the hand that feeds, this could result in a kind of implied censorship against provocative music. The general message from the industry seems to be that brand partnerships must be vetted closely – any relationship that seems too incongruous or clunky could still turn people off. The music world has learned from misdemeanours such as U2’s infamous partnership with Apple – which saw their 2014 album Songs of Innocence clog up the iTunes of 500m people; and Alicia Keys’ collaboration with BlackBerry – which she slightly undermined by tweeting it from an iPhone. Lessons about subtlety and authenticity have been learned, which is why nakedly cynical examples are hard to find (a recent music website advertorial called Why I Love Dr Martens boots, written by the ex-pirate radio DJ and Boiler Room favourite Oneman being a notable exception). Yet the oxymoronic nature of the phenomenon – that brands have colonised the world of non-commercial music – doesn’t seem to bother anybody I speak to; instead they say both artists and audiences simply accept the relationship as financially necessary. That seems logical when you consider the fact that artist-brand partnerships exist in a climate of guilt. Fans listen to artists for free on streaming sites such as Spotify and YouTube, where advertising is a reminder that they aren’t willing to actually buy the music – and that it has to be funded somehow. Yet this complicity is a cause for concern: advertising may not have totally undermined the underground just yet, but it’s certainly reshaping alternative music in its own hollow image."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/13/catalans-should-look-beyond-independence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T17:18:34Z","webTitle":"Catalans should look beyond independence | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/13/catalans-should-look-beyond-independence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/13/catalans-should-look-beyond-independence","fields":{"headline":"Catalans should look beyond independence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Catalans need to build bridges, and to do so quickly.

Under Franco the army had become used to playing a very active role in politics. Spain’s need for a new constitution is greater than Catalonia’s need for independence. The other direction for bridge-building is just as urgent: bridges to the other Catalan-speaking regions of the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands. At the last regional elections the ultra-conservative People’s party (PP) lost control of both these autonomous regions to leftwing alliances. The PP is the party of Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy. Such bridge-building is not just about politics. There is also much scope for improving cultural and economic relations, as I pointed out in my recent book Catalans and Others. Catalonia has always survived by being open to the world but at present is indulging in a prolonged bout of navel-gazing.

The arrival of fieldfares and redwings is always sparkling compensation for the gloomy approach of winter but I would have to wait a little longer. At least the sun was out, turning the sprung shoulders of a kestrel to a vibrant caramel as it quartered the brook below me. Almost as I reached the Baslow road the sunlight picked out a red deer stag standing tall some distance away, antlers raised, breath steaming from its flared nostrils. At the same time I caught sight of another beast advancing towards the stag with an enormous-lensed camera held to his eye. Red deer are skittish and with the wind in the right direction can smell a human from 500 metres away. These moors, six square miles on the limits of Sheffield, support a population of 168 deer, according to the Eastern Moors Partnership’s most recent census. There can be few British herds in such proximity to a large city but they seem to have adjusted. The cabs of lorries passing me would have made a fine vantage point from which to glimpse the autumn rut. The photographer, on the other hand, came a metre too close and the stag dropped a shoulder and wheeled away. I got out my binoculars but by the time I had the ground in view again the photographer had vanished, spooked perhaps by the disapproval of more distant walkers who had also been admiring the superbly antlered male and the 40 or so hinds in his harem. Off to one side two more males were lurking hopefully, although the season now was drawing to a close. A bolving competition, when humans imitate the throaty, booming, roar of a stag hoping to provoke a response, was planned for the following weekend, the autumn’s last exchange between one species that has learned toleration for the curiosity of the other.

I don’t want that for myself. I just want to know how they do it. Lucy Fry is a fitness journalist and author. She was once a personal trainer, briefly a boxing fanatic and can do a handstand in the air on a pair of bars. Born in 1981, she marks the very start of the demographic: millennial ground zero. It is not really a case of keeping up with Fry as she models power and endurance. She is very into rings and bars, jumping on the side of things, hanging off things. Fry can effectively fly. Even just listening to her makes me feel tired. “It’s about being badass,” she tells me. “Strength is a huge thing. Callisthenics is a huge thing.” This is a form of body-weight exercise, running, grasping, pushing, jumping, swinging, usually without equipment, though if there is a horizontal bar handy, they will haul themselves up it – that’s a muscle-up – or do a barspin. Basically, anything you’d see a delinquent nine-year-old trying to do in a playground, you should now try yourself. Urban callisthenics is the same, except you have to wear a bandana and be rude to people. It’s just, well, it’s just preposterously hard. This isn’t like an exercise reboot; these people are like an improved species. “It looks really cool,” Fry concedes. “I always pretend I’m promoting my coach when I post on social media, but really it’s just because I think I look so strong.” Wait, what? What coach? “I have a coach in Australia who programmes for me. I send him videos of what I’m doing, and he gives me a view on it.” For the slightly less hardcore millennial, they join an online community – Kayla Itsines’ is the big one. They post pictures of their progress, and if they make it on to her noticeboard, they have a huge rejoicing ceremony. “We’re looking for health hacks. We’re looking to increase output. We’re trying to be athletes. It helps with the existential sense of purpose.” I want to be Fry. I like her staccato delivery and fearless grunting. But this stuff is not for wimps. I cannot touch anything with my chin, except for my own neck. Next, millennials maximise their recovery with 20 minutes in a 90C sauna, 10 minutes in a cold shower, 20 more minutes in the sauna. They sync their indoor bikes with an international online community, then race people in India. They are mad for Pilates. They have nutrition coaches, too. They self-actualise through fitness goals. It dawns on me that they’re actually preparing for life post-apocalypse. I would never say that to their faces. Just from a huge distance, and then run away. This week I learned Fitness is a feminist thing, now. Or, rather, not wanting to be fit enough to pull a car is unfeminist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"science/across-the-universe/2017/oct/16/mondays-gravitational-wave-observation-is-astronomical-alchemy","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T14:00:11Z","webTitle":"Monday's gravitational wave observation is astronomical alchemy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2017/oct/16/mondays-gravitational-wave-observation-is-astronomical-alchemy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/across-the-universe/2017/oct/16/mondays-gravitational-wave-observation-is-astronomical-alchemy","fields":{"headline":"Monday's gravitational wave observation is astronomical alchemy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you are wearing a piece of gold jewellery, take a good, hard look at it and consider this: you are likely to be wearing the celestial debris of a cataclysmic stellar collision, a collision so devastating that it literally shook the universe. That’s the conclusion from Monday’s announcement of gravitational wave signal GW170817. It is another reminder that we are intimately connected to the cosmos around us. At heart, astronomy is not really about remote and abstracted realms, instead it informs us about our own origins and the origins of those things we value. Astronomically, the origin of gold has been a puzzle for decades. The recognition that stars shine because they fuse one chemical element into another was made in the 1920s. It suggested that stars are the chemical factories that build almost everything in the chemist’s periodic table, but the details were elusive. Astronomers have since established that the simplest elements – hydrogen and helium – were made during the origin of the universe in the fireball of the big bang. The rest of the naturally occurring elements come in various quantities from dying, exploding or colliding stars. Monday’s announcement confirms research from 2013 that shows that a significant fraction of the gold and other heavy elements could come from the collision of two super-dense celestial objects known as neutron stars. The resulting explosion is known as a kilonova. A neutron star is the burned-out core of a once-giant star that exploded long ago. This particular pair was initially separated by 200 miles, but spiralled towards each other so rapidly that they met 100 seconds later. Situated about 130m light years from Earth, each neutron star was around 12 miles (19km) in diameter and contained a mass about half a million times that of the Earth. The final moments of their spiral and the actual collision itself generated the gravitational waves. These were detected at 1:41pm UK time on 17 August by two identical detectors in the US (Washington state and Louisiana), and a third detector in Pisa, Italy. It triggered a worldwide alert for other astronomers to try to find the event with traditional telescopes. At the time of the first gravitational wave detection in February 2016 there was talk about how this was the equivalent of a new sense for astronomers. Being ripples in the fabric of space, gravitational waves were said to be rather like the cosmological equivalent of sound. It would be like going from silent movies to talkies. This is now coming true because at almost the same time that the gravitational waves were discovered, Nasa’s Fermi observatory registered a short burst of gamma rays. Such short gamma ray bursts have been known about for years. Analysis suggested that they were the result of a collision between two neutron stars but clinching evidence has always eluded astronomers. Until now. The gravitational wave signal shows clearly that they were neutron stars not their larger cousins, black holes. Follow-up observations taken with ground-based telescopes captured the flash of the explosion and showed astronomers the chemical fingerprint of the atoms in the debris, including significant quantities of gold. This mixture of gravitational waves and traditional observations is the opening of the astronomical flood gates. Such coordinated observations are going to become the norm for astronomers. And as they do, expect more wonders and more links to be found between us and the wider cosmos.

Oh, and join Simon Burnton for Southampton-Newcastle, here and now! That was not a very good game at all, but the last ten minutes were delicious. Errors, fury, idiocy and violence - all the things that make the Premier League the best league in the world - were there in abundance, and at the end we got a result to infuriate both teams. Lovely stuff. So Everton move up to 15th and Brighton to 14th. Both will be vex. 90+4 min Holgate finds space down the left and dries a cross that finds Mirallas! But though he makes good contact - twice! - Ryan is there on both occasions to beat clear! 90+4 min In all the fuss, I neglected to note that Davies has come on - for whom I’m not sure. 90+3 min Mirallas is booked for pulling back Gross, thus ending a Brighton break. 90+3 min I hope Chris Hughton ties Bruno to a goalpost tomorrow morning, and has Dunk and Duffy practice finishing from three yards. 90+2 min Suttner humps one into the box, but Keane is there to head away. 90+1 min A game of football has broken out. 90 min There shall be a minimum of four added minutes. Ryan goes right, Rooney drills left, and the least reliable penalty taker in the world has saved Everton! Sigurdsson lifts in the free-kick and at the back post, Bruno elbows Calvert-Lewin. That is majestically brainless! He has a look, steadies himself, and then flings a forearm into neck for absolutely no reason! What a hero! Immense! He’s booked, but should’ve gone off really. Wayne Rooney readies himself to be saviour, if you ignore the last 87 minutes of nowt-doing. 88 min Everton break and Niasse scoots forward, so naturally Knockaert pulls him down; yellow card. 87 min Brighton are streaming forward now, Brown finding Inquierdo, taking the ball back, and shmicing a shot that Pickford beats over the top. The corner comes to nowt. 87 min Everton play Lyon on Thursday and Arsenal next weekend. Gulp. 86 min Oh, Everton. And spare a thought for Ronald Koeman, who has about 15 minutes to find someone not named Ronald Koeman to blame. 85 min Murray departs, replaced by Brown. 84 min On comes Mirallas - it was going to be for Rooney, but now it’s for Baines. I’m sure that’ll sort things. Bruno goes down the right and diddles Holgate, who sells himself, and clips back for Izquierdo. But though his contact, eight yards out, is solid, Keane blocks well yet again ... only the rebound falls into the path of Knockaert, who bangs home! A serious celebration follows, the kind of mass bundle that is why we all want to be footballers. 82 min Suttner finds some space and flips a ball into the box ... Baines bundles into the Murray and sees it away. Brighton claim a penalty, but this time the ref’s call not to award one is fair. 79 min Both sides are looking for a winner here, and Rooney finds Schneiderlin, who crosses. The ball is half-cleared, but only as far as Sigurdsson ... who can’t get to the ball because Gorss is pulling him back. That’s suuuuuch a penalty, and Michael Oliver is looking right at it too, but for reasons known best to himself he doesn’t bother awarding one. 78 min Izquierdo has livened things up a bit. 76 min Brighton win a corner down the right and when the ball finds its way back to Knockeart, he crosses again to the back post. Dunk then heads towards the front and Knockaert, who’s continued his run, opens his body and from a narrow angle thuds a left-footer goalwards, only for Keane to block superbly. 74 min Rooney finds space on the right and crosses well, Calvert-Lewin taking it down well at the back post. But as the ball drops he’s got to swivel and shoot, doing both well, only he can’t impart the power necessary to seriously trouble Ryan. Phil Neville reckons he should’ve scored; Danel Harris reckons he did well with what he had. 74 min Duffy can’t continue, so Huenemeier replaces him, and at the same time, Izquierdo comes on for March. 73 min Everton fans are singing this. Swings and roundabouts. 72 min Duffy is down with what looks like a groin situation. 71 min Brighton flow forward through Kncokaert, Propper and Murray, but Murray then seeks Gross inside the box and can only find Jagielka. 71 min Everton are the opposite of good. 69 min Niasse replaces Gueye, so Sigurdsson goes into midfield - with Rooney I think - and Niasse is up front. 68 min Sigurdsson takes it - search me - and curls wide of the near post. 67 min Baines thrashes an up-and-under, which Dunk leaves. Suddenly Rooney is in behind him, though 40 yards out, quite what he’s going to do about it is not easy to fathom. Dunk pulls him down though, giving Sigurdsson the chance to stick one in the box, and in the repechage that follows, Murray fouls Holgate 25 yards out, right of centre. Sigurdsson and Baines are behind it... 65 min March wins another corner down the left and Rooney and Jagielka stand off Duffy and Dunk. Gross directs his kick towards the former who clambers all over his man at the back post, but can only nod down and wide. 63 min Keane pulls a jersey, giving March a chance to curl in a free-kick from the left. It’s headed clear, but March, now on the edge of the box, slides a clever ball towards Knockaert, left side. It wins his side a corner, which comes to nothing. 62 min Lovely touch from Rooney, laying off for Vlasic ... but Stephens slides in with a proper teeth-rattler, and Brighton build again. 61 min I know Brighton’s devastating attacking prowess forced Ronald Koeman to pick Schneiderlin and Gueye, but the pairing isn’t working. 59 min Brighton have been quiet this last bit, but then Gross feeds March. His cross, though, is too close to Pickford. 57 min Nice from Everton, who’re coming. Calvert-Lewin moves the ball infield, Sigurdsson sends it onto Vlasic, and he does very well to turn Suttner, who’s too close, with a flick. But as he swivels into the shot he slips, and naturally remonstrates with the grass. How very dare it! 55 min Gueye allows the ball to run a roll longer than Propper expected and moves it away into space, so Propper carries on anyway and autographs foot with studs. Yellow card reckons Michael Oliver - a generous interpretation of the offence. 53 min nice from Everton, Holgate skating forward and finding Vlasic, whose backheel meets his stride into the box. March is between him and goal, so he chops the ball behind his standing foot, sending March somewhere off towards Plymouth, and smashes a shot which Ryan beats out. 52 min Stephens flattens Gueye, who wanted too long to control a loose pass. The ref gives a foul, but the passage is a telling one nonetheless. 51 min Lovely from Gross, pulling left and turning a square pass into the box, perfect to meet Murray’s stride. His first touch would constitute a crime in some countries. 50 min Brighton are still pushing the pace, such that is is. 49 min Everton are dustbins, drains, gutters and sewers. 48 min Vlasic puts Sigurdsson in space down the right, and his cross isn’t bad, but Duffy slides in decisively to intercept. 46 min Yes, we’re already onto kids’ telly, which tells you everything you need to know. “Ah, Newsround... Never counted towards my daily TV allowance as a kid,” emails Adam Forbes. “Grange Hill of course was forbidden. Quite right too.” My parents used to quite like Grange Hill. I remember Jeremy drowning the same evening that Ian Rush scored four at Villa. A sad day in the Harris household. 46 min We go again. The players are back with us. Wayne Rooney is having a quick with Ashley Williams. Ahem. Here’s Paul Wilson on Tom Davies, who isn’t playing on account of being quite good at football. A scoreline speaks a thousand expletives. 45+1 min If Uri Geller’s reading, please use your frankly divine powers to shove the clocks forward. Toda rabah achi. תודה רבה. 45 min There’ll be one added minute. 43 min It’s been a fair while since Everton did anything going forward. Weird, when you consider they sold a striker they knew would score 25 goals a season, and replaced him with a striker who quite fancied moving to his favourite team. 42 min BREAKING NEWS: Everton are whack, pants, bobbins and nonsense. 41 min Murray flicks the ball out to March, who bends in another ball, cleared to Stephens arriving at the edge. He thrashes to who knows where, but Everton can’t get out at the moment. 39 min Now Propper tries a raking pass, drilling from centre to right seeking Bruno. It’s too strong, but nevertheless reflects how things are going. 38 min Stephens tries to spread wide for March, but Keane does just enough to intercept. Everton are second best in midfield at the moment. 37 min Brighton are climbing into this game now, and they’re getting March running at Holgate wherever possible. If they’re prepared to gamble with more men in the box, they might just be onto something. 35 min Gross goes down the right and crosses deep for Murray, just over Keane’s head. But the chest down is too strong, and subsequent dive too bait. 34 min Looking at that potential handball again, Keane did indeed forearm the ball away, but it clipped his thigh first, so the ref probably made the correct call. Great defending. 31 min A mistake from Gueye allows March to cross, and Brighton haver a corner ... it goes short, but to the edge, is clipped in, laid back, and Knockaet thunders a low shot that someone blocks ... the ball breaks to Duffy, right of centre and with Pickford nowhere ... he smacks a with his laces towards goal, but Keane blocks - with his hands on first look, Stephane Henchoz-style, but no one seems too fussed. 30 min Rooney is chugging about and stuff, but Everton really don’t look very dangerous. It might be anathema to a sophisticate like Ronald, but maybe if they went 4-4-2, Calvert-Lewin could test Dunk and Duffy. 28 min Keane brings the ball out of defence and finds Vlasic then carries on running, accepting the one-two close to the right touchline before whamming a cross over the bar. I wish Newsround was on. 26 min “True, play boldly and without fear,” retorts Gary Naylor. “But that was the Martinez approach (especially with John Stones) - how did that work out?” Better than tedious football and fourth-bottom? I’m not saying experience isn’t important, but there are positions on the pitch where you can get away with playing kids, and Davies plays in one of them. 25 min Everton win another free-kick, this time just right of centre, but further out. Again, Sigurdsson’s delivery is decent, but the ball comes to Calvert-Lewin faster than he was expecting and glances off his brow and wide. 23 min “Sorry Daniel,” begins Geoff, “but gulls aren’t sea birds. They do like to live near the sea and to eat fish, but equally to spend all day at landfill sites eating whatever or divebombing people eating chips. Seabirds live at sea.” The list of things more interesting than this game is long and multifarious. 21 min Phil Neville reckons no one in the Premier League has better delivery than Gylfi Sigurdsson. I wonder if he’s familiar with the work of De Bruyne, K. 19 min A shot! This is nice from Everton, Rooney transferring the ball short and into Sigurdsson, who lays off immediately for Gueye, meeting his stride. From 20 yards, he drills a right-footer headed low towards the far corner, but Ryan dives sharply to shove around the post. The corner comes to nowt. 18 min Sigurdsson into Rooney, who spreads wide for Baines. His cross isn’t bad, but just close enough to Suttner for an extended leg to divert it back out of the box. 16 min “Re Davies, younger players make more mistakes, so I see why 3 in an XI is 1 too many,” tweets Gary Naylor. “But Everton really need his quick tempo.” If things aren’t working, which they aren’t, just pick your best, most balanced team and worry about age later. And maybe young players do make more mistakes - maybe - but they’re also less scared. 14 min Calvert-Lewin finds Rooney, so Duffy slides in and concedes the foul, 25 yards out and just left of centre. This time, Sigurdsson’s delivery is decent, forcing Matt Ryan to barrel into everything - he takes a bit of Jagielka and absolutely clatters seven shades out of Duffy, who has a little rest on the ground. 13 min Murray galumphs forward and for a second Brighton look to have space, but Schneiderlin slides in quickly and hard. 12 min Dunk sashays forward with the ball but panics 25 yards out and Everton regain possession. Naturally, they pass it slowly and sideways to little avail. 9 min Knockaert finds himself in space in centrefield, but Gross sells Bruno short and Calvert-Lewin storms through him to break, finding Rooney. He then slides a pass into the path of Sigurdsson, but Dunk immediately flings all of himself directly at the first-time dig. 7 min Everton enjoy possession around the Brighton box, pinning the home team back. Holgate and Vlasic are stretching play down the right, and the former zoom a cross over, too strong for Rooney, but the pressure continues. 5 min Keane finds Holgate, who looks a player, and he nips a pass into Rooney., dropping off. Eventually the ball goes wide to Vlasic, and he crosses into the nearest available shins. 4 min There’s a pretty decent racket bouncing around the Amex, and Brighton are sticking the ball into the Everton half whenever possible, though not with very much menace for now. 2 min “I too am unimpressed by Tom Davies’ absence,” emails Kevin Wilson. “England are likely to go to Russia with Livermore or Delph in their squad. England don’t have many options in central midfield. If you get regular football, you’ve basically got a chance.” Yep - and given midfield is England’s weakest area, someone able to get about the pitch, who might develop into a mainstay, would be pretty useful. 1 min From kick-off, Everton aim a punt towards Calvert-Leiwn and Bruno can’t resist fouling him. Free-kick, dangerous position ... and Sigurdsson, very deliberately, curls it at the nearest defender. The dye is cast. 1 min We’re off! Everton’s blue kit clashes with Brighton’s blue kit, so they’re playing in their change kit which is blue. The players are out and shaking hands. The integrity is mindblowing. Incidentally, this game is happening now because it suits Star Sports in India. Interviewed by a different television station, Koeman says that his team need to be more aggressive. He’s not wrong. Ronaldo Koeman looks like he’s kipping in the car. He says that Everton need experience, but it’s hard not to look at their team and see the younger players as its strongest elements. The problem for Brighton this season will be scoring goals ... keep reading for more insight. But the thing is, some likely strugglers have regular strikers, whereas Chris Hughton keep rotating his options, looking for the best fit for the particular opponent. That requires him getting things right, as well as players playing well - possible, of course, but with greater margin for error. Anyone got any idea that at which Ronald Koeman is playing? Surely his team needs Tom Davies’ energy and enterprise, while Wayne Rooney is definitely five years past playing up front on his bill. I suppose Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be trying to help the old man out, showing him how to work the telly and such, but it’s not a recipe for a successful football team. Anyway back to those teams, both of which show three changes from the last time they played, seventeen months ago. Suttner, Knockaert and Murray come in for Brighton, replacing Bong, Izquierdo, Brown and my pre-prepared buckets and hot knives gag; Everton omit Williams, Martina and Niasse, in favour of Holgate, Jagielka and Rooney. Aw! Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (a showman’s 4-4-1-1): Ryan; Bruno, Dunk, Duffy, Suttner; Knockaert, Stephens, Propper, March; Gross; Murray. Subs: Krul; Bong, Huenemeier, Izquierdo; Schelotto; Brown; Molumby. Everton (4-2-3-Rooney!): Pickford; Holgate, Jagielka, Keane, Baines; Schneiderlin, Gueye; Vlasic, Sigurdsson, Calvert-Lewin; Rooney. Subs: Stekelenburg, Williams, Mirallas, Martina, Niasse, Klaassen, Davies. Michael Oliver: Michael Oliver. Did you know that there is no such thing as a seagull? You probably did, but in case not: there are simply various species of gull, which are seabirds. Amazing, yeah? Anyway, it’s a bit early for Chekhov, even for your super soaraway Guardian, except there’s no such thing a toffeeman either, so maybe game is simply a figment of our collective imagination – it’s not even on telly or nuffink. Given the likely quality of any prospective encounter, let’s hope so.

But first: Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump giving an address in a hangar. This week, he explains, he’s been reversing everything Obama did: Obamacare, the nuclear deal with Iran … and ‘We’re ripping out all of the vegetables in Michelle Obama’s garden and planting McNuggets.’ There’s something less funny about Baldwin’s performance than, say a year ago, and that thing is that now Trump is the president. Sad! Nanjiani comes out in a chic grey suit. Hosting is a big deal, he says. As a kid, “My whole family in Pakistan would get together on Saturday night and watch Star Trek“ – since SNL wasn’t available. His monologue on racism is nimble and acute. Many online reviews for his recent film, The Big Sick, were racist, he explains. One complained of “race-mixing”. “First of all, nobody good ever uses the phrase ‘race-mixing.’ Even if someone said, ‘I’m pro race-mixing,’ I’d be like … are you an undercover KKK dragon?” His real gripe with racists, he concludes, is their ignorance. If a racist person tells him to “Go back to Pakistan, which was part of India until 1947, and is now home to the world’s largest salt mine, then I’d be like: ‘That guy seems to know what he’s talking about, I’ll pack my bags.’” Next is a game show sketch, Bank Breakers, that is so dull and unfunny it doesn’t feel worth writing about except to say: it existed. There follows an Anderson Cooper–It mashup. Alex Moffat is Cooper, who ventures out on a dark night in a jaunty yellow rain slicker and finds Kellyanne Conway, played by Kate McKinnon, in the sewer. She wants him to put her back on TV, to spread her alternative facts. “Puerto Rico actually was worse before Hurricane Maria and the hurricane did blow some buildings back together.” Then she turns into Hillary Clinton, lures Cooper into the sewer and bites his arm off. Another low-concept sketch: most of the ensemble in Halloween costumes, playing coworkers at an office party who learn their boss has tainted the cake with Hepatitis A. It’s another dud, even though Nanjiani is dressed as Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy. Last week, the show was slammed in the press for ignoring the Weinstein story. Now, it begins to make up for it. Aidy Bryant plays a moderator at the New York Film Festival, leading a “Women’s Round Table” with Viola Davis (Leslie Jones), Marion Cotillard (Cecily Strong) and Kate McKinnon as an ancient, fictional actress called Debette Goldry. Jones and Strong are the straight women, really, setting up McKinnon. On the subject of whisper networks, McKinnon explains: “We had a secret code among us actresses to warn each other about creeps. The code was: ‘He raped me.’ And if the men were listening, they tuned us right out.” Pink comes out and sings What About Us, wearing a long tweed coat which is a little bit Oliver! But she crushes it, like the veteran she is. Weekend Update also hits Weinstein. “It’s so easy to make jokes about a guy who looks like this,” Michael Che says, pointing to a photo. “He looks like chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair.” Weinstein claims he has made a mistake, Che continues, but Weinstein’s actions were not a mistake. “You assaulted dozens of women. That’s not a mistake, that’s a full season of Law &amp; Order.” Colin Jost talks about the president’s week of ridiculous things. The executive order undercutting healthcare “…brings the number of things Trump has destabilized up to … all of them.” Strong joins as Ivana Trump, wearing a red power suit and binging on Ferrero Rocher. Nanjiani is back next, playing opposite Mikey Day in a gentle sketch in which Nanjiani is a slightly irritating hotel receptionist and Day is a guest staying courtesy the American government, having been rescued from North Korea. It’s a hilarious set up! It’s not really hilarious at all! Nanjiani is a little bit wasted here. He’s less wasted in the next sketch, where he’s the doctor in a nursing home, talking to Mikey Day and Heidi Gardner, who are visiting their promiscuous grandmother, who is played by a silent but expressive McKinnon. “How did this happen?” the distraught grandchildren ask. “We think sex,” Nanjiani replies, while McKinnon grimaces in an easy chair. Pink comes out again to sing Beautiful Trauma. She’s wearing a metallic pink puffa vest over a dress that seems to be made out of a Thai flag and an old plaid blanket. I know, it doesn’t make sense, but that’s what she’s wearing. They save the best sketch for last: Nanjiani plays a Pakistani call center worker dealing with American customers and bullied by his colleagues. Strong plays noted anti-bullying campaigner Melania Trump. They’re brought together by her online shopping addiction and he becomes her “confidante, dream journal, and one true friend”. Their friendship culminates in Melania paying a visit to the call center and shouting at the bullies. “I should go before they find out that I’m not asleep,” she says, wistfully. The camera cuts to a maid discovering her bed stuffed with handbags. It’s a surreal conclusion: fitting for a surreal week in America."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/15/man-dies-incident-stable-yard-kempton-racecourse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T09:47:35Z","webTitle":"Racing grieves after groom fatally injured in incident at Kempton stables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/15/man-dies-incident-stable-yard-kempton-racecourse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/15/man-dies-incident-stable-yard-kempton-racecourse","fields":{"headline":"Racing grieves after groom fatally injured in incident at Kempton stables","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The dangers of working with racehorses were underlined by the leader of the stable staff union following the death of Ken Dooley at Kempton Park on Saturday night. Dooley, who had spent decades in racing and was in his 50s, is believed to have been kicked while working in the stable area and collapsed shortly afterwards. “You’re dealing with half a tonne of combustible beast,” said George McGrath, the National Association of Stable Staff chief executive, when reflecting on the tragedy on Sunday. “I don’t think people realise how dangerous it is, or how skilful the staff are to keep these horses under control. “The public see horses crossing roads in Newmarket or Lambourn or Malton, looking quiet and sedate, but the level of skill needed to make them look like that is completely underappreciated. It’s a tribute to their talent that people assume they’re easily manageable. “You could compare it to driving a car, which has its own dangers. But now imagine you’re in a Formula One car. If Joe Bloggs gets in a Formula One car, he’d crash in 100 yards. These horses are bred and trained to be supremely motivated and they are unpredictable.” Amanda Perrett, the Sussex-based trainer, was Dooley’s employer for the last seven years and spoke of her sadness at losing “a friend and colleague”. She said: “Ken was a very special member of our family business. He was an excellent employee, very experienced with racehorses, having worked all of his life with them as a jockey, trainer and jockey coach around the world. He was always first into work in the morning, hugely enthusiastic and dedicated to his horses and a very much valued and integral member of our team.” The last two races at Kempton were abandoned as every member of medical staff rushed to the racecourse stables to help Dooley. Surrey police have begun an investigation, describing his death as “unexplained”. Martin Dwyer, one of the jockeys riding at Kempton on Saturday, spoke of the “sombre mood” that followed news of the incident. “It highlights what a dangerous sport this is,” he said, “and makes you think of the stupid things we worry about: making the weight, will I ride this horse or that. Then something like this happens and the whole industry takes a breath. “Unfortunately horses do kick out and I believe that’s what happened. They have metal shoes on and, if you get a kick from a horse, it can be very serious. Horses don’t mean to do it. If they feel frightened or threatened, if they feel someone is too close or something, they do kick out but fortunately it is very rare.” Black armbands were worn by staff and jockeys at Sunday’s race meetings at Chepstow and Goodwood and a minute’s silence was observed. A spokesman for the Racecourse Association said: “Racecourses do everything they can to provide a safe working environment in all areas and are equipped to provide the highest level of medical care and attention whenever it is required. “This tragic accident is a reminder of the dangerous nature of the work stable staff do, day in, day out, and our thoughts are very much with everybody affected at this difficult time.” The National Trainers Federation also expressed its sadness and added: “Mercifully, fatal accidents in the course of caring for racehorses in Britain are rare and we acknowledge and salute the commitment of stable employees across the country who devote their working lives to their horses.” Tizzard hesitating to aim high with Finian’s Oscar Finian’s Oscar lost his confidence after slipping on the approach to an early fence on Saturday, his trainer, Colin Tizzard, said on Sunday, reflecting on the star youngster’s unconvincing round of jumping here the day before. Tizzard has changed his mind about the likely venue for the horse’s next run and is now inclined not to go to Cheltenham this month. “He’s fine, he trotted out fine this morning,” Tizzard said between races. “Bryan Cooper said he slid into the third and frightened himself a little bit, so he sat up on him.” That explains why Cooper allowed Finian’s Oscar to be so far behind the leaders by halfway on the horse’s first run over fences, which he eventually won by 11 lengths. “The race fell apart didn’t it?” Tizzard said. “He was quite a way back, we were all thinking, you need to be a bit closer, really. But he moved up quite quickly, easily. Then obviously the grey [Alcala] fell on the bend and the other one was knackered. It was a matter of just hacking home.” While Finian’s Oscar fiddled his way over a few fences, Tizzard was encouraged by how he responded on the run-in when Cooper decided to test him. “Bryan said: ’After I jumped the last, I thought, I’ll just see what there is under the saddle.’ You watch it again, he squeezes him and for five strides he was gone.” Cooper found himself having to restrain the horse just seconds after asking for an effort. Tizzard said: “I did say we’d aim him at Cheltenham next but I think we’ll find somewhere else for him. We might even go small again.” Five players from the Cheltenham Town side that lost to Port Vale on Saturday found some consolation when they came here to cheer Poetic Rhythm, a battling winner of the Persian War Novice Hurdle. Harry Pell, Danny Wright, Brian Graham, Aaron Downes and Kevin Dawson were all present and in high spirits in the winner’s enclosure. All have been following horses since meeting Chris Coley, who manages the Yes No Wait Sorries syndicate, in April at a charity match to raise money for the Injured Jockeys Fund. “This is better than scoring a goal, they tell me,” Coley said. “Of course, they don’t score many ... ” Chris Cook’s tips for Monday Yarmouth 1.40 Fakhoor 2.10 Willie John (nap) 2.40 Progressive Jazz 3.10 Aljezeera 3.40 Four Kingdoms 4.10 Kulgri 4.40 Chiswick Bey (nb) 5.10 Tawfeer 5.40 Lunar Deity Musselburgh 1.50 Eva Docc 2.20 Mister Showman 2.50 Big Tour 3.20 Alpha Delphini 3.50 One Boy 4.20 Gabrial The Tiger 4.55 Sexy Legs 5.25 Tawseef Windsor 2.00 La Belle Mayson 2.30 Garrick 3.00 Convinced 3.30 Sandy Shores 4.00 Zeelander 4.30 Abiento 5.00 Dash Of Spice 5.30 Ciaoadiosimdone"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/15/australias-household-power-prices-rose-63-in-past-decade-says-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Australia's household power prices rose 63% in past decade, says watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/15/australias-household-power-prices-rose-63-in-past-decade-says-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/15/australias-household-power-prices-rose-63-in-past-decade-says-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Australia's household power prices rose 63% in past decade, says watchdog","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Residential electricity prices have increased by 63% on top of inflation over the past decade, according to Australia’s competition watchdog, mainly due to higher network costs, which comprise 48% of a household bill. An interim snapshot, to be released by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Monday ahead of the expected unveiling of the Turnbull government’s new energy policy this week, found there was a “severe electricity affordability problem across the national electricity market, and the price increases over the past 10 years are putting Australian businesses and consumers under unacceptable pressure”. It noted that “large increases in electricity prices have not been matched by price increases in other areas of the economy, nor in wage growth” and it said the burden of higher electricity prices “disproportionally affects those segments of society least able to afford it”. The report pointed to the 63% increase over the past 10 years, and it broke down the components of a residential power bill of $1,524. It said 48% of that bill was network costs, 22% wholesale costs, 16% retail and other costs, and 8% retail margins. Green schemes, which have been the focus of most public attention in recent times, made up only 7%. In an effort to identify the underlying factors driving increases in power prices, the ACCC pointed predominantly to a lack of competition, with the power-generation market highly concentrated, and with substantial levels of vertical integration between generation and retailing. It said the big power generators – AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia – continued to hold large retail market shares in most regions, and control in excess of 60% of generation capacity in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria “making it difficult for smaller retailers to compete”. It said the current lack of competition in the market raises “real concerns”, because the national electricity market was predicated on competitive markets. It said electricity network operators had been able to overinvest in poles and wires as a result of the suboptimal network regulation framework, and that behaviour would continue to burden consumers “for decades to come”. While pointing the finger squarely at anti-competitive market behaviour by power companies as the principle driver of higher power prices, the ACCC also noted there was uncertainty in Australia’s electricity sector, with a trend of “insufficient investment”. The competition watchdog noted that ageing coal assets leaving the system were not being replaced by sufficient new capacity. It said 5,000 MW of generation capacity had left the national electricity market in the last five years. An additional 2,000 MW had come on stream, with 92% of that renewable generation – leaving a net decline in capacity of more than 3000 MW. Prior to 2016–17, all regions in the national electricity market had a surplus of electricity generation capacity, but the supply/demand balance had shifted because of reduction in generation capacity, with old coal plants leaving the system, and an uptick in demand. Australia’s energy sector and many business groups argue that policy uncertainty caused by a decade of toxic political debate on climate and energy policy is one of the factors driving up power prices, because the lack of settled policy makes it difficult to make future investment decisions. While the ACCC pointed the finger back at the anti-competitive market behaviour of generators and retailers currently making the complaints about the destructive impact of policy uncertainty, it does accept some of the uncertainty argument. It noted the Turnbull government’s as-yet unresolved position on the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist Alan Finkel. The ACCC also pointed to the fact the Australian Energy Market Operator had reported power generation proposals comprising 23,000 MW “which suggests additional capacity is ready to be developed given the right conditions”. The report found that Queenslanders would be paying the most for their electricity this year, followed by South Australians and people living in NSW, while Victorians would have the lowest electricity bills. On the power price impact of green schemes, the ACCC noted that subsidies aimed at achieving sustainability objectives “have also increased costs and created cross-subsidies”. It noted that the costs of policies like the feed-in tariffs adopted by some states for solar photovoltaics have been “passed through to all electricity users.” “Some measures to improve environmental sustainability have been overly generous and poorly targeted, with outcomes that appear inequitable, the report said. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said ahead of the release of Monday’s report there was currently to much “ill-informed commentary about the drivers of Australia’s electricity affordability problem”. Sims warned there was no prospect of governments being able to land on a fix unless there was a clear understanding of the underlying issues. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said a final report from the ACCC, expected in coming months, would help to “further drive action from the Turnbull government in order to secure more affordable and reliable energy for Australian households and businesses”. “Ensuring we keep the lights on and that the prices Australian families pay for energy are affordable is central to the Turnbull government’s approach to energy policy.” The government is expected to put its new energy policy to cabinet and the Coalition party room this week, after spending the past few weeks playing down expectations it will adopt the clean energy target modelled in the Finkel review. The clean energy target has been opposed from the outset by Tony Abbott and a small group of conservatives within the Coalition party room, including the Nationals MP George Christensen, who has said several times he won’t vote for it. The government’s policy is expected to include comprehensively overhauling the national electricity market rules to ensure more dispatachable energy is made available to the market to make the system more reliable, and it is also understood to include measures to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Labor warned the government on Sunday not to ditch Finkel’s clean energy target. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the loss of the clean energy target meant there was little prospect of bipartisan agreement on energy policy between the major parties. Butler declared if the prime minister dumped the clean energy target, “then he won’t get the support of the Labor party”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/15/dumping-clean-energy-target-is-dealbreaker-for-labors-support-on-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T00:57:22Z","webTitle":"Dumping clean energy target is 'dealbreaker' for Labor's support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/15/dumping-clean-energy-target-is-dealbreaker-for-labors-support-on-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/15/dumping-clean-energy-target-is-dealbreaker-for-labors-support-on-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Dumping clean energy target is 'dealbreaker' for Labor's support","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The shadow climate change minister Mark Butler says Labor won’t support the Turnbull government’s new energy policy if it dumps the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. With the Turnbull government expected to press ahead with its new energy policy this week after consideration by the cabinet and the party room, Butler issued a clear public warning on Sunday that the loss of the clean energy target meant there was no prospect of bipartisan agreement between the major parties. Butler said Labor had been prepared to keep an open mind on the clean energy target, even though it was not the opposition’s preferred policy option, because the model had been thought through by the chief scientist and endorsed uniformly by stakeholders across the community. “So what we’re very worried about and what people in the community who care deeply about the energy crisis are worried about is the increasing likelihood that Malcolm Turnbull is walking away from the clean energy target under pressure from Tony Abbott,” Butler told the ABC on Sunday. Butler declared if the prime minister dumped the clean energy target, “then he won’t get the support of the Labor party”. Asked again whether dropping the clean energy target was a dealbreaker for the ALP, Butler replied: “Of course.” The government has spent the last month or so signalling it won’t adopt the clean energy target modelled in the Finkel review, and last week queried whether renewable energy required subsidies now the technologies were becoming cost-competitive with coal and gas. The clean energy target has been opposed from the outset by Abbott and a small group of conservatives within the Coalition party room, including the Nationals MP George Christensen, who has said several times he won’t vote for it. As well as ideological opposition from some quarters of the party, some government MPs have also been concerned that their main political pressure point from the voters is rising prices and network reliability. Despite the arguments in the Finkel review that a clean energy target would lower electricity prices compared with business as usual, some Liberals equate subsidies for renewables with higher power price increases. As well as comprehensively overhauling the national electricity market rules to ensure more dispatachable energy is made available to the market, the government’s new energy policy is also understood to include measures to lower greenhouse gas emissions. On the rule changes, the Australian Energy Market Operator has asked the government to adopt a day ahead market – where the market operator identifies the energy demand for the next day, hour-by-hour, then generators bid in via reverse auctions to supply the market – as a clear market signal to bring more dispatchable power into the grid. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has also said a number of times the government intends to remain within the Paris international climate agreement, which involves an undertaking that Australia will reduce emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030. If the government dumps the clean energy target, it is possible they could set a new emissions-reduction trajectory, and use the architecture of the existing Direct Action policy, including more funding to the existing Emissions Reduction Fund and adjusting the existing safeguard mechanism, to encourage abatement. The government has also flagged the use of international permits through its review of the Direct Action policy. It is understood Labor is prepared to look at an alternative plan for abatement if the government produces one this week, but the opposition isn’t prepared to support an alternative to the clean energy target unless it is a serious policy mechanism dealing with the problem of carbon risk. Going in to what will be a critical political fortnight, Labor is increasingly of the view that the government, with its new energy policy, cannot successfully balance Abbott’s demands and the opposition’s demands. The government began the process of laying the ground for its new energy policy almost 12 months ago by signalling it might adopt an emissions intensity trading scheme for electricity, then dumping that, then subsequently setting up the Finkel review, which proposed the clean energy target, which the government is now backing away from. The recommendations of the Finkel review have support across the board – from the energy sector, from business groups, from environmentalists and state governments – and it was hoped the clean energy target could be a policy that Labor, federally, could support. Bipartisanship is particularly important in energy policy because it stabilises the investment framework and removes carbon risk, so energy companies know which assets to invest in, and financial institutions know which technology will be viable over the long term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/14/george-groves-beats-jamie-cox-prepare-eubank-fight","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T22:20:53Z","webTitle":"George Groves beats Jamie Cox in four and prepares for Eubank fight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/14/george-groves-beats-jamie-cox-prepare-eubank-fight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/14/george-groves-beats-jamie-cox-prepare-eubank-fight","fields":{"headline":"George Groves beats Jamie Cox in four and prepares for Eubank fight","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"George Groves has had plenty of tough nights in his career but the world WBA super-middleweight champion showed what a consummate operator he has become when he rode out the intense challenge of Jamie Cox for a fourth-round stoppage as impressive as any of his 26 victories. It was a near-perfect preparation for the semi-final of the World Boxing Super Series against Chris Eubank Jr, in January or February, probably at Craven Cottage – which should test the midwinter hardiness of boxing fans, as well as the fighters. It will almost certainly be an early contender for fight of the year. “I made a mistake and he made me pay,” a disconsolate Cox said on the ring apron. “I didn’t want an easy fight,” Groves said. And Cox was not there to give him one. For weeks, word had circulated that Cox, the smaller man, was knocking out sparring partners as big as light-heavyweight (confirmed ringside by Nigel Benn’s son, Conor, who has seen the Swindon fighter work out), and the southpaw had his big left cocked like a pistol from the start. Cox, who won Commonwealth gold in 2006 and has had his problems away from the ring in a stop-start career, burst into action with a flurry of headshots that had Groves sucking the air with his back to the ropes. Cox shipped a few near the bell, but was still buzzing. A thumping Cox left hook steadied the champion at the start of the third and, as he grinned to his corner over Groves’s shoulder, he seemed primed for the fight of his life. The battle-hardened Londoner kept his shape, though, and edged the round. While a fight in the crowd rumbled in the background, the paid combatants continued to provide the quality entertainment and some of the miscreants no doubt missed the conclusion. Groves buried a wicked right deep into Cox’s unprotected ribs over the top of a wild oncoming right hand and, try as he might, the challenger could not beat the count at one minute and 42 seconds of the fourth round. The first time Groves fought at this venue, six years ago on the undercard of Ricky Burns’s successful world title defence against Michael Katsidis, he was taking care of business in two rounds against Paul Smith as the British and Commonwealth 12-stone champion. The finishing punch was as sweet as any he has thrown. Billy Joe Saunders was further down the bill, and James DeGale was hoping for a return with Groves after losing to him on points a few months earlier. How the landscape has shifted. While Groves would later lose twice to Carl Froch before winning the WBA belt, DeGale forged on to become IBF champion, but is recovering from shoulder surgery – Saunders is in a queue waiting for Gennady Golovkin and Saul Álvarez to settle their dispute in a rematch next year. Into this entertaining maelstrom steps Eubank. It is fair to say a fight between him and Groves is more intriguing – perhaps more commercially appealing – than Groves-DeGale. Eubank seems comfortable at super-middleweight (so a rematch with Saunders might not happen for a while), as his impressive knockout of the unbeaten but limited Turk Avni Yildirim in Stuttgart last weekend demonstrated. On an interesting undercard, the 38-year-old light-middleweight Kevin McCauley, who has lost 154 times, beat Jamie “Mr Excitement” Carley, eight years his junior, in a fill-in four-rounder before the main event. A step up from that in quality, John Ryder stopped the former world title challenger Patrick Nielsen with a right uppercut in the fifth round that the Dane never saw, preoccupied perhaps after the Londoner dislodged his mouthguard with a left hook good enough to finish any fight. The Eubank aura was not enough to protect the record of Chris’s other fighting son, Nathaniel “Banks” Wilson, who was stopped on his feet in the first round after the unheralded Camberley lightweight, Jonny Phillips, had floored him with a left hook. The loser protested to the referee, Howard Foster, to no avail. Earlier, Foster was involved in another controversy in the welterweight bout between Louis Adolphe and Nathan McIntosh. Four seconds from the end of the first round, the unbeaten Adolphe appeared to deck McIntosh after Foster had called for a break. The Nottingham boxer received oxygen in the ring as Adolphe celebrated – only to then be disqualified for a late blow. Never a dull moment in this game. Whyte to fight Helenius for WBC silver heavyweight title Dillian Whyte and Robert Helenius will meet for the WBC silver heavyweight title at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff on 28 October. Whyte is hoping victory over Helenius on the undercard of Anthony Joshua’s world-title fight with Kubrat Pulev can put him on the path towards a possible world-title fight of his own with WBC champion Deontay Wilder. “It’s been a very frustrating few months trying to get someone to fight me,” Whyte told Matchroom Boxing. “I thank Robert for stepping up and in two weeks’ time we will fight for the WBC silver title in Cardiff. “I love to fight and I’m looking forward to being back in the ring, getting the victory and moving on to challenge for the World Heavyweight title.” The 33-year-old Finn, known as ‘The Nordic Nightmare’, is delighted to have landed the fight and said: “This is a huge fight and I’m excited about fighting the winner of last December’s thriller between Whyte and (Dereck) Chisora.” “Chisora and I were scheduled to fight in May but he ran. To my understanding Dillian is not a runner and he will stand and fight. This is a big fight for the heavyweight division and may the best man win.” PA"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/15/donald-trump-values-voter-summit-conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"'We tried nice guys': conservative hardliners stay in a trance for Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/15/donald-trump-values-voter-summit-conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/15/donald-trump-values-voter-summit-conservatives","fields":{"headline":"'We tried nice guys': conservative hardliners stay in a trance for Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nearly a year ago, conservative Christians gambled on Donald Trump, a thrice-married Manhattan billionaire who bragged about sexual assault, ran casinos and used to support a woman’s right to abortion. The bet paid off. This weekend, Trump became the first sitting president to address the Values Voters Summit, a yearly Washington symposium that brings together social conservative leaders and voters seeking “to preserve the bedrock values of traditional marriage, religious liberty, sanctity of life and limited government that make our nation strong”. He duly touted his administration’s progress in “returning moral clarity to our view of the world”. “How times have changed,” Trump thundered across the cavernous Shoreham Hotel ballroom, lamenting the erosion of conservative values he said were the bedrock of America. “But you know what? Now they’re changing back again, just remember that.” The crowd rose. Two years ago, Trump was booed at the same conference. Before the Republican primaries, he finished a distant fifth in the summit’s straw poll. This year, he rattled off a list of promises to evangelical Christians he said he had kept, including pledges to appoint a “conservative” justice to the supreme court and to impose a new healthcare rule exempting employers whose religious beliefs conflict with the mandate that they provide coverage for birth control. “I didn’t have a schedule,” he said, “[but] if I did have a schedule, I would say we are substantially ahead of schedule.” His administration would “stop cold the attacks on Judeo-Christian values”, he said. Trump may be an unlikely favorite of the religious right but last November exit polls said he won 81% of white evangelicals – more than George W Bush, John McCain or Mitt Romney. Michele Bachmann, a former congresswoman from Minnesota and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, called Trump’s victory “proof positive of what the Lord did”. “He knows he is the president of United States today because evangelical Christians came out and supported him,” she said in her address. In hallways after Trump’s speech, attendees buzzed with excitement. “It’s like a cloud has lifted,” said Pat Flynn, who came with a group of women from Catholics for Freedom of Religion. “When Obama was in, everything was sad. Nothing was good. Now look – look at the smiling faces. Look at people getting jobs again.” She said she had a conversation with a nun earlier who wished Trump would speak – and tweet – less. But Flynn believed that his“gift of gab” and “wiseguy” bravado was exactly why he was elected. “We tried nice guys,” she said. “We had John McCain. Mitt Romney. They were nice, smiling at everybody, but they couldn’t beat out Hillary. Romney, I mean come on. The only thing people remember about him is that he tied a dog to his roof.” ‘Creepy little scribblers’ Inside the frigid ballroom, where clusters of stars were projected on to the walls and Christian ballads played in breaks between speeches, the mood darkened. Angry speakers lamented political correctness and derided media bias. Literature handed out in red totes included a flyer for a book, The Hazards Of Homosexuality. The “mainstreaming of homosexuality”, the flyer said, had created a “public health crisis affecting us all”. The bag also included a bumper sticker that read: “I don’t believe the liberal media.” In speeches, abortion was likened to genocide. The liberal “resistance” to Trump was compared to the Taliban. Journalists in attendance were called “creepy little scribblers”. Refugees were accused of spreading disease and terror. Speakers took turns denouncing NFL players, for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police violence, and Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul and liberal donor accused by dozens of women of harassment and sexual assault. “If there were more real men in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein probably would have had a couple of black eyes,” said Dana Loesch, a Dallas-based conservative radio host who has starred in controversial videos for the National Rifle Association. “That’s what happens in the real world ... when women are mistreated.” Loesch also declared that feminism was “dead as a doornail” and accused third-wave feminists of trying to replace the patriarchy with a matriarchy. Women, she said, “are not a good master”. Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager turned special counselor to the president, was introduced at the summit as “the woman who saved the world”. During a question and answer session with Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, she too raised the Weinstein allegations. “The juxtaposition of that,” she said, “is that I am in a place where women are respected.” No speaker mentioned accusations against Trump by more than a dozen women of sexual harassment and misconduct, all of which he has denied despite saying in a now infamous 2005 video that he could kiss and grab women without their consent. ‘These folks are coming for you’ And yet the loudest applause was reserved for attacks not on Democrats and the left but on the Republican establishment, setting the stage for an internecine war that could dramatically affect next year’s midterm elections. “Occasionally you come across one, you pull the trigger and it’s a dud,” said Mark Meadows, a North Carolina congressman who chairs the hardline House Freedom Caucus, talking about firing guns. “You have two choices: leave that in the chamber, pull the trigger again and again. Or you can eject it and put in another shell. “I would suggest we have some members who are duds that have been left in the chamber too long and it’s time that we eject them.” The next morning, Steve Bannon, once Trump’s campaign chair, then chief White House strategist, now back at Breitbart News, declared war on the Republican establishment, heralding a “populist, nationalist, conservative revolt” he said would sweep them from power. “Nobody can run and hide on this one, these folks are coming for you,” Bannon said, to sustained applause. Sally Boss, of Hudson, Florida, said she agreed with Bannon “100%”. “Donald Trump is one of the few politicians that is doing what he said he is going to do,” she said. “And he’s trying to do more if the Republican establishment would just get behind him. “Well, get behind him or get out of the way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/15/zinedine-zidane-stuttering-real-madrid-prepare-spurs","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T07:59:25Z","webTitle":"‘Tranquil’ Zinedine Zidane takes win as stuttering Real Madrid prepare for Spurs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/15/zinedine-zidane-stuttering-real-madrid-prepare-spurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/15/zinedine-zidane-stuttering-real-madrid-prepare-spurs","fields":{"headline":"‘Tranquil’ Zinedine Zidane takes win as stuttering Real Madrid prepare for Spurs","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“Should you be worried?,” Zinedine Zidane was asked. “No, I don’t think so,” he said. It was late Sunday night at the Santiago Bernabéu and Real Madrid’s third home game of the season had just ended, like the other two, without a win. In the final minute, a goal from Toni Sanabria had given Real Betis a 1-0 victory. Levante and Valencia, the previous visitors, had drawn. Five weeks in, Madrid had already dropped seven points, Barcelona slipping away early. “Maybe last year we won some games we didn’t deserve: now it’s the other way around,” Zidane said, simply. “That’s football: you have to accept it. It’s still very early, even if it is seven points.” In La Liga, where title winners have needed at least 90 points for each of the last seven years, dropping seven is significant and at Madrid defeat is never acceptable, even when it can be explained – and Zidane is, not unreasonably, focused on fortune. Publicly, at least. “Sometimes the ball doesn’t want to go in,” he said. “We had 26, 27 chances.” There was support from the Betis manager, Quique Setién, who admitted: “To win here, you know you’ll suffer and that your goalkeeper has to be spectacular: winning here without suffering is a utopia.” For Madrid, winning was a start: when they beat Espanyol 2-0 before the international break, Isco said: “It was about time we won at the Bernabéu.” Zidane was entitled to think that it shouldn’t have taken so long. Karim Benzema admitted he could have played all night and not scored against Valencia. When Levante came, it was Gareth Bale who had opportunities. Against Betis, the chances fell to Cristiano Ronaldo. None scored. Madrid had taken more shots than anyone else in La Liga, and by some way. In those three games alone, almost 80. These were matches they really should have won. Zidane talking about efficiency in front of goal. “Three goals at home isn’t many for us,” he said. Nor even could it be seen as a long-term problem. Thirty-five different teams from eight different countries had tried to stop them scoring and failed before Betis did it, 73 games later. If there was comfort in those statistics, Zidane himself knew that chance alone did not explain a damaging start. Ronaldo had been absent for five games, suspended; Luka Modric, Gareth Bale, Marcelo, and Benzema had all missed matches through injury. James Rodríguez and Álvaro Morata, top assist provider and second top scorer respectively last season, had departed. When Morata went to Chelsea in the summer, Zidane said he needed another striker. At that stage, he expected it to be Kylian Mbappé, but he joined Paris Saint-Germain instead. “I would have liked Morata to stay,” Zidane admitted. Yet the squad remained incredibly strong – Dani Ceballos, Theo Hernández and Marcos Llorente added young talent to it – and nor did absences alone explain the results. Yes, Madrid had been unfortunate to drop seven points; yes, the bench might have rescued them as it did often last year; yes, opportunities had been wasted, but Betis’s Setien rightly insisted his team could have caught Madrid sooner. And Zidane admitted after Levante: “I can’t be happy with how we played.” This Saturday he said he had been happy with how they performed at Getafe, but they had not impressed in clinching a late 2-1 victory, with Ronaldo’s first league goal of the season. In the last few weeks, when they have been winning, Madrid have not moved the ball as swiftly, nor pressed so high as at the close of last season or the beginning of this, when Gerard Piqué admitted that for the first time in nine years he felt inferior. Defensively, they have looked vulnerable. Up front, there is talent but the ideas are not yet fully formed. “We’re struggling to generate football,” Isco admitted. Since that Betis game, they convinced in Dortmund – and there is something about Madrid that is as if it takes a worthy stage for them to perform – but less so in defeating Alavés, Espanyol and Getafe. After a first half dominated by Madrid, Espanyol hit the post and then pushed them back as the second began; twice Pedraza hit their post at Alavés; against Getafe, there was a late chance for Mauro Arambarri at 1-1 and their winner never felt inevitable. “I’m very angry,” Getafe’s manager José Bordalás said. “We know they’re very good running into space so we worked on closing those. Madrid had trouble generating chances. I thought the only way they’d hurt us was inside and we made a change to prevent that ... but that’s where the goal came.” When it did, Zidane leapt from the bench celebrating. Afterwards, he said he would watch Atlético v Barcelona, which ended in a 1-1 draw, “as a football fan”. He would also have watched as a manager hoping to close the gap. Hoping, but not worrying. The private analysis is different, but the public persona remains. “I won’t ever change,” he has said. “There’s a word I like: ‘tranquillity’.” It defines him and has served him well. “I enjoy every day,” said a smiling Zidane on Friday as he prepared for Getafe and Tuesday’s Champions League visit from Tottenham, which will be his 101st game. So far, they have won 75 of them; defeat against Betis was only his eighth. He has won seven titles – one every 92 days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/14/cross-party-group-no-deal-theresa-may-brexit-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T15:03:19Z","webTitle":"MPs move to block Theresa May from signing ‘no deal’ Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/14/cross-party-group-no-deal-theresa-may-brexit-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/14/cross-party-group-no-deal-theresa-may-brexit-eu","fields":{"headline":"MPs move to block Theresa May from signing ‘no deal’ Brexit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A powerful cross-party group of MPs is drawing up plans that would make it impossible for Theresa May to allow Britain to crash out of the EU without a deal in 2019. The move comes amid new warnings that a “cliff-edge” Brexit would be catastrophic for the economy. One critical aim of the group – which includes the former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke and several Conservative ex-ministers, together with prominent Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green MPs – is to give parliament the ability to veto, or prevent by other legal means, a “bad deal” or “no deal” outcome. Concern over Brexit policy reached new heights this weekend after the prime minister told the House of Commons that her government was spending £250m on preparations for a possible “no deal” result because negotiations with Brussels had stalled. Several hundred amendments to the EU withdrawal bill include one tabled by the former cabinet minister Dominic Grieve and signed by nine other Tory MPs, together with members of all the other main parties, saying any final deal must be approved by an entirely separate act of parliament. If passed, this would give the majority of MPs who favour a soft Brexit the binding vote on the final outcome they have been seeking and therefore the ability to reject any “cliff-edge” option. A separate amendment tabled by Clarke and the former Labour minister Chris Leslie says Theresa May’s plan for a two-year transition period after Brexit – which she outlined in her recent Florence speech – should be written into the withdrawal bill, with an acceptance EU rules and law would continue to apply during that period. If such a transition was not agreed, the amendment says, exit from the EU should not be allowed to happen. With a sense of crisis engulfing the government and whips fearing a series of Conservative rebellions and defeats over the bill, ministers have been forced to postpone the committee stage of the legislation, which was due to start this week. Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP who has been part of the behind-the-scenes cross-party efforts to find ways to amend the bill, said: “There is now growing cross-party anger at the absurd suggestion that we could crash out of the EU without a deal, and without even the transitional period that was promised by the PM – let alone that the government is attempting at the same time to give itself sweeping new powers and undermine the devolution settlement. It is clear the prime minister and Brexit secretary now have a real crisis on their hands over this bill and face defeat on a series of issues.” Leslie said the MPs would continue work to find amendments around which soft-Brexit MPs of all parties could unite to prevent a disastrous outcome for the country. “In the remaining time before committee stage starts, conversations between MPs across the parties will help identify common ground – and enshrining the transition period into law is increasingly likely if we work together in this way. This bill could be the last chance for parliament to put safeguards in place; it’s too important to miss these opportunities.” Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the business community “wants a transition agreed in principle and trade talks under way by the end of 2017. If there is not that clarity we will start to see the activation of contingency plans and likely significant impact on business investment.” The 10 Democratic Unionist party MPs, upon whose votes May relies for a Commons majority, have made it clear to government whips that they would not accept a “no deal” outcome because it would mean a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If May were to try to push such an approach, the deal with the DUP that keeps her in power could fall. Yesterday, in a sign of growing desperation, it emerged that the Brexit secretary, David Davis, will travel to Brussels on Monday for unscheduled talks after the EU ruled that insufficient progress had been made for the two sides to begin future trade talks with Britain. A key plank of May’s Brexit policy has been her insistence that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. She has made it clear that at the end of negotiations MPs will have only two options: to accept whatever deal is on offer or to agree there will be no deal. Labour has also tabled a series of amendments that would bind the government to a transitional period, after Brexit day in March 2019, during which the UK in effect would remain inside the single market and customs union. The party’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, said: “No deal means the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland. No deal means no agreement on how we trade with Europe. No deal means EU nationals working in our schools and hospitals and the 1.2 million UK citizens living in the EU will continue to be unsure about their future. No deal means no deal on aviation, which quite literally means planes cannot take off and land. This is not scaremongering, it’s the grim reality.” Tory MPS who oppose a hard Brexit have declared they will not back any amendments tabled by Labour’s frontbench and bearing Jeremy Corbyn’s name, but say they would be prepared to line up with amendments from like-minded Labour backbenchers. The former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan, who has signed several amendments, said last night that the best way for ministers to avoid a defeat was to agree to give MPs a binding vote on the outcome, “whether or not there is a deal”. She added: “If they test this I think they will find there is a majority for an amendment and no majority for a ‘no deal’ outcome.” This weekend it is expected that at least one hardline pro-Brexit Tory MP will break cover to call for the suspension of Brexit negotiations until the EU agrees that trade talks can begin. The Observer has also learned that ministers may sanction the first expenditure on preparations for a “no deal” Brexit as soon as Monday, without the full approval of parliament. Meanwhile, ministers are rushing through a vote on treatment of nuclear material in a move that will allow them to begin spending on the new IT systems and inspectors needed should Britain remain outside Euratom, the EU-wide nuclear regulatory body. The spending could go ahead after the vote although the legislation is far from receiving full parliamentary approval. It comes amid claims of another “power grab” by ministers over Brexit plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/14/bath-treviso-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T19:12:17Z","webTitle":"Josh Lewis scores 13 points on first start as Bath beat wasteful Treviso","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/14/bath-treviso-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/14/bath-treviso-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Josh Lewis scores 13 points on first start as Bath beat wasteful Treviso","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Treviso had only won on the road four times in 19 European Cup campaigns, the last time at the Dragons, a side with a record in the tournament almost as undistinguished as their own. They duly lost again, but even a few grains of belief harvested by winning would have been enough to embarrass Bath, who spent much of the evening tackling. Treviso, who started with 13 full Italy internationals, dominated the match in terms of possession and territory, and won the penalty count handsomely in the opening half thanks to their dominance up front, where the visitors had a Ferrari. They required one behind, however, where, on the occasions the ball was given width, they were exposed for pace. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, was among the spectators. He saw the flanker Sam Underhill make a break before departing with a head injury and Jonathan Joseph find space in the opening period, and the early gains were made by Bath, who played at too quick a pace for their opponents, who wilfully conceded penalties at the breakdown. Josh Lewis, making his first start for Bath since joining from Ebbw Vale in the summer, kicked two to put the home side six points up in as many minutes, but when the match turned from loose to tight, Treviso grew in comfort. The game stagnated into a series of scrums around the Bath line after Sebastian Negri’s second line-break of the half saw Robert Barbieri held up centimetres short by Aled Brew and Taulupe Faletau. It was an early example of Treviso’s capacity for finding ways of not scoring. They seemed intent on rumbling a scrum over the opposition line, each penalty they received for their opponents’ collapsing turned into another set-piece. Bath were fortunate to avoid conceding a penalty try, although given the chances they spurned could it ever have been said in this match that Treviso would probably have scored a try? Bath did, though, lose their prop Nick Auterac to the sinbin. Treviso, with the scrums continuing to go down rather than forward, decided to move the ball wide. Ian McKinley’s long pass gave Tommaso Benvenuti the room to score on the left wing, but Semesa Rokoduguni, not known for his defence, knocked the ball out of his opposite number’s grasp as both dived at right-angles to each other. Rokoduguni, fed by Joseph, prompted a break-out one minute from the interval and Chris Cook’s pass set free Zach Mercer, one of the players looking to catch Jones’s eye, for a try that would have appeared on an indictment as grand larceny. The slick play was a lesson for Treviso, who missed a penalty when McKinley lined up from 30 metres following the unsuccessful series of scrums. When the Italian team did find their way over through Robert Barbieri, Giorgio Bronzini’s pass to the No8 was ruled forward on a night when at all other times that offence seemed to have been removed from the statute book. Little was going for them but Treviso stuck at it, willing if not able. Bath extended their 13-0 interval lead through Lewis’s third penalty after the outside-half profited from Bronzini’s and McKinley’s fumbling to fly-kick his way to the Treviso posts where he was caught by Benvenuti. The Italian side continued to hog the ball but it was as if they had been introduced to a stranger and become tongue-tied. Brew showed them how with a 30-metre break from a lineout with 10 minutes to go. Jones had gone by then, probably never to see Treviso in this tournament again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/16/la-public-housing-vouchers-wait-list-13-years","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"After 13 years, LA residents have a two-week window to apply for low-income housing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/16/la-public-housing-vouchers-wait-list-13-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/16/la-public-housing-vouchers-wait-list-13-years","fields":{"headline":"After 13 years, LA residents have a two-week window to apply for low-income housing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For most of his adult life, Michael has bounced between homes – his mother’s, his brother’s, his sister’s. Once, he slept on the street for two nights. When things are particularly desperate, Michael, now 33 and living in Los Angeles, donates plasma twice a week for $75. “Your body changes, you feel sick and weak,” he said. Like millions of other low-income Americans, Michael is eligible for a rental-subsidy voucher from the federal government. Michael applied for one, and was waitlisted until one of the limited number of vouchers becomes available. And so he has waited. For over a decade. Today, more Angelenos will have the chance to join the interminable waitlist, which is opening for the first time in a remarkable 13 years – but only for two weeks. In that time, the city expects to receive 600,000 applications for vouchers. Yet there are just 20,000 spots on the new waitlist – the lucky 3.3% will be chosen by lottery, and will then have to start waiting themselves. For people like Michael, whose mother put his name on the waitlist as soon as he turned 18, in the early 2000s, it’s obvious that the program isn’t working for the vast majority of people who need it. He still had not received a housing voucher after 15 years. Rental-subsidy vouchers – known as Section 8 vouchers for the part of the law that authorized them – are the government’s primary way of helping low-income Americans pay rent, and are used by 2.2 million families. They generally cover any rental costs that exceed 30% of the renter’s income. Yet studies have shown that only one in four Americans who need housing assistance actually receive it. And administrators acknowledge that the Section 8 system is not exactly working the way it should. “Well, of course it’s frustrating,” said Douglas Guthrie, president of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (Hacla). “Any way you look at this, we’re going to be extremely limited [in resources], with a growing affordable housing need.” The problem isn’t unique to Los Angeles. Local housing agencies across the country have similar problems, with need far outstripping supply, said Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Waitlists in New York have been closed since 2009 and in Chicago since 2014. When Baltimore opened its waitlist for the first time in a decade, in 2015, officials there warned that the list would expire after six years, meaning that some of the 25,000 signups might end up waiting years only to receive nothing. Section 8 “addresses this kind of systemic gap between low incomes and high rents – it ends homelessness,” Roman said. “The major problem we see with the Section 8 program is that there’s not enough Section 8.” The housing voucher program was created in 1974, and marked a shift away from building and managing public housing developments, which were unappealing to many, and towards helping tenants who were struggling with rent that was eating up almost all – if not all – of their paychecks. It was also seen as a way to help foster socioeconomic and racial integration, because voucher holders could choose where they lived. But, almost since its inception, the housing voucher program has been woefully underfunded. And it is not a favorite of the Trump administration, which sought cuts that would have resulted in more than 250,000 fewer vouchers. “Section 8 is the main tool we have for rental affordability,” said Jerry Jones, public policy director at the Inner City Law Center, a legal clinic and advocacy group in Skid Row. “So what’s the plan? There’s nothing coming out of Washington.” In the Los Angeles region, one of the consequences of the rental-voucher shortage is clear: soaring homelessness. Around 55,000 people are homeless on any one night, a record for the city. Bill Przylucki, executive director of a Santa Monica advocacy group called Power, said that even once a person gets a voucher, the battle’s not over. Because then, they have to find a landlord who will agree to take the voucher. And many of them won’t, he said. A study of rental units in Austin, Texas, for instance, found that the vast majority were not accessible to voucher-holders. Now, after over a decade of waiting, Michael is gearing up to face that battle himself. Since Michael’s mother first put his name on the wait list in the early 2000s, when he turned 18, his life has changed dramatically. He met and married his wife, and they had a daughter, who is 11 now. He has three stepchildren – 13, 12, and seven, respectively. He started, and then, when he ran out of money, stopped, a training program for automotive technicians. His brother died. But last week, he finally received the call: he got a voucher. Michael knows it might not be easy to find an apartment. He’ll have to save up for a deposit. He’s already had to downgrade his expectations, after learning that the amount that Hacla was willing to contribute was $2,150 per month, less than he’d hoped for an apartment for him, his wife and their four children. And he wants to find a place near where his children live now, so they won’t have to move from the magnet schools where they’re enrolled. Still, he’s optimistic. And, after waiting for a decade and a half for the voucher, he’s already looking forward to the day he can give it up. “The whole plan is not to be on Section 8 forever,” he said. “Hell no.” This article was amended on Thursday 19 September 2019 to remove identifying information about Michael"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/14/steve-bannon-brutus-julius-caesar-mitch-mcconnell-republican-civil-war","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T18:07:42Z","webTitle":"Steve Bannon renews call for war on Republican establishment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/steve-bannon-brutus-julius-caesar-mitch-mcconnell-republican-civil-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/steve-bannon-brutus-julius-caesar-mitch-mcconnell-republican-civil-war","fields":{"headline":"Steve Bannon renews call for war on Republican establishment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Former White House strategist Steve Bannon declared war on the Republican establishment on Saturday, comparing Mitch McConnell to Julius Caesar and asking “who’s going to be Brutus” in the political assassination of the Senate majority leader. In an unapologetic speech at the annual Values Voter Summit in Washington DC, Bannon called on the social conservatives assembled in the cavernous ballroom of the Shoreham Hotel to join him in replacing sitting senators with outsiders in next year’s midterm elections. “If I can a little riff on Plutarch and Shakespeare,” Bannon said in his remarks regarding McConnell, “up on Capitol Hill, it’s like the Ides of March. The only question – and this is just an analogy or metaphor, or whatever you want to call it – they’re just looking to find out who’s going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar.” After leaving the White House in August, Bannon rejoined the far-right Brietbart News website, promising to use his influence with Donald Trump to push a populist agenda from outside the West Wing. Now the rightwing bomb thrower has dedicated himself to tearing down a party establishment that finds itself in a tailspin. Bannon has become emboldened since his candidate of choice, Roy Moore, a hardline conservative twice removed from the state supreme court and known for making controversial comments, won the Alabama special election primary against Luther Strange, the incumbent supported by McConnell and Trump. That victory was a clear warning shot to McConnell and the GOP establishment, Bannon said. Bannon drew raucous cheers when he spoke of the “the populist, nationalist, conservative revolt that’s going on, that drove Donald Trump to victory, that drove Judge Moore to victory, that will drive 15 candidates to victory in 2018”. He predicted: “Trump is not only going to finish this term, he’s going to win with 400 electoral votes in 2020.” “There’s a time and season for everything and right now it’s a season of war against a GOP establishment,” Bannon said, adding: “Nobody can run and hide on this one, these folks are coming for you.” He singled out senators John Barrasso of Wyoming, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Dean Heller of Nevada for not siding with the president in a boiling war of words between Trump and Bob Corker. In a New York Times interview last week, the Tennessee senator, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee and once strong ally of the president, accused Trump of setting the nation on a path towards “world war three”. This weekend he told the Washington Post Trump had “castrated” secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has been trying to set up talks with nuclear-armed North Korea in the face of public criticism from his president. Corker will retire next year. Bannon called on him to resign before then. “Bob Corker has trashed the commander in chief of our armed forces while we have young men and women in harm’s way,” he said. There was still time for senators to offer a “mea culpa”, Bannon said, calling for such figures to publicly take the president’s side in the feud with Corker, to band together to remove McConnell from his leadership role and to dismantle a legislative procedural hurdle that requires 60 votes for certain legislation in the Senate. Trump has repeatedly blamed that rule for stymying his legislative agenda – in fact healthcare reform needed only 50 votes to pass and Republicans have failed to find a majority. Seb Gorka, a controversial former advisor to the president who also left the White House in August, also addressed the Values Voter crowd. He compared Bannon to Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi master played by Alec Guinness and Ewan McGregor in the Star Wars film franchise. “If you strike me down now I will be more powerful than you ever imagined,” Gorka said, paraphrasing Obi-Wan’s warning to the villain Darth Vader during a lightsaber duel. “That is Steve Bannon today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/14/government-criticised-for-low-funding-level-to-tackle-online-hate","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T17:07:27Z","webTitle":"Government's new online hate crime hub given just £200,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/14/government-criticised-for-low-funding-level-to-tackle-online-hate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/14/government-criticised-for-low-funding-level-to-tackle-online-hate","fields":{"headline":"Government's new online hate crime hub given just £200,000","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government’s commitment to tackling online hate crime has been thrown into question after it emerged that its much-trumpeted new hub to improve the police’s response to the escalating problem has been allocated just £200,000 – equivalent to £3 per incident, according to analysis by Plaid Cymru. “The national online hate crime hub that we are funding is an important step to ensure more victims have the confidence to come forward and report the vile abuse to which they are being subjected,” Amber Rudd, the home secretary, pledged last week when she unveiled the initiative. But opposition MPs say the sum allocated for the initial running of the hub, which will be taken from existing budgets, is negligible and will do little to curb the menace of online abuse. Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has been the target of online trolls, said: “It is clear that one of the reasons people don’t come forward when they face hate, intimidation and threats is that they don’t feel they are taken seriously. “We can no longer just talk a good game on online hatred, we must take action. This funding seems like paying lip service to a problem we all know must be tackled. It is a serious problem and it must be treated as such by the government.” In 2015/16 there were 62,518 online hate crimes recorded by the police – an increase of 19% on the previous year. “Online hate crime is increasingly prevalent but £200,000 a year would barely be sufficient to deal with incidents in north Wales, let alone the whole of both Wales and England,” said Plaid Cymru’s home affairs spokeswoman, Liz Saville Roberts MP. “Any initiative to tackle online abuse must be welcomed, but to allocate just £3 per incident, and from existing budgets rather than new money, is extraordinary and unacceptable.” The number of recorded online hate crimes is just a fraction of the true total, according to experts. Amnesty International says 25,000 abusive messages were sent to female MPs alone on Twitter in six months this year, two thirds of which involved intimidation or a threat of violence. Football’s anti-discrimination organisation, Kick It Out, says 134,400 abusive messages were posted on social media to footballers or their clubs in 2015. Jewish and Muslim groups say they have seen increases in online attacks in recent years. Women’s Aid says a third of women have suffered online harassment by a current or former partner. Research from the University of Bedfordshire shows that a third of victims of stalking suffer online abuse. “There is currently a substantial under-reporting of online hate crime,” said Harry Fletcher of Digital Trust, a victims’ rights campaign. “The government wants this to change, which is welcome news, but the amount available to investigate each case is derisory. If all hate crime was reported, the number of crimes being investigated would reach the hundreds of thousands. “Even if only 200,000 incidents are reported, it would mean a mere £1 per victim. Yet again victims are at the periphery of the justice system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/14/manchester-united-liverpool-jose-mourinho-david-de-gea-cautious-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T17:44:00Z","webTitle":"David de Gea’s block saves a point but cautious United miss their chance | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/14/manchester-united-liverpool-jose-mourinho-david-de-gea-cautious-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/14/manchester-united-liverpool-jose-mourinho-david-de-gea-cautious-tactics","fields":{"headline":"David de Gea’s block saves a point but cautious United miss their chance","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"First the highlights of Manchester United’s afternoon. Highlight No1. With 34 minutes gone David de Gea produced a genuinely brilliant save, sticking out his left foot to block a close-range shot from Joël Matip after a corner. It was a game‑saving moment, an example of the way a fantastic goalkeeper can drive his team from the back, snatching those small, stand‑alone moments that direct the wider story of matches won, points gained, teams built. De Gea is something of a gymnastic freak, a tall man with startling fast-twitch reflexes and a dancer’s control of his limbs. Just to get his foot down in that position, so quickly and with such certainty, is a feat beyond most human beings, even the elite athletes among us. Highlight No2. On a noisy, oddly balmy afternoon at Anfield, Romelu Lukaku played a role similar to that of Matt Damon in the film The Martian, a man entirely isolated in the harshest of environments, cut adrift on an alien red planet and reduced to foraging desperately. Lukaku bullocked gamely from wing to wing throughout this stodgy, directionless 0-0 draw. With 40 minutes gone he found himself unexpected proximity to another grey United shirt. Readjusting with commendable speed to the shock of human company, the striker played a neat one-two with Anthony Martial and shot powerfully but a bit too close to the Liverpool keeper, Simon Mignolet. Next up, the filler. Or in other words the rest of it, on an afternoon when a collection of talented, pacy, powerful United players spent most of the game crouched behind their guard in a 4-5‑green space-1 formation, eking out a neurotically cautious point against a Liverpool team that had not kept a clean sheet since August. By the end Lukaku had touched the ball 22 times. One of those was that shot, also United’s only effort on target. He should probably have been sent off but avoided even a booking for a horrible tackle on Joe Gomez and then some minor contact with Dejan Lovren’s head on the other side of the pitch. Perhaps the referee felt sorry him, seeing a man just seeking out a little human contact. This was probably the kind of occasion Jorge Valdano had in mind when he offered his infamous, and often-misquoted line about the intensity of English crowds and the energy of the players, contrasted with the artless spectacle at its heart. This was a game with everything – spectacle, history, big names, speed, power, commitment – except, perhaps, moments of craft, imagination and invention. C’est magnifique. Mais ce n’est pas anything that resembles a high-class game of attacking football. Afterwards José Mourinho was, as you might expect, unbothered by any of this. Instead he portrayed his team’s performance as something only a purist could really appreciate, one for the coaches, the aesthetes, those who see beyond the gaudy thrills to the chess match beneath. Mourinho pointed out, rightly, that United were missing three key midfielders. He is of course also right that to keep a clean sheet is not as easy as it sounds, and is instead the product of a huge amount of discipline and expertise. Those who venerate him unquestioningly will say United came here for a 0-0 and that this was mission accomplished, the kind of result that wins a title. Mourinho – in particular Mourinho – is not here to dance for us. He’s here to win things. And this is how he does it. In spite of which Mourinho will surely look back on this game with one or two regrets. United arrived at Anfield as title contenders, a driving attacking machine up against a local rival with a glass jaw, opponents that shipped five goals to Manchester City at the Etihad, even if four of those came while down to 10 men. United failed to press at any of those bruises, failed to wrench at the stitches, and left Anfield with no real idea if Liverpool’s defence might have caved to some concerted pressure. By the end Liverpool had dominated this game without ever really dominating it, betrayed by a lack of precision in attack for all the eye-catching skills of Mohamed Salah 40 yards from goal. United had De Gea’s brilliance on their side, and a studied doggedness. Mourinho still gets cut a lot of slack for this kind of performance, based on his winning record, a pantomime villain persona and the idea that defending deep for 90 minutes is some kind of toxic tactical masterstroke in his hands. As indeed it is when your opponent is a superior attacking threat or when all that is required is a draw at the very last. But we’re still in October. And lads, it’s Liverpool, a team that had conceded 14 goals in seven games before Saturday. Mourinho judges the rhythms of a season as well as anyone. He knows his team and his players, and knows there is every chance United could end up winning the league by a point. Should it go the other way, however, matches such as this will stand out for other reasons, an afternoon when a vulnerable opponent was allowed to remain pretty much unshaken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/14/manchester-city-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T16:09:30Z","webTitle":"Kevin De Bruyne leads the way as Manchester City thrash Stoke 7-2","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/14/manchester-city-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/14/manchester-city-stoke-city-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Kevin De Bruyne leads the way as Manchester City thrash Stoke 7-2","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Something fairly amazing happened in the 27th minute of this latest Manchester City goalfest. A slick first-time passing move produced an unanswerable goal for the home side, but a bamboozled Stoke City defence was already wearily familiar with that routine. What shocked about the third goal was that Kevin De Bruyne was not behind it. The Belgian has been the inspiration behind much of what Manchester City have produced this season, yet here were his fellow forwards pinging the ball about with accuracy and imagination without him. Gabriel Jesus found Leroy Sané on the left, his firm cross was instinctively caught and turned back in a single touch by Raheem Sterling, which left David Silva the relatively simple task of arriving on the six-yard line to become the third different scorer of the afternoon. Even by that stage, supporters in the posh new Tunnel Club seats were beginning to turn their back on the action to take selfies. In fairness, in under half an hour they had already witnessed the best of the De Bruyne show. “Kevin is a big talent, he’s dynamic and aggressive,” Pep Guardiola said. “When he gets possession with space ahead of him our forwards know to get moving because the ball is coming.” Not only the forwards, as it happens. For the first goal the visitors were slow to react to the danger when De Bruyne advanced with the ball, biding his time until Kyle Walker came steaming up on his inside to run behind Kevin Wimmer. Once De Bruyne knew he was ready the weight on his pass was perfect, leaving the right-back to cut the ball back from the goalline for Jesus to hook past Jack Butland. Before Stoke had fully recovered their composure Manchester City struck again with another quality passing move. This time a disguised reverse pass from De Bruyne, quite possibly his most exquisite of the afternoon, set Sané free on the left with Jesus and Sterling practically queuing up in front of goal. Sané found the latter and Sterling came up with a composed finish. With David Silva missing an inviting opening just before his goal and De Bruyne bringing a fingertip save from Butland right on the stroke of half-time, Stoke could hardly have complained if they had turned round four or five goals in arrears. Remarkably, thanks to a determined run and shot from Mame Diouf and a neat return pass from Jesé, the interval deficit was just two. Stoke had managed to score with their only real attack of the first half and having had 16% of possession by that point, but it came at exactly the right time to remind all present this might not be the expected procession after all. That impression was only strengthened when Stoke opened the second half with another goal, Diouf reaching a Tom Edwards cross to score with the help of a significant deflection off Walker, though that was as good as the afternoon got for Mark Hughes and his 18-year-old debutant. Edwards did not enjoy the easiest of Premier League introductions trying to keep tabs on Sané, and though he must have been pleased with an assist his afternoon ended prematurely when an over-enthusiastic Fabian Delph challenge saw him depart on a stretcher with an ankle injury. Stoke never looked as threatening again and the home side regained control with ridiculous ease thanks to another burst of three quick goals. De Bruyne had a hand in them all, and though Stoke only had themselves to blame for the mix-up that led to the first, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the midfielder’s searching ball into the area and even more to admire in a dazzling first time finish from Jesus. Fernandinho was next, taking a pass from De Bruyne via Delph to hammer home a long shot, and if Belgian influence on that occasion was minimal normal service was resumed with the sixth goal. A delightful diagonal ball left Sané an opportunity he could hardly miss, a fact not lost on a crowd who celebrated by singing De Bruyne’s name rather than that of the goalscorer. “De Bruyne is head and shoulders above anyone else in the Premier League,” Hughes said, unashamedly joining in the chorus of appreciation. “I have to be honest, some of their goals today were outstanding, almost impossible to defend against because of the quality of the passing. We weren’t at our best but we came up against an exceptional side full of world-class players.” Stoke were as good as on the bus home by the time Sterling and Bernardo Silva combined for a seventh goal. Guardiola had withdrawn De Bruyne by then, but even with only 66 minutes on the pitch there was no question who was man of the match. “I cannot deny that was one of the best team performances I have seen here,” Guardiola said approvingly. “We played quick and we played simple, and I hope we can play as well in the next game against Napoli.” Tuesday’s Champions League fixture is likely to be a much sterner test for free-scoring City, but credit where it is due. There is no need for any further speculation about whether or not Guardiola can do it against Stoke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27336","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T23:00:30Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,336","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27336","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27336","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,336","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27337","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T23:00:51Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,337","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27337","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27337","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,337","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27338","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T23:00:49Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,338","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27338","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27338","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,338","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/15/the-warped-logic-of-making-the-poor-pay-more","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:05:15Z","webTitle":"The warped logic of making the poor pay more | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/the-warped-logic-of-making-the-poor-pay-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/the-warped-logic-of-making-the-poor-pay-more","fields":{"headline":"The warped logic of making the poor pay more","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There was a grim inevitability to the news that Department for Work and Pensions’ helplines for people confused about universal credit are costing many claimants money they can’t afford, with demands that these calls are moved to a free 0800 number. Problems include long waiting times, people placed on indefinite hold and overworked, undertrained staff who don’t know the answers to callers’ questions. All this is going on, with phone charges of up to 55p a minute, as people struggle to deal with claims. This is just more proof that there are those who have a vested interest in turning the welfare system into a warped, confounding mash-up of The Crystal Maze and the 12 labours of Hercules. It’s a disgrace, but is it a surprise? It’s long been obvious that, all too frequently, the poor pay more. Nor is this confined to people having to make ludicrously expensive phone calls so that a bewildering benefits system can be decoded, doubtless with the kind of doggedness that used to be reserved for, say, cracking Enigma machines at Bletchley Park. This poor-pay-more rule applies to many of the most basic aspects of life. Let’s run through just a few. Homes: jobless/low-income claimants can’t dream of getting a mortgage, which can work out cheaper than renting, and means that you at least have an asset and some security. So they rent, often in the notoriously extortionate private sector, at a cost their benefits may not completely cover, so they have to make up the difference. Heating water (for baths, showers, washing up) can mean finding money for greedy meters. And heating their homes is a luxury that many people decide they can’t afford. New clothes (for job interviews) – forget it. And one of the little acknowledged side-effects of the “vintage” trend is that even charity shops can get pretty expensive these days. Nor do they tend to own washing machines and tumble dryers, so they use laundrettes, pay-as-you-go-style again. Food may be from a food bank or the cheapest takeaway or microwaveable ready meal they can find. Even as the pious continue to drone on about how cheap and easy it is make a “nourishing soup for the whole week!”, anyone half sane has worked out something different. Even if they could stand this insulting hipster-slop day after day – is it the trendy millennial answer to workhouse gruel? – it would require ingredients, a kitchen that extends beyond one conked-out, grease-encrusted ring on a hob, utensils and the money for the gas or electricity to cook it. Travel: skint people tend to live in areas with crummy public transport, can’t afford to own or run cars, nor invest in the type of travelcards that bring prices down, so again it’s often PAYG, the most expensive way to get around. Moreover, people don’t have their own computer or affordable, decent wifi, so again they have to travel for these facilities. Mobile phones, which most people would deem a necessity, also tend to be PAYG and credit would be quickly used up, especially, for instance, if people were to ring expensive benefits helplines that blow their entire food budget for a week. This is just a short list – there must be many other ways that broke people are fleeced because they can’t afford the initial outlays or access the superior long-term deals that make life easier and cheaper. Instead, they have to do their best in pressured, hand-to-mouth PAYG-lives. A remorseless grind, where everything you try to do costs not just money that you haven’t got, but sometimes more money than better-off people are paying for the same services. In this context, overcharging struggling people just to have their benefits explained to them may sound cruel and sick, but it also makes perfect (albeit shameful) sense."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/14/last-isis-fighters-in-raqqa-seek-deal-to-leave-former-capital-in-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T18:22:15Z","webTitle":"Last Isis fighters in Raqqa broker deal to leave Syrian city – local official","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/last-isis-fighters-in-raqqa-seek-deal-to-leave-former-capital-in-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/14/last-isis-fighters-in-raqqa-seek-deal-to-leave-former-capital-in-syria","fields":{"headline":"Last Isis fighters in Raqqa broker deal to leave Syrian city – local official","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Islamic State fighters remaining in Raqqa, once the group’s de facto capital, have brokered a deal that would allow them to leave the city with a number of human shields, according to agencies in Syria. Omar Alloush, a senior official of the Raqqa Civil Council, told Agence France-Presse a deal had been reached to allow fighters out of the city, which is on the verge of being captured by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. “Foreign fighters are included in the deal,” he said. According to Alloush, up to 500 fighters including both Syrian and foreign-born jihadists remain in Raqqa. Coalition sources put the number lower at 300-400 fighters. The coalition estimated earlier this week that 300 to 400 militants remained in the city. On Friday, a local official said an estimated about 100 militants had surrendered. “They [Isis] have 400 hostages with them – women and children – in the national hospital,” Alloush told AFP. The US-led coalition backing the SDF’s drive for Raqqa had announced the deal earlier on Saturday but said it would exclude foreign Isis fighters. However, Alloush insisted the agreement included non-Syrian jihadists. “The foreign fighters have two choices: either surrender or be taken out” of the city, Alloush said, saying it was possible they would be taken to Deir Ezzor, an area in eastern Syria where Isis still holds territory. The agreement comes after days of talks on a way for the US-backed SDF to secure the last parts of the city while avoiding further civilian casualties. Militants left in Raqqa have only pistols, rifles, light machine guns and a dwindling supply of ammunition, and they are cut off from their leadership, according to a statement from the SDF, which despite its name is largely Kurdish-led. Despite that, the coalition told the Associated Press that it expects difficult days ahead until Raqqa is retaken. The battle for the town, backed by US-led airstrikes, intelligence and advisers, has been raging since June and is being fought street to street. The city, once a symbol of Isis’s power and a backdrop to macabre executions posted on social media, is now in ruins and littered with mines and boobytraps. Senior members of the group have long fled. Among those who left the city over the summer was Sally Jones, a British member of Isis who is believed to have been killed in a drone strike with her 12-year-old son Jojo as she sought refuge on the Syria-Iraq border. She had become one of the group’s most senior women. Soldiers loyal to the Syrian government have also seized a town in the east of the country that had become one of the last refuges for the Isis leadership, according to local media. Opposition from militants in Mayadeen collapsed on Saturday after weeks of fighting. The pro-government al-Ikhbariya TV quoted an unnamed military official as saying that soldiers were chasing the last militants out of Mayadeen while a military corps of engineers were clearing land mines left in the town. Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government troops backed by Shia militias had taken control of the town but were still combing it for militants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/14/time-to-make-link-between-abuse-and-film-content","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:05:15Z","webTitle":"Time to make the link between abuse and film content | Kate Hardie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/14/time-to-make-link-between-abuse-and-film-content","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/14/time-to-make-link-between-abuse-and-film-content","fields":{"headline":"Time to make the link between abuse and film content","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Many creative men have come out since the Weinstein allegations, making it clear that they do not agree with sexual abuse. I wasn’t aware there was any doubt that sexual abuse was a bad thing, but it’s good to have it clarified. (Forgive the sarcasm. It’s been a long week.) But so far, very few have been brave enough to start a conversation about the subtler, yet no less urgent, subject of the content of their own work, to examine their own record regarding the treatment and the representation of women. The focus is quite rightly on the horrendous sexual abuse that Weinstein is alleged to have committed. But to focus on that alone is to miss the point that the portrayal of women – of their lives, their feelings, their sexuality and their bodies – is nearly always decided upon and filtered through male eyes. Nearly every actress will tell you about scripts that included scenes of female nudity that seem to have no apparent reason for being there and that are often degrading. You only have to turn on most police dramas to find the obligatory image of a battered, naked – but beautiful – young female corpse. (Apart from the ones written by Sally Wainwright: will someone please put Sally Wainwright in charge of everything for a while?) You don’t have to be talking about consent and abuse to be mortified by many female roles. I worked on a job last year and before the read-through I spoke to two young actresses involved: both on their first TV jobs, both playing roles that required them to be naked, both confused as to why the scenes were there, both not wanting to do them. But they were also too scared of the all-male creative team, a set of hugely powerful, award-winning men, to say anything. I am 49, so I do not get asked to be naked any more. (That is another thing the male-dominated industry is not keen on – women over 40 having any kind of satisfactory sex life or, indeed, bodies.) But when I was 17, I had become so used to being required to appear naked that I asked for a no-nudity clause to be written into a contract. I was fired by the male director because, despite there being no nudity in his script, he felt the clause curbed his creativity should he, on a whim, decide he needed me to remove my clothes. (This director, fittingly was given his break by Weinstein.) I knew the nudity these actresses were being asked to do was not integral to the story and so did nearly every other woman, and a few of the men, on that production. I tried suggesting to the actresses they could say no – but of course I understood why they felt afraid to. We proceeded to read the scripts; the room was full of women – a casting director and assistant director included. A male producer was reading out the stage directions, his voice hardly faltering in tone as he read out: “He rips open her shirt and we see her tits.” When we finished, it was announced that anyone who wasn’t an executive producer, producer, writer, director or the director of photography had to leave so that those left behind could make important decisions. I watched as the room emptied of women. I wondered to myself whether any of the men would have noticed just how incongruous the nude scenes were. Or would have flinched as much as I had on hearing them read aloud and would have felt as saddened and slightly scared by the use of the dismissive and slightly aggressive word “tits”. Whether any of them understood the experience they were about to put the actresses through; whether any of them thought about how hugely difficult it was for the women to question their choices without fearing we might lose our jobs. I wonder whether the powerful creative men making it so clear that they know that Harvey Weinstein is a sexual predator – and that sexual predators are wrong – will also take time to truly look at all the other ways, overt and subtle, in which their male power dominates our industry.

The proposal was first discussed in August by acting chief executive of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), Barry Quirk. But Grenfell survivors and other residents were alarmed when they received a letter from the tenant management organisation urging them to vote for it to be disbanded at its AGM on Tuesday 17 October. Residents say that while they ultimately want the TMO to be dismantled, this must not happen before it has been scrutinised at the public inquiry. They fear that if there is agreement on Tuesday to disband it, officials could avoid corporate manslaughter charges, being sued in civil litigation for omissions and failures before the fire, and the residents may be unable to liaise with the inquiry regarding witnesses or evidence. Scotland Yard has said there are “reasonable grounds” to suspect the TMO and the council committed corporate manslaughter over the fire. An urgent legal letter was sent to RBKC and the TMO by residents’ legal representatives on 13 October calling for any moves to disband the TMO to be postponed until more information is available. It also said this issue should not be voted on at Tuesday’s AGM. The letter stated: “On the basis of the currently available information, there are very serious concerns among all those affected, including our clients and the wider community, about both the procedure that has been adopted in relation to this AGM and what actions RBKC might take if it was to become the sole member of the TMO. “Crucially, all of these matters could prevent or undermine the TMO being held accountable in relation to the fire and prevent or undermine the search for the truth through all available legal avenues.” One resident, Gordon Futter, said that while he had grave concerns about the TMO’s safety record and ability to look after residents, the TMO should remain in place for the duration of the public inquiry. “I feel that the letters all the residents have received from the TMO urging us to vote to disband the organisation is like asking us to commit an act of self-harm. I’m going to propose a motion that this resolution should be postponed. “I believe that the TMO is blatantly uninterested in residents but we need to keep them around to ensure that they are held to account. At a time when we are still burying our dead from the fire, this move is just so callous and so wrong.” Another resident said: “The resolutions they want us to vote for to disband the TMO are poorly explained and there is no detail as to what will replace it. All we have from the council is their verbal assurance that they will ‘consult with residents’ but you can understand why we are sceptical about this. “There’s no trust, so it’s hard. I think residents are in a real bind, on top of everything else.” The letter from the TMO states: “It is with a heavy heart that we have come to this decision. But the council and the government have made it clear to us that there’s no role for us following the tragedy.” It adds: “I hope you will agree that this is the only way forward given the tragic events.” TMO officials insist that disbanding the TMO would not damage the inquiry and would not prevent TMO members from answering questions. The Grenfell Action Group has launched a campaign to prevent the TMO from being disbanded titled Save The TMO."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/14/drivers-who-kill-may-now-face-life-sentence","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:05:15Z","webTitle":"Drivers who kill will now face life sentence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/14/drivers-who-kill-may-now-face-life-sentence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/14/drivers-who-kill-may-now-face-life-sentence","fields":{"headline":"Drivers who kill will now face life sentence","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Dangerous drivers who cause death while using their mobile phones or speeding will face life in prison, ministers have confirmed. The decision to go ahead with a major extension of sentences comes after a campaign by families and a cross-party group of MPs. Drivers who kill while under the influence of drink or drugs will also face a life sentence. And there will be a new offence of causing serious injury through careless driving, as part of renewed efforts to improve road safety. The new measures mean such drivers could face the same length of sentence as those convicted of manslaughter, with maximum penalties raised from 14 years to life. Last year 157 people were sentenced for causing death by dangerous driving, with a further 32 convicted of causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Tory MP Heidi Allen has been campaigning for life sentences for death by dangerous driving. The South Cambridgeshire MP has been supporting the family of a 21-year-old who was killed after being hit by a car on a night out. The killer was sentenced to four years, but was released after two. Labour’s Judith Cummins also pressed the government on the issue in July. Dominic Raab, the justice minister, said: “We’ve taken a long hard look at driving sentences, and we received 9,000 submissions to our consultation. Based on the seriousness of the worst cases, the anguish of the victims’ families, and maximum penalties for other serious offences such as manslaughter, we intend to introduce life sentences of imprisonment for those who wreck lives by driving dangerously, drunk or high on drugs. We will introduce a new offence of causing serious injury by careless driving, punishable by imprisonment, to fill a gap in the law andreflect the seriousness of some of the injuries suffered by victims in this category of case.”In response to a government consultation on dangerous driving, 70% of responses backed extending the maximum penalty for the offence to life imprisonment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/14/jose-mourinho-manchester-unnited-tactics-liverpool-anfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T15:46:27Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho defends Manchester United tactics after Anfield stalemate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/14/jose-mourinho-manchester-unnited-tactics-liverpool-anfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/14/jose-mourinho-manchester-unnited-tactics-liverpool-anfield","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho defends Manchester United tactics after Anfield stalemate","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"José Mourinho defended Manchester United’s tactics after a 0-0 draw at Anfield that left Jürgen Klopp remarking that he would never set up his Liverpool side in such a defensive system. Klopp chose his words carefully to make sure it could not be construed as a verbal attack on Mourinho but the Liverpool manager was clearly frustrated after the two sides fought out a second successive goalless draw in the Anfield fixture, for the first time ever. Mourinho, however, would not accept that it was a poor spectacle or that he had deliberately set out to leave Anfield with a draw. “It depends on what is an entertaining game,” the United manager said. “One thing is an entertaining game for fans, another thing is an entertaining game for people who read football in a different way. “For me, the second half was a bit of chess but my opponent didn’t open the door for me to win the game. We came for three [points] but in the second half it was difficult to do that with the dynamic as it was. I was waiting for Jürgen to change and go more attacking but he kept the three strong midfielders at all times. “I was waiting for him to give me more space to counter but he didn’t give me that. So I know that probably you think we were defensive and they were offensive – well, you [Liverpool] are at home and you don’t move anything. I don’t know why. I was waiting for that and he didn’t do it. I think he did well, honestly [not changing it].” Mourinho went on to explain that he had brought on two of his substitutes, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard, to try and catch Liverpool on the break if the home side had been emboldened to change their system. However, the more notable substitution was the arrival of Victor Lindelof, a centre-half, in place of Ashley Young, who was playing as a winger, in stoppage time. “You could not play this way at Liverpool but it’s OK for Manchester United,” Klopp said. “I thought we were worthy of three points. There were a lot of good individual performances. But when an opponent has this kind of defensive approach you will not create 20 chances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/16/raw-sewage-flowing-into-rivers-across-england-and-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T07:21:57Z","webTitle":"Raw sewage 'flowing into rivers across England and Wales'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/16/raw-sewage-flowing-into-rivers-across-england-and-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/16/raw-sewage-flowing-into-rivers-across-england-and-wales","fields":{"headline":"Raw sewage 'flowing into rivers across England and Wales'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Raw sewage is flowing into rivers at thousands of sites across England and Wales, a report has warned, harming wildlife and putting human health at risk. The total amount of raw sewage intentionally being put into rivers is unknown, which is a “huge concern”, according to conservation group WWF, which produced the analysis. The available data suggests that more than half of overflow sites spill sewage into rivers at least once a month and 14% at least once a week. WWF argued this is far more frequently than allowed under regulations that permit overflows only at times of unusually heavy rainfall, when treatment works cannot cope. The report also said the number of reported sewage pollution incidents, including failures at sewage treatment plants, rose in 2016 for the first time since 2012. Furthermore, only 14% of rivers in England have “good” ecological status, which reflects both sewage and farm pollution and low water levels, compared with 27% in 2010. Sewage pollution can cause algal blooms that starve rivers of oxygen and kill fish, as well as affecting the wildlife such as kingfishers and otters that depend on them. The pathogens in untreated sewage can also threaten people’s health, causing gastroenteritis and even septicaemia and hepatitis A. “Britain’s bountiful rivers have forever provided the lifeblood of our nation – vital to our economy as well as our wildlife and our own wellbeing,” said Tanya Steele, the WWF chief executive. “The current situation is unacceptable. These findings demonstrate the urgent need to transform the way we treat our freshwater environment.” The government must force water companies to act, WWF says. The analysis reports that 40% of the rivers in England and Wales are polluted with sewage, which comes from almost 18,000 sewage overflow sites operated by water companies and from treatment plant breakdowns. Thames Water had the highest proportion of rivers affected by sewage – 72% – followed by Southern and Anglian Water. Until recently, there was little monitoring of how often and for how long the overflows spill sewage into rivers. But data from south-west Wales showed overflows there spilled for an average of 217 hours over a year, with 9% spilling for at least 730 hours a year, equivalent to flowing constantly for a whole month. WWF warns that without action the situation is likely to get worse due to rising population, increasing urbanisation and climate change making intense rain more common. “It seems companies are relying on sewer overflows to compensate for under-capacity” at treatment plants, the report states. “Our research has revealed a sewerage system on the edge; one that is ill-equipped to protect people and nature as we face the tough challenges ahead.” An Environment Agency spokeswoman said: “There have been dramatic improvements to water quality over the last two decades but there is more to do. We have set more stringent targets for the water sector, stated they must do more to reduce pollution incidents and in the most serious cases taken enforcement action leading to record fines.” Since 2015, 4,000 of the sewage overflow sites have been fitted with monitoring equipment to record the frequency and duration of spills and by March 2020 about 11,500 will be monitored, the EA spokeswoman said. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Our rivers are the cleanest they have been since industrial times and we’re working with the water industry to meet tougher targets and improve their planning and investment in wastewater infrastructure.” A spokesman for Water UK, which represents water companies, said that in relation to pollution incidents WWF had failed to distinguish between the most serious, which increased from four to nine in 2016, and the vast majority which the EA classes as having “only a limited or localised effect on water quality”. “There’s a genuine debate to be had about how we as a country are going to deal with sewage and drainage issues in future in a way which protects our environment, but WWF have muddied the waters with an inaccurate picture of what is going on,” he said. Wildlife such as salmon and otters have returned to some rivers, he added. Coastal waters have seen a big reduction in sewage pollution in recent decades but action on rivers has lagged behind, WWF argues. “We know the water industry can clean up their act, if given the right push. They just have to get on and do it,” said Catherine Moncrieff, the freshwater policy manager at WWF."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/14/somalia-several-killed-in-mogadishu-truck-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T14:09:46Z","webTitle":"Somalia: deadly truck bombing in Mogadishu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/somalia-several-killed-in-mogadishu-truck-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/14/somalia-several-killed-in-mogadishu-truck-bomb","fields":{"headline":"Somalia: deadly truck bombing in Mogadishu","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At least 20 people have died in Mogadishu after a truck bomb detonated in a busy district of the Somali capital that is home to hotels, shops, restaurants and government offices.

Because it’s what everyone else is doing. For the first time, sales of 50th birthday cards and party gear have overtaken those marking 21st birthdays. They now account for 16% of all card sales, compared with 14.1% for 21sts. Who is going to 50th birthday parties? Oh, everyone. Apparently, the average number of guests for a 30th birthday party is 40. But by 50, you’ve got older kids, loads of current and former colleagues, and half a century of friends to invite, so the average shoots up to 100. But why throw a party for them all? It might be because many people have reached a position of relative comfort by 50. They’ve got good jobs and the disposable income to have a really nice bash. Oh, I see.

So you’re saying that the information is skewed? It’s possible. Perhaps the 50th birthday merchandise boom is the celebratory equivalent of Bradley Walsh’s music career; it exists only because middle-aged people are still interested in physical formats such as cards and CDs.

Speaking to students in Luxembourg on Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker said he had told the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, that his government needed to act to stop the Catalan situation spinning out of control, but that the advice had gone unheeded. “For some time now I asked the Spanish prime minister to take initiatives so that Catalonia wouldn’t run amok,” he said. “A lot of things were not done.” Juncker said that while he wished to see Europe remain united, his hands were tied when it came to Catalan independence. “People have to undertake their responsibility,” he said. “I would like to explain why the commission doesn’t get involved in that. A lot of people say: ‘Juncker should get involved in that.’ “We do not do it because if we do … it will create a lot more chaos in the EU. We cannot do anything. We cannot get involved in that.” Juncker said that while he often acted as a negotiator and facilitator between member states, the commission could not mediate if calls to do so came only from one side – in this case, the Catalan government. Rajoy has rejected calls for mediation, pointing out that the recent Catalan independence referendum was held in defiance of the Spanish constitution and the country’s constitutional court. “There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience or illegality,” he said on Wednesday. Despite his refusal to intervene, however, Juncker warned the international community that the political crisis in Spain could not be ignored. “OK, nobody is shooting anyone in Catalonia – not yet at least. But we shouldn’t understate that matter, though,” he added. The commission president also spoke more generally about the fragmentation of national identities within Europe, saying he feared that if Catalonia became independent, other regions would follow. “I am very concerned because the life in communities seems to be so difficult,” he said. “Everybody tries to find their own in their own way and they think that their identity cannot live in parallel to other people’s identity. “But if you allow – and it is not up to us of course – but if Catalonia is to become independent, other people will do the same. I don’t like that. I don’t like to have a euro in 15 years that will be 100 different states. It is difficult enough with 17 states. With many more states it will be impossible.” Juncker’s comments came as the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, found himself under increasing pressure over his decision on Tuesday to sign a unilateral declaration of independence but propose that its effects be suspended for a few weeks to allow for dialogue. Rajoy has told Puigdemont that he has until Monday to confirm whether or not independence has been declared, and until next Thursday to abandon his push for independence or face the suspension of the region’s autonomy and the imposition of direct rule from Madrid. On Friday, Spain’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, said the regional government’s behaviour was damaging the region’s economy and asked Puigdemont to put an end to instability by re-establishing “institutional normality” as soon as possible. Sáenz de Santamaría told the Catalan president that the central government was prepared to discuss the issue in parliament if he stopped ignoring Spanish law. She also reminded him that Rajoy and the Spanish socialist party had already agreed to establish a commission to investigate possible changes to the way the country’s autonomous regions are governed. “That would allow him [Puigdemont] to set out his thoughts, his proposals and his plans,” she said. “Nothing in our constitutional framework is immutable – anything can be discussed. But it has to be done by respecting the rules of the democratic game and the rights of our citizens.” Meanwhile, Puigdemont’s junior coalition partners, the far-left separatist party CUP, urged him to ignore pressure from the Spanish government, abandon the suspension and move to a definitive proclamation of independence. The call was backed by the Catalan National Assembly, the main pro-independence civil society group in the region. In a statement, it said that Rajoy’s refusal to talk meant it no longer made sense “to keep the suspension of the independence declaration”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/15/sti-warning-as-clinics-close-in-london-and-self-testing-is-delayed","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:14:43Z","webTitle":"STI warning as clinics close in London and self-testing is delayed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/15/sti-warning-as-clinics-close-in-london-and-self-testing-is-delayed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/15/sti-warning-as-clinics-close-in-london-and-self-testing-is-delayed","fields":{"headline":"STI warning as clinics close in London and self-testing is delayed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"People are being denied care at overburdened sexual health clinics after a wave of closures and huge delays to a controversial new self-testing scheme for diseases such as syphilis, health experts are warning. Six long-established sexual health clinics around London have shut in recent months as part of a planned switch from face-to-face consultations to online services. Problems accessing services for sexually-transmitted infections (STI) are being compounded because the internet-based system, via which people can order a home-testing kit, is many months behind schedule. “We are hearing about emerging evidence that shows patients are being turned away from sexual health services in London because of huge pressures clinics are facing,” said Dr Elizabeth Carlin, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), which represents specialist doctors in the field. The self-testing scheme was supposed to be rolled out across 27 of the capital’s 32 boroughs from 1 May. But it is still not functioning and will not start until January at the earliest. Sexual health experts are warning that the clinic closures and unavailability of the kits could lead to “an explosive increase” in STI rates in London, which are already the highest in England. “A lot of services are being dismantled and potentially that will have a big impact on the future of STI rates. The rates will go up substantially if we don’t get a handle on this,” said Dr Paul Lister, who until June helped run sexual health services in south-west London. “The diagnosis of STIs will not be as efficient because people cannot access testing, so people who have untreated infections are more likely to have complications and potentially develop infertility. They are more likely to pass on infections to others as they will go undetected”, he added. Levels of HIV infection could also start to rise again, Lister added. “Rates of HIV have gone down significantly in recent years. So if we reduce access to services, as is happening across London, we are doing that at our peril because history repeats itself and we see a direct link between access to services and rates of infection and the potential consequences of that.” Kat Smithson, director of policy and campaigns at the National Aids Trust, said: “There seems to be a gap between the e-service being up and running and services it was supposed to support being closed. We are worried about the order things are happening in. “From a patient perspective it changes your options and makes it harder to get an appointment, which seems to be what is happening.” The restricted access threatens to undermine London’s success in encouraging gay and bisexual men to get tested, Smithson added. Men who have sex with men account for one in four STIs in the capital. The 27 councils have given Preventx, a private diagnostics firm, the contract to provide the kit delivery service. They said that in future “the front door into services for most people will be web-based, with a single web address providing patients with information about sexual health, signposting to the most appropriate service for their needs and the ability to order self-sampling tests”. Councils were made responsible for funding many sexual health services, including STI testing as well as contraception, in 2013 in a massive shake-up of the NHS. Councils acknowledged that “there may be fewer major centres for people with more complex sexual health needs” as a result of the clinic closures, more of which are due, but said “an online service will complement face to face clinic services”. The e-testing system is a key part of the London sexual health transformation programme, through which the councils are aiming to modernise sexual health care to cope with growing demand. Some people who find that they cannot yet order a kit for free from Preventx are being offered a 10% discount on the usual £99.99 cost of a test for 10 common STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhoea, from the company’s sister site test.me. The sexual health clinics that have shut their doors include those at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead and the Clare Simpson Clinic at Barnet hospital, both in north London, as well as two in south London run by Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust. Sexual health experts claim the changes in London have been forced on councils by ministers cutting the amount of money they give them for public health work. Public Health England warned in a recent report that local councils could not maintain their current level of sexual health services as a direct result of those cuts. A spokesperson for London Sexual Health Transformation Programme said: “The e-service and self-sampling kits offer a new way for people to access services that makes the best use of new technology, recognises the changing way people get their information and health care and frees up face to face clinic appointments for those with greater need.” • This article was amended on 16 October 2017.

I have little idea about whether to sell and invest the capital for what I guess would be a return of about 2% from a bank or building society, or let the property which could give me a yield of about 5%. Similar houses in the area rent for £750 per month in the area. On the face of it, letting is more than twice as lucrative as putting cash in the bank, but what costs such as tax, and so on would I face? I am a standard-rate taxpayer and am likely to need an agent to manage the property for me as I live in Kent. Most of the advice I have read largely concerns buy-to-let, not outright ownership, so I’d be grateful to know what the matters to consider are. MS A You are right. On the face of it, letting the property is a much more lucrative proposition than selling the house and putting the cash in a savings account. That’s not least because you would be lucky to find an account offering more than 1.6% unless you are willing to tie into a fixed rate for a couple of years in which case you could get 2% or slightly more on your cash. You are also right that buy-to let for landlords with mortgages has become a lot less attractive since changes to the tax rules for relief on finance costs such as mortgage interest – as well as interest on other loans and loan arrangement and early repayment fees. Before 6 April 2017, a landlord could deduct all the mortgage interest from rental income to work out the tax bill. By 6 April 2020, landlords will be able to calculate what HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) calls a “basic-rate tax deduction” of 20% of finance costs which is subtracted from your tax bill. A useful guide to the tax issues involved in letting property is available in the online guide to letting a property from HMRC. But as you say things are different if you own a property outright as, without a buy-to-let mortgage, the tax changes for finance costs won’t make a lot of difference to how much tax you pay or on the return on your buy-to-let property. What will eat into your property earnings is the money you have to spend on getting the house into a state where it can be let. This may include redecorating and, if you plan to let the house furnished, buying new furniture which meets fire safety standards. It must include fitting smoke alarms and, if there are solid-fuel appliances, carbon dioxide alarms. You’ll also have to pay for a qualified registered electrician to check the electrics and provide an electrical safety certificate and pay a Gas Safe engineer to approve any gas appliances and, every year, provide a gas safety certificate. If you were to use the full management service of a letting agent – which makes sense as you live so far away from the house – you could be looking at a reduction of 20% (including VAT) in the form of the agent’s fee for managing the property in the amount of rent you get. There are extra costs for dealing with the tenancy paperwork, putting the tenant’s deposit into a government-approved tenancy deposit scheme, making an inventory and arranging works or refurbishment on the property. You also have to factor in the cost of insurance for the property as well as months when the property is empty and you’re not getting any rent. Taking just the cost of using a letting agent into account – and not any of the other costs mentioned – you might get after-tax rental income of just over £4,752 which represents a yield of 2.64% on the £180,000 house. However the true yield will depend on how much you have to pay for other costs. If they were to mount up to £1,000 or so, there would be very little difference in the after-tax income you would get from a savings account paying 2%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/13/jeremy-hunt-considers-barring-walk-in-patients-from-ae","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T11:49:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt considers barring walk-in patients from A&E","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/13/jeremy-hunt-considers-barring-walk-in-patients-from-ae","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/13/jeremy-hunt-considers-barring-walk-in-patients-from-ae","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt considers barring walk-in patients from A&E","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has floated the idea of stopping walk-in patients from attending hospital emergency departments in an attempt to head off a winter crisis in the health service. NHS England has denied it plans to pilot an idea that would require patients to consult their GP or NHS 111 before being allowed to go to A&amp;E. However, Dr Helen Thomas, its national medical adviser for integrated urgent care, said the health secretary was considering testing the idea. “Jeremy Hunt has mentioned to some of my colleagues, maybe we should have a ‘talk before you walk’ and we may well pilot that,” Thomas told a conference, according to a recording released by the doctors’ magazine Pulse. Labour, the BMA and the Patients Association said Hunt’s idea revealed the depth of the financial crisis facing the NHS. Thomas admitted that even piloting the idea was a “hot potato” but said early discussions had been held. “I think it’s been done in other countries where they’ve actually said you can’t come into ED (emergency departments) until you’ve talked on referral, or you have to have that sort of docket that you’re given by having talked on the phone that you do need to come to ED.” Speaking to an audience at an Urgent Health UK event in Birmingham on Thursday Thomas said that only 20% of walk-in patients called 111 before attending A&amp;E. Of the 80% who did not, she said: “Some of them will need ED, but there’s an awful lot that won’t.” Thomas admitted that making patients consult their doctor first would put pressure on GP out-of-hours services. NHS England played down Thomas’s comments. A source told the Guardian: “There are no formal plans to consider any pilots about stopping walk-in patients. It was just a pie in the sky possibility that Pulse have massively overblown.” Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said she understood the proposed pilot scheme would only involve phone referrals to A&amp;E via 111. If, as reported, it would also involve patients having to visit their GP, this would be counterproductive, she said. “Pressures in the NHS are not restricted to emergency departments – intense workload and workforce issues are being faced in general practice too, and this would simply create further capacity problems, and increase bureaucracy for a profession already drowning in it. “We know that the main issue contributing to pressures in A&amp;E is not inappropriate attendance, but a lack of hospital beds, and a lack of the community support services patients need when they are discharged, so they end up staying in hospital for longer than they needed to.” A Department of Health spokesperson said: “There are absolutely no plans to pilot this approach – patients can be reassured that unprecedented planning has gone into preparing the NHS for this winter, supported by an extra £100m for A&amp;E departments and £2bn for the social care system.” The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “The NHS is being pushed to the brink with underfunding so bad that ministers are in secret discussions to ban sick or injured people from walking into A&amp;Es. Patients deserve better. “Preventing patients from walking into A&amp;Es is not a plan to help the NHS but an abdication of responsibility. Labour would implement a proper plan to make sure accident and emergency services are available to those who need them.” Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said the A&amp;E idea was impractical: “Will the parent of a child who has fallen and broken their arm, for instance, really have to call 111 or get a GP referral first? Are they even likely to know such a bar exists? Will there be bouncers on the door, turning people away?” She added: “Maybe a pilot will identify some good ways of reducing genuinely inappropriate use of A&amp;E, but that this idea is even circulating speaks volumes about the consequences of the government’s decision to underfund the NHS. The chancellor must take note, and respond in his budget next month.” Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association, said: “Trying to solve a problem in one part of the NHS by shifting it on to another won’t work. Pressure on emergency departments is down to seriously ill patients and a lack of capacity and funding across the whole system.” He said the proposal would just increase both the pressure on staff and bureaucracy for patients. “It could also have the added effect of increasing the burden on the ambulance service as people could instead just call an ambulance to get a place in A&amp;E.” Nagpaul said better patient education about the purpose of A&amp;E was needed, but the government needed to “urgently address the funding, capacity and recruitment issues”. Meanwhile, Hunt said GPs needed longer than 10 minutes to meet some patients’ needs. Speaking at the Royal College of GPs’ annual conference in Liverpool on Thursday, he said: “The old model of 10-minute appointments doesn’t really work for patients with multiple long-term conditions who may need 30, 40, 50 minutes to get to the bottom of all their needs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/oct/15/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-loud","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'loud'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/oct/15/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-loud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/oct/15/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-loud","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'loud'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘loud.’ Share your photos of what loud means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

Members of the elite Russell Group are lobbying behind the scenes for modern universities to bear the brunt of any cuts. The prime minister, Theresa May, promised a major review of university fees in her speech to the Conservative party conference. There has since been a resounding silence from government on what this might entail, but vice-chancellors are privately resigning themselves to the likelihood of a cut to the maximum fee, which is currently frozen at £9,250. This will leave a funding hole. Smarting from the media storm about “fat cat” vice-chancellor salaries, whipped up by the former Labour education minister Lord Adonis, few university heads are willing to put their name to their views on funding. Yet serious divisions are opening up. The head of one Russell Group university, who asked to remain anonymous, says: “Ministers never intended all the new universities to charge the maximum amount. There are some stark surpluses in post-1992 universities, as their costs are much lower. The elephant in the room is whether all institutions should charge the same fees.” The same vice-chancellor points to the latest institutional data from the Office For Fair Access, the universities’ access regulator, which shows that Lincoln University has £800 more to spend on teaching per student than Oxford, after deducting bursaries and other support for under-privileged students. In 2018-19 Oxford will have an average of £7,915 left from each tuition fee after paying for these “access measures”, whereas Lincoln will have £8,732. A second vice-chancellor from the Russell Group agrees: “At my university with fees at £9,250 we just break even for home students. But some vice-chancellors have admitted to me that teaching a student only costs them £5,000. At Oxford that is probably closer to £15,000. So you can’t generalise and say the whole sector should be getting less.” He adds: “Just capping fees at £9,250 is costing us tens of millions over the next five years. I really hope the government is thinking of a way of varying fees, because at the moment the harm is being done to the research-intensives.” On the other side, Prof Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor of De Montfort University, reacts angrily. “The idea that modern universities are sitting on mountains of cash is a fallacy,” he says. “Fifty per cent of the sector’s unrestricted reserves are in the hands of just 14 institutions and 13 of them are in the Russell Group.” Shellard has been holding debates with students and staff at De Montfort on the future of student finance, and is calling for a royal commission to examine the issue nationwide. “Universities are being talked about in a way I can’t remember for a long time. But I don’t think vice-chancellors should duck their heads down because they are terrified of criticism of their salaries,” he says. “Universities are about debate and my students want to talk about these issues. Are students graduating with £50,000 of debt a good thing for the country?” Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, says: “Those calling for variable fees by institutional ‘reputation’ are very unlikely to be successful – and very unwise.” He argues that Worcester’s fees (set at £8,100 in 2012 and now £9,250) are based on the university’s “best estimate” of what it costs it to educate a student. The university’s income from government grants has fallen from two-thirds of its total to just 7%. “Jo Johnson [higher education minister] says the issue for students isn’t fees but value for money. He is wrong. The issue is tuition fees,” he says. “Not a single student has ever talked to me about value for money. But students do feel graduates are being asked to pay too much and that the government and firms should be making more of a contribution.” Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, is also dismissive of the idea that modern universities can more easily afford a cut. “Many have been caught in a perfect storm, losing full-time students in the new competitive market at the same time as part-time student numbers have collapsed. The idea that they are awash with cash is hard to sustain,” he says. “I’ve been hearing arguments for differential fees, but universities should be careful what they wish for. It could have unintended consequences, such as politicians meddling in what subjects they deliver.” One idea rumoured to be doing the rounds in the Treasury is that fees should reflect the salaries graduates can command. In June the government published the first full set of its Longitudinal Education Outcomes dataset, the first of its kind to track higher education leavers from university to the workplace. It highlighted real disparities in earning power across subjects and institutions, with subjects including the creative arts and mass communications coming out particularly badly. The salaries for some subjects varied widely according to which institution graduates had attended. For instance, five years after graduation average earnings for business and administration degrees ranged from £19,400 at the University of Wolverhampton to £71,700 at the University of Oxford. Hillman, who is in favour of controversial data like this being put in the public domain, warns that the results need a lot more discussion before they can safely be used to drive policy. But Shellard argues: “One of the dangers of the LEO data is you’ll know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Salary isn’t the motivating factor for many students. And once ministers start telling universities what they should and shouldn’t teach you are getting into very dangerous territory.” Amid the uncertainty, what unites the university sector is a fear that a fee cut will drastically reduce the money available to teach and support each student. Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, says: “It certainly looks as if there will be a push for lower fees. Labour’s offer looks very generous to students, but how you could abolish fees without slashing university funding, I don’t know. And we do know that abolishing fees benefits the middle classes most of all.” Riordan sat on the recent Diamond review of higher education funding in Wales, which ushered in means-tested maintenance grants to support students’ living costs. He argues that Theresa May needs to follow suit. “I think it was a mistake to abolish maintenance grants and make the less well-off students borrow ever more money. What students really want is money in their pocket now. If their family can’t provide that, the state should and then they would be more likely to go to university.” Shellard backs him up. “If you look at a university like mine with 50% black, Asian and minority ethnic students, the biggest single thing the government could do would be to bring back maintenance grants. It was a fetishisation of austerity when they removed them three years ago. It was a step too far.” The standfirst of this article was amended on 17 October 2017 to remove the reference to Cardiff university, which is also in the Russell Group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/13/age-birthdays-become-memento-mori","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T14:59:34Z","webTitle":"At my age, birthdays have become a memento mori | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/age-birthdays-become-memento-mori","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/age-birthdays-become-memento-mori","fields":{"headline":"At my age, birthdays have become a memento mori","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Monday My birthday. At 61, increasingly a memento mori rather than cause of much celebration, though I did have a lovely dinner with friends at the weekend. But even then I was just as aware of those who weren’t – and never would again be – there as those who could make it. Rather than go out on the day itself, I chose to remain at home and treat myself to several episodes of Ken Burns’s remarkable documentary on the Vietnam war. Quite why this series has not had bigger plaudits and been given a more primetime billing is beyond me. Some of the footage, such as Ho Chi Minh in Moscow during the 1930s, is just sensational. As are the interviews from survivors on both sides. I guess that to many people it is now just a forgotten American sideshow from 50 years ago, but to me it feels part of my childhood as I can still remember the news bulletins being dominated by horrific images of the war in the late 60s and the early 70s. Having got to bed by about 11, I was woken up by my phone ringing. It was my son. “Just how asleep are you, Dad?” he asked. Not as much as I had been. Or wanted to be. Tuesday It was hard to know which bit of Theresa May’s interview was most disturbing. The revelation that not even she believes in the government’s Brexit strategy or the news that the cabinet minister she would most like to take with her to a desert island was Liam Fox – the one person who almost everyone in the country could agree was a bit useless. The Financial Times had an interesting insight into the minister for international trade’s incompetence this week. On a trip to the US this summer, Fox took a team of 27 departmental officials with him, none of whom knew anything about trade negotiations. Their previous experience amounted to working for the British Film Council, the Better Regulation Executive and Enfield council. By contrast, the US came to the table mob-handed with 77 delegates, most of whom were old hands at trade talks. Predictably, no progress was made. Still at least the EU can’t accuse us of negotiating with the US behind their backs. Wednesday The metal barricades have been removed and the police guards have been stood down so I went to Tooting Bec Common to see what damage Wandsworth council had managed to do by chopping down a much loved avenue of chestnut trees, only a few of which were diseased and needed to be removed. It was worse than I had feared. The avenue looks like a Paul Nash first world war painting and almost everyone who lives in the neighbourhood is experiencing the loss of the trees as some kind of bereavement. It’s too late to do anything about it now, but the anger shows no signs of diminishing. All the council’s notices explaining why chopping down an entire avenue of trees was the right thing to do have been defaced with the word “lies”. One of Wandsworth’s more imaginative explanations was that it had sent round a survey to a small sample of people asking if they would like an avenue of trees. To which the answer was unsurprisingly yes. Because they already had one. To add insult to injury the council’s promised 20ft replacement lime trees are only about 15ft tall. My autumnal existential despair is almost complete. Thursday When I was trying to decide which novels to include in my 2010 book, Brideshead Abbreviated, I went through the US bestseller lists of the 1920s – the UK didn’t publish any bestseller lists till the 1970s as publishers and critics didn’t trust readers to make sound judgments about a book’s quality. The lists made sobering reading. In a decade of weekly Top 10 lists, there were only two books I recognised. Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence and Anita Loos’s Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. All the others, which had once been read and loved by hundreds and thousands of people, had been long since forgotten by almost everyone. Left to be pulped or gather dust. A metaphor for most of our lives. So it’s always heartening to hear of someone or something that beats the odds. Step forward then, Protoichthyosaurus applebyi, a fossil that for the last 50 years or so has been lying on a shelf unloved in the Nottingham University engineering collection. Someone has now come across it by accident and realised it is the first known fossil of its type anywhere in the world. Fame at last. There’s hope for us all. Friday A new report from scientists at Imperial College that magic mushrooms can have a therapeutic role in treating people suffering from depression fills me with misgivings. Though the researchers do point out that people shouldn’t self-medicate, it seems to me that’s precisely what anyone desperate enough to want to give the mushrooms a go is liable to do given that they are unlikely to be able to get them on prescription from their GP. My own experience with psychedelics would also suggest some caution. Back in 1976, I rashly conducted my own one-man Summer of Love experiment – frequently when I was meant to be working as an ice-cream seller in Oxford Street. After a while, the pleasures of seeing people melt into the pavement turned into acute anxiety and I ended the summer a near paranoid wreck. I never dared take psychedelics again. One of the few good decisions I made at that time of my life. Just the thought of my shrink prescribing them to me in place of my usual medication is enough to send my stress levels rocketing.

In Russia, nobody is laughing. The Death of Stalin, which chronicles the Kremlin infighting in the aftermath of the Soviet leader’s death in 1953, stars Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev, who eventually succeeds Stalin, and Simon Russell-Beale as Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin’s odious secret police chief. Beria is referred to as a “sneaky little shit” in one scene featured in the trailer by Georgy Zhukov, the commander of Soviet troops in the second world war, played in the film by Jason Isaacs, representative of the jokey tone of the film. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw said The Death of Stalin was the film of the year and gave it five stars. Many in Russia are less amused, however, as the film threatens to reopen heated Russian debates about the role of Stalin as the centenary of the October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power approaches. “The death of any person is not a subject for comedy, and even more so the death of a head of state and a great leader,” said Nikolai Starikov, a politician who leads a fringe nationalist party and has written a series of bestselling books on Russian history, including one glorifying Stalin. “He was the leader of a state that was an ally of Great Britain during the war. Could you imagine the Russians making a film mocking the death of a British king?” Starikov said the film was an “unfriendly act by the British intellectual class” and said it was very clear that the film was part of an “anti-Russian information war” aimed at discrediting the figure of Stalin. A spokeswoman for Russia’s culture ministry said she could not comment on whether the film might be banned in Russia, as no application for a licence had yet been made. A representative of Volga Films, the Russian distributor of The Death of Stalin, confirmed that the company had yet to submit an official request to the culture ministry for a licence for the film, saying this would take place after the UK premiere on 20 October. She said any public commentary about a potential ban was “simply speculation”. It is clear, however, that the prospect of the film being screened is already causing uproar among nationalists. The pro-Kremlin newspaper Vzglyad recommended the film should not be screened in Russia, calling it “a nasty sendup by outsiders who know nothing of our history”. Pavel Pozhigailo, an adviser to Russia’s culture ministry, said the film was a “planned provocation” aimed at angering Communists in Russia and had the potential to “incite hatred”. In the centenary year of the two revolutions, the official Kremlin narrative of Russian history avoids criticism of leaders and instead focuses on “Russian greatness”, whether under the tsars, the Soviets or President Vladimir Putin. The relentless focus on this has led to popular anger that the Kremlin itself sometimes finds hard to control. Matilda, an upcoming film featuring an affair between the last tsar, Nicholas II, and a ballerina, has led to protests and threats to attack cinemas which show it. Iannucci, who has satirised the US political system with Veep and the British system with The Thick of It, might find that Russians are a more sensitive target. “Modern Russia is very neurotic about its past – much more neurotic than the Soviet Union ever was,” said Roman Volobuev, a Russian film-maker. “In the USSR we had comedies about World War II and the October Revolution. Now, suddenly, it’s too sacred, ‘the wounds are too fresh’ and so on. Period films have to be either fuzzy and nostalgic, or gung-ho heroic.” Putin has calibrated his rare words about Stalin carefully, making sure not to praise the Soviet leader outright, but he has also refrained from direct criticism. Under Putin, victory in the second world war has become a sacred event that is portrayed as the main foundation block of the Russian state, and as a side-effect of this, positive views of Stalin have increased, due to his role as wartime leader. In June, Russia’s Levada Centre polled the country’s citizens on who they believed to be “the greatest person of all nations and all eras”, and Stalin came in first place. Putin came second, and the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin third. According to Levada’s Denis Volkov, Stalin’s popularity rose sharply in spring 2014, around the time of the annexation of Crimea, when nationalist rhetoric from the Kremlin increased. Since then, the polls have found more than twice the number of Russians assess Stalin positively than those who view him negatively. “This is not a coincidence. The [Crimea] events were taken by the population as a sign of the restoration of the country’s greatness – the same greatness which many people feel was created during Stalin’s rule and lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union,” Volkov wrote in a column for the newspaper RBC. The bitter reaction to Matilda has served as a further warning to Russian arts figures of the dangers of straying from the Kremlin-approved version of history. Volobuev said the long tradition of biting Russian satire had not died, but that film professionals were aware that satire was now unmarketable. “Every TV producer I know wants to do a political comedy; one of them literally has a picture of Armando Iannucci above his desk, right next to Putin’s portrait,” he said. “They just don’t want to lose money making something no network will run.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/13/uk-ministers-told-to-get-a-grip-after-accidental-deportation-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T11:02:19Z","webTitle":"UK ministers told to 'get a grip' after accidental deportation letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/uk-ministers-told-to-get-a-grip-after-accidental-deportation-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/uk-ministers-told-to-get-a-grip-after-accidental-deportation-letters","fields":{"headline":"UK ministers told to 'get a grip' after accidental deportation letters","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British government misinterpreted its own rules when it mistakenly sent more than 100 letters to European nationals ordering them to leave the country within a month or face deportation, a minister has admitted. The government confirmed it would reimburse those who spent money fighting the wrongful orders and Brandon Lewis, the immigration minister, said he had written to each to apologise. Ministers were urged to “get a grip” by the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, whose written question in parliament prompted the government’s admission on Thursday. “Mistakes like this are simply not acceptable and add further worry to the lives of EU nationals already anxious about their status here in the UK,” she said. “These are people who are our neighbours and friends and family, yet the government is treating them with contempt as second-class citizens. The government is turning lives upside down by callously playing hardball over Brexit and creating a ‘hostile environment’ for migrants. “Ministers need to get a grip, and make sure that an error like this never happens again.” The prime minister, Theresa May, described the episode as an “unfortunate error” when a Finnish academic, Dr Eva Johanna Holmberg, highlighted the issue in late August. Lewis confirmed that, between 11 and 16 August 2017, 106 letters were sent to people from EEA nations: the 28 EU member states, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. “The error made was an incorrect interpretation of the consequences of an EEA national’s unsuccessful application for a registration certificate. We have agreed to meet any reasonable associated costs incurred as a result of this error. We should be able to quantify the total cost in due course,” he wrote. The letter sent to Holmberg, who has lived in the UK with her British husband for most of the past decade, told her to leave the country or the Home Office would give “directions for [her] removal”, adding she was “a person liable to be detained under the Immigration Act”. After the case came to light, Holmberg, a visiting academic fellow from the University of Helsinki at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian: “It seems so surreal and absurd that I should be deported on the grounds that I’m not legal. I’ve been coming and going to this country for as long as I remember. I don’t know what kind of image they have of me but it’s clearly quite sinister based on the small amount of info they actually have on me.” Another recipient of one of the letters, Mihaela Duta, spent more than £1,000 on legal fees fighting the order. She said: “There are no words for how I feel. It was the worst week of my life. It took everything I knew and turned it on its head. “We borrowed the money from the bank. We need it back – we’re just normal people.” On Friday, it emerged that a British-American family was saddled with costs of £45,000 and split by the Atlantic Ocean after the Home Office refused to reverse a visa decision based on a misinterpretation of its own rules. The department has said it is reviewing the case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/13/uk-raids-suspected-suppliers-of-deadly-diet-drug-dnp","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T17:10:42Z","webTitle":"UK raids uncover suspected suppliers of deadly diet drug","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/13/uk-raids-suspected-suppliers-of-deadly-diet-drug-dnp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/13/uk-raids-suspected-suppliers-of-deadly-diet-drug-dnp","fields":{"headline":"UK raids uncover suspected suppliers of deadly diet drug","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A series of raids in northern England has uncovered an operation suspected of selling a deadly fat-burning chemical used by bodybuilders that has killed eight young people in Britain in the last two years. Around 11 kilos of the chemical 2,4-dinitrophenol, known as DNP, was found last month at premises in Wigton, Cumbria, alongside other legal supplements and equipment that could be used for making tablets. The premises are believed to be used by a company called Enhanced Athlete Europe, set up by a flamboyant ex-lawyer turned bodybuilding star who calls himself Dr Huge and has his own YouTube channel on which he extols the virtues of “the world’s most dangerous fat loss drug”. DNP is a fertiliser that can be used in explosives. Because it is not intended for human consumption, it is not regulated by the drug licensing authority but by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The raid last month was led by their National Food Crime Unit. Three local authorities and Northumbria and Cumbria police also took part, along with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Other sites were searched too. The FSA says it is still trying to speak to “those identified and connected” with the alleged DNP pill factory. In a statement, its chairman, Heather Hancock, said: “DNP can and does kill. We are relentless in pursuing those seeking to profit from the illegal sale of this toxic substance for human consumption. “We have been able to disrupt supply routes and close down websites. That stops people being put at risk from the severe harm that comes from consuming DNP.” It is believed that more than 60 people have died worldwide as a result of taking DNP, eight of them in Britain since 2015. They include Sarah Houston, 23, a medical student at Leeds, Chris Mapletoft, 18, from Twickenham who had just taken his A-levels and Eloise Parry, 21, a student in Wales. The substance heats up the body’s metabolism, burning fat, but it can cause drastic overheating. Its victims’ organs literally cook inside the body. Once taken, there is no antidote. Enhanced Athlete is based in Sacramento, California, fronted by Charles Anthony Hughes (aka Dr Tony Huge) who is said to have given up his legal practice to run the business. On his YouTube channel, he openly discusses the use of DNP with other bodybuilders. Other videos flaunt his lifestyle, showing off a Ferrari costing in excess of $150,000 and lifting women over his head. He runs the business with Scott Cavell, who was released from prison last year after serving time for mortgage fraud. Cavell was captured and deported from Ireland, where he had fled with a false passport and the proceeds of the fraud, turned into gold and coins. He resorted to drug dealing when it ran out. The pair are listed as the original directors of Enhanced Athlete Europe, which was set up in Gateshead. On Enhanced Athlete’s YouTube site, one of the staff in the US, Ryan Russo, told customers on 11 September that the Europe office “got raided”. But he reassured them that their orders would be fulfilled. “Everyone who ordered from Europe do not worry – the US will be taking over all those orders and getting them out to you. “Is Europe done with? No. Europe will be back online within the next coming weeks but the real reason that they were down for maintenance is that they were raided,” he says. The previous day, all customers were sent an email headed, “Freedom is under Attack!”. The email continued: “Enhanced Athlete Europe was visited by the regulatory authorities last week. All inventories, machines, and computers were taken until the investigation is concluded. As a result of this Enhanced Athlete EU will be temporarily closed for approximately two months whilst all our products are tested to ensure they meet label claims and we have all appropriate licenses so we are 100% legit. “Enhanced Athlete may have move to a more friendly European country as a result,” it said. It is signed: “Stay Swell &amp; Swole My Friends of Freedom, Tony Huge.” For DNP orders, it directed customers to a website selling fertilisers, which shares the same US business address as Enhanced Athlete. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is understood to be collaborating with the UK agencies. Meanwhile, Enhanced Athlete is being sued in the California district court by an attorney, Rob Tauler, who has been pursuing supplement companies that promote potentially harmful substances for years. Tauler, a Los Angeles attorney with Tauler-Smith LLP, is bringing the case under the federal false advertising law on behalf of a rival company called Nutrition Distribution, arguing that Enhanced Athlete is damaging sales and bringing the supplement industry into disrepute. Supplement manufacturers and suppliers have a great deal of freedom within the law on the basis that they are selling products that occur in nature, he said. Some companies, however, are packaging dangerous substances as supplements and making millions before the FDA is alerted. “The problem from law enforcement is that there simply aren’t resources to police niche marketplaces like bodybuilding,” Tauler said. “DNP is basically pesticide coming out of a smoke stack and these folks are ingesting it and losing weight because their body is trying to get rid of it. It is ingested poison. “The problem with the way the defendants in this case are marketing it, as if it is just a fun thing to do. Wow – we’re experimenting with our bodies and that’s so much fun. Well they’re making money, they are laughing all the way to the bank,” Tauler told the Guardian. “These guys are leaving all these casualties in their wake and the consumers have no idea. In fact they’ve been brain-washed in the other direction. They think that anyone trying to stop this is somehow infringing on their freedom.” Cheryl Gillan, the constituency MP of Sarah Houston, who died, and who has lobbied for DNP to be classified as a category C drug, said: “This dangerous drug is still being made available illegally and the suppliers must be stopped. People should be aware that it has been the cause of many deaths, cutting off the lives of young people in their prime.” The Guardian attempted to contact Hughes through his lawyer without success. Staff at Enhanced Athlete in the US said they did not sell DNP. In a court filing, the company denied Hughes had set it up and described him as a spokesperson. Cavell had not responded to requests for comment by the time of publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2017/oct/14/weekend-reading-hollywoods-dark-side-and-australias-cruelty","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Hollywood's dark side – and Australia's cruelty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2017/oct/14/weekend-reading-hollywoods-dark-side-and-australias-cruelty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2017/oct/14/weekend-reading-hollywoods-dark-side-and-australias-cruelty","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Hollywood's dark side – and Australia's cruelty","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The night Harvey Weinstein jumped on me All throughout the evening, Harvey Weinstein flirted and stared at me as if I was a piece of meat.

Jon Boulton, 27, who was a speechwriter and media adviser to the former minister for civil society Rob Wilson, had faced two charges of rape against a 25-year-old woman in Wimbledon, south-west London. Following a 14-month police investigation and court hearings spanning four months, Paul Douglass, for the Crown Prosecution Service, told Kingston crown court on Friday they were offering no evidence – formally terminating proceedings – following a review of the case. Judge Susan Tapping told Boulton, who lives in Stockwell, south London, that verdicts of not guilty would be recorded against the two counts of rape. Boulton was arrested on 16 April last year and charged on 27 June this year. He was initially charged with six counts of rape and appeared at Wimbledon magistrates court in July. He later appeared at Kingston crown court in August where the charges were reduced to two counts of rape. Boulton said: “I’m pleased that this is over. I’d like to thank my friends and family, and everyone who has stood by me over the last 18 months. I feel completely vindicated and would now like to put the matter behind me.” The alleged victim, now 27, told the Guardian she would seek a review of the CPS decision. “I believe the system has failed me,” she said. “I wouldn’t wish going through this process on anyone. I am now living with this and this has changed me. “After the whole process of such a long police investigation, I no longer have faith in the criminal justice system.” On Friday, Douglass told the court: “The crown has a continuing duty to review any case it brings before the court. The crown has discharged this duty anxiously and scrupulously.” He added: “A decision has been made to offer no evidence on both counts on the indictment.” Wilson is no longer a minister after losing his Reading East seat to Labour’s Matt Rodda in the general election in June. Wilson’s website previously said Boulton helped with “research, drafting of questions, speech-writing and national media” – but the references were removed after he was arrested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/13/mental-health-sectioned-black-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T09:47:21Z","webTitle":"I feel no shame about my mental breakdown: it helped make me who I am | David Harewood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/mental-health-sectioned-black-identity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/mental-health-sectioned-black-identity","fields":{"headline":"I feel no shame about my mental breakdown: it helped make me who I am","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tuesday was World Mental Health Day, and I was encouraged by a friend to tweet a word of support to help raise awareness of an issue that affects so many people in different ways. I picked up my phone and tweeted about my experience, 20-odd years ago, when I suffered a breakdown and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. In truth I didn’t think what I’d written was a big deal. So I was astonished at the reaction: 30,000 people all over the world liked or shared the post. My own breakdown started shortly after I left drama school. Despite a successful start, within a couple of years of becoming professional, I found myself deeply unhappy. It is fitting that I am writing this in the same week that government figures revealed the huge effects of ethnicity on life chances in Britain, because my own breakdown had everything to do with identity. Outside drama school, in the world of acting, I was being forced to get to grips with the reality that I was no longer just another actor. I was a black actor. Perhaps I was profoundly naive, but at no point during my time studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art did the colour of my skin cross my mind. I was a comprehensive school kid from Birmingham; I’d never heard of Bertolt Brecht, I’d read Othello and cried at a production of King Lear when I was at school, so I knew Shakespeare was kinda special. But that was about my limit. Suddenly, at drama school, I was exposed to all these amazing plays by all these astonishing writers. I played King Lear in my second year. But in the real world I was never going to play those roles. Outside Rada, those opportunities weren’t open to actors of colour, and leading roles were rare, particularly on television. I very quickly had to adjust my sails for shallower waters. It was immensely frustrating, since I knew I was capable of much more. But my blackness had trumped my talent. Things came to a head when I played the part of Sloane in Joe Orton’s Entertaining Mr Sloane at Derby Playhouse. When the play was first produced in London in the 1960s it caused a scandal and I leapt at the chance of the central role. What I didn’t realise was that I was venturing into the treacherous waters of representation, and the question of how, as a black actor, one is supposed to represent blackness. Sloane is a scheming, murderous, sexual deviant who ends up in servitude to two highly dysfunctional characters, and maybe I should have seen how my blackness could be seen to add a racial element to an already inflammatory set-up. The play was very funny. Press night was a success so I dared a peek at the reviews. I’d heard they were generally positive and they were. Only the journalist from the local black newspaper had given it the thumbs down, and he wasn’t holding back on naming names. “Mr Harewood should seriously examine his choices as an actor,” he wrote. “He shouldn’t represent the community in a such a vile manner.” He ended his piece by suggesting that if people did go to see the show, they should walk out if, like him, they were disgusted by what they saw. And so, for the remainder of the run, on some nights, as I delivered Sloane’s sordid soliloquy at the start of the second act, some of my brothers and sisters would get up and leave. Here I was, struggling with my black identity in a white world, and rejected by people who looked just like me. It was a confusing time. I began to lose confidence on stage. I started drinking, before and after shows. Manically throwing myself into performances was the only way I could block out what was happening in my head. But it was my next job that pushed me over the edge. I was cast as the “fool for interracial love” in a touring production of a very flawed play about black identity. It was a disaster, made even worse by the unwanted sexual advances of another member of the company. I couldn’t wait to get back to London, to see my friends and be happy again. But it was already too late. I haven’t got enough space in this article to tell you what happened between then and the day I was sectioned at the Whittington psychiatric hospital in Archway, north London, but I will say this: I had the most extraordinary time. Much of it I don’t remember but I have vague memories of travelling around London, performing “street theatre”, bursting into song on the tube and chatting to complete strangers. Help arrived when I had an audition in central London and turned up three hours late. The casting director, who later became a dear friend, recognised something was wrong and called my agent. Friends came and took me home. We all knew something was off but didn’t really know what to do because it looked on the surface as though I was having a great time. I visited a doctor but he fobbed me off with a bottle of pills after 20 minutes and said to my mates: “He seems to think he’s Lenny Henry! He should take these and get some sleep.” I threw the tablets in the bin on the way out. The first time I realised I was in serious trouble was when I tried to get out of the hospital ward I was on but I couldn’t because the doors were locked. I’d been sectioned. I had amazing support from friends and family, who visited me often and stressed to everyone at the hospital that although I appeared to be a scary big black guy prone to outbursts of song and verse, I was in fact an actor experiencing a nervous breakdown of some kind. My brother Paul offered me the best advice: “Dave … I know you’re flying a bit but if you wanna get out of here you’ve got to tone it down and start acting normal.” I took his advice. Even though the Largactil (an anti-psychotic drug) was making my head spin, I resolved to start taking control and cutting out the outbursts. Eventually, with rest and the amazing care of my mother, I got myself out of there, and within six to eight months was back at work. I’ve never had a repeat of what happened, and although many of the issues and pressures of identity and blackness are still with me, I’m much better at coping with them now. I’m more experienced, in life and in the industry too, and reasonably secure in who I am and how I fit in. Personally, I believe that episode has given me enormous strength. I’ve never been ashamed to talk about it – it’s my go-to pub anecdote – so I’m not sure why it’s taken so long to say it publicly. But I’m glad if what I said has given someone comfort or strength. If people now see me as the weirdo in the corner, that’s no concern of mine. If you’ve ever experienced or are experiencing some form of mental illness, I’d urge you to get some support and wish you the best of luck. It’s more common than you think. If you can find your way through the craziness, there’s treasure in it, I promise you. I know because I found some. As King Lear says: “Oh ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how this world goes.” • David Harewood is an actor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/13/brexit-wrangle-over-citizens-rights-is-nonsense-says-juncker","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T14:51:46Z","webTitle":"'Now they have to pay': Juncker says UK stance on Brexit bill untenable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/13/brexit-wrangle-over-citizens-rights-is-nonsense-says-juncker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/13/brexit-wrangle-over-citizens-rights-is-nonsense-says-juncker","fields":{"headline":"'Now they have to pay': Juncker says UK stance on Brexit bill untenable","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jean-Claude Juncker has upped the pressure on Theresa May over Britain’s Brexit divorce bill, acknowledging Europe’s debt of gratitude to the country “during the war, after the war, before the war”, but insisting: “Now they have to pay.”With EU leaders meeting for a summit next week, the European commission president used a speech in Luxembourg to express his frustration at the British government’s failure so far to commit to honouring its financial obligations to the bloc on leaving it. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, insisted on Thursday at the end of the fifth round of negotiations that the UK would only spell out what aspects of the past commitments it was willing to meet once talks were opened on the future trading relationship. As a consequence, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, claimed the talks were in a “very disturbing state of deadlock”. Juncker told students at Luxembourg University that the British position was untenable. “We cannot find, for the time being, a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the UK are concerned,” he said. “As we cannot do this, we will not be able to say during the European council in October that now we can move to the second phase of the negotiations, which means the shaping of the British-European future. Things have to [be] done. One has to deliver. “If you are sitting in the bar and you are ordering 28 beers and then suddenly some of your colleagues [are leaving without] paying, that is not feasible. They have to pay. They have to pay.” To laughter in the audience, Juncker added: “Not in an impossible way. I am not in a revenge way. I am not hating the British. We Europeans have to be grateful for so many things Britain has brought to Europe. During the war, before the war, after the war. Everywhere and every time. But now they have to pay.” Estimates on the size of the divorce bill have varied from about €60bn to €100bn (£54bn to £90bn). Juncker also dismissed the negotiations over citizens’ rights as a “nonsense”, claiming he could not understand why the British had not guaranteed from the start that everything would remain the same for European nationals – “or ‘foreigners’, as they are saying in London” – after the UK leaves the EU. Citizens’ rights is the aspect of the negotiation upon which the two parties are closest to a deal, but differences remain on a number of aspects, including the so-called right of family reunification, which would allow EU nationals to avoid having to meet an income threshold, as British citizens do, when they are seeking to bring a non-EU spouse to the UK. “Brexit is a serious issue,” Juncker said. “It came unexpected but not totally unexpected. Now we have to deal with the results and first to be impressed by the numerous disadvantages that Brexit – Brexit meaning Brexit – is entailing for the British. They are discovering, as we are, day after day, new problems. That is the reason why this process will take longer than initially thought.” Juncker continued: “We had the idea that we would clear all the questions related to the divorce, but it’s not possible. Citizens’ rights, yes, we are making progress. I don’t even understand this problem. Why not say, easily, with common sense – which is not a political category, as we know – that things will stay as they are? The Europeans – ‘foreigners’, as they are saying in London – they are there in the island, and so many British friends are here. Let them here, let them there. Why are we discussing nonsense like that?” The European council summit next week is expected to see the EU’s leaders conclude that talks about any future trading relationship with Britain will have to be delayed because of a lack of progress on the issues of citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the divorce bill. A document leaked on Thursday suggests that the European council president, Donald Tusk, will, however, invite the 27 EU member states to start working among themselves on their vision of the transition period and the future relationship, in the hope that sufficient progress on the opening issues can be made by a summit in December. One EU source said the move was both “prudent planning” and an attempt to push the UK to build on Theresa May’s pledge in her speech in Florence to pay its way, including the provision of €20bn to ensure no member state loses out in the two years after Brexit. During a wide-ranging speech, Juncker also attempted to play down suggestions that his recent state of the union address was an attempt to turn the EU into a single political entity. “I don’t believe a European citizen would really like to see the creation of a united states of Europe similar to what they have in the USA,” he said. “I’m not in favour of a united states of Europe, but I am in favour of further integration.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/13/uber-appeal-london-licence-tfl","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T10:06:24Z","webTitle":"Uber launches appeal against loss of London licence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/13/uber-appeal-london-licence-tfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/13/uber-appeal-london-licence-tfl","fields":{"headline":"Uber launches appeal against loss of London licence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Uber has lodged its legal appeal against Transport for London’s decision not to renew its private hire licence, as the ride-hailing app steps up its campaign to keep operating in one of its biggest markets. Uber London filed papers with Westminster magistrates court in an attempt to reverse a ruling that it is not a “fit and proper” company to run taxi services in the capital. Uber’s licence expired on 30 September, but Uber’s cars will remain available in London until the legal process is exhausted – potentially a year or more. A first hearing is likely to take place on 11 December, according to a judicial office spokesman. The firm indicated that it hoped it would resolve its issues with TfL without going further down legal avenues, although the appeal was essential for its continued operations in the short term. An Uber spokesperson said: “While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right.” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive since September, has apologised for the company’s past actions and promised to change – a public statement welcomed by the mayor, Sadiq Khan. The Uber boss came to London in early October for talks with the TfL commissioner that both sides described as “constructive”. TfL had previously indicated that the “conduct and approach” of Uber had been an issue. The licence decision had cited concerns including Uber’s approach to reporting criminal offences, how it conducted medical and criminal checks on drivers, and whether software employed to evade regulation was being used in London. Uber has also been criticised over its treatment of drivers, and is awaiting a separate tribunal ruling over the employment status of what it terms “partners”. It has been attempting to overturn a judgment that drivers – about 40,000 of whom work for Uber in London – have rights to paid holiday and the minimum wage. The debate over Uber’s future has divided Londoners, with more than 850,000 people signing a petition urging the mayor to revoke the decision. However, polls have indicated a small majority back the decision to stop a firm that Khan said was not “playing by the rules”. Uber says 3.5 million people in London have downloaded its app and used it at least once in the past three months. However, black-cab drivers argue that Uber is artificially driving down fares to a level that will not be sustainable in the long term.

During a Friday morning radio appearance, which came two days after a prominent British human rights activist was denied entry to the former British colony, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was repeatedly asked if Patten might also be turned away. “I can’t exclude any possibility because immigration matters will change depending on the case,” Lam said, adding that the government had the right to choose whom it admitted. She also said Beijing could block anyone if it considered their presence in Hong Kong to be a matter for the foreign affairs department in Beijing. In an email to the Guardian, Patten, who is chancellor of Oxford University, said he had written to Lam about her comments and was waiting for a reply. Referring to Britain’s pre-handover deal with China, which guaranteed Hong Kong’s way of life and high degree of autonomy from Beijing, Patten added: “I hope that she and her government still stand by the joint declaration and the basic law.” Benedict Rogers, the deputy chair of the Conservatives’ human rights commission, was barred from entering Hong Kong on Wednesday. Following protests from London, China said Rogers had been barred because he was “very clear as to whether he intended to interfere with the affairs of the special administrative region and the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary”. Rogers has been a vocal critic of China’s tightening grip on Hong Kong and Patten called the refusal disturbing and inexplicable. Lam attempted to assure the public during the radio interview, saying: “Decisions of this nature will not be taken arbitrarily; there must be clear evidence.” However, Rogers was given no reason or explanation as to why he was banned from Hong Kong. In response to his case, local lawmakers and activists launched a campaign titled “Stop Repression in Hong Kong” to tackle the “worst political repression” since the return to Chinese rule. Rogers has also announced plans to establish a new NGO in London focused on influencing policy-makers on Hong Kong issues. The US congressman Chris Smith, co-chair of the congressional-executive commission on China, said Rogers’s case was “another audacious blow to Hong Kong’s autonomy”. “I am shocked and saddened that the Chinese government is warning foreigners about who they can meet in Hong Kong,” he added. “There must be a concerted effort to push back with the leaders in Beijing and the government in Hong Kong. We all have a stake in ensuring Hong Kong remains an open city, with the rule of law and guaranteed rights currently unavailable in mainland China.” Patten served as governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997, and oversaw the handover of sovereignty to China. During his tenure he pushed for greater democratic reforms in the city, which were eventually rolled back by the Chinese government after Patten sailed out of Hong Kong on board the royal yacht Britannia on 1 July 1997. He was openly despised by officials in Beijing at the time and was previously branded “a sinner of a thousand years” by a high-ranking Chinese official for his efforts to increase direct elections in the city’s legislature. Patten has often returned to the territory, most recently in September when he called the jailing of the local democracy activist Joshua Wong a “political decision”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/13/trump-meet-parents-japanese-teenager-seized-north-korea-abductions-megumi-yokota","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T09:59:31Z","webTitle":"Trump to meet parents of Japanese teenager seized by North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/13/trump-meet-parents-japanese-teenager-seized-north-korea-abductions-megumi-yokota","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/13/trump-meet-parents-japanese-teenager-seized-north-korea-abductions-megumi-yokota","fields":{"headline":"Trump to meet parents of Japanese teenager seized by North Korea","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump will meet the parents of a teenager snatched from her home by North Korean spies 40 years ago when he visits Tokyo next month, as Japan attempts to maintain pressure on Pyongyang to resolve the cold war abductions of dozens of its citizens. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was arranging for the president to meet Shigeru and Sakie Yokota, whose daughter, Megumi, was abducted from her hometown of Niigata on the Sea of Japan coast in November 1977, when she was 13 years old. She was on her way home from after-school badminton practice when she was seized by spies, bundled aboard a boat and taken to North Korea. Abe said he had mentioned a possible meeting with the Yokotas and the families of other abductees when he met Trump in New York last month. “When I asked … he accepted on the spot,” Abe said this week. “He promised he would do his best to rescue the Japanese abduction victims.” Trump mentioned Megumi during his speech to the UN general assembly. “We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies,” he said. Megumi’s mother welcomed the reference to her daughter. “I was really surprised, but it was great, and I’m thankful to [Trump] for bringing up the issue and putting it into words in front of representatives from around the world,” she said, according to Kyodo news agency. “Every word on the issue is a chance.” The couple, who are both in their 80s, met Barack Obama when he visited Japan in 2014 and Sakie Yokota met George W Bush during a visit to the US in 2006. Megumi is one of 17 Japanese people officially listed as having been abducted by North Korea during the 1970s and 80s, when they were used to teach Japanese language and culture to Pyongyang agents. Campaigners believe the number of abductees could be as high as 100. In 2002, after years of denials, the North Korean leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, admitted his country’s special forces had carried out the abductions. He made the admission during a meeting in Pyongyang with the then Japanese leader, Junichiro Koizumi, and agreed to allow five of the victims to return to Japan. They were later joined by family members, including Charles Jenkins, an American soldier who deserted to the North in 1965 and married Hitomi Soga, a nurse who had been taken from Japan in 1978. Of the 12 remaining missing Japanese people, Megumi’s case resonates most with the public because of her young age and the violent nature of her abduction. Her parents did not find out that she had been abducted until 1997, when a former North Korean spy who defected to South Korea talked at length about a Japanese girl who matched her description. North Korea claimed she had committed suicide in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression, that another seven abductees had died of illness or in bizarre accidents, and that four others had never entered the country. When North Korea sent what it claimed were Megumi’s remains to Japan for analysis in 2004, tests showed they contained someone else’s DNA. Japanese media reports said the Trump administration would consider the abductions when deciding whether to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism in response to the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in February. Bush removed North Korea from the terror blacklist in 2008 in an attempt to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal. It is not clear how Trump and Abe propose to approach the abductee issue. Both support tough economic sanctions against the regime, while Trump has not ruled out a military response to a major provocation. Neither leader is willing to enter into negotiations as long as Pyongyang continues to test nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The prospects for a resolution practically vanished after North Korea pulled out of a 2014 agreement to investigate the abductions in protest at Japanese support for UN sanctions. Trump will fly to Japan early next month on his first tour of Asia, which will include visits to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/13/amazon-to-create-1200-uk-jobs-with-new-bolton-warehouse","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T15:33:19Z","webTitle":"Amazon to create 1,200 jobs with new Bolton warehouse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/13/amazon-to-create-1200-uk-jobs-with-new-bolton-warehouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/13/amazon-to-create-1200-uk-jobs-with-new-bolton-warehouse","fields":{"headline":"Amazon to create 1,200 jobs with new Bolton warehouse","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amazon is to create a further 1,200 new jobs with a warehouse in Bolton as it continues its rapid UK expansion. The warehouse, which will be the third to open in the north-west, will be one of a new generation of Amazon facilities that will see staff work alongside robots. Stefano Perego, an Amazon director, said the warehouse would take the total number of new permanent jobs the company has created in the north-west of England to more than 3,500 since 2016. Amazon, which will have 15 of the warehouses – called fulfilment centres – across the UK by the end of this year, employs a workforce of 24,000 across Britain. Amazon has started recruiting for a range of roles at the fulfilment centre, including operations managers, engineers, human resources staff and IT specialists. Warehouse staff will be responsible for picking, packing and shipping items alongside Amazon’s robots, which slide under a tower of shelves where products are stowed, lift the product and move it through the fulfilment centre. Perego said the Bolton staff would receive “competitive wages and comprehensive benefits starting on day one”. The warehouse will open next year. Fufilment centre staff will start on £7.65 an hour minimum, rising to at least £8.15 over their first two years of employment. The national living wage for over-25s is £7.50 an hour. However, employment conditions at Amazon warehouses have been the subject of scrutiny in several countries, including the UK. Last year Amazon was accused of creating “intolerable working conditions” at its site in Dunfermline after allegations that workers had been penalised for taking sick days. At the time, Amazon said it offered “great jobs and a positive work environment with opportunities for growth”. Last year, Amazon announced that it would open fulfilment centres in Daventry, Doncaster, Warrington and Tilbury in 2017, creating more than 3,500 permanent full-time jobs. The Daventry site opened in February, while Doncaster, Warrington and Tilbury began operating recently. Amazon also has research and development sites in Edinburgh and Cambridge, which are working on voice recognition services, drones, and developing Amazon’s online and mobile shopping services. By the end of the year, the company will have 1,500 UK-based staff working on R&amp;D."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/13/girl-17-was-sexually-assaulted-three-times-in-one-hour-in-east-london","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T08:49:13Z","webTitle":"Girl, 17, was sexually assaulted three times in one hour in east London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/13/girl-17-was-sexually-assaulted-three-times-in-one-hour-in-east-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/13/girl-17-was-sexually-assaulted-three-times-in-one-hour-in-east-london","fields":{"headline":"Girl, 17, was sexually assaulted three times in one hour in east London","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A 17-year-old girl was sexually assaulted on three separate occasions in one hour in east London by up to five suspects, police have said. The victim was making her way home after becoming separated from her friends following a night out at a club in Tower Hamlets last month, the Metropolitan police said. She was attacked three times in quick succession from about 11.55pm on Friday 29 September until about 12.55am on Saturday 30 September by three different men, the last of whom was part of a small group. CCTV footage and still images of two of the men – referred to as suspects two and three – have been retrieved from different cameras that the Met team has used to track the victim’s movements around the streets at the time of the attack. DI Suzanne Jordan, from the Met’s child abuse and sexual offences command, said: “This is a horrific multiple sexual assault on a young female who was simply making her way home after a night out. We would like to thank the members of the public who intervened to help her and possibly prevented her ordeal from continuing even further. “We believe two of the three were very serious sexual assaults indeed, and are determined to catch the persons responsible for these hideous crimes. I would urge anyone who recognises either male in these images to contact us as a matter of urgency. “We’d also like to speak to any witnesses who haven’t already come forward, or anyone with any information at all, however insignificant they believe it might be – it could prove crucial to progressing our inquiries.” The victim’s ordeal started shortly before midnight when she was first picked up on camera being carried by a man – suspect one – on Cambridge Heath Road. The pair are then seen appearing to go into a doorway on the same road, after which the man is not seen again on camera, but items of the top half of the girl’s clothing were subsequently found by the location. Shortly after midnight, another CCTV camera picks up the girl stumbling down Mint Street being followed by a different, bearded male, on a racing bicycle – suspect two. Images released by police show the man wearing a baseball cap backwards, a hooded zip jacket and a plain T-shirt underneath. He has dark trousers and a bag on his back. When the next camera picks her up a short time later, the man has approached her and they have reached Corfield Street. The CCTV indicates that he then directed the victim into an area set back from the street where they remain for a period of time. The camera then shows suspect two leaving this location and walking away. The girl, whose clothing appears dishevelled, emerges shortly afterwards and goes further down Corfield Street. Minutes later, about 12.45am, detectives believe the victim suffered a third attack, this time possibly involving two or three men. CCTV captures suspect three walking down Corfield Street and joining two other figures seen in the distance under some trees. He appears to bend down towards a spot on the kerb in between some parked cars. Detectives believe it is at this point where the victim was sexually assaulted. The footage reveals that the suspect has a distinctive gait, which gives him the appearance of walking unevenly and perhaps being slightly bow-legged. Following this, a member of the public spotted the teenager lying on the ground in Corfield Street in a state of distress and immediately rang 999 to alert police. Officers arrived shortly afterwards and took her for examination and specialist support. Officers believe it is possible that she was drugged and are in the process of conducting toxicology tests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/13/three-killed-skydiving-mission-beach-queensland","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T05:29:25Z","webTitle":"Experienced skydivers and female customer die in Queensland accident","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/three-killed-skydiving-mission-beach-queensland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/three-killed-skydiving-mission-beach-queensland","fields":{"headline":"Experienced skydivers and female customer die in Queensland accident","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police hope mobile phone footage and witness accounts can help piece together the cause of a skydiving tragedy in north Queensland that killed two experienced instructors and a local mother-of-eight following a mid-air collision. The two male instructors, aged 34 and 35, and 54-year-old local woman were found dead at Mission Beach – several kilometres from the usual beach landing point – just after 3pm on Friday. The instructors have been identified as Peter Dawson and Toby Turner. Kerri Pike, a Mission Beach mother of eight, was jumping in a tandem dive, understood to have been given to her as a birthday gift from her family. One instructor, who was jumping solo, was found in a backyard at Mission Beach, while the other instructor and Pike, who were jumping in a tandem dive, were found in a nearby tree, about 1.5km from the regular landing zone. A police statement said: “Initial investigations indicate that a solo skydiver may have collided with tandem skydivers in mid-air with their parachutes failing to deploy correctly.”A witness told the Cairns Post newspaper: “You could see one chute was tangled and it wasn’t opening. I was just watching him in free fall until he went behind the trees and that was the last I saw. It wasn’t good to watch. I had my heart in my mouth.” Queensland police has not named the trio, but the instructors have been identified on social media as Peter Dawson and Toby Turner. “All we can say is that our beautiful boy died doing what he loved. Our hearts are broken, but we know that every tear we shed Peter was worth,” Liz Dawson wrote on Facebook. It is understood members of Dawson’s family are travelling to Queensland on Saturday from Victoria. Investigators have asked anyone with footage of the incident to contact them. “We’re appealing for anyone that did witness or has some of kind of footage [of the incident] to come forward to police,” Senior Sergeant Peter Williamson said on Friday. “It’s a horrific scene, an unfortunate scene and there’s going to be a lot of families very upset as a result of this,” he said. “Any accident involving skydivers is not good for anyone. “This will have a huge effect on tourism and everyone knows Mission Beach runs on tourism.” Operating company Skydive Australia has indefinitely suspended its operations at Mission Beach while investigations into the incident continue. “The company extends its deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the individuals and families involved and the broader skydiving community,” it said in a statement. Skydive Australia said the solo skydiver was a “highly experienced instructor who had completed thousands of jumps … the other two were jumping as a tandem pair: a highly experienced instructor and a customer”. Queensland Police and the Australian Parachute Federation are investigating the tragedy. A report will be provided to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

It considers the personal histories families construct for themselves and the grand narratives they wish could have been. In 1969, a young Sylvia Moone watches the moon landing and longs for someone to sweep her off on an adventure. In 2017, she’s a crotchety old woman, her memory failing, and her son and daughter-in-law are trying to conceive. In 2055, her granddaughter, also named Sylvia Moone, is preparing to become the first person to set foot on the Red Planet in a corporatised post-Brexit, post-Trump world. Thompson, whose script beat more than 1,600 submissions to the 2016 Theatre503 playwriting award, has crafted a heartfelt text at once large and intimate. He questions the divine command to “be fruitful and multiply”, not just on Earth but also in the vast beyond – and the choice and the curse of barrenness, applying both to fertility and to the surface of Mars. The counterfactual linchpin of the play is an undelivered 1969 speech by presidential speechwriter William Safire titled In Event of Moon Disaster, which would have been read by Richard Nixon if Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin hadn’t made the trip back. The play is peppered with similar what-ifs. The free-spirited Sylvia longs to roam the Earth and despairs at a child that grounds her; her son Neil yearns for a father he never had and a child he and his wife can’t seem to conceive; and the young Sylvia has made a choice to journey away and never return to a family she loves. Lisa Spirling’s brisk, rhythmic direction imagines worlds unfurling on Sarah Beaton’s spare, two-tiered stage, and there are some clever technological and lighting interventions in an otherwise lo-fi environment. Rosie Wyatt plays the three incarnations of Sylvia Moone – young, old, and next-generation, switching deftly between – all on the brink of strident and abrasive, but softened by the characters around her. There are some lovely, deeply felt performances by Will Norris as Neil, Alicya Eyo as Julie and Thomas Pickles as the sweet and steadfast Dennis from Sylvia Sr’s youth. It is hard not to see shades of Alice Birch’s three-generation Anatomy of a Suicide here, with its interlocking, sometimes simultaneous timelines and examination of what children inherit from their parents. But Moone Disaster has less about bleak genetic determinism and more about the redemptive nature of hope, leavened by the bittersweet tang of joy and regret sprung from the choices each character makes. As the world of the play hurtles between past, present and future, Thompson sketches out the cycles of what one generation yearns to have and what the next takes for granted. It’s not just the parents who look at the stars and the children who strive to get there, but the grandchildren who arrive and wonder what might have been lost – and found – along the way. At Theatre 503, London, until 28 October.

It is all about timing. Japan wasn’t due to hold an election for the powerful lower house until the end of next year, but Abe spied an opportunity to take advantage of a weak and divided opposition. In addition, his approval ratings have recovered since the summer, when he was implicated in two education-related scandals. With echoes of his UK counterpart Theresa May, Abe has argued that Japan needs strong and stable government at a time of domestic and international uncertainty. Unlike May, however, his gamble is likely to pay off. He is expected to win approval for his hard line against North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, but he could struggle to convince voters of his plans to go through with a rise in the consumption (sales) tax in late 2019. The measure, which Abe says is needed to fund social security spending and later to pay down Japan’s debts, is unpopular with the public. He has tried to sweeten the move by promising a 2 trillion yen ($17.8bn) stimulus package to fund childcare, education and social care for the elderly. There is also an element of personal ambition: a comfortable win for Abe’s coalition would improve his chances of staying on as Liberal Democratic party (LDP) president next September, enabling him to become Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. Who is Yuriko Koike? Koike shook up Japanese politics in the summer of 2016 when she became the first female governor of Tokyo. Despite once serving as Abe’s defence minister during his first, short-lived, stint as prime minister a decade ago, Koike defied the LDP to run for the governorship and then formed a local party that routed her erstwhile colleagues in Tokyo metropolitan assembly elections in July. Her decision to return to national politics with the launch of Kibo no To (Party of Hope) on the day Abe dissolved parliament prompted speculation that she was about to transform the country’s political landscape. But just days into the campaign, there is markedly less talk of the Party of Hope as a credible alternative to Abe’s LDP after several disappointing poll results. Whatever happens, Koike – who decided not to run for the lower house herself in order to continue as Tokyo’s governor – will remain an influential figure. The former news anchor and Arabic speaker has described herself as a “conservative reformist” who wants to take on vested interests. A defence hawk who admires Margaret Thatcher, Koike also supports legislation to ban discrimination against Japan’s LGBT community and has described herself as a “compassionate conservative”. The election probably came too soon for the Party of Hope, but winning several dozen seats would lend credence to its claims to be a serious opposition party. What are the main issues? North Korea aside, the early phase of the election campaign focused on the proposed increase in the sales tax, from 8% to 10%, in two years’ time. While Abe insists the extra revenue is needed to fund social security spending, Koike has said she would freeze the hike and provide a basic income to poorer households. Her economic agenda – dubbed “Yurinomics” after her given name – is short on detail. She has spoken in general terms about promoting private sector investment though a combination of deregulation and taxing companies’ huge retained earnings, while ditching the aggressive public spending and monetary easing that have characterised Abe’s five years in office. Nuclear power is also on the agenda, almost seven years after the triple meltdown in Fukushima. Abe is pushing for nuclear reactor restarts that he says will lower Japan’s dependence on expensive fuel imports and help it meet its climate change commitments. Koike wants to phase out nuclear power by 2030 and increase renewables’ share of the energy mix to just under a third. Intriguingly, the Party of Hope’s platform vows to achieve “12 zeroes” – including “zero hay fever” and “zero abandoned pets”. How big a factor is the North Korean nuclear crisis? Abe has put the perceived threat from North Korean missiles at the heart of his campaign, not least because polls show most voters support his hard line against Pyongyang. Along with the low birthrate and large elderly population, North Korea’s missile programme represents a “national crisis” for Japan, Abe has said. The regime has sent two ballistic missiles over the northern island of Hokkaido in recent weeks, triggering alerts and calls for Japan to develop the ability to strike North Korean military site. Which party is expected to win? With less than a week to go, it is looking as if Koike will have to settle for a distant second. In contrast to the excitement that greeted her party’s sudden arrival on the political scene, Koike has been criticised for her high-handed approach towards liberal deserters from the Democratic party who had showed an interest in running as Party of Hope candidates. Some voters have questioned her decision to get involved in national politics while she is still in charge of a city of almost 14 million people. The absence of any real ideological differences between Koike and Abe, particularly on security, may tempt LDP voters to stick with the party they know, rather than the Tokyo governor’s newly formed band of “conservative reformers”. One poll this week even suggested that the LDP and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, could come close to retaining their two-thirds “supermajority” in the lower house. The Nikkei business paper put the coalition on course to win 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber. That was roughly in line with polls taken by other media organisations. The Nikkei survey projected Hope would win 69 seats, with the Constitutional Democratic party, a left-leaning group that wants to preserve the constitution, on just over 40 seats. Will it be business as usual if Abe’s party retains its majority? Abe has show little interest in altering his economic policy – a mixture of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform. The Tokyo stock exchange’s recent rise to levels not seen since the mid-1990s, plus encouraging growth and employment figures, will only reinforce his belief that so-called Abenomics represents Japan’s best chance of ending two decades of stagnation. The sales tax rise, though, could hit already weak consumer spending – a drawback Koike has pointed out in the run-up to polling day. On foreign policy, Abe will continue to take a tough stance on North Korea and cultivate his relatively good relationship with Donald Trump. Another five years in office will give Abe perhaps his last chance to pursue his long-held dream of revising Japan’s constitution. For postwar conservatives like Abe, the US-authored “pacifist” constitution places unfair constraints on the country’s self-defence forces and is rooted in irrational fears of a return to the disastrous militarism of the first half of the 20th century. At the very least, Abe wants the constitution to clarify the role of the country’s self-defence forces (SDF) to reflect new security challenges posed by a rising China, North Korea and international terrorism.

It was all a bit much for some on my Twitter feed, who saw the arcane, theoretical nature of the questions as yet another example of the institution’s exclusivity and self-regard, nothing more than a secret handshake between the privileged few. The thing about these interviews, of course, is that you can’t prep for them, notwithstanding the endless sites offering online advice, the numerous books that have been published promising to give applicants a cutting edge, the hothouse tutors who auction themselves off to those with enough money to pay their inflated fees. Oxford and Cambridge can be accused of many things, but I feel there’s a democratic instinct at the heart of the interview process. The questions are designed to preclude preparation; instead, they seek to show the shape of a student’s mind, the first flickerings of critical thought. I was prepared for my interview by the genial headmaster of the Sussex state secondary I attended. We met most mornings in the weeks leading up to that fateful October day and he’d fire questions at me about Eliot, Pound, Woolf and Joyce, my specialist subjects in what felt increasingly like a gameshow whose prize was my future. In the end, I wasn’t able to roll out any of the dozen quotes I’d learned by heart – the three dons (that’s what I called them in my head) quizzed me about an early 19th-century nature poem. I came out thankful only that I’d managed not to soil myself. With a little perspective, I can see two things about that interview. The first is that it was only partly aimed at testing me. It also offered me a glimpse of life within the tutorial system, of the kind of questions I’d be faced with during my time at university. I also realised that the interview was about my potential tutors deciding whether I was a pupil who would manage to stick out the three years of essays and exams, whether I’d bore them in tutorials, or infuriate them, or perhaps even surprise them with a few original thoughts. The English literature question in this year’s sample was set by one of those who interviewed me 18 years ago, Emma Smith. In it, she asks students to consider the difference between JK Rowling’s writing for children and adults. The choice of author is a conscious one, Smith says. “I worry that not all candidates might have the same access to a wide range of literature and I am careful to judge them on what they know, not on what they don’t know.” At a time when Oxford is seeking to be more inclusive and representative in its choice of students, the idea is to find out how students think about literature, rather than whether they’ve been forced to wade through Areopagitica. “Mainly,” Smith says, “I always want to know that whatever they are reading, candidates are reading thoughtfully and self-consciously and are able to think as literary critics about all the books they read.” Other questions on this year’s sample asked law students: “If the punishment for parking on double yellow lines were death, and therefore nobody did it, would that be a just and effective law?”; philosophy candidates had to consider if violence was always political; music students to design a new musical instrument and describe its sound. None was quite as fiendish as the (sometimes apocryphal) tales we were told in the run-up to our own interviews: of bricks lobbed through windows, of students asked to change a fuse in a kettle, of an interviewer who sat in total silence for 20 minutes, then told the student they could leave. I’m occasionally asked when speaking at secondary schools what advice I’d give to those facing Oxbridge interviews. First, I point them towards the lectures that Oxford has on its podcast station on Apple Podcasts (formerly iTunes U). Emma Smith’s talks on Shakespeare are brilliantly approachable and entertaining, but the anarchic, counterintuitive, critical approach they take to the plays is the perfect illustration of the difference between school and university. I also suggest they read The Silk Roads by Peter Frankopan. This book, which is subtitled A New History of the World, seeks to de-westernise our ideas of history, unlearns so much of what we’ve learned about the way the world was put together. Again, it’s about pushing students to question everything, to challenge received ideas, whatever field they’re in. It also helps that Frankopan is professor of global history at Oxford and a fellow at Worcester College. I emailed Frankopan to ask him for the inside line on the interview process and I’ll leave you with his response, which strikes me as decent counsel whether you’re sitting an Oxford interview or not. “My advice is simple: listen and think. These interviews are not about catching out applicants or stretching them to see who breaks and who doesn’t. They are about getting candidates to think. Some turn up with pre-packaged ‘greatest hits’ of things they want to talk about in the hope of impressing the interviewers; others think that agreeing with the questions will do the trick. (There are always a few who think that violently disagreeing with any premise will show ‘independent thinking’). The best thing to do is to stay calm and use the one thing that will get you into Oxford: your brain. We are not expecting you to solve the riddles of the universe. Just the potential that you might do that one day.” Alex Preston’s latest book is As Kingfishers Catch Fire This article was amended on 15 Oct 2017 to change a reference to a comprehensive school to state secondary school"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/football-league-blog/2017/oct/14/football-league-sheffield-united-keep-pace-at-top-while-luton-hit-seven","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T17:36:00Z","webTitle":"Football League: Sheffield United keep pace at top while Luton hit seven","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2017/oct/14/football-league-sheffield-united-keep-pace-at-top-while-luton-hit-seven","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/football-league-blog/2017/oct/14/football-league-sheffield-united-keep-pace-at-top-while-luton-hit-seven","fields":{"headline":"Football League: Sheffield United keep pace at top while Luton hit seven","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Championship • Sheffield United took their chance to draw level with Cardiff, the league leaders coming into the weekend, albeit a little unconvincingly with a 1-0 win over Ipswich at Bramall Lane. Chris Basham’s powerful header on 49 minutes was the difference, though the Blades’ afternoon was marred by a nasty injury when Cameron Carter-Vickers fell heavily on top of his team-mate Kieron Freeman. The Blades manager, Chris Wilder, confirmed that Freeman had dislocated his knee and faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines. • It has taken 13 games but finally Bolton have a league win. Sammy Ameobi and a Sam Hutchinson own goal put them two up against Sheffield Wednesday and although Kieran Lee poached one back to set up a nervy finish, which was full of chances and brilliant saves at both ends, Bolton held on. It is only one win in five games now for Carlos Carvalhal’s sinking Owls, a slump outdone by Leeds who fell to a third straight defeat at home to Reading, Modou Barrow’s late goal doing the damage. • While the rest of the games were done and dusted, two kept on going and both were eventually decided by 96th-minute goals. Denis Odoi’s last-gasp equaliser for Fulham denied Preston three points at Craven Cottage in a 2-2 draw, while Norwich finally broke through Hull’s stubborn 10-man resistance – 23 shots later – through Nélson Oliveira’s opportunistic flick to claim a point. • Millwall’s frustrating afternoon against Brentford was topped off when Lee Gregory’s equaliser was ruled out, with the referee, Lee Probert, bringing the game back for a penalty instead. Gregory stepped up himself, saw his spot-kick saved by Daniel Bentley and they lost the game 1-0. “It’s a hard one to take,” Neil Harris said afterwards. “We should have had four or five goals today. That isn’t good enough.” Results: Barnsley 2-2 Middlesbrough, Bolton 2-1 Sheffield Wednesday, Brentford 1-0 Millwall, Fulham 2-2 Preston, Leeds 0-1 Reading, Norwich 1-1 Hull, Sheffield United 1-0 Ipswich, Sunderland 1-1 QPR. • Full Championship table League One • For so long it looked like being 13th game unlucky for Shrewsbury after Graham Carey’s stunner had put Plymouth on course to end the Shrews’ unbeaten start to the season at 12 games. But Shaun Whalley fired a late reply to salvage a point and Shrewsbury remain the only Football League side with a 0 in the L column. • Even so, Wigan climbed above Shrewsbury to the summit with a 3-0 victory over Southend at the DW Stadium. Southend’s Jermaine McGlashan was sent off for what has been roundly denounced as a poor two-footed tackle on Callum Elder, Wigan’s Australian defender on loan from Leicester City, who was OK to continue. Michael Jacobs’ deflected strike, a breakaway finished by Nick Powell and an Ivan Toney tap-in claimed the points in style. • There was a moment of serious concern at The Valley when the referee, Robert Lewis, collapsed on to the pitch following an accidental collision with the Charlton striker Josh Magennis. Their game with Doncaster was delayed by seven minutes as Lewis received treatment, but fortunately he was well enough to be helped from the pitch via a combination of visiting players and home medical staff. Charlton were 1-0 ahead at the time through Tarique Fosu’s ninth-minute goal and held on to climb into the top six. • Oldham nicked all three points against Blackburn with a 90th-minute goal by the wonderfully named Queensy Menig, on loan from Nantes, scoring his first in English football. That is three wins in a row for Oldham, four in all competitions, and surely the caretaker manager, Richie Wellens, has now done enough to get the job on a full-time basis – despite the hierarchy’s rumoured interest in Paul Scholes. Results: Bristol Rovers 0-1 Oxford United, Bury 3-1 Bradford, Charlton 1-0 Doncaster, Fleetwood 2-2 Rochdale, Northampton 0-1 Wimbledon, Oldham 1-0 Blackburn, Peterborough 0-1 Gillingham, Plymouth 1-1 Shrewsbury, Portsmouth 2-0 MK Dons, Rotherham 2-0 Scunthorpe, Walsall 1-1 Blackpool, Wigan 3-0 Southend. • Full League One table League Two • It was a proud day for the Ameobi family: after Sammy’s goal for Bolton, Shola struck with a header in Notts County’s 2-1 win over Barnet at Meadow Lane, two days after he celebrated his 36th birthday at the club with chocolate cake. Exeter’s goalless draw with Wycombe means Kevin Nolan’s side are back on top of the table. • Manchester City were not the only side to rack up a seven-goal haul on Saturday, as Luton demolished Stevenage with Luke Berry scoring a hat-trick from midfield with head, left foot and right foot. His curling effort from the edge of the box into the top corner was the pick of the bunch. • There were a couple of big wins at the foot of the table for Morecambe, who beat Chesterfield 2-0 sparked by Adam McGurk’s precise free-kick, and Port Vale who saw off Cheltenham 3-1. Results: Accrington 1-0 Coventry, Chesterfield 0-2 Morecambe, Colchester 0-1 Carlisle, Forest Green 0-4 Newport, Grimsby 0-0 Crawley, Lincoln 0-0 Cambridge, Luton 7-1 Stevenage, Mansfield 1-3 Swindon, Notts County 2-1 Barnet, Port Vale 3-1 Cheltenham, Wycombe 0-0 Exeter, Yeovil 2-0 Crewe • Full League Two table"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/14/us-drone-strike-kills-14-isis-militants-in-afghanistan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T10:29:16Z","webTitle":"US drone strike 'kills 14 Isis militants in Afghanistan'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/us-drone-strike-kills-14-isis-militants-in-afghanistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/14/us-drone-strike-kills-14-isis-militants-in-afghanistan","fields":{"headline":"US drone strike 'kills 14 Isis militants in Afghanistan'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A US drone strike has killed 14 Islamic State militants, Afghan officials say.

As Australia prepares to join the UN’s powerful human rights council, officials from Canberra will appear before the UN human rights committee in Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday. But from Monday, a coalition of non-government organisations will brief the committee on rights issues across Australia, and the country’s compliance with global rights treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On the same day, Australia will be elected unopposed to the powerful, but controversial, UN human rights council, in New York. While a report prepared for the Geneva committee argues while Australia has made some positive steps towards improving human rights protection, such as sex discrimination laws and parliamentary scrutiny of rights in legislation, it says “in some areas Australia has clearly gone backwards”. Australia’s policies of boat turnbacks and indefinite offshore detention (re-introduced since Australia’s last assessment) are in violation of international law, and expose refugees, to whom Australia legally owes protection, to danger, and imposes cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. The federal government recently agreed to pay $70 million in compensation to men illegally detained in dangerous and damaging conditions on PNG’s Manus Island. Other issues cited as examples of Australia’s regression include: reports of systematic violence and abuse against children held in youth detention; the Australian federal police’s information-sharing with foreign security agencies that lead to the imposition of the death penalty; increased police powers to lock up indigenous Australians without charge; and extreme metadata retention laws. The director of legal advocacy with the Melbourne-based Human Rights Law Centre, Emily Howie, told Guardian Australia: “A close look at Australia’s human rights record shows that Australia is going backwards almost across the board – on treatment of refugees, indigenous incarceration, violence against women, protecting children in youth justice and the physical safety of people with disability”. “Even our basic democratic rights, once supported across the parliament, are being diminished by excessive secrecy in government and laws that stop people from speaking out even where they witness human rights abuses or government misconduct,” Howie said from Geneva. Howie said persistent rights issues had damaged Australia’s international reputation. “Unfortunately, the asylum policies and treatment of indigenous people cast a pall over Australia’s international reputation ... If Australia wants to be taken seriously as a champion of human rights on the [human rights] council, it urgently needs to lift its game.” In its report to the committee, the Australian government said it was committed to its international obligations and to upholding human rights. “Australia implements its international obligations through a range of measures, including through legislation, policies and programs at federal and state levels, and through common law.” The government defended offshore detention and processing as legal. “New memoranda have been entered into with both Nauru and PNG ... both countries agree to ensure that transferees will be treated with dignity and respect and that relevant human rights standards are met. “Having been granted the above-mentioned assurances by Nauru and PNG, and having assessed the totality of the circumstances, Australia’s position is that transferring people to the sovereign states of Nauru and PNG for the processing of their asylum claims and settlement there does not breach Australia’s international obligations.” Australia signed the optional protocol to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Opcat) in 2009. Eight years on, it has still not ratified the Opcat, but has promised to by December this year. The protocol would require Australia to establish a monitoring mechanism to monitor all places of detention, including immigration and juvenile detention, prisons and police watch-houses. In February, foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and attorney general George Brandis, in committing Australia to ratifying Opcat, said it would be “another significant human rights achievement for the Turnbull government”. “It will improve the oversight of places of detention in Australia, and it reflects the government’s commitment to preventing torture and mistreatment.” Howie said Australia must honour its commitment to finally ratify Opcat. “The case for it is clear. We’ve seen from the horrific images at Don Dale just how much we need a youth justice system that helps rather than harms children. That immigration detention has led to fear, violence, suffering and death. Ratifying Opcat is a step towards rectifying the conditions in which some of this harm takes place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/15/oligarchy-lessons-ancient-greece","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T10:00:29Z","webTitle":"How the oligarchy wins: lessons from ancient Greece | Ganesh Sitaraman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/oligarchy-lessons-ancient-greece","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/oligarchy-lessons-ancient-greece","fields":{"headline":"How the oligarchy wins: lessons from ancient Greece","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A few years ago, as I was doing research for a book on how economic inequality threatens democracy, a colleague of mine asked if America was really at risk of becoming an oligarchy. Our political system, he said, is a democracy. If the people don’t want to be run by wealthy elites, we can just vote them out. The system, in other words, can’t really be “rigged” to work for the rich and powerful unless the people are at least willing to accept a government of the rich and powerful. If the general public opposes rule-by-economic-elites, how is it, then, that the wealthy control so much of government? The question was a good one, and while I had my own explanations, I didn’t have a systematic answer. Luckily, two recent books do. Oligarchy works, in a word, because of institutions. In his fascinating and insightful book Classical Greek Oligarchy, Matthew Simonton takes us back to the ancient world, where the term oligarchy was coined. One of the primary threats to oligarchy was that the oligarchs would become divided, and that one from their number would defect, take leadership of the people, and overthrow the oligarchy. To prevent this occurrence, ancient Greek elites developed institutions and practices to keep themselves united. Among other things, they passed sumptuary laws, preventing extravagant displays of their wealth that might spark jealousy, and they used the secret ballot and consensus building practices to ensure that decisions didn’t lead to greater conflict within their cadre. Appropriately for a scholar of the classics, Simonton focuses on these specific ancient practices in detail. But his key insight is that elites in power need solidarity if they are to stay in power. Unity might come from personal relationships, trust, voting practices, or – as is more likely in today’s meritocratic era – homogeneity in culture and values from running in the same limited circles. While the ruling class must remain united for an oligarchy to remain in power, the people must also be divided so they cannot overthrow their oppressors. Oligarchs in ancient Greece thus used a combination of coercion and co-optation to keep democracy at bay. They gave rewards to informants and found pliable citizens to take positions in the government. These collaborators legitimized the regime and gave oligarchs beachheads into the people. In addition, oligarchs controlled public spaces and livelihoods to prevent the people from organizing. They would expel people from town squares: a diffuse population in the countryside would be unable to protest and overthrow government as effectively as a concentrated group in the city. They also tried to keep ordinary people dependent on individual oligarchs for their economic survival, similar to how mob bosses in the movies have paternalistic relationships in their neighborhoods. Reading Simonton’s account, it is hard not to think about how the fragmentation of our media platforms is a modern instantiation of dividing the public sphere, or how employees and workers are sometimes chilled from speaking out. The most interesting discussion is how ancient oligarchs used information to preserve their regime. They combined secrecy in governance with selective messaging to targeted audiences, not unlike our modern spinmasters and communications consultants. They projected power through rituals and processions. At the same time, they sought to destroy monuments that were symbols of democratic success. Instead of public works projects, dedicated in the name of the people, they relied on what we can think of as philanthropy to sustain their power. Oligarchs would fund the creation of a new building or the beautification of a public space. The result: the people would appreciate elite spending on those projects and the upper class would get their names memorialized for all time. After all, who could be against oligarchs who show such generosity? An assistant professor of history at Arizona State University, Simonton draws heavily on insights from social science and applies them well to dissect ancient practices. But while he recognizes that ancient oligarchies were always drawn from the wealthy, a limitation of his work is that he focuses primarily on how oligarchs perpetuated their political power, not their economic power. To understand that, we can turn to an instant classic from a few years ago, Jeffrey Winters’ Oligarchy. Winters argues that the key to oligarchy is that a set of elites have enough material resources to spend on securing their status and interests. He calls this “wealth defense”, and divides it into two categories. “Property defense” involves protecting existing property – in the old days, this meant building castles and walls, today it involves the rule of law. “Income defense” is about protecting earnings; these days, that means advocating for low taxes. The challenge in seeing how oligarchy works, Winters says, is that we don’t normally think about the realms of politics and economics as fused together. At its core, oligarchy involves concentrating economic power and using it for political purposes. Democracy is vulnerable to oligarchy because democrats focus so much on guaranteeing political equality that they overlook the indirect threat that emerges from economic inequality. Winters argues that there are four kinds of oligarchies, each of which pursues wealth defense through different institutions. These oligarchies are categorized based on whether the oligarchs rule is personal or collective, and whether the oligarchs use coercion. Warring oligarchies, like warlords, are personal and armed. Ruling oligarchies like the mafia are collective and armed. In the category of unarmed oligarchies, sultanistic oligarchies (like Suharto’s Indonesia) are governed through personal connections. In civil oligarchies, governance is collective and enforced through laws, rather than by arms. With this typology behind him, Winters declares that America is already a civil oligarchy. To use the language of recent political campaigns, our oligarchs try to rig the system to defend their wealth. They focus on lowering taxes and on reducing regulations that protect workers and citizens from corporate wrongdoing. They build a legal system that is skewed to work in their favor, so that their illegal behavior rarely gets punished. And they sustain all of this through a campaign finance and lobbying system that gives them undue influence over policy. In a civil oligarchy, these actions are sustained not at the barrel of the gun or by the word of one man, but through the rule of law. If oligarchy works because its leaders institutionalize their power through law, media, and political rituals, what is to be done? How can democracy ever gain the upper hand? Winters notes that political power depends on economic power. This suggests that one solution is creating a more economically equal society. The problem, of course, is that if the oligarchs are in charge, it isn’t clear why they would pass policies that would reduce their wealth and make society more equal. As long as they can keep the people divided, they have little to fear from the occasional pitchfork or protest. Indeed, some commentators have suggested that the economic equality of the late 20th century was exceptional because two world wars and a Great Depression largely wiped out the holdings of the extremely wealthy. On this story, there isn’t much we can do without a major global catastrophe. Simonton offers another solution. He argues that democracy defeated oligarchy in ancient Greece because of “oligarchic breakdown”. Oligarchic institutions are subject to rot and collapse, as are any other kind of institution. As the oligarchs’ solidarity and practices start to break down, there is an opportunity for democracy to bring government back to the people. In that moment, the people might unite for long enough that their protests lead to power. With all the upheaval in today’s politics, it’s hard not to think that this moment is one in which the future of the political system might be more up for grabs than it has been in generations. The question is whether democracy will emerge from oligarchic breakdown – or whether the oligarchs will just strengthen their grasp on the levers of government.

As insults go, it is mild. The right has no plan beyond a desire to turn Britain into a Randian dystopia where regulations vanish and the state withers. It has no policy beyond a nostalgic hope that Britain will sail across the wide blue oceans and conquer new markets as our imperial ancestors conquered them before. The right offers religion, not politics. Its faith is without blemish, the gospel runs. If Brexit fails, that is not because the faith is false but because heretical traitors, judges, civil servants and EU governments have schemed to defeat it. “He that doubteth is damned,” said St Paul. “For whatsoever is not of faith is sin.” Boris Johnson agrees. Thatcherism, Britain’s last revolt of the right, was preceded by years of hard planning in the Centre for Policy Studies and Institute of Economic Affairs. If you were around in the 1970s, you might have loved or loathed it. But you could not deny the right had built a programme for government. Today, there is no plan, no programme, no nothing. Instead of being populated by serious thinkers, Brexit’s thinktanks are filled with propagandists, tabloid hacks and tax-exile newspaper proprietors. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are columnists turned politicians. The Sun, Telegraph, Mail and Express do not just cheer on the cause while the grown-ups make the real decisions, as they did in Margaret Thatcher’s day. They are what brains the Brexit campaign possesses. Dominic Cummings, the director of Vote Leave, demonstrated the frivolity of the enterprise last year when he wiped his own campaign’s website after the referendum. It as if he was admitting the promises Johnson and Gove had made to 17.4 million voters were worthless. Now the heist had been pulled, he would destroy the incriminating evidence. A global movement against over-mighty states in Ronald Reagan’s America and Mikhail Gorbachev ’s Soviet Union sustained the Thatcher government. The Brexiters have no one beyond Donald Trump and they don’t really have him. Along with all his other faults – the racism, the narcissism, the incessant mendacity – Trump is an “America first” protectionist. He will never give us a sweetheart deal to make up for lost European markets, even if Congress let him (which it would not). The Brexiters have no allies, only enemies. Men such as Daniel Hannan and Bernard Jenkin have been fighting their opponents in the Tory party for 30 years. The wounds are too deep, the scars are too thick, for them to admit now the other side may have a point. If they once had a conception of Britain’s interests and the welfare of its citizens, they forgot it long ago. Beyond the desire to create an isolated state in the Atlantic, where welfare and regulations are slashed and climate change denied, is a more primal impulse. They cannot concede an inch to enemies, who have belittled them for most of their adult lives. Compromise in these psychological circumstances feels like a betrayal, even if the only compromise demanded of them is a compromise with reality. So be my guest and say that Brexit is a movement of organised stupidity. But accept that as propagandists the Brexiters are anything but stupid. They have been the most brilliantly successful manipulators of public opinion in modern British history. From the point of propaganda, their vices are virtues. During the referendum, the Remain campaign mocked Brexiters’ inability to offer the British a coherent account of our future. But laughter was misplaced. The inability to level with the public made the Leave campaign a moving target that never offered its opponents a clear line of attack. The religious insistence that supporting Brexit is a matter of faith, not reason, has the propaganda benefit of keeping supporters in line. Despite the collapse in the pound and living standards, despite the descent of the negotiations into the mire, not one prominent supporter of Brexit has admitted to the smallest doubt. The normal arguments of politics no more exist on the right than they do in the Church of Scientology. Who will break ranks when they know a movement run by vicious hacks will denounce them as traitors? Newspaper proprietors have power without responsibility, Stanley Baldwin said, the “prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages”. The harlot’s prerogative ensured that when Liam Fox said negotiating a deal with the EU will be “the easiest thing in human history”, or when David Davis promised in 2016 that by now we would have “trade deals with the US and China”, or when Johnson and Gove swore there would be £350m a week for the NHS, they never expected to be held to account. True democratic politicians are responsible for their words. The Brexit right never is. Last week, the right showed how it is always two steps ahead of its opponents. It demanded the punishment of Phillip Hammond for refusing to shake the magic money tree and spend on new quangos and custom and excise bureaucracies in case we cannot reach a deal. It was a revealing tantrum. They know Brexit is going wrong. When it is revealed to be a bloody mess, they want to be able to say: “It’s not our fault. If only the government had listened to us in October 2017 we would be prosperous and free.” The failure of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour frontbench to challenge the right is as irresponsible as the right’s failure to protect the national interest. Instead of listening to them, listen to the men and women who are prepared to fight in the Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalists and on the Labour backbenches. They know the best tactic is the simplest. “They hate it when you throw their words in their faces,” Labour’s Chuka Umunna told me. “They start shouting, ‘You want to refight the referendum’.” To which the only response is, you promised to cut immigration, boost prosperity, secure global trade deals and restore parliamentary sovereignty. You can’t just wipe that off the web and pretend it never happened. You do not win by treating 17.4 million people as stupid. You win by treating them as democratic citizens with the right to punish the men who made impossible promises. Once it is clear they will never be kept and were never meant to be kept, the question arises: is it time to think again?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/observer-killer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:01:14Z","webTitle":"Observer killer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/observer-killer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/observer-killer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer killer sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Normal Sudoku rules apply, except the numbers in the cells contained within grey lines add up to the figures in the corner.

Fans of the show would be able to view original sets, costumes and unseen footage (though none of the actors is involved). After the tour launched in Singapore, Michael Edelstein, president of one of the organisers, NBCUniversal International Studios, remarked: “One of the things we have learned is that selling Britishness to British people is not as interesting as bringing the British experience to Americans.” When he says “interesting”, does he mean “lucrative”? While Downton was a phenomenal success in Britain, Edelstein may have a point about Americans being more open to the idea of it being a totem of Britishness. Brits know Anglo porn, or stately home porn, when we see it. Never mind now, Downton wasn’t even representative of Britishness back then. Which may explain why most would think it absurd to yearn for an era when probably the most you could hope for was dying of consumption, aged 19, just after you finished blacking the grate in some toff’s scullery. Downton owes its success to ordinary British people having a well-developed sense of humour about yon (tainted) olden days and the ability to enjoy an upmarket soap opera without caring too much about historical accuracy. But that’s as far as it goes. Most people in the UK would be about as likely to view Downton as symbolising Britishness as they would be to call the police station about a murder, saying: “It was Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the lead piping!” In short, most Brits are able to separate fact from fiction, leaving it to American Downton Abbey fans to sigh nostalgically for a bygone Britain that so few people got to experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/14/harvey-weinstein-oscars-academy-holds-emergency-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T09:06:14Z","webTitle":"Stars welcome Academy move to expel Weinstein over sexual assault claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/14/harvey-weinstein-oscars-academy-holds-emergency-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/14/harvey-weinstein-oscars-academy-holds-emergency-meeting","fields":{"headline":"Stars welcome Academy move to expel Weinstein over sexual assault claims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hollywood stars have welcomed the expulsion of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In an unprecedented move after a special meeting held in Los Angeles on Saturday morning, the Academy board said: “We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over. “What’s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.” Among those who supported the decision was actor Mia Farrow, whose son Ronan write a New Yorker article in which three women alleged Weinstein raped them. She tweeted: “Proud of TheAcademy! Harvey Weinstein is out.” Emmy Rossum, the star of Shameless, wrote “Amen, the academy!!!” while Hellboy actor Ron Perlman tweeted: “As a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences I am proud of their decision to expel Harvey Weinstein.” Weinstein, 65, faces allegations of sexual misconduct from more than two dozen women and three of rape. He has apologized for having “caused a lot of pain” but has forcefully denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. It is believed he is currently in Arizona, receiving “treatment” related to his behavior. In its 90-year history, the Academy has expelled only one other member, and only because 83-year-old Carmine Caridi, an actor, violated specific written rules about sharing screener copies of films in 2004. No member has been expelled for unethical or potentially criminal behavior, including figures such as Roman Polanski, Bill Cosby and Mel Gibson, who have had high-profile sexual or domestic assault allegations made against them. The academy’s 54-member board of governors needed a two-thirds vote to trigger an expulsion, according to its bylaws. It voted “well in excess” of that requirement, according to the Academy statement. The Academy’s UK counterpart, Bafta, suspended Weinstein on Wednesday morning, calling his alleged behavior “completely unacceptable and incompatible with Bafta’s values”. In an emotional interview with The Hollywood Reporter published on Saturday, even Weinstein’s own brother advocated his suspension. “I have a brother that’s indefensible and crazy,” said Bob Weinstein, 62 and an executive at The Weinstein Company (TWC). “I find myself in a waking nightmare. My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls I say this with every bone in my body – I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed.” Prior to the decision others were less sure, arguing that pushing Weinstein out might set a difficult precedent. “For the Academy to treat Harvey as if he is the only creep in the business is wrong,” Mitchell Block, a member of the short films and feature animation branch, told the Hollywood Reporter. “The problem is far larger than just Mr Weinstein. The silence about the other sociopaths is deafening. I think the Academy should not move hastily and take action until it fully understands the scope of the problem and formulates a clear policy.” Weinstein has a complicated relationship with the Academy. On the one hand, according to a Quartz analysis, he is the second most-thanked person in Oscar award speeches over the past quarter-century, just behind Steven Spielberg and tied with God. His movies have been nominated for more than 300 Academy Awards. He won an Oscar himself as producer of the 1999 hit Shakespeare in Love. On the other hand, some Hollywood insiders say Weinstein was more tolerated than loved – he has long been known for a gruff, abrasive demeanor. “He’s never been an insider with them,” one anonymous member told Daily Variety. “They’ve never really liked him.” Many of the Academy rules around award-season lobbying were put in place in response to the type of aggressive campaigns Weinstein was famous for mounting. The New York Times first reported allegations against Weinstein this month. More than 30 women have now accused the mega-producer of inappropriate sexual behavior, including four who have alleged that he raped them. The most recent rape allegation was levied by actor Rose McGowan on Twitter. In a string of tweets directed at Amazon Studios late on Thursday, she wrote: “HW raped me.” Police forces in the US and the UK are investigating. In a statement issued after the New Yorker detailed allegations of rape, the TWC board said it was “shocked and dismayed” and “committed to assisting with our full energies in all criminal or other investigations of these alleged acts”. Sallie Hofmeister, a spokesperson for Harvey Weinstein, said: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. With respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.” In his Hollywood Reporter interview, Bob Weinstein said he had barely spoken to his brother in almost five years. “I could not take his cheating, his lying and also his attitude toward everyone,” he said. While he said he was aware his brother was “philandering with every woman he could meet”, he insisted he had little idea about the alleged predatory harassment. Weinstein insisted TWC could survive, in an interview in which, the Reporter said, he often became emotional. He and his brother, he said, ran separate companies so many of the people Harvey Weinstein did business with he had never met. “The members of the [TWC] board, including myself, did not know the extent of my brother’s actions,” he said. Weinstein also said he was a victim of his brother’s abuse, including physical abuse. “I do not put myself in the category at all of those women that he hurt,” he said. “But it’s a complicated situation when it’s your brother doing the abusing to you as well. I saw it and I asked him to get help for many years. And that’s the truth. He avoided getting the help. We begged him.” His brother should never be allowed back into the film industry, he said. “He lost his rights. He didn’t lose his rights to be rehabilitated as a human being. But as far as being in this town again? I mean, give me a break.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/14/chinese-museum-accused-of-racism-over-photos-pairing-africans-with-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T04:27:21Z","webTitle":"Chinese museum accused of racism over photos pairing Africans with animals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/14/chinese-museum-accused-of-racism-over-photos-pairing-africans-with-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/14/chinese-museum-accused-of-racism-over-photos-pairing-africans-with-animals","fields":{"headline":"Chinese museum accused of racism over photos pairing Africans with animals","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A museum in China has removed an exhibit this week that juxtaposed photographs of animals with portraits of black Africans, sparking complaints of racism. The exhibit titled This Is Africa at the Hubei Provincial Museum in the city of Wuhan displayed a series of diptychs, each one containing a photo of an African person paired with the face of an animal. In a particularly striking example, a child with his mouth wide open was paired with a gorilla and other works included baboons and cheetahs. The exhibit was eventually removed after complaints by Africans, including some living in China, the curator said. All the photographs were taken by Yu Huiping, a construction magnate who has travelled to Africa more than 20 times, has previously won awards for his work and is vice-chairman of the Hubei Photographers Association. Racial sensitivities are often muddled in China, where about 92% of the population belongs to the dominant Han ethnicity and ethnic minorities mostly live in the sporadically populated far west of the country. African countries are increasingly important trading partners, but cultural stereotypes dominate Chinese popular discourse on the continent. Wang Yuejun, one of the exhibit’s curators, said that comparisons to animals were typically seen as a compliment in Chinese culture, pointing to the zodiac signs that identify people with animals according to their birth year. “The target audience is mainly Chinese,” Wang said in a statement. But the museum understood the images offended “our African friends” and the pictures were removed to show respect for their concerns, Wang added. The offensive nature was first notices by a Nigerian Instagram user, Edward E Duke. In a post, which was later removed, he asked why the museum “put pictures of a particular race next to wild animals”. More than 141,000 people visited the show, which opened just before China’s week-long National Day holiday. China is rife with examples of tone deafness when it comes to race. China’s most popular chat app, WeChat, was forced to apologise this week after its software used the English N-word to translate a Chinese phrase that commonly means “black foreigner”. Last year a television advert for laundry detergent showed a black man covered in paint going into a washing machine and coming out as a sparkling Asian man. The video went viral around the world and caused outrage for its insensitive messaging. Over the summer China’s state news agency published a video during a border standoff with India featuring an offensive parody of a Sikh man, complete with a turban and fake beard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/14/trumps-biggest-enemy-isnt-the-media-its-poor-people","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T14:56:14Z","webTitle":"Trump's biggest enemy isn't the media.

It's poor people","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whenever talk turns to Donald Trump’s enemies, the Democrats and the media are always assumed to be at the top of his hit list. This is a man, after all, who cries out “Fake News!” almost as often as he draws breath. But Trump’s truest enemy isn’t any card-carrying journalist, progressive Democrat, or disgruntled member of the Deep State. It’s any American who doesn’t have much money. The irony of Trump was always his tin pot populism, speaking to people’s economic anxiety while doing everything possible to screw them over. It’s a testament to his cult of personality that he even retains the little popularity he has. Trump’s most dramatic move yet to dismantle Obamacare will surely punish many of the poor people who voted for him and the rest who didn’t. It will hurt the sickest and most vulnerable. More than anything else, that is Trump’s modus operandi. On Thursday, the White House announced that it would scrap subsidies to health insurance companies that help pay out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. This move came hours after Trump said cheaper policies with fewer benefits and protections for consumers would eventually hit the market. While some younger, healthier people could benefit from low-cost plans, both announcements threaten to further destabilize the Obamacare marketplace. If healthier people opt out of more comprehensive coverage, the cost of care for the oldest, sickest, and poorest will skyrocket. Obamacare is imperfect, but it did promise coverage to people with preexisting conditions who, under the old system, would’ve been locked out of the healthcare market. None of this matters to Trump. Since the Affordable Care Act – once upon a time, a market-driven approach to healthcare championed by conservatives – was Barack Obama’s signature achievement as president, it deserves to be destroyed. He cannot stomach anything related to the legacy of the first black president. If it carries Obama’s stamp, it must be eradicated. Trump couldn’t do this legislatively because he had no serious alternative to Obamacare. Republicans in the Senate balked at his madness. Now, he will chip away at our healthcare system anyway he can, proving to his frothing base he is trying his best to eviscerate what Obama left behind. The poor, of course, will be collateral damage, and in that way Trump is more your conventional 21st century Republican, only less organized in thought and action. Had Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz prevailed last year, they would also likely be in the process of trying rip healthcare away from people. The national Republican party is the plutocrat party. Its entire intellectual foundation rests on the assumption that the poorest and weakest deserve to suffer. This isn’t to excuse Democrats, who have been too beholden to corporate interests. The greatest corrective to Obamacare, a public option, died during negotiations because insurance companies with plenty of clout in a Democratic Congress insisted they shouldn’t have to compete with a cheaper, government-run plan. Obamacare was good for insurance companies: it created new customers. A single-payer, Medicare-for-all plan is the only humane answer here, though a public options could at least help stabilize markets. We know Trump has no interest in pursuing either path. He is a rich bully who fights for rich bullies. As vacuous as he is mean, he is willing to shred healthcare as we know it to make a point. What he doesn’t understand is how much his own party will be blamed for this coming debacle. Barack Obama doesn’t live in the White House anymore. Republicans control every level of government. Were Trump a different kind of person – wiser, saner – he would probably give this some thought."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/14/atletico-madrid-v-barcelona-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T20:42:33Z","webTitle":"Atlético Madrid 1-1 Barcelona: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/14/atletico-madrid-v-barcelona-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/14/atletico-madrid-v-barcelona-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Atlético Madrid 1-1 Barcelona: La Liga – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Barcelona’s 100% record has gone, but they will be much happier after breaking Atlético’s resistance with 10 minutes to go. They stay top, five points clear of Real Madrid and have escaped with a point from a typically ferocious test against Diego Simeone’s side. Thanks for joining me, and keep an eye out for our report online shortly. Enjoy your evenings. Bye! Messi aims his shot to the right of the wall, but Oblak is in the right place to gather it, and an excellent game ends in a draw. 93 mins: Antoine Griezmann gives the ball away with seconds left, and in a state of panic, hacks Messi down just outside the area. He’s booked, and Barcelona have a free hit to win the game... 92 mins: Saùl becomes the only on-field player in the book, after tugging Umtiti’s shirt. 91 mins: Deulofeu almost combines with Suárez to find a breakthrough. Both he and Sergi Roberto have made a difference since coming on. What idiot said they wouldn’t? 90 mins: Three more minutes... 89 mins: Luis Suárez, who looks a different player to the sluggish figure of the first half, fires over Oblak’s bar from 20 yards out. 88 mins: Barcelona could, maybe should, have nicked a winner here. Gomes finds space on the left and takes down a through ball tidily. He has time to pick his spot but opts to flick a pass across goal towards Suárez, who is inches away. 86 mins: Fernando Torres is on in place of Gabi for the final few minutes. Can he find a winner? Can anyone? 85 mins: Paulinho tries a backheel to Messi, and Godín responds with a pirouette to elude the Argentinian. This has been a lot of fun. Sergi Roberto charges upfield from right back and curls in a perfect cross which Suárez, finally getting half a yard in the area, heads down and beyond Oblak. He orders the home fans to shush, but they don’t need further encouragement. ...and they’ve got their equaliser! 81 mins: Suárez again test Oblak, this time from a narrow angle on the edge of the six-yard box. Despite Atlético’s relentless defence, Barcelona are still finding the narrowest of gaps... 79 mins: Paulinho comes on for Rakitic; the former Spurs man has impressed at Barcelona, but that change suggests a lack of attacking options on the bench. 78 mins: Messi is once again denied by Godín, who steps up to cut out his pass to Suárez. What a terrific defender he is. 76 mins: Juanfran puts his arm across Jordi Alba and catches him with his elbow. Alba makes rather a meal of it, but it’s just a free kick. It’s cleared but ends up back at the feet of Umtiti, who offers the sort of shot you’d expect from a centre-back up for a set-piece. Here’s Mark Turner on the second yellow card debate: “It’s the same principle as when your mum used to clip you round the ear: 1) I’m warning you, lad. 2) “I bloody well warned you, lad. 3) Thwack. 2) is superfluous, but always present.” 73 mins: Carrasco, who has had an excellent game, is replaced by young holding midfielder Thomas Partey, moments after Gomes lashes a shot over the bar from 20 yards. 72 mins: If Atlético can keep this up, they’ll stay unbeaten and climb to second, three points behind Barcelona. 70 mins: Rakitic moves forward and links up with Messi, who gets the ball back via a deflection. He takes aim at the far corner, but lashes his shot just wide under pressure from Godín. That was an inch wide, maybe two. 68 mins: Deulofeu is offering a bit more thrust up front, with André Gomes dropping into midfield. He bustles all the way to the byline, but is eventually crowded out. Simon McMahon has some thoughts on the whole two yellow cards business: “I was always under the impression that two yellows and a red, although resulting in the same punishment, were different in that they carried different ‘weightings’ when it came to categories of offence, appeals, disciplinary points etc.” That did occur to me, but that could always be addressed later on – after all, there are different punishments for different types of red cards. Are there any leagues where they don’t bother with brandishing the second yellow? Let me know. 65 mins: ...Messi is forced to go the long way round from Suárez’s lay-off, and shoots from an angle even he found too tight. 64 mins: Saúl steps up to rob Messi off the ball, that red and white wall in front of the penalty area still standing firm... 62 mins: Two changes for Barcelona. Iniesta goes off, replaced by Gerard Deulofeu, and Sergi Roberto comes on for Nelson Semedo. I’m not sure either of those will help. 60 mins: Suárez appeals for a handball against Savic, and replays show the ball hit the defender’s arm – even if he seemed to be moving it out of the way. Seen them given! 59 mins: Simeone makes a change, withdrawing Angel Correa and bringing on Nicolás Gaitán to offer some extra solidity. 56 mins: Barcelona free kick, as Suárez gets lost in a tangle of legs. It’s 25 yards out, dead centre. Messi curls the ball over a wall that has about six Barça players in it – and hits the post! 55 mins: As the home crowd bellow relentlessly in the background, Suárez steps around his marker and powers a shot on goal that Oblak turns smartly away. After a stop-start first half, this one is approaching top gear now. 53 mins: Griezmann is everywhere at the minute, and he peels into acres of space to meet Koke’s deep cross with an ambitious volley that pings beyond Ter Stegen’s near post. 52 mins: More gaps at the back for Barcelona, and Griezmann breaks alongside Correa – but his team-mate is stopped by a well-timed Piqué challenge... 51 mins: Atlético respond, Carrasco charging forward and forcing Umtiti to step forward. When he does, the ball is switched via Griezmann to Juanfran, who ought to do better with his low cross. 49 mins: Barcelona playing with more purpose here, and Alba is set free at the byline. With options in the middle, he wildly overhits his cross from the left. 48 mins: Messi drops deep to start a passing move, gets the ball back, goes past Saúl and tumbles over his outstretched leg. It was telegraphed from Messi, but should have been a free kick all the same. 46 mins: An early free kick is whipped in by Carrasco, but Umtiti is on hand to head behind. From the corner, a one-two catches Barcelona cold and Carrasco stings Ter Stegen’s palms from a tight angle. Both teams are unchanged as the second half begins. Half-time reading Half-time thought Gabi, booked early on, lived a little dangerously in that first half with a couple of errant tackles but avoided a second yellow card. It got me thinking – what exactly is the point of a second yellow card? Why not just show them the red card? Thoughts welcome. Saúl Ñíguez’s fine strike is the difference at half time, and a blunt looking Barcelona have a job on their hands to maintain their 100% record. They do, of course, have Messi though. Back shortly. 45 mins: ...Atlético break and Rakitic scythes down Griezmann. The referee plays an advantage, Atléti faff too long, he blows for half time and books Rakitic. 44 mins: Barca pushing forward with greater urgency as the first half ticks down. Messi steps away from his marker but his shot is blocked by Savic... 42 mins: A first glimpse of Messi in a little while, dancing between defenders after André Gomes chases down a lost cause. He is eventually stopped, but it takes three or four players. 41 mins: Rakitic is tripped by Gabi in midfield. It was a touch cynical, and Gabi has already been booked. 39 mins: Barcelona’s clearest sight of goal since the opening minute as Iniesta, stationed on the left, cuts through the defence with a diagonal to Suárez – but his shot from a tight angle is blocked smartly. 37 mins: Suárez does burst into life to reach an overhit pass from Jordi Alba, but his cross is dealt with, the hosts comfortably outnumbering Barcelona in the penalty box. 34 mins: Suárez, ineffectual so far, loses the ball under pressure from Juanfran, and exchanges some choice words with Uruguay team-mate Godín. 32 mins: Messi’s free kick is curled in towards Suárez and Piqué, but the former jumps like there’s lead in his boots, putting Piqué off and missing the ball completely. 31 mins: When Barcelona attack, Atlético look comfortable with everyone bar Griezmann behind the ball – but Juanfran is harshly penalised, and the visitors have a set piece out left, 20 yards from goal... 29 mins: Carrasco fires in a cross from the free kick, but Umtiti gets his head to it first, and Ter Stegen collects the loose ball. 27 mins: Another humdrum Barcelona move breaks down and Atlético push forward again. Griezmann picks the ball up from Carrasco and is needlessly bundled over by Rakitic. 25 mins: Barcelona push Atlético back again, but the hosts are happy to sit on the 18-yard line and repel them. Their unconvential front three isn’t really clicking. 23 mins: As well taken as Saùl’s goal was, it stemmed from Atlético finding space in front of the back four – the sort of gap Paulinho, on the bench tonight, would have surely been stationed in. The hosts enjoyed their longest spell of possession in 10 minutes, before Carrasco threaded a pass to Saúl, who found a gap in the Barcelona midfield. He shaped to shoot just outside the area, and picked out the far corner with an unstoppable strike. And just like that, Atlético are ahead, after a brilliant curling finish from Saùl! 19 mins: The game has settled down after a gung-ho opening 10 minutes, with Barcelona probing down the left but getting no joy from Atlético’s defence. 16 mins: Umtiti clatters Ángel Correa but no yellow card is forthcoming, prompting howls of derision from the home crowd. 14 mins: Gabi picks up an early yellow card for an agricultural challenge on Messi, who dusts himself off to take a free kick that Atlético clear away. 12 mins: Barcelona get their foot on the ball, stroking it around their curious formation – Suárez is joined by André Gomes up front, with Messi lurking in behind them. 9 mins: Griezmann means business, and creates an even better chance all by himself – cutting inside, he nutmegs Piqué and leaves him sprawled on the deck, but can’t quite add the finish, his low shot parried away by Ter Stegen. 7 mins: Atlético have responded well, and Koke slides a pass in to Griezmann, who forces a fine save from Ter Stegen at his near post! 5 mins: Correa, playing up front alongside Antoine Griezmann, is presented a chance as Godin wins the ball in midfield – but he’s slow to react and Umtiti recovers to clear. 3 mins: Barcelona, bedecked in light blue kits (who do they think they are, Manchester City?) have started at a brisk pace, with Iniesta the latest to charge forward before being swamped by red and white shirts. The game begins and within 20 seconds, Lionel Messi so nearly scores! He picks the ball up and, as if still in Ecuador, heads straight for goal. He’s held up in the area but twists to sneak a shot beyond Oblak that squeezes just wide of the near post! In the tunnel at least, it’s all very cordial as hands are shaken and backs are slapped. The players head out to that sea of red and gold; it’s hard to tell if this display is meant to be hospitable or hostile. Maybe someone with better local knowledge can give me a clue, but for now, time to focus on the game. From the admittedly limited visual evidence I’ve seen, the Catalonia issue remains front and centre tonight. Barcelona are warming up in a training top in Catalan colours, while plenty in the crowd have brought their Spanish flags along. Barcelona’s trip to the Spanish capital is their first match since playing Las Palmas at an empty Camp Nou. The issue of Catalonian independence has loomed large in the build-up, and both club presidents will appear on the pitch beforehand to spread a message of harmony. Juan Mata spoke eloquently on the subject, and plenty of others, in his interview with Donald McRae: It’s not great when you see confrontations. I had sad and worrying feelings but I hope it can end in a good way with no violence. I hope some kind of resolution will be possible, through dialogue and goodwill from both sides. Football plays a very important role in Spain and Catalonia. It has the ability to unite people like little else. Atlético Madrid (4-4-2): Oblak; Filipe Luis, Godín, Savic, Juanfran; Carrasco, Gabi, Saúl, Koke; Griezmann, Correa. Subs: Moyá, Lucas, Giménez, Thomas, Gaitán, Gameiro, Torres. Barcelona (4-4-2): Ter Stegen; Semedo, Umtiti, Piqué, Jordi Alba; Busquets, André Gomes, Iniesta, Rakitic; Messi, Luis Suárez. Subs: Cillessen, Denis Suárez, Mascherano, Paulinho, Deulofeu, Digne, Sergi Roberto. Fresh from hauling the nation of Argentina to the World Cup, Lionel Messi is ready to strap FC Barcelona back onto his shoulders. Messi has scored 13 goals for Barça this season – 11 more than any other player – as they have overcome Neymar’s departure, and the wider political turmoil in Catalonia, to maintain a perfect league record. That will be put to its most serious test so far tonight at the Wanda Metropolitano, Atlético Madrid’s glowing monolith straight out of Blade Runner. Their old stadium was a fortress, but not against Barcelona – in fact, Diego Simeone has yet to win a league game against tonight’s opponents.

The Everton player treated his family to a trip to spend some time with relatives living in Perth, and spent a few weeks criss-crossing the continent taking in all the tourist sights, including Uluru, formerly known as Ayers Rock. Nothing unusual in that: Davies still lives with his parents and it was his way of showing his gratitude for the support they gave him when he was establishing himself as a footballer. “We all had a great time,” he explains. “Just doing normal things like anyone would on holiday. Then one day at Ayers Rock a guy came up and said: ‘Excuse me, are you Tom Davies?’ I was amazed. I don’t get that all that much at home, never mind in outback Australia. And this guy was an Australian, not even a fellow tourist.” Davies might have to get used to it sooner rather than later. Still only 19, his already distinctive appearance draws attention to what he does on the field, which is usually quite a lot. “I get around the pitch,” he says, modestly. “I like to think I bring a bit of energy to the team. My game has always been quite high-energy, that’s what I think I am good at.” Others think so, too. The confidence and composure he has shown since Ronald Koeman gave him his first-team break last season belies his age, and even though he has found himself in and out of the side as Everton have struggled for results in the last couple of months – at Brighton on Sunday they are looking to avoid a fifth defeat in eight league games – his response to the situation is a mature one. “It’s part of football, isn’t it?” he says. “I didn’t expect my career to be all flowers and roses. This is just another part of my development really, a good challenge. I’ve got to show I’m good enough to deserve a place and I’m definitely going to work on that. “The players Everton have brought in have quality, I’m already learning from them in training. I don’t want to be negative about anything, the standard in training has gone up, even if our results aren’t showing that at the moment. What I have to do now is work hard to try and get ahead of the players that have been brought in, and I am willing to give that a go. No one actually told me that the second season is often more difficult than the first for a young player but I’ve managed to figure that out for myself.” There have been suggestions that Koeman has unbalanced the team with the summer acquisitions and some supporters clearly feel that with Davies in the side Everton’s performances this season might not have been so uneven, but the midfielder is not about to complain about a manager who showed enough belief in him to make him a first-teamer at the age of 18. “Ronald Koeman is a manager who demands high standards,” he says. “That’s the way he is and for me that’s been good because he’s brought a lot out of me. He’s already taught me a lot about the game. You can say he is demanding but as a manager that’s what you need. “He sets high standards for the team and if you don’t meet them you are going to hear about it. If you give the ball away you know you are going to get told you need to do better. Even when we are not playing well he’s not going to let you off if you make a mistake, but that’s good for us all. He might come across as tough but he’s got a side to him where you can go up and speak to him.” Someone else Davies has found himself speaking to of late is Wayne Rooney, perhaps an even bigger footballing icon to a lifelong Evertonian. Rooney joined Everton at the age of nine, Davies at 11, long after the forward had left for Manchester United. Yet it would not be an exaggeration to say the younger player has spent his entire life looking up to the older one. Even now it is possible to detect a sense of awe when Davies reflects on the trophies Rooney has won and the career statistics he has put together. “Wayne has been great, but I don’t mind admitting it was kind of weird when he came back,” Davies says. “It was strange having him around at first, almost surreal actually, but after a few days it all felt quite natural again. He offers help and advice, he took me aside for a chat once after I had come off the pitch unhappy with my performance. “For someone who grew up supporting the club that still takes some getting used to, but it says a lot that after the career he’s had and everything he has won he still takes an interest in how younger players are getting on.” Rooney would not be able to get all the way to Uluru before being recognised, and Davies is not sure how he would cope with that level of fame and attention, but for now he is happy doing what he has always done. “I’m in a bubble at the moment, enjoying my life and my football,” he says. “I still have the same friends I’ve always had, I still like to go out around Liverpool. In one way everything changed for me last season but in another way everything stayed just the same. I don’t have any immediate plans to do anything differently.” That goes for the trademark rolled-down socks, too, though Davies is happy to confirm he is not attempting a fashion statement, an act of rebellion or a homage to favourite players from the 1960s with his casual-looking approach. “It’s just the way I like to play, my calves get quite tight if they are compressed, so I have always rolled my socks down. It just feels more natural. Referees don’t mind as long as the pads are in place. I’ve been doing it since I was a kid so I don’t see any reason to change now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/13/trump-iran-deal-jcpoa-sanctions-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Trump risks making US rogue actor as he condemns Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/trump-iran-deal-jcpoa-sanctions-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/trump-iran-deal-jcpoa-sanctions-congress","fields":{"headline":"Trump risks making US rogue actor as he condemns Iran nuclear deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The content, tone and style of Donald Trump’s speech about Iran on Friday was a reminder of how much the current president of the United States relishes conflict. With his domestic legislative agenda stalled and a federal investigation scrutinising his finances and his relations with Moscow, Trump has taken to finding enemies to rail against, including the press and black football players who kneel during the national anthem. The tactic galvanises his core supporters and seems to rejuvenate him. He appeared similarly energised excoriating Iran on Friday. But taken into foreign policy, Trump’s visceral drive for confrontation threatens to add a second nuclear crisis to the one Trump has already escalated in the Pacific with North Korea. The 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA), was aimed at ensuring that nearly 40-year feud between the US and revolutionary Iran did not mutate into a confrontation between two nuclear states. In return for sanctions relief from six major powers and the international community as a whole, Iran accepted very deep constraints on its nuclear programme. Its current stockpile of enriched uranium, for example, is just over 1% of what it was before the deal. But in his speech, Trump completely ignored the non-proliferation gains represented by the JCPOA, and portrayed the repatriation of Iran’s previously frozen assets as money for nothing. He made the false claim that Iran had been on the point of “total collapse” when the agreement was signed. His claims that “the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement” were also misleading at best. On two occasions, Iran’s stockpile of heavy water flowed over the ceiling imposed by the deal, but the situation was quickly rectified and Iran’s reserve is now below the limit. Nor is heavy water a direct proliferation threat. It is used in certain reactors that produce plutonium as a by-product. However, under the deal, Iran has destroyed the only reactor of that type. Trump’s remark that Iran had “failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges” appeared to refer to an ambiguity in the deal that has since been resolved and was not declared to be a violation. Trump’s litany of Iran’s past alleged crimes was also highly contentious, including an effort to link Shia Iran with the Sunni militants of al-Qaida, and in particular Osama bin Laden’s 1998 attacks on US embassies in east Africa. The state department did not comply with White House pressure to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation, but the Treasury did make that designation – under a relatively obscure clause – marking the first time a major part of a country’s armed forces has been described as terrorist. It was – to say the least – a risky move given that troops from both countries are in close proximity in Syria and potentially elsewhere in the region. Trump’s speech also dimmed hopes that the nuclear deal could escape Trump’s hostility if he passed the decision over its fate to Congress. Congress is deeply divided over the issue and therefore might end up doing nothing, European diplomats had reasoned. But after Trump’s remarks, that escape ramp appears to be blocked. Trump has called on Congress to add conditions to those Iran already complies with under the JCPOA, restricting ballistic missile development and extending restrictions on its nuclear programme indefinitely. Even if a deeply divided Congress agreed on such changes – which would require the support of 60 senators – there is no realistic possibility Iran would accept them. In that case, Tehran would be bound to cast the US as the rogue actor on the world stage – and Washington’s European actors would find it hard to disagree. “Iran is not going to comply with provisions imposed unilaterally by the US. If the US then imposes sanctions or scraps the deal, then the US will be left highly isolated,” said James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The US will be blamed across the world for the collapse of the Iran deal, other countries will not cooperate with the US in reimposing sanctions on Iran, and the end effect will be that Iran’s nuclear programme will be unconstrained and the US will have no leverage to try to constrain it.” However, if Congress does not agree on new conditions, Trump threatened to “terminate” the deal himself, by executive order. If he sticks to his word, the JCPOA appears doomed in its current form. The other signatories could try to keep it going but major European companies are likely to flee Iran for fear of losing US markets. The benefits for Iran would shrink significantly, as would incentives to abide by its strictures. A change of mind is always possible. Trump on Friday said he was “always open” to negotiation with North Korea after weeks insistenting that he had no intention of talking to the regime. Yet his animus towards Tehran, stoked by Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seems, if anything, even more deeply entrenched."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/the-war-with-no-end-why-american-television-refuses-to-leave-the-trenches","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T10:00:37Z","webTitle":"The war with no end: why American television refuses to leave the trenches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/the-war-with-no-end-why-american-television-refuses-to-leave-the-trenches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/the-war-with-no-end-why-american-television-refuses-to-leave-the-trenches","fields":{"headline":"The war with no end: why American television refuses to leave the trenches","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Military shows have always had a special place in the American television landscape, often reflecting the country’s feelings about its armed forces, and their role in the world. The dominant mood in the 1950s and 60s was light. Sitcoms such as The Phil Silvers Show, Gomer Pyle, USMC and Hogan’s Heroes presented military life as a goofy romp, even if it was happening in a Nazi prison camp. When the national mood soured in the 70s, the tragicomedy M*A*S*H* hinted at the nation’s growing disillusionment with the Vietnam war. Even the 80s camp of The A-Team tapped into widespread distrust of the government after various scandals, including the Iran-Contra affair. Since 2001, the global war on terror has been the focus of the majority of military shows, with most feeling fearful or angry. From network procedurals like 24 to prestige offerings like Homeland, the terrorist threat has been real, imminent, and often deadly. America’s enemies will not give up or sue for peace. They must be defeated. Fortunately, America is guarded by exemplary soldiers. Shows about elite military teams, like The Unit (2006-09) and Six (2017), have extolled the courage, camaraderie and loyalty of American soldiers. Only rare exceptions, like David Simon’s Generation Kill (2008), have expressed deep skepticism about America’s foreign adventures. This autumn’s three new military shows – The Brave, Seal Team and Valor – don’t all share Simon’s skepticism. They may be more diverse in terms of cast, but they still portray American soldiers as heroes, their enemies as irredeemable villains and the global war on terror as necessary, even just. These shows come at a time when the American public is ambivalent about its global mission. In a Pew survey from last year, 57% of Americans wanted the US “to deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with their own problems as best they can”. But the survey also found that a plurality of Americans wanted more military spending. A majority wants the US to remain the world’s only military superpower, and an overwhelming majority listed Isis as the top global threat. The Trump administration has tried to seize on this tension, turning NFL players’ protests against racial injustice into a simple referendum on the flag and US military. While none of these new shows is so straightforwardly rightwing, they still subtly prop up the military-industrial complex. NBC’s The Brave is potentially the wokest of the new crop and never misses a chance to insist that the women and Muslims on the squad are as committed and capable of fighting the terrorists as anyone. “Amir, doesn’t it make you angry to be sitting in a mosque next to a guy who might blow your head off some day?” asks the impolitic joker of the unit. “It makes me angrier than you, a non-Muslim, could ever understand,” retorts Amir, played by Hadi Tabbal. During a lull in the action, the unit’s female sniper tells her squad leader that he is “the only commanding officer I’ve ever had who looks at me and doesn’t see a woman first”. Their diversity, it turns out, is their strength. Yet underneath this veneer of religious tolerance and you-go-girl feminism, The Brave is belligerent, even bloodthirsty. In the pilot episode, the unit’s handler in the “Defense Intelligence Agency” declares: “We are fighting people who want to wipe us off the face of the planet. That means we have to be as ruthless as they are.” Her team seems to agree. “Unfortunately there is evil in the world, and sometimes power only bows down to more power,” states the squad’s preacher, played by Demetrius Grosse. If so, then maybe the military does need more money. It certainly needs to maintain its global reach. Seal Team also contrasts the expertise, valor and nobility of America’s soldiers with the cruelty of their foes. In the pilot episode the team’s leader, played by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer star David Boreanaz, would rather capture a terrorist than kill him. In another episode, the Syrian regime uses VX gas on its own people, while the American soldiers risk their lives to save them. But Seal Team at least hints at problems with America’s wars: Boreanaz’s character has PTSD, a soldier points out that the US army used to make VX gas, and the Department of Defense seems indifferent to the plight of the poisoned Syrian civilians. But these problems are brushed aside rather easily. PTSD in this show is a personal obstacle, not a reason to doubt the wisdom of war. As for the VX gas, Boreanaz reminds his friend: “We are the good guys, because we’re not actually using this stuff.” When another soldier suggests that the top brass may be right (maybe America can’t take responsibility for imperiled civilians around the world), Boreanaz responds that there is “not a lot of honor in that” – meaning, in the name of America’s honor, the fighting must continue. The most skeptical show of the bunch is CW’s Valor, which began this week and is about a crack squad of helicopter pilots. It trades the other shows’ moral “monster of the week” format for a longer arc, in which the pilots prepare to retrieve members of their squadron, left behind in a mission gone wrong, from Somali terrorists. The show’s hero Nora Modani, played by the Spanish actor Christina Ochoa, faces sexism on the job, both from commanding officers and her boyfriend. And while on The Brave and Seal Team the soldiers and intelligence agents work in perfect harmony, Valor suggests that the CIA may not have best interests of American soldiers at heart. The show is even critical of the US public, presenting Americans as only too happy to have our battles fought overseas by tiny units like these. “People don’t want boots on the ground,” Madani’s co-pilot tells her. “So this is what war is now: covert ops, blurred lines. That’s what you joined.” Even if the government is indifferent to the fate of its soldiers, and even if American special forces blur moral lines, the rescue mission has to go forward. Valor may be critical of American warfare, but there still seems to be no other option. These shows tell Americans, 57% of whom are skeptical of our open-ended, globe-spanning war, that the cause is probably just, and at the very least necessary. The soldiers on these shows are not invaders or occupiers. They are rescuers. Charged with liberating captives and defending the helpless, their missions, like the war on terror itself, must continue week after week, regardless of the costs, with no end in sight. The Brave and Seal Team offer the soothing message that Americans can have it all: extending military power to every corner of the globe yet becoming “less involved” because there are fewer boots on the ground. It’s too soon to tell if Valor, like M*A*S*H*, will consistently voice doubts about the country’s longest-running war. Here’s hoping it does. As vital as it is to keep this administration from entering any new wars, it may prove harder to end the old ones. If these three shows are anything to go by, the end of the war on terror is hard even to imagine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/07/what-trump-did-this-week-la-vegas-puerto-rico","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"What Trump did this week: Puerto Rico, Las Vegas, 'Morongate' and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/what-trump-did-this-week-la-vegas-puerto-rico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/what-trump-did-this-week-la-vegas-puerto-rico","fields":{"headline":"What Trump did this week: Puerto Rico, Las Vegas, 'Morongate' and more","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last weekend This column faded to credits last week with Donald Trump locked in a spat with the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital city, a row he escalated in typical fashion on Saturday. Attacking Carmen Yulín Cruz for her “poor leadership ability” as the island struggled to recover from two devastating hurricanes, he lamented of the citizens of the US territory in colonial style: “They want everything to be done for them.” The president has had difficulty striking the right tone in the wake of hurricanes that have wrecked Texas, Florida and now Puerto Rico, but during the latest disaster tactlessness seemed to give way to an irritated paternalism. Trump took a different tack with his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, but nevertheless undermined him too. Tillerson had said the US had opened direct lines of communication to North Korea. This, said Trump, was a waste of time. “Being nice to Rocket Man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now?” the president asked on Twitter, conflating Kim Jong-un, who took office in 2011, and his father and grandfather. Monday Late on Sunday night one of the awful rituals of American life began again when a gunman in Las Vegas shot dead 58 people and injured almost 500. On Monday Trump called the shooting – the worst in recent American history – an “act of pure evil”. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, deflected talk of gun control reform by claiming: “There is time and place for political debate, but now is the time to unite for the country.” Tuesday Trump used different language to say much the same thing, telling reporters “we’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes on” as he set off to visit Puerto Rico. At a press briefing on the island, Trump praised his administration’s performance and chided the storm-wracked citizens for the cost of the recovery effort: “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack.” As comedian Jimmy Kimmel remarked: “Next time you allow a storm to ravage your island please think about – we’re not made out of money – think about the cost.” The president also threw paper towels out to locals at a relief centre as if they were basketballs. Wednesday Visiting Las Vegas, Trump displayed the same clumsiness evident when visiting natural disaster zones, noting of the shooting: “It’s a very, very sad day for me, personally.” He continued to deflect the debate over gun control, telling reporters: “We’re not going to talk about that today.” In Washington, pressure was building for a relatively minor reform: the banning of the “bump-stock” devices that were found in Stephen Paddock’s room and which make semi-automatic weapons fire much faster, to horrific effect. Elsewhere the absurd side of the Trump presidency was on display again as Tillerson disavowed an NBC report that he had considered resigning but refused to deny the bit in the story in which he called Trump as a “moron” at a meeting of White House national security officials and members of the cabinet. “The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec Tillerson and @VP Pence,” asserted Trump, which was true … except for the bit about him being a moron. Thursday The National Rifle Association came out in favour of regulations on bump stocks in a rare concession. Sanders welcomed the relatively inconsequential move, but continued to parrot the usual pro-gun talking point that the wake of a shooting was not the time to attempt to prevent future shootings. “We’ve had one of the most horrific tragedies ever on US soil,” she said. “I don’t think we’d want to go out and make rash decisions while we’re still having an investigation.” Trump seemed keen to pile another problem on to his plate on Thursday night, using a group photograph before a dinner with military leaders to warn cryptically that the evening represented “the calm before the storm”. Iran experts presume he was referring to a plan to withdraw from the deal that halted Tehran’s nuclear programme, which would raise tensions in the Middle East and could make it harder to strike a similar bargain with North Korea. Congress may not follow Trump’s lead – expected next week – by reimposing sanctions, however, and the European signatories to the deal and Iran itself are thought keen to keep the deal alive. Friday The administration rolled out a couple of characteristically regressive moves, expanding the number of employers allowed to flout rules that require company healthcare plans to cover contraception at no extra cost, and undercutting federal protections for LGBTQ people in what one advocate called a “licence to discriminate”. The moves followed new justice department guidelines saying that a federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace did not apply to transgender employees. At the White House, Trump was celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and greeting manufacturing workers. Asked about his “calm before the storm” comment, he replied: “You’ll find out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/06/us-escalates-trade-dispute-with-uk-and-canada-over-bombardier-jets","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T21:05:05Z","webTitle":"US escalates trade dispute with UK and Canada over Bombardier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/06/us-escalates-trade-dispute-with-uk-and-canada-over-bombardier-jets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/06/us-escalates-trade-dispute-with-uk-and-canada-over-bombardier-jets","fields":{"headline":"US escalates trade dispute with UK and Canada over Bombardier","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The US has escalated its trade dispute with Britain and Canada by announcing plans to slap a further 80% duty on the export of planes built by Bombardier. The move follows complaints by Boeing that Canadian-owned Bombardier, which employs more than 4,000 people in Belfast, had dumped its C Series jets at “absurdly low” prices. Bombardier is facing a planned 220% tariff as part of a separate investigation, the US Department of Commerce confirmed. A second levy of 80% is also being applied to Bombardier’s sales to the US after a preliminary finding that the jets were sold below cost price to Delta Air Lines in 2016. Boeing claimed that 75 aircraft were sold at nearly £10.6m below cost price. Bombardier dismissed the claim as “absurd”. The company is due to begin delivering a blockbuster order for up to 125 new jets to Atlanta-based Delta next year. The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said: “The United States is committed to free, fair and reciprocal trade with Canada, but this is not our idea of a properly functioning trading relationship. We will continue to verify the accuracy of this decision, while doing everything in our power to stand up for American companies and their workers.” The US government said its intervention was prompted by concern to prevent “injurious dumping” of imports into the country, “establishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field”. The Department of Commerce said Bombardier had failed to provide the information it had requested. It said: “The anti-dumping duty law provides US businesses and workers with a transparent, quasi-judicial, and internationally accepted mechanism to seek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping of imports into the United States.” The US government’s preliminary decision affects imports of 100 to 150 aircraft from Canada. The department said it would instruct US Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits of duties. The proposed duties would not take effect unless affirmed by the US International Trade Commission (ITC) early next year. To win its case before the ITC, Boeing must prove it was harmed by Bombardier’s sales, despite not using one of its own jets to compete for the Delta order. Bombardier said it was confident that the ITC would find Boeing had not been harmed, calling the Department of Commerce decision a case of “egregious overreach”. Delta said the decision was preliminary and it was confident the ITC “will conclude that no US manufacturer is at risk” from Bombardier’s plane. Boeing has said the dispute was not an attack on Canada or Britain. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, lobbied the US president, Donald Trump, last month over the dispute sparked by Boeing’s complaints about “unfair” state subsidies from the UK and Canada. She also discussed the issue with her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau. The UK business secretary, Greg Clark, travelled to Chicago for a meeting with Boeing’s chairman, president and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, to try to solve the dispute. The decision is expected to heighten trade tensions which flared last week after the US announced a preliminary duty of nearly 220% for subsidies Bombardier received, which was well above the 80% duty Boeing sought in its complaint. Unions have warned that the move could put jobs in jeopardy. In retaliation, Canada and Britain threatened to avoid buying Boeing military equipment, saying the duties on the C Series would reduce US sales. The combined 300% duty would effectively keep the plane out of the market. Bombardier shares dipped 2 cents to C$2.18 (£1.33) immediately after the announcement but have since recovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/07/fruit-fly-fascination-nobel-prizes-genetics","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:05:34Z","webTitle":"Six Nobel prizes – what’s the fascination with the fruit fly?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/07/fruit-fly-fascination-nobel-prizes-genetics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/07/fruit-fly-fascination-nobel-prizes-genetics","fields":{"headline":"Six Nobel prizes – what’s the fascination with the fruit fly?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Am not I A fly like thee? Or art not thou A man like me? With these lines, from The Fly, William Blake posed a question of unusual prescience for a poet writing 200 years ago. At first glance, there seem to be few similarities between Homo sapiens and airborne insects. Yet Blake was not so sure. He could see connections. And in recent years, science has found that he was probably correct. Fruit flies, it transpires, have common features with humans to a remarkable degree (we share 60% of the same DNA) – a point underlined last week when the Nobel committee awarded yet another prize to scientists who have used Drosophila melanogaster as the basis of groundbreaking research. In this case, Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young – all based in the US – were awarded the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on the molecular mechanisms that control circadian rhythms – in other words, the 24-hour body clock that controls lives throughout the animal kingdom. Crucially, this work was done largely by experimenting on fruit flies. Nor was this a first for drosophila research. At least five other groups have received Nobels for their work using fruit flies to unpick the secrets of human physiology and biology in general. This Nobel love affair with drosophila began in the early 20th century, when US biologist Thomas Morgan used fruit flies to confirm that genes are located on chromosomes like beads on a string, and that some genes are linked – in other words they are inherited together. In doing so, Morgan established genetics as a modern science. Ever since, the discipline has relied – to a startling degree – on fruit fly research, leading to breakthroughs in a vast range of topics. Today, scientists believe that about 75% of known human disease genes have a recognisable match in fruit flies. These include Down’s, Alzheimer’s, autism, diabetes and cancers of all types. “It’s almost as if they were designed to help scientists,” says geneticist Steve Jones. As their name suggests, fruit flies like to eat fruit – particularly the ripening variety – and appear in summer to settle on apples, pears and sweet drinks. (Hence Groucho Marx’s observation that “time flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana”.) They pose no threat to health but have a number of features that make them ideal laboratory fodder: drosophila have a life cycle of two weeks. They eat cornmeal, yeast and sugar, and little else, and can be housed in tiny tubes. “You put a male and female together, and a fortnight later you have a new generation of fruit flies to study,” said Simon Collier, head of Cambridge University’s Fly Facility. “That makes them a very powerful tool for studying mutations in genes.” On its own, that would be useful enough. However, the fruit fly possesses other key features that impress scientists. The drosophila genome has only four pairs of chromosomes. Humans have 23. That means it is much easier to manipulate and study the function of genes and understand how they interact. “In addition, fruit fly genes have very high mutation rates and that makes them very useful to study,” says Jones. “The changes that these mutations throw up can be traced quite easily on a relatively simple organism like drosophila. In more complex animals – like mice or men – these changes are much more difficult to trace.” As a result, the fruit fly has played a key role in unravelling biological processes for the last century. “Drosophila is now the best known organism on the planet because of this work,” said Professor Andreas Prokop, of Manchester University. “Due to this knowledge, we can plan an experiment on a fruit fly and have the result in three weeks. In a mouse that could take a year. Fruit flies offer a cheap, fast pipeline to reach understanding of complex biological questions which can then be translated into medical applications.” In Prokop’s case, the fruit fly has provided a new understanding of extensions of nerve cells known as axons. These degenerate as people age, but far more sharply if they suffer from Alzheimer’s or other degenerative disease. “We can grow drosophila neurones in culture and use them to study axon development. That helps us get a new understanding of what causes neurodegenerative disease.” Another example is provided by work at the Institute of Cancer Research. “There is a biological process known as cell death which occurs in all living creatures – from worms to humans,” said Professor Pascal Meier, head of the cell death and inflammation laboratory in the institute’s breast cancer unit. “Essentially, it is a suicide mechanism that is fundamental to life, and key aspects were discovered first in fruit flies. When a cell becomes damaged, its death – a process known as apoptosis – is triggered and it is killed off, allowing organs to remain healthy.” In cancers, however, cell deaths are not triggered, and this aids the process by which tumours spread. “We now know, from fruit fly research, that molecules known as inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are involved,” said Meier. “They act to block cell deaths. In other words, if levels of IAPs are elevated, apoptosis is prevented and cancers spread.” As a result, scientists are now testing drugs that can inhibit IAPs in humans and so allow apoptosis to regain control of cells. “It is a very promising approach,”said Meier. “However, the behaviour of IAPs in humans is more complex than it is in fruit flies and that complicates the hunt for drugs. Nevertheless, it is an avenue of cancer treatment that would not have existed today had we not made basic discoveries using fruit flies.” Today, fruit flies are a major undertaking at research centres. The Cambridge fly facility houses 60,000 tubes containing drosophila and provides carefully cross-bred flies for about 30 research groups. “The vast majority of these scientists are doing research either on human conditions or on general biological problems,” said Collier. “Only one or two are involved on research on insects themselves. That shows you the usefulness of fruit fly research to biological research in general and to understanding how the human body works in particular.” Not everyone has been convinced about the value of fruit fly research, of course. In her 2008 election bid to be vice-president of the US, Sarah Palin – in an early policy speech – went out of her way to denounce drosophila experiments. “They really don’t make a whole lot of sense and sometimes these dollars go to projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good. Things like fruit fly research. I kid you not,” she announced. Palin urged that more money be spent on particular research priorities, such as autism – remarks that were seized upon by infuriated scientists who pointed out that only a few years earlier, scientists had pinpointed a chemical called neurexin which in some forms appear to be a genetic risk factor for autism. And there are no prizes for guessing where neurexins were first identified: in fruit flies. As Richard Wolffe, the senior White House correspondent for Newsweek, remarked, this was “the most mindless, ignorant, uninformed comment we have seen from Governor Palin and there’s been a lot of competition for that prize”. Fortunately, others have been more appreciative of the use of fruit flies in research – including Michael Rosbash, one of the recipients of last week’s Nobel prize for medicine. He heard he had won the prize when the Nobel committee chair called him at 5am local time. “When the landline rings at that hour, normally it is because someone died,” Rosbash said last week. Then he got the good news. “I am very pleased for the fruit fly,” he replied. PRIZE WINNERS Six Nobel prizes in physiology or medicine’ have been awarded to a total of 10 scientists for their groundbreaking biological work based on fruit fly research: 1933 Thomas Hunt Morgan used drosophila to uncover the role played by chromosomes in heredity 1946 Hermann Joseph Muller used X-ray irradiation to increase mutation rates in fruit flies 1995 Edward B Lewis, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, and Eric F Wieschaus used drosophila to understand genetic control of embryonic development 2004 Richard Axel concentrated on odour receptors and the organisation of the olfactory system 2011 Jules A Hoffmann was given the award for his research on the activation of innate immunity 2017 Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young won the prize for uncovering the molecular mechanisms that control circadian rhythmsSource: droso4schools"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/07/electric-cars-key-driving-change-uk-energy-supply-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T22:08:56Z","webTitle":"Electric cars key to driving change in UK’s energy supply industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/07/electric-cars-key-driving-change-uk-energy-supply-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/07/electric-cars-key-driving-change-uk-energy-supply-industry","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars key to driving change in UK’s energy supply industry","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"You drive home and plug in your electric car, telling an app how many miles you need the next day. As you eat dinner, relax and sleep, your energy supplier takes control of your battery, using it to buy power when it’s cheap, selling it back later when high demand pushes prices up. The company offers national and local power grids services from your battery, making more money that it will later split with you, perhaps as “free miles” for your car. This sounds like a far-off vision of the future. But the scenario will be reality next year for British households able to afford a new Nissan Leaf electric car and willing to allow energy firm Ovo to fit a special charger in their home. “The customer has to want to do it and understand it, and allow someone else to have some degree of control over their charging patterns for some form of rewards,” said Tom Pakenham, head of electric vehicles at Ovo. In his view, everyone benefits: individuals, suppliers and energy networks coping with the increasing, but variable, amount of wind and solar power flowing through their cables. “Electric vehicles, like all vehicles, are an under-utilised asset: cars are parked 92% of the time, doing nothing. So why not make some use of it, to allow us to deploy renewables on the grid, and to allow the owner of the car to benefit somehow?” he said. It is not just medium-sized challenger companies like Ovo eyeing this emerging opportunity. Big-six firm E.ON launched a tariff last week targeting owners of electric cars, offering electricity at night – when most of the UK’s 100,000 plug-in cars are charged and when energy demand is usually at its lowest – at prices a third cheaper than in the daytime. “The next big challenge is going to be how we integrate all these electric vehicles into the grid system,” said Dr Chris Horne, head of origination at E.ON. “In time, you can see how this is a complete change in the way we think about energy, motoring and vehicles.” The German firm is exploring the sort of vehicle-to-grid technology being used by Nissan and Ovo. E.ON thinks the concept may begin to become more mainstream in the next decade, boosted by a £20m government fund for projects starting next year, and the greater availability of electric car models – not all are capable of it. This switch, from individuals potentially giving back power to their supplier, as well as taking it, marks the beginning of a whole new relationship between energy company and citizen. On the one hand, cheaper solar and energy storage at home could, as one researcher at Imperial College recently put it, “bleed revenues from the utilities sector”. “Our relationship with the grid will become quite different, from being utterly dependent on the grid for power, people may become a bit more interdependent, giving or taking,” said Dale Vince, founder of green electricity firm Ecotricity. “There’ll be a role for energy companies, it’ll just be very different. It could be considerably diminished in terms of energy supply, if you go far into the future,” he added. On the flip side, helping a customer with the complex task of exploiting their battery is an opportunity for energy companies to move beyond just supplying electricity and gas, where price is still the main differentiator, into being providers of a range of energy services. British Gas has already started down this road, offering a range of smart home products under its Hive brand and launching a site to find tradesmen. Horne said electric cars offered a chance for firm to change their relationship with consumers, and focus on offering them “solutions”, not just power. “We think people can become their own energy-independent unit and we’re excited by that vision and need to support it. But, obviously, if people don’t buy energy from us, we need to find other ways to have relationships with them, and to supply them with products and services,” said Pakenham. Robert Llewellyn, the actor and writer, knows all about that changing relationship. An advocate for electric cars and renewable energy, he has had a battery-powered car and solar power for seven years, and the solar panels were upgraded this year. “It’s changed my relationship with my energy supplier – I give them much less money. Since May, I’ve been around 85% powered by solar,” said Llewellyn, best known for playing mechanoid Kryten in Red Dwarf. “My one house makes no difference, but if there were 5m homes with [solar and electric cars], it would really help the national grid and reduce the costs of generating power,” he said, referring to the £3bn annual cost to consumers of running the UK’s energy networks. For Llewellyn, electric cars, batteries and solar power are most exciting not at individual level but at community level, citing his Gloucestershire village’s efforts to generate its own electricity. “What’s emerging rapidly is community-owned energy generation and distribution,” he said. This future, where electric cars are used as a key element of our energy system, is not without potential downsides. Vince said he had concerns about the impact on the car battery’s longevity, though Ovo thinks active management of it could even be beneficial. Thinktanks have warned that just six electric cars in one neighbourhood could cause unplanned drops in voltage if they are not charged at the right times of day. And another worry is the social impact of lots of solar- and electric car-equipped homes reducing their reliance on the power grids. Tom Edwards, an analyst at energy expert Cornwall Insight, said: “If I install a battery in my home, because I can afford to put a battery in, that means I’m avoiding the cost of using the national grid but my neighbours might not necessarily be, and they’re going to have to pick up the slack that I’m not paying for.” The risk, as he puts it, is that one day, “you’re left with the whole £3bn bill landing on one old lady in Cornwall”. To avoid that, regulator Ofgem is looking at how paying for the energy network might change in the future, such as a phone-line rental-style charge, rather than being based on the amount of energy used. There is also disagreement over whether it’s more efficient to produce and store power at a local level, close to where it’s consumed, or at large central power stations with the energy transmitted over long distances. “Making power where it’s used at the home level is the most efficient way to do it because you avoid all the losses of the distribution and transmission system to get it to people,” argues Vince. Under Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour party has made such a decentralised system one of the planks of its energy policy. For Edwards, it’s not a given that greater energy independence for consumers is a good thing. “[It’s] not necessarily, because the most efficient way to generate electricity is in very large power stations. They will be more efficient than anything you can stick on your roof.” One thing Edwards agrees on is that batteries, along with trends such as more renewables and greater digitisation, mean upheaval is coming. “The system will fundamentally change,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/07/football-league-and-non-league-day-clockwatch-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T16:11:12Z","webTitle":"Football League and Non-League Day clockwatch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/07/football-league-and-non-league-day-clockwatch-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/07/football-league-and-non-league-day-clockwatch-live","fields":{"headline":"Football League and Non-League Day clockwatch – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And with that, we’ll leave you to enjoy your Saturday night. Cheers for reading. And our non-league games: Barrow 2-2 Leyton Orient Macclesfield 1-0 Ebbsfleet United Torquay United 0-2 Dover Athletic Curzon Ashton 1-2 Harrogate Town Hackney Wick 1-2 Clapton (Take our word for it that the Cambridge v Wycombe game is done now, with that final score) Shrewsbury’s unbeaten record is still intact: they’ve finished 1-1 at Walsall, but Wigan’s win at Scunthorpe means the gap is down to just two points at the top of League One. Big, big, big equaliser for Kevin Nolan’s men. They’re level in the 96th minute, a Robert Milsom header saving a point for Notts against Forest Green Rovers, who have been hanging on for a little while. Exeter will still usurp them at the top of League Two, but that’s something at least. Ooooh: injury-time could be interesting at Glanford Park, as Scunthorpe have pulled one back against Wigan through Funso Ojo. Remember Wigan are down to ten men.... Late goal for Harrogate Town in the National League North: Mitchell Curry nets to give them a 2-1 lead over Curzon Ashton, meaning they will extend their lead at the top of the table over Salford City, who are losing 3-2 to Leamington. JOY OF SIX! Bristol Rovers have moved into humiliation territory at Northampton: Dominic Telford makes it 6-0 there. Seriously, Jimmy: get in the car, pick up a bottle of wine on the way home, watch a romantic comedy and rip into them on Monday. A fourth for Bradford: Paul Taylor makes it MK Dons 1-4 Bradford. They’ll be weeping the streets of Milton Keynes tonight. Which presumably they are every night, but that’s not the point. In League Two, looks like Exeter are going top: they’re winning 1-0 at Carlisle, and they should leapfrog Notts County, still losing 1-0 to Forest Green Rovers. OH NO JIMMY. Officially a rout for Bristol Rovers at Northampton: it’s 5-0 now, as Liam Sercombe bags another for the Gas. If I was JFH, I’d walk out and not return until Monday. Everyone knows the worst bit about your parents telling you off isn’t the telling off, but the wait beforehand. Make them sweat. Notts still losing 1-0 there, by the way. Ho! Ten men winning ahoy! Nick Powell has scored for Wigan against Scunthorpe. They lead 2-0 despite having a man sent off earlier in the day. Another for Bradford in Milton Keynes: Charlie Wyke has his second, and City lead the Dons 3-1. Woe upon woe upon woe upon woe: it’s Northampton 0-4 Bristol Rovers. Rory Gaffney with the strike, and Jimmy is going for a long walk. Woe upon woe upon woe for Northampton: not only are they 3-0 down to Bristol Rovers, but now Alex Revell has been sent off. Some serious JFH boots to bottoms need to be applied soon. I thought Ferg Snr had retired in part to spend more time with his wife? Have a weekend off, big man. At least he’s seen a goal: Macc are winning 1-0. Sean O’Keefe, supporter of the now rampant Doncaster, is back: “I moved away from Doncaster at the end of the 1990s, just before the start of a decade that would see the Rovers enjoy unprecedented success. I wonder if the absence of my depressing presence on the Popside terrace might’ve had something to do with it. I’m beginning to think that I’m the worst thing to happen to Doncaster since Margaret Thatcher pursued a vicious policy of neoliberalism that destroyed that proud town’s traditional industries. I shall henceforth be quiet and never offer an opinion on Doncaster Rovers again.” Additional woe for Torquay: the side at the bottom of the National League with just one win all season look like they’re going to maintain that record, as Ryan Bird scores to make it 2-0 to Dover. And Ben Whiteman completes a ten-minute hat-trick! Doncaster are flying now, a penalty giving them a 4-1 lead over Southend. 3-0 now. Oh Jimmy. Harrison gets another for Bristol Rovers against Northampton. Yikes. Not starting brilliantly for Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at Northampton: his lads are now 0-2 down to Bristol Rovers, Ellis Harrison bagging the second for the Gas. Ecstasy for Donny! Ben Whiteman has his second, and they’re now 3-1 up over Southend. Our gloomy correspondent from a few minutes ago clearly inspired them. “Just to note that Pascal Chimbonda is making his debut for Washington against Penrith in the Ebac Northern League today,” writes John Davis. “Sadly, his team are one-nil up at half-time.” That last note leads us to believe that you’re a...Wigan fan? And news gets better for Doncaster: they’re 2-1 up over Southend, Ben Whiteman slotting home a rebound after the stalwart’s stalwart, James Coppinger, hit the post. Wigan are closing in on Shrewsbury - who are still being held by Walsall - as they’ve just taken the lead against Scunthorpe. Dan Burn, who I saw have a pretty decent game for Fulham against Arsenal a few years ago, is the man with the goal. An email, as second-halves begin across the land, from Sean O’Keefe: “Doncaster Rovers secured promotion back at the start of April with a single goal victory over Mansfield. On that day they were top of League Two, buoyed by putting five past Grimsby in their previous game and were sitting six points clear of Plymouth. They wouldn’t win again, surrendering their grip on the title to Plymouth on the last day of the season. In the 17 league games they’ve played since that victory, they’ve won two. Doncaster are surely heading for an immediate return to the basement if they keep Darren Ferguson.” Donny are currently drawing 1-1 with Southend, a goal in first-half injury time from John Marquis saving Ferg Jnr from cracking out the hairdryer (junior too, I’d imagine) at the break. Half-times in our five Non-League Day matches: Barrow 2-2 Leyton Orient Macclesfield Town 1-0 Ebbsfleet Torquay United 0-1 Dover Athletic Curzon Ashton 1-1 Harrogate Hackney Wick 0-1 Clapton Half-time whistles going all over the shop. We’ll have some scores for you soon enough. Bit of hope for MK Dons: Ethan Ebanks-Landell has pulled one back for them against Bradford. It’s 1-2, but remember MK are down to ten men. Woe for Leyton Orient, hope and joy smashed into pieces like a ship crashing against the rocks in turbulent seas: Barrow have equalised through Jordan White. More emotions at Sixfields: the bloke who came on for Billy Bodin, Tom Nichols, has just missed a penalty, saved by Cobblers keeper Matt Ingram. Still Northampton 0-1 Bristol Rovers. Rollercoaster of emotions for Billy Bodin: he gives Bristol Rovers a 1-0 lead over Northampton, but pulls his hamstring in the process. Ach. Meanwhile: Jesus Christ... That snood seems to have done Harry Kewell some good: his Crawley Town side are 1-0 up over Morecambe thanks to a Billy Clifford goal, and now the hosts have been reduced to ten men, after Kevin Ellison was dismissed for reasons not 100% clear. The Sky ticker simply says ‘foul play’. The joy is back for Leyton Orient! Craig Clay has scored for them to put the side most in need of some good news 2-1 up over Barrow. Record breaking... A shock on the cards at Meadow Lane? All has been peachy for Kevin Nolan of late, but bottom leads top as Omar Bugiel bags to give Forest Green Rovers the lead. And as I press save, Barrow are level: Bedsente Gomis makes it Barrow 1-1 Leyton Orient. Look at this! Leyton Orient are ahead! They have collected but a single point in the last six games, haven’t won in a month but now they’ve taken the lead against Barrow through David Mooney. And the unbeaten record looks safe again: Stefan Payne levels from the penalty spot, but word is there should have been a red card for deliberate handball, but the officials couldn’t work out the owner of said hand so cards were kept in pocket. Bad to worse for MK Dons: Bradford are 2-0 up, the second goal coming courtesy of Charlie Wyke. Goal in another of our Non-League games: Harrogate Town, top of the National League North, are ahead of Curzon Ashton, Joe Leesley scoring via a deflection. It’s around this time of year that you see Facebook statuses saying ‘Is it bad I’ve already put the heating on lol’. Presumably it’s been whacked up to 11 in the Kewell house... The final unbeaten record in the Football League is under threat: Paul Hurst’s team are 1-0 down at Walsall, Daniel Agyei scoring a nice curling effort to break the deadlock there. And bad news for both iterations of the old Wimbledon: AFC Wimbledon are a goal down to Oxford, with Wes Thomas scoring there. And now MK Dons are a goal down: Romain Vincelot heads home as Bradford take a 1-0 lead. You have to walk through the lobby of a hotel to get to some bits of stadium:mk. Maybe they could dull the pain by hitting the minibar. Red card at stadium:mk, the weirdest-named ground in the country. Aaron Tshibola has been sent off for MK Dons against Bradford. Weird old career for Tshibola: signed for a thick wedge by Aston Villa from Reading last summer, didn’t do much there, went on loan to Nottingham Forest in January but barely played there, and now he’s getting sent off in League One. And we have a goal in one of our Non-League games: Dover have taken the lead over Torquay, the latter side stone bottom of the National League. It’s 1-0 to Dover as Paul Lewis bags. And we’re away. Games kicking off up and down the land. Football! Dover Athletic flew to that game against Torquay. Non-League teams! Taking the plane! What happened to uncomfortable five-hour journeys in a rickety coach, eh? Rickety coach not good enough for you Dover? So, here are the Non-League Day games we’ll be following: Barrow v Leyton Orient Macclesfield v Ebbsfleet United Torquay United v Dover Athletic Curzon Ashton v Harrogate Town Hackney Wick v Clapton The reviews are in for the early game and, erm, they’re not the best... It was 0-0, in case you hadn’t worked that out. So what do you do when there’s no ‘top level’ club football to keep track of? Well, you remember that there’s still loads of football elsewhere, and loads of football is, we believe, much better than no football. Much better. We’ll be concentrating on Leagues One and Two, plus a select few Non-League games, and really anything else you would like us to concentrate on. So what are the games to keep an eye on? Well Shrewsbury can continue their frankly implausible start to the season away at Walsall, unbeaten as they are after struggling for most of last season. For background reading, Jeremy Alexander went to see manager Paul Hurst last week and discuss their wholesale changes over the summer. Second-placed Wigan face Scunthorpe, themselves hovering on the edge of the playoff places, bottom of the table Plymouth go searching for a win against Fleetwood. Then in League Two the early kick-off sees a stirring Coventry visit Barnet, leaders Notts County face eco vegan lads Forest Green Rovers (who are bottom of the table, alas), while Luton could leapfrog Accrington into the automatic spots if they win the game between the two. And then there’s a massive bunch of Non-League games. Loads of them, obviously, so it would make sense to pick a few - let’s say five - to follow closely. We’ll pick the five over the next hour before kick-off, but if anyone has any nominations, do send them to Nick.Miller@theGuardian.com.

Michael Hickey’s resignation comes after the Irish airline had to scrap the bookings of more than 700,000 passengers last month due to an apparent shortage of pilots, having failed to plan for enough leave for staff. O’Leary said: “Over the past 30 years Mick Hickey has made an enormous contribution to Ryanair, especially the quality and safety of our engineering and operations functions. “He will be a hard act to replace, which is why we are grateful he has agreed to continue in an advisory role to smooth the transition to a successor and to complete a number of large projects he is currently working on including a multi-year engine maintenance contract and new hangar projects in Seville and Madrid.” Hickey will be the first executive to leave the embattled airline after the scheduling crisis. The company was already under heavy fire for cancelling up to 50 flights a day in the middle of September before an extra 18,000 flights were axed at the end of the month. O’Leary issued an unprecedented apology to his pilots this week in an attempt to stem the crisis at the airline, which has also faced the threat of an employee revolt. Ryanair hoped a bonus payment could entice some pilots to change their holiday plans, but O’Leary further inflamed the situation with disparaging comments about pilots at the airline’s annual meeting in Dublin. On Thursday, he sent an unusually contrite letter to pilots at the airline “to apologise personally to each of you for the disruptions you have experienced”. O’Leary had accused pilots of being “precious about themselves” and “full of their own self-importance”, saying: “I would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked, or how anybody who by law can’t fly more than 18 hours a week could possibly be suffering from fatigue.” He said the comments had been directed at “pilots of competitor airlines and their unions”, a favoured refrain of O’Leary’s when addressing those who have criticised his employment model. “I have the utmost respect and admiration for Ryanair’s pilot team,” he said. The letter offered a range of improvements to terms and conditions, including salary increases, loyalty bonus payments, improved rostering and better compensation for those pilots forced into working away from their home base. But it warned pilots against taking alternative employment with other airlines, particularly Norwegian, where hundreds are thought to have decamped. A graph of his rival airline’s tumbling share price, along with some choice financial facts, was appended to the letter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/08/alabama-senate-race-democrats-roy-moore-doug-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T11:00:48Z","webTitle":"Has Roy Moore given Democrats a shot at a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/alabama-senate-race-democrats-roy-moore-doug-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/alabama-senate-race-democrats-roy-moore-doug-jones","fields":{"headline":"Has Roy Moore given Democrats a shot at a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In one of the strangest political developments of a strange political year, Democrats may have a shot at winning a Senate seat in Alabama, one of the most conservative states in the country. Although Democrats had footholds in state and local government until recently, at the national level the Yellowhammer state has long been a Republican stronghold. It has supported one Democrat for president in 60 years and Richard Shelby, the last Alabama Democrat elected to the US Senate, switched to become a Republican more than 20 years ago. Now, Roy Moore’s win in the primary for the Senate seat vacated by the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has given Democrats a sliver of hope that their nominee, Doug Jones, can pull off an upset in December. In a turbulent career that has seen him twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama supreme court, Moore has made inflammatory and controversial statements. In the past year, he has praised Vladimir Putin in a Guardian interview and suggested that the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 were punishment for a country turning away from God. He has said “homosexual conduct should be illegal” and his most recent removal as Alabama chief justice came after he ordered state courts to defy the US supreme court’s legalization of gay marriage. In prepared remarks during a primary debate, he condemned “sodomy”. As Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster based in Montgomery, put it to the Guardian, Jones is, despite all this, “an underdog”. But McCrary struck a number of optimistic notes. First, he noted that “Roy Moore is just a bad candidate” who finished below 20% in two primaries for governor and “limped across the finish line” in his 2012 race for state chief justice, lagging far behind the rest of the Republican ticket. McCrary also emphasised Jones’s biography. From a blue-collar background, he rose to become a federal prosecutor, successfully prosecuting two Ku Klux Klan members for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham in 1963, in which four African American girls were killed. Jones is drawing national attention: Joe Biden, the former vice-president, spoke at a rally this week in Birmingham. Moore’s campaign welcomed the visit and the prospect of others to follow. In its view, Biden actually boosted Moore, by nationalizing a race in such a deep red state. “Chuck Schumer can come down here, Nancy Pelosi can come down here, even Obama,” said an adviser to Moore, Dean Young. “Evidently they are gearing up for a war in Alabama and if they gear up for a war, they’ll gear up to lose.” Jones has also staked out a stance on abortion that may not play well in Alabama. In a recent interview with MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, he said he was “not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman’s right and her freedom to choose. That’s just the position that I’ve had for many years. It’s a position I continue to have.” One Republican strategist was pleasantly flabbergasted by this, saying: “Alabama is one of the most pro-life states in the union and he didn’t take a middle-of-the-road pro-choice position.” ‘Bozo candidates’ Republicans remain wary of Moore, who is not only likely to become a fundraising magnet for Democrats: in a divided party, he could become millstone around the necks of GOP candidates in more socially liberal areas. In the primary, national Republicans duly spent heavily against Moore. A Super Pac affiliated with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, spent more than $9m to support Luther Strange, who was appointed to the Senate after Sessions joined the Trump administration. Donald Trump was even coaxed into endorsing the incumbent. In contrast, Moore was backed by the populist Trump wing of the party, including the former White House aide Steve Bannon, who stumped on Moore’s behalf. One Washington Republican strategist said that if the race was competitive, “the ball [will be] in Bannon’s court”. As the strategist noted, Bannon “got his guy through the runoff and [it is] now incumbent on him to get his candidate through the general election. “In past cycles, Bannonites and [the] Senate Conservative Funds of the world have gotten these bozo candidates through the primary and left them on the vine to die.” Moore’s campaign returned the disdain toward the national Republican party. Young told the Guardian: “I don’t know much about Mitch McConnell except that he spent $30m lying about my friend Judge Moore. Don’t know how much he’ll help Judge Moore or be allowed to help Judge Moore.” The problem is that Moore will need the help. He ran a barebones campaign in the primary and was boosted by deep distrust among Republican voters around the controversial circumstances under which Strange was appointed to the Senate. As McCrary argued: “Roy Moore’s policies and views aren’t just [in] sync with 1958 attitudes. Roy Moore is more inclined to run a campaign akin to 1958.” On election eve, outside a rally held in a barn in southern Alabama, Moore provided an opportunity for supporters to make phone calls on his behalf. There were only a handful of volunteers. They were simply given printed lists of numbers. Yet for all of the Moore campaign’s challenges, he is still facing a reliably Republican electorate in a state Trump won by nearly 30 points. He will also have the support of most who until now have adamantly opposed him. Asked who he would support in the general election, Senator Shelby said: “I’m a Republican. I’m going to support the nominee, who in this case happens to be Roy Moore.” Asked if he thought the race would be competitive, the veteran politician said: “I don’t think so. “But you never know.

Charlton has had five winners in the past fortnight at a strike-rate of better than 20%, is within five wins of his best year and has the likeable Makzeem (3.35) in Ascot’s Challenge Cup, today’s major handicap. Closely related to Charlton’s top-class Al Kazeem, this four-year-old is finishing his year on a strong upward curve and is well in under a penalty for his success at Newmarket last weekend. Another furlong is probably going to help him in time but he should get the strong pace that he needs to get the win this time. 1.50 Ascot Waady has been working his way back to the sort of form that saw him win a Group Three in 2015 and go close in the King’s Stand last year. His Leicester win over Kachy and his Newbury fourth to Take Cover read well in this company. 2.05 Newmarket The suddenly progressive Marie Of Lyon should be able to complete her hat-trick, with Ryan Moore aboard for the first time. 2.25 Ascot The market will get all excited about Andre Fabre’s Waldgeist, who was pipped in the French Derby and ran fourth in the Irish equivalent when last seen. But he looked ploddy that day and a three-month absence followed by a drop into this company is disconcerting. Secret Number, who won this race four years ago, could be the answer again, having shown all his old ability in a light campaign so far. 2.40 Newmarket A really tricky Group One, in which Qemah might have the most raw ability, though she and her jockey seem unable to agree as to who’s boss. Roly Poly beat them in the Prix Rothschild, at which point Aidan O’Brien’s filly had been beaten only by Winter in four Group Ones. She was ridden like a pacemaker last time, in a race that Winter was expected to win but which in the end fell to another of her stablemates. Roly Poly can show her ability once more with Moore back aboard. Usherette comes into the reckoning and will be fine on the ground but trailed Roly Poly by three lengths at Deauville in the summer. 3.00 Ascot Heavy going at Haydock last month did not suit Blue Point but he is the fastest of these and should be able to prove it, even though there is some juice in the ground. 3.20 Redcar In this big field, it might be an idea to go with a horse proven over further and perhaps Crownthorpe can do best of Richard Fahey’s big team. His form has improved for each of his last four runs in nurseries.

Alexandre O Philippe’s documentary is a tribute to this extraordinary moment in film history: electrifying, audacious, a smash-and-grab raid on on territory previously considered impossible or unacceptable. Philippe assembles a mighty chorus of directors and cinephile heavy-hitters such as Walter Murch, David Thomson, Sam Raimi, Eli Roth, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis and Guillermo del Toro to rave enthusiastically about this scene – where it came from, how it was put together, and where it took cinema from then on (though disappointingly this lineup doesn’t include Gus Van Sant, the film-maker who has engaged with the scene more intensely than anyone, having directed a shot-for-shot remake in 1998). Perhaps this is (tacitly) considered a kind of desecration or hubris, which means that Van Sant’s own opinion is now ruled out of court. Perhaps there should have been more space for noting that if this was a failure, it was an honourable failure, particularly in respect of the creative theme variations Van Sant introduced, such as restoring the “forbidden” shot from the original shower scene storyboard, the moment where Marion Crane’s body is shown slumped, with stab-wounds and buttocks visible. There are some interesting insights here – and a fair bit of redundant and derivative waffle; it’s a much-discussed subject and this documentary doesn’t have the originality of Kent Jones’s Hitchcock/Truffaut (2015), about the great encounter of these two directors, or Johan Grimonprez’s fantastical Double Take (2010), using clips from Hitchcock’s TV show to imagine a Borgesian encounter between young Hitchcock and old Hitchcock. 78/52 has a fair few pointless shots of guys sitting watching the shower scene on TV and saying not much more than “Wow!” and “Whoah!” Which of course is fine – although there’s a kind of self-policing in this discussion, and an obvious need not to seem so uncool or unsophisticated as to appear to be criticising the scene in any way, that prevents people talking about the dark streak of misogyny which, like it or not, partly fuelled the diabolical brilliance of this scene. There’s a lot of contextualisation in this documentary, but no one talks about Tippi Hedren’s experience some years later of being abused and menaced by Hitchcock in real life. It’s quite relevant to any discussion of what was going on in the director’s head when he shot the shower scene with Janet Leigh. But there is some engaging material, and I particularly enjoyed Del Toro’s description of the shower scene as the “perfect stainless-steel trap” and there are some very witty and aposite clips of previous Hitchcock movies, from The Lodger to Rear Window, to suggest that everything in his work had been leading up to the Bates Motel shower scene as a crowning masterpiece: all the sense of transgression, vulnerability, anxiety, denial, fear, arbitrary extinction. The documentary puts Psycho at the very tipping point of US history, a spasm of fear after the certainties and complacencies of the 1950s and postwar prosperity – but before the Kennedy assassination, civil rights and Vietnam. Bogdanovich talks interestingly about billing in the 1920s and 30s: how women were routinely above the title before the second world war, but male stars progressively muscled them out of the way, and how the murder of Marion Crane in its way set the seal on this tendency. Sam Raimi has some funny and interesting things to say about “the American cut” popularised by Hitchcock – the practice of cutting from a wide shot to a closeup. Raimi says that if you don’t do with the master’s own flair it looks more like a “Canadian cut”. The film notes that the shower scene perhaps didn’t take US cinema forwards but backwards, to a pre-Hays Code era when movies were in an exciting, experimental infancy with a pioneer ethos: anything goes and anything’s possible. There are some intriguing comparisons with Eisenstein, that master of editing, who had a proto-Hitchcockian predisposition for violence and chaos and pure provocation. This documentary is as good an excuse as any to return – again – to Psycho. •Released in the UK on 3 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/06/harlequins-sale-premiership-match-report-jack-clifford-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T21:47:43Z","webTitle":"Harlequins hammer Sale but Jack Clifford injury sours night for England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/06/harlequins-sale-premiership-match-report-jack-clifford-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/06/harlequins-sale-premiership-match-report-jack-clifford-injury","fields":{"headline":"Harlequins hammer Sale but Jack Clifford injury sours night for England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The victory for Harlequins was polished but Jack Clifford’s suspected dislocated shoulder promptly removed the shine. The back-row joins their walking wounded – already a seemingly endless list – and leaves Eddie Jones with a further headache for England’s autumn internationals in November. The 24-year-old, drafted into the England training squad for the injured Billy Vunipola last month, was withdrawn shortly before half-time against Sale and is a serious doubt for the autumn fixtures. With Vunipola already out of the running and Nathan Hughes missing Wasps’ trip to Saracens on Sunday, Jones is swiftly running out of options at No8. It is rotten luck for Clifford, who underwent surgery on the same shoulder in April and subsequently missed England’s June tour of Argentina, and it is untimely for Harlequins, who ended last weekend with 25 players on the injured list. In addition Kyle Sinckler is suspended until late November, Will Collier went off with a back injury and James Horwill was a late withdrawal after failing his concussion protocols. “It looks as if [Jack has] dislocated his shoulder,” said Harlequins’ director rugby, John Kingston. “It’s frustrating for him. Last night we had five players in question, two missed out, three got in – he was one. He had [painkillers] to get him out there in the first place and it’s disappointing because he was playing ever so well. It’s too early to say how long he’ll be out.” In the face of all that upheaval, however, Harlequins had their first-half blitz and 17 points from Marcus Smith, who continues to show an authority beyond his years, to thank for victory against a Sale side who began the match every bit as poorly as they were impressive against Gloucester last week. Three second-half tries from the Sharks opened the possibility of an unlikely comeback but ultimately Smith steered his depleted side home. With Joe Marler at his abrasive best after emerging from the physio room described by Jamie Roberts as “a morgue” this week, and Danny Care at his liveliest, it was a relative stroll for the home side in the first half, as three tries within the opening 24 minutes testified. Care teed up the first for Tim Visser with an artful kick, Marler barged over for the second from close range and Joe Marchant charged down Sam James for the third – Smith converting each of them with no little conviction. Sale were on the scoreboard when Mike Haley evaded Chris Robshaw’s tackle a little too easily and carved his way in under the posts. Harlequins then had more hardship to endure before the interval as Clifford was withdrawn and soon followed by his team-mate Collier with Sale’s Josh Beaumont also taken off. The Premiership’s alarming injury rate shows little sign of abating. Harlequins at least had a penalty that Smith in this mood was not going to miss, and his second of the evening gave Harlequins a 20-point lead at the break. Another Care kick, this time a grubber, was expertly gathered by Visser seemingly to put the game to bed after 48 minutes but Halani Aulika barrelled over for a second Sale try and James’s interception effort put the visitors firmly on the front foot. Ross Harrison’s close-range effort earned Sale a bonus point but Smith’s chip over the top led to Marland Yarde’s late try which condemned Sale to a 10th straight away Premiership defeat. “We didn’t get off the bus with the right mentality,” said Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond. “We asked them at half-time to get a bonus point and it’s a small consolation. Last week all the planets aligned and our top players played well. It’s frustrating. We probably thought after last weekend we were a world XV.” Harlequins Morris; Yarde, Marchant, Roberts (Alofa, 66; Swiel, 72)), Visser; Smith, Care; Marler (Lambert, 68), Ward (capt), Collier (Swainston, 39), Merrick, Matthews, Robshaw (Elia, 78), Clifford (White, 36), Luamanu (Lamb, 57).

Ubiquitous and inescapable, it’s a shared celebration of the moment when a no-hoper led an unprecedented popular movement and knocked established wisdom back on its heels. For others, it’s symbolic of the empty hero-worship that constitutes the new left, of vapid communal feelgood moments and a cult of personality masking politics that shade from the inept into the disturbing. It might have turned you on to Jack White’s now-defunct garage blues duo or it might have ruined them for you forever. Either way, it is the earworm to beat all earworms. Listen to the original recording of Seven Nation Army – a far from obscure number 7 in the UK charts in 2003 – and try thinking of anything else. You can’t. The lyric is fixed now. It goes “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”. And everyone knows about it, from the Queen of England to the hounds of hell. If you’re on board with the Corbyn project then here is your battle cry. “The spread of the chant is definitely confirmation of what we’ve been saying about Jeremy all along,” says Beth Foster-Ogg, training organiser at the Corbynista brains trust Momentum. “He’s talking about politics that are more inclusive, more grassroots. It’s about people coming together and the singing reflects that.” It helps that the syllables of Corbyn’s name fall perfectly on the chords of White’s none-more-simple, demonic descending riff. (It didn’t work quite so well when Tom Watson attempted to get “Oh, Rebecca Long-Bailey” off the ground at last month’s Labour conference. And who knows why Tory conference-goers tried to start a chant of “Oh, David Davis” when they could have tried Salt-N-Pepa’s Push It instead? From Friday night club queues to tuxedoed undergraduates at Downing College’s May Ball, it doesn’t take much to get the chant going now. Such is the drama of the song that Corbyn fans’ responses can appear Pavlovian. When Ed Miliband hosted a pub quiz at the Labour conference, says Foster-Ogg, every time he mentioned the leader the audience broke out into song. “He pretended to get upset,” she recalls, “so we tried to sing ‘Oh, Ed Miliband’ and it really didn’t work.” The story of a political life in one scene. But the hallmark of a good chant is how quickly it takes off. Famously the Seven Nation Army Corbyn chorus entered politics from football during the run-up to the June election. When Corbyn appeared on stage just before the Libertines at the Wirral Live rock festival in May, somebody – nobody quite knows who – started the chant and the crowd took it up immediately. The effect, by all accounts, was electric. “Suddenly, I was getting all these texts and videos and recordings popping up on my phone, all saying: ‘You won’t believe this’,” says terrace culture guru and Corbyn enthusiast Peter Hooton, whose band the Farm had played Wirral Live at Tranmere Rovers’ ground the day before Corbyn. “You never know how a politician is going to go down with music fans but this wasn’t the usual. The singing was totally spontaneous.” Retweeted by John Prescott, the Tranmere clip went viral. Within days, Labour election rallies were singing along. “The chant swept round the country over the summer,” says Hooton. “You’d see girls outside pubs of a Friday singing it. Kids who were supposed not to care about politics were paying attention. I’ve never known anything like it.” By the time of the Glastonbury festival – after Corbyn’s better than expected showing in the general election – the chant was established as the long-lost bridge between pop culture and politics. When Stormzy’s Glastonbury crowd began to sing it, the grime MC joined in (“this is what it’s about right now, Glastonbury”). Radiohead were spotted grinning and clapping along to it in a break in their set – find it on YouTube and note Thom Yorke’s possibly mocking falsetto. When Corbyn himself took the stage to the inevitable chorus before introducing hip-hop duo Run the Jewels, it seemed the headiness of the event had seeped into his brain. As he wound up his speech, Corbyn half-stalked across the stage and leaned forward into his handheld mike as if he were an MC too. Musicians usually complain when politicians co-opt their songs. Florence Welch and Calvin Harris spoke out after the Tory conference used You Got the Love and This is What You Came For as entrance music. In this case, it was not the politician but the followers who chose the song, and that’s harder to object to. The defiance and ultra-basic melody of Seven Nation Army reflect the underdog self-image of the Corbynosphere. “I’m gonna fight ’em all,” goes the original. “A seven nation army couldn’t hold me back.” Irony alert: the song concerns the pressures of fame, although it’s not much of a stretch to see the media as one of those pressures. Labour voters of a more Methodist strain might prefer the fact that the title comes from his childhood mispronunciation of “Salvation Army”. Football made the song famous, though. It’s widely agreed that fans of Belgium’s Club Brugge were the first to adopt a (wordless) version of Seven Nation Army at their surprise Champions League victory over AC Milan in October 2003. It was snapped up by Roma and then the Italian national side, and became their unofficial anthem at the 2006 World Cup. White let it be known that he approved. “I am honoured that the Italians have adopted this song as their own,” he said. “Nothing is more beautiful than when people embrace a melody and allow it to enter the pantheon of folk music.” Where did it reach Britain? At Liverpool, of course, says Hooton. (As a fellow LFC fan, I’m not going to disagree with him.) In early 2007, fans needed a song for new signing Javier Mascherano. “There were endless debates on Liverpool websites,” recalls the Groovy Train hitmaker. “People had heard the White Stripes in Italy. The syllables fit but it’s a great song too. A good chant has to be simple and direct. If a football crowd finds something easy to chant, a crowd at a political rally will find it easy too.” What about the criticism that chants like this dumb down politics, replacing substance with mindless togetherness? “Politics has been elitist and exclusive for generations,” says Momentum’s Foster-Ogg. “Any way to get young people involved has to be a good thing. It may look like hero worship but it’s empowering to be able to use this song to tell everyone who was negative about Labour, no, you were wrong. We do have power and things are not going to be the way you say they are.” As anyone who has ever stood in a crowd knows, chanting is exhilarating. There’s a binding joy to be had from singing together, be it a song as moving as You’ll Never Walk Alone or Abide With Me or something as daft as aiming “your teeth are offside” at Luis Suárez. Chants can create unity – but they can also create the illusion of unity. Mass chanting can become coercive. Who wants to be the only person in the hall who’s not singing along? Or worse the loser, the one who’s not singing any more? Humans are social. We want to belong. But if we’ve learned anything over the past three years it’s that when you make political decisions based on the need to be part of something rather than the issues, it can lead you into dark places. If you love Jeremy Corbyn then there will never a bad time to sing about it. Revel in your time. If you don’t, then look on the bright side. It is only a song. And if not for Seven Nation Army, you’d probably be hearing endless choruses of “Jeremy Corbyn packed his trunk/And said fuck off to the Tories” instead. Nobody wants that. So you don’t like “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”, politicians? Get your own chant, then. Here are some suggestions… “Starmer, Starmer, Starmer, Starmer, Starmer chameleon / He’s got my vote, he’s got my vo-ote.” Shadow Brexit minister and centrist dad hero displays the benefits of compromise. “Chuka Umunna’s waiting, he’s talking ’bout Europe.” Labour Remainers, Bananarama are there for the taking. “Richard Burgon – hey! / Touched for the very first time.” Can’t see the shadow justice secretary in a Madonna outfit but you never know. “Priti Patel/Priti Patel / Diddly dee dee-dee.” Sing it to the Roobarb &amp; Custard theme. She’ll hate it. “Rebecca Long-Bailey / I said Rebecca Long-Bailey / Jitterbug Bailey / On a Saturday night.” Marc Bolan’s We Love To Boogie, if you really do want to take us back to the 70s. “Who let the Mogg out? Who? Who, who, who?” Be careful what you wish for.

This victory means the Republic of Ireland will travel to Wales knowing that, if either side wins Monday’s feverishly anticipated Celtic duel, it will be certain of finishing in second place, at least, in Group D. Top spot will be up for grabs in the unlikely event of the leaders, Serbia, stumbling at home to Georgia. “It’s there for us,” said Martin O’Neill. “Let’s go for it.” Daryl Murphy made sure there was no spoilsport deviation from that script by scoring twice here to dispatch the group’s bottom side. Murphy and Callum O’Dowda, in particular, made strong cases for roles in Monday’s match and eased criticism of O’Neill in advance of a much fiercer test. Opinions among Irish supporters are evenly split as to whether O’Neill and his assistant, Roy Keane, have got the best out of the resources available to them so there was widespread bemusement when the Football Association of Ireland let it be known that the pair have been offered a new contract even before the outcome of the current campaign is clear. O’Neill intimated that one of the reasons he is eager to remain at the helm is to integrate exciting young players. He began that process against Moldova by giving a first competitive start to 22-year-old O’Dowda. The Bristol City winger was chosen ahead of Aiden McGeady to replace the suspended James McClean, who will probably return to the showdown in Cardiff, as will Robbie Brady. O’Dowda’s selection was quickly vindicated here. So was the manager’s decision to start Murphy up front in spite of calls for him to hand first international starts to the Preston striker Sean Maguire or Aston Villa’s Scott Hogan. Murphy began alongside Shane Long and the 34-year-old took his Nottingham Forest form on to the international stage, hitting two goals in the first half, doubling the tally he had managed in his previous 29 games for his country. It took only 90 seconds for Murphy to strike. Ireland’s first goal involved no conjuring from Wes Hoolahan, another encouraging inclusion in the starting line-up. Instead Stephen Ward created it with a long throw-in, which was flicked on inadvertently by a defender. Murphy reacted quickest to hook a left-footed volley into the net from five yards. The thrusting O’Dowda tried to increase their lead after 10 minutes, curling a shot just wide from the edge of the area, and he continued to justify his inclusion by producing a lovely flourish in the 15th minute that should have resulted in another goal. He showed power and subtlety to elude two defenders before calmly teeing up Long, who shot wide from 12 yards. Then Ward and Murphy combined again, yielding a more elegant goal than the first. Ward raced on to a fine diagonal pass from Hoolahan before delivering a grand cross to the back post, inviting Murphy to boom a header back across the goalkeeper and into the bottom corner. O’Dowda might have inflicted more damage moments later but was thwarted by Ilie Cebanu. Then Ireland’s goalkeeper, Darren Randolph, had to demonstrate his alertness to prevent Moldova from scoring out of the blue, Sergiu Platica’s sudden blast from 25 yards bringing a fingertip save from the Middlesbrough player. Chris Coleman will have noted that not everything was rosy for Ireland in the second half. The hosts let the initiative slip as the visitors passed the ball better, albeit without threatening a breakthrough. And the form of Long remains a worry. The Southampton striker has not scored for club or country since February and looked forlorn in front of goal here. He made an easy chance seem unfeasibly awkward in the 66th minute when, after a break by Hoolahan and O’Dowda, he skewed the ball wide from six yards as the goalkeeper lay helpless. O’Neill craved a goal for Long almost as much as the player did himself and he left him on until the 82nd minute before introducing Maguire, whose arrival drew a huge cheer from the home crowd. O’Neill knows Long’s woes leave him with another big selection decision to make for the Wales match. “He remarked to me going in [at the end of the game] that he can’t buy a goal at the moment and that might sum it up,” said O’Neill. “He had some great chances that normally he would have taken. Sometimes your confidence is affected by that. But it is what it is.” Asked whether Murphy had cemented a starting place, O’Neill replied: “Who knows?” That, at least, was a less enigmatic response than the one offered by the Moldovan manager, Igor Dobrovolski, when asked whether Alexandru Gatcan deserved the red card he was shown for thrusting his head into that of Harry Arter in the closing minutes “He didn’t headbutt him, it just happened,” reasoned Dobrovolski. Monday’s contest will be feisty, too, although O’Neill said he hoped it would not be unduly influenced by memories of the Neil Taylor tackle that left Séamus Coleman with a broken leg when the countries drew in Dublin in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/07/after-vegas-why-do-we-still-treat-the-us-as-a-civilised-country","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:05:34Z","webTitle":"After Vegas, why do we still treat the US as a civilised state? | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/after-vegas-why-do-we-still-treat-the-us-as-a-civilised-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/after-vegas-why-do-we-still-treat-the-us-as-a-civilised-country","fields":{"headline":"After Vegas, why do we still treat the US as a civilised state?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For a body of people with manifestly indefensible views, the US gun fraternity continues to enjoy a deferential hearing in Britain, at least on the regular occasions when its principles result in a massacre. The routine attrition, of a mass murder (that is, four or more people) a day, is now so unremarkable, such an entirely expected aspect of American culture, that it can no more warrant sustained foreign coverage than does the violence that afflicts civilians in, say, day-to-day Afghanistan or the lashings allegedly critical to a harmonious Saudi Arabia. But, as with those countries, when the loss of life in America is big enough to shock, the gun-averse world pauses. In the case of the US, however, our news organisations go further and invite those who facilitate the savagery – firearms enthusiasts – to put the case for more. If this approach ever catches on, we might yet hear, when a car bomb goes off in a crowded market or the Saudis complete a mass execution, impassioned justifications from the implicated terrorists, politicians or clerics. A supporter of the Taliban, or advocate of cutting off adolescents’ heads, would be invited to remind us that a lot more people are killed by unstable fridges and that we should respect, in any case, that such bloodshed necessarily proceeds from his country’s founding principles. Following the Las Vegas shooting, Mark Walters, of Armed American Radio, a station serving the indigenous death cult, was duly heard on the BBC, making light of the event, although he was disgusted by the fuss over something so predictable. Actually, Walters remarked, he foresaw another big killing pretty soon: “It’s more than likely being planned by some psychopathic lunatic right now,” he assured the Today programme. Which is pretty thoughtless of the psychopathic lunatic. “I predict,” Walters said, “that when that happens we will see the immediate calls from the Democrat left – screaming politics, politicising and dancing in the blood of the victims before the bodies are even taken to a morgue – for more gun control.” Perhaps some perverse interpretation of Ofcom’s balance, as applied to our special relationship, explains why, after the Las Vegas massacre, heartbreaking interviews with survivors and with campaigners for gun control who have lost children in shootings alternated with contributions from gun apologists, turning sense on its head. No, these brutes insisted, nothing had gone wrong. It was as if someone had come on air the morning after the Grenfell disaster and said it’s a fundamental right to save on building materials, stop dancing in the ashes. Bereaved mothers, including a woman whose young son and his boyfriend were killed in the Orlando nightclub shooting, were informed that they’re nothing special: “Human beings have been killing each other since the dawn of time.” Moreover, the cultists repeated, presumably since this inversion works so well at home, it’s opponents of guns – like her – who will have the blood of innocents on their hands, if atrocities lead to restrictions on sale. “You have to understand that guns save lives, guns prevent crime,” Channel 4’s go-to AAR celebrity, Neil McCabe, informed Krishnan Guru-Murthy, deploying one of the lobby’s favourite fictions, “and you’re asking Americans to, what, to disarm themselves because of an incident in Las Vegas?” Addressing their domestic audience, after these and other similarly undemanding encounters, Walters advised colleagues, in a think piece, “Blah blah blah… more gun control”, on how best to browbeat the naive – or maybe simply stunned – British interviewer. “Now is the time to extract the truth from these crybaby’s [sic], that what they truly seek is outright banning and confiscation of your firearms”. Then again, media crybabies are probably aware of the futility of these occasions. Men previously unmoved by the murder of tiny children at Sandy Hook, then of the young people out dancing in Orlando, are happily re-advertising, not unlike supporters of the Taliban and Isis – and evincing levels of irrationality that surely echo theirs – their proud withdrawal from civilised norms. Ask a National Rifle Association supporter to give up his semi-automatic? Just to save lives? When – another firearms argument goes – wicked owners could just as easily kill their families, or 60 innocent strangers, with trucks? Do we want to ban trucks? It’s pointless, as well as insulting to the victims, to keep giving their protestations an attentive hearing. You might as well ask her assailant why it was OK to shoot Malala in the head, or draw out human traffickers, or interview Qatar’s stadium builders on the merits of bonded labour: whatever the answer, it is of strictly anthropological interest. In terms of respectability, admittedly, the US gun lobby has the advantage over many rival specialists in human suffering, of presidential patronage, having paid for this in cash. Some vestigial moral authority adheres to that office, thanks to Donald Trump’s predecessor, and there’s little doubt, from his tweets, that the current president senses the world’s expectations. Britain has often benefited from his guidance, most memorably and disreputably, a few hours after Islamist terrorists murdered civilians at London Bridge. “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack”, he tweeted, “and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’” Whatever the president tweeted at himself, after a mass murder perpetrated by a white American male using his legally acquired arsenal, his public response, for civilians alarmed by the US epidemic of gun violence, was to defer action, that lawmakers will discuss the issue “as time goes by”. Gun users cheerfully, no doubt correctly, translate this as “our guns are safe”. Although, unlike his efforts on behalf of global environmental and nuclear catastrophe, Trump’s alliance with the NRA endangers principally his compatriots, this staggering acceptance of the latest homegrown massacre could be what finally – if it cannot guarantee pariah status – shreds US claims to global leadership. A country that accepts 93 firearms deaths a day, on a wayward reading of an 18th-century statute, is not obviously better placed than the ostracised Aung San Suu Kyi to lecture on human rights or, as Trump at the UN, on global security. He fretted about “rogue regimes” that even threaten “their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity”. Idiots. Don’t they know over-the-counter semi-automatics will do the job perfectly well? True, Britain is hardly well supplied, these days, with moral high ground, what with our public demonstrations of xenophobia and Etonian-inflicted self-harm. In fact, since the dual calamities of Brexit and Trump, there has been a certain rivalry between resident crybabies of the respective nations over which is more deserving of international contempt. The nation that put the orange narcissist temporarily in charge or, as some of us insist, the nation staggering blindly towards the clifftop, with an unprincipled racist for foreign secretary? Whichever now has the lead in self-inflicted pariahdom, Britain surely has enough unspeakable fantasists of its own, without inviting US contributions, presidential and otherwise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/06/magnus-carlsen-extends-world-rankings-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T19:03:06Z","webTitle":"Leonard Barden on Chess","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/06/magnus-carlsen-extends-world-rankings-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/06/magnus-carlsen-extends-world-rankings-lead","fields":{"headline":"Magnus Carlsen extends gap at top of world rankings with Isle of Man win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Magnus Carlsen has seen off his rivals, at least for the moment. Following his early elimination from the World Cup in Tbilisi the 26-year-old world champion made the bold decision to travel to Douglas for the Chess.com Isle of Man Open. He left behind his normal entourage of parents, manager and trainer but brought his girlfriend, Synne Christin Larsen. Carlsen led all the way, used some offbeat openings like 1…g6 and 1…b6, won several creative games, made a trip to the top of Snaefell, the Isle’s highest point and captured the £50,000 first prize with an unbeaten 7.5/9, half a point ahead of Hikaru Nakamura of the US and India’s Vishy Anand. It was the Norwegian’s first victory in a classical tournament for more than a year. Carlsen’s lead in the live ratings has now jumped from a meagre 10 points a few months ago to a healthy 36 ahead of his closest rival, Levon Aronian, the World Cup winner. There were still a few blemishes. He was in danger of defeat in round two against Eugene Perelshteyn of the US and had the worse of a draw as White against India’s Gujrathi Vidit. But his incisive wins against Ukraine’s Pavel Eljanov and Fabiano Caruana of the US had the stamp of greatness. The former world champion Vlad Kramnik had a dreadful start where he lost to the US veteran James Tarjan, as featured in last week’s puzzle, but the Russian fought back with a finishing spurt to 6.5/9 and a last-round win over England’s Gawain Jones. That result capped a below-par tournament for the English grandmasters. Michael Adams joined Kramnik and others in a tie for fourth but Jones, David Howell and Nigel Short dropped rating points. The trio are struggling to achieve consistency at the elite 2700 level. The No1 woman, Hou Yifan, as at Gibraltar where she made a bizarre final-round protest, began Isle of Man with a run of female opponents and lost to one of them. This time her response was shrewder. She took a half-point bye, returned invigorated to defeat her male opponents and made sure of the £6,000 women’s award with a round to spare. Fabiano Caruana had beaten Gawain Jones in the previous round with some impressive prep, finding a nuance at move 19 in a sharp variation of the Ruy Lopez. Carlsen opted for 14…Re8 and a more solid approach, was surprised by 15 g4!? and worked out the counter 15…Qe7 and 16…Nd8, guarding f7, though the machines prefer 15…Qd7, ready to sac on g4, or the complex 15…exd4 16 cxd4 Nb4 17 g5 c5! As played, Caruana stood slightly better against Carlsen but began to lose the thread with 22 Bc2? where 22 Nf5 Bxf5 23 exf5 Qc7 24 Nh4 is unclear. Soon the weak a5 pawn dropped while Carlsen’s powerful 26…d5! and 27…Bb8! opened up the game for Black’s attacking army. Short of time, Caruana collapsed as 32…Ng5! prepared the decisive tactic featured in this week’s puzzle.

While comprehensive figures for the previous year are not available, the larger countries surveyed all reported a jump in applications, suggesting a significant overall increase. Figures collated from requests to London-based EU embassies and interior ministries across the bloc show that EU citizenship applications from UK residents and Britons living in other member states surged in the 12 months after the referendum. Responses received from 20 countries showed the greatest number of applications were for Irish citizenship with almost 9,000 applications from UK residents and Britons living in Ireland in the 12 months from July 2016, the month after the referendum took place. The Irish embassy in London received 8,017 applications from UK residents between July 2016 and the end of June 2017 compared with just 689 in the full year of 2015. There was also a surge in applications from British residents in Ireland: 894 applications were made in the year from 1 July 2016, compared with just 104 the previous year. An overall agreement on Britain’s article 50 withdrawal from the EU is far from settled, and the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Thursday that sufficient progress had not been made on the issue of citizens’ rights for the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in other EU countries and 3.6 million EU citizens who are residents of the UK. Dora Kostakopoulou, a professor of EU law and European integration at Warwick University, said the main reasons for the surge in applications was because people wanted security of residence and were seeking to retain EU citizenship rights, including the right to travel and live in the 27 countries that will remain members of the EU after the UK leaves. “They value European citizenship and therefore they do not wish to lose this status as a result of Brexit,” she said. “So gaining citizenship of (another) member state would guarantee their existing status and their existing rights.” The Guardian contacted the UK-based embassies and interior ministries of the other member states requesting the number of citizenship applications made by UK residents and Britons living in the respective countries. In the first eight months of 2017, 2,129 Britons living in France applied for French citizenship, figures from the interior ministry show. This compares with 1,363 applications in the whole of 2016 and just 385 in 2015. These figures exclude those made directly to the French embassy in London. Just over 1,700 UK residents applied for German citizenship in the 12 months following the Brexit vote, compared with just 63 applications in the full-year 2015. About 90% of these were made under restoration of the basic law for the Federal Republic of Germany which confers citizenship rights on the descendents of people whose citizenship was renounced on political, racial or religious grounds in Nazi Germany. One of them is London-based Jon Landau, the chief operating officer at tech startup Wazoku. He, his father, uncle and son all applied for citizenship on the grounds that Landau’s grandfather lost his German citizenship in the 1930s. “As soon as the Brexit vote became clear, I started looking more seriously into the application process. Becoming a German citizen isn’t just about my future, but also about my young son’s opportunities. I want to ensure that he will see himself as a European citizen, with all the possibilities and freedoms of travel, study and work that I’ve enjoyed,” he said. There was also a large increase in German citizenship applications among Britons living in Germany. The Federal Office for Statistics (Destatis) recorded 2,865 such applications last year, up from 622 in 2015. Figures for 2017 are not yet available. The Swedish migration authority reported a steep increase in applications by British citizens: 1,965 Britons applied for Swedish citizenship domestically and abroad in the year to the end of June 2017, more than double the previous year. British applications for Danish citizenship more than doubled to 604 in the same period compared with the previous year. In Spain, where foreigners can apply for nationality after 10 years’ residence but must renounce their prior citizenship, the numbers seeking citizenship are relatively low: data on the number of people taking Spanish knowledge tests with the Instituto Cervantes shows there were 579 applications in the year after the Brexit vote. As the test was only made compulsory in October 2015, it is not possible to compare this with the previous year period, but the average number of applications per month shot up from nine to 58 after June 2016. One of the largest proportionate increases was recorded in Italy where the number of applications rose more than eightfold from 70 in the 12 months to the end of June 2016 to 593. Applications for Finnish citizenship trebled to 115 applications while the number of applications for Cypriot and Greek citizenship quadrupled to 306 and 45 respectively. There were about 170 applications in the Netherlands in the 12 months after the vote compared with just 40 in the full year of 2015. Dawn MacFarlane, who has lived in Holland for the past 19 years and is awaiting a decision on her Dutch citizenship, said: “I actually considered myself a European citizen so I never felt the actual need to change my citizenship to Dutch even though I’ve been here a long time.” However, she became concerned after the Brexit vote about her entitlements should she become unemployed and she said her feelings about the UK changed after the result. “I just feel that being part of Europe is a very important part of my identity. For a large part of my life, I felt more European than British. I am Scottish first and I would have been British but the European feeling overpowered the British part.” The Austrian embassy said it usually received about 10 applications per year, but that rose to 35 in the year following the Brexit referendum. A further 37 applications were received across the country’s nine states compared with just 15 between July 2015 and June 2016. Other countries reported more modest increases in the number of UK residents seeking citizenship in the 12 months following the vote: the Czech republic recorded 27, up from 11, while Slovakia had 24 applications, up from 15. No Britons were recorded as having applied for citizenship of Estonia and Slovenia. The Guardian did not receive responses or got incomplete figures from Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Portugal, and a Belgian official said its figures were not centrally collated. Citizenship applications differ from applications for passports which can only be obtained by existing citizens. Irish passport applications made by UK residents have soared since Brexit: more than 100,000 Irish passports were issued in the UK in the first six months of 2017, up from 65,000 in 2016. People born in other countries are automatically Irish citizens if they or either of their parents were born in Ireland (including Northern Ireland) before 2005. However, foreign-born individuals with an Irish grandparent or a parent who, although an Irish citizen, was born outside the country, must apply for inclusion in the foreign births register in order to gain citizenship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/06/bookmaker-launch-mobile-app-betting-live-horse-races","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T17:34:38Z","webTitle":"Bookmakers to embrace ‘big data’ to shift racing’s betting landscape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/06/bookmaker-launch-mobile-app-betting-live-horse-races","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/06/bookmaker-launch-mobile-app-betting-live-horse-races","fields":{"headline":"Bookmakers to embrace ‘big data’ to shift racing’s betting landscape","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Racing fans will soon be able to place bets with a bookmaker on their mobile phone as races are being run, thanks to advances in GPS technology and data transmission times which could change the betting landscape for casual and committed gamblers alike. Detailed information on sectional times within races, precisely how much ground each horse has covered, its stride length and pattern, and how quickly it clears an obstacle over jumps will also be more widely available, as racing starts to fully appreciate – and exploit – the wealth of data it generates. The Guardian understands that a leading online bookmaker will announce the launch of in-running betting within the next few weeks, and others are sure to follow its lead. Customers will bet via an app which presents data on the position of every horse in a race with an average accuracy of no worse than 0.1m, and with a time-lag of 0.1sec or less from live. Post-race, information including every runner’s speed at different stages will be available for analysis by punters and professionals as they try to understand the result in more detail and identify horses whose performance may have been affected by positioning, interference or the way the race was run. “Big data”, in other words, is finally coming to British racing, and not before time. Previous attempts to extract speed and other performance data from races have run into a range of obstacles, including the wide variety of tracks and layouts in Britain and the sheer intensity with which a race such as a five-furlong sprint can unfold. There were doubts, too, about the market for the information, but a number of technological advances mean that live data, in particular, should now have significant value. “We couldn’t have done this even two years ago,” Will Duff Gordon, chief executive of Total Performance Data, a company leading the way in speed sensing technology, said on Friday. “The original milestone was in 2000, when Bill Clinton allowed civilian access to military level accuracy, but over time governments have invested more and more. Glonass is the Russian satellite we can connect to and hasn’t been available to non-Russians for that long, and Europe has its own system called Galileo, which is coming on stream now. “The positional fix comes down from the satellite, hits our tag [in the horse’s saddlecloth] and our tag reports back to the grandstand and on to a customer, comfortably within 0.1sec. In terms of real-time position fixes getting to customers from the horse’s back, it’s pretty much live. I don’t think anyone can come close to us in terms of the latency [lag] of the content, and what we’ve now done is to find a market for that content.” Initially, that market will be bookmakers and punters, and casual, quick-fix punters in particular. The margin – or over-round – built in to the in-running prices is likely to be significant while the bookies test and develop the new market, and refine the algorithm generating the odds. The odds may not compare favourably, for instance, with the in-running markets on Betfair, which have been a feature of the exchange since its launch, but as increasing numbers of exchange backers appreciate, the Betfair markets are dominated by racecourse-based players with access to the fastest pictures of the action. If shrewd punters looking for real value in the bookies’ in-running markets may be disappointed, however, they should find much to interest them in the wealth of data which every race creates, both on the Flat and, in time, over jumps. “We can’t wait to do it for the jumps,” Duff Gordon said. “We’re going to look at things like how much ground is lost over fences, meaning the speed and fluency of jumping. We’ll need a bigger boat to tackle jumps at the same time, but the hardware will all work. It’s more to do with the software and finding your timing points, because they will be fences and not furlong poles. There will need to be survey data for all the fences, and we need to deal with things like when the race starts, because they go round in circles and then start. But we’ve done a couple of jumps fixtures and that’s going to be a project in the first quarter next year. “The same box [which transmits GPS data] can also report live how many strides per second the horse is doing, and we will start to release stride-length data at the end of October, which is another exciting development.” And it is not only the horses whose performance will be scrutinised as data capture and analysis increases. Which riders are the most dependable when it comes to finding an efficient path through a race? How long, on average, does it take a jump jockey to get his mount over a fence, and which jockey’s mounts are the slickest at the business end of a steeplechase? The list of questions that could soon have a sensible answer is almost endless. A horse race is an ephemeral blur of speed, colour and chance, and some might prefer it to stay that way. But technology now promises to provide an x-ray, to reveal its internal dynamics in increasing detail, and those who choose to look may find the fascinations of a 250-year-old sport are not diminished, but enhanced.

Not only was the election an unnecessary fight for Mrs May to have picked, she has emerged a diminished figure. Her cabinet is united – but mainly in their desire to succeed her. On the day of Mrs May’s big speech at the Conservative party conference this week, everything that could go wrong, did. Then Grant Shapps, a former party chairman who once led a double life as a “multimillionaire” web guru, was unmasked as a parliamentary general aiming to topple Mrs May for her shortcomings. Despite boasting the backing of 30 MPs, none of Mr Shapps’ troops were prepared to follow their commanding officer over the top. Mrs May is hurt and the consensus is that she will stagger on. But the crisis in the Conservative party is here to stay: a toxic brew of personal ambition, ideological visions and electoral panic. This at a time when Britain’s productive forces are stagnating and the biggest foreign policy issue of our times – leaving the European Union – is met with the political posturing of a clown wearing the mask of a roaring lion. The Conservative party was once steeped in pragmatism, dominated by the wish to win elections and to be in power. There always were differences of opinion. These differences in dispositions have now curdled into doctrinal differences. The Brexit vote has helped widen gulfs in the party, intensifying the cultural nationalism on the right of the party. This group, who since the days of John Major have put forward anti-EU arguments with a burning passion, repelled the electorate to such an extent that the Tories could not win a majority for more than two decades. The bad news for Mrs May is that they are back. The result is that the Tories lost their parliamentary advantage this year. Yet those who profess this anti-European nationalist creed are feted in the current Tory party. It was their speakers who drew the crowds and cheers at conference, not the cabinet’s. That Mrs May relies on the votes of the anti-gay, anti-abortion climate-change deniers of the evangelical Democratic Unionist party to carry her through will mean MPs on the cultural nationalist right will be emboldened. It speaks volumes about the mess the party is in that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP for the last century, who is against gay marriage and anti-abortion on the grounds of his faith, is such a star. Young people, having grown up in a culturally permissive era, are not aroused by the holy anger of the right. They are moved by issues such as climate change and education, where an egalitarian view of humankind prevails. Conservatives have in the past been able to accept social change and adapt to it. They have anticipated society’s needs and changed their policies to meet them. Now the party’s anti-Europeanism means they risk losing a section of voters for ever. The Conservatives have also long been deaf to issues affecting the under-40s. Not only are these voters seeing their wages squeezed, they are unable to save for homes and pensions while the prices race away. Mrs May will find it difficult to sell capitalism to those with no capital. The last election threw into sharp relief the cracks in the Tory party’s support. Its voters are dying off faster than it can win over new ones. That is why Mrs May has accepted that there is a cost-of-living crisis and lifted policies from Ed Miliband, a man once derided as Marxist. The Tory leadership seems to think it does not require new ideas. It is content to make do with old ones. Mrs May needed to bring her party’s thinking in line with an environment it does not like. Replacing the leader will only work if the party understands that it needs to change too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/kazuo-ishiguro-nobel-prize-digital-age-serious-literary-fiction-vital","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T18:28:33Z","webTitle":"Why serious literary fiction like Ishiguro’s is vital in times like these | Alice O’Keeffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/kazuo-ishiguro-nobel-prize-digital-age-serious-literary-fiction-vital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/kazuo-ishiguro-nobel-prize-digital-age-serious-literary-fiction-vital","fields":{"headline":"Why serious literary fiction like Ishiguro’s is vital in times like these","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s always entertaining to observe the interaction between the news media and a writer who has just won the Nobel prize. The all-time best was obviously Doris Lessing, who when doorstepped simply rolled her eyes and snorted “Oh Christ”, before turning around to pay for her taxi. Bob Dylan studiously ignored the whole thing, while Kazuo Ishiguro had clearly emerged from solitary confinement in his study on Thursday (he is in the middle of writing a novel), to face a barrage of questions and photographs. Blinking and bewildered, he described the themes he has spent his life thinking about and painstakingly unpicking: “The way countries and nations and communities remember their past, and how often they bury the uncomfortable memories from their past.” Such matters don’t lend themselves easily to a soundbite; asking a literary giant to respond to the demands of a 24-hour news cycle is a little like asking a dinosaur to ride a bike. Writing and reading novels are activities that take place in opposition to the frantic, thoughtless rush of modern life. They demand a different quality of commitment and concentration, and a longer time scale. Serious novelists do our deep thinking for us, and find ways to communicate big questions (“the way countries and nations remember their past”) within stories so compelling that readers absorb them without having to try. We read Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day because we want to know whether housekeeper Miss Kenton ends up with butler Mr Stevens, and in the meantime absorb the atmosphere and politics of pre-second-world-war Britain. We are bewitched by the prehistoric, magical landscapes of his 2015 novel The Buried Giant, and incidentally find ourselves thinking about the importance of history to a bewildered, conflicted nation. This is a time of year when novelists are all over the headlines, not only because of the Nobel, but also with the impending announcement of the winner of the Booker prize. Meanwhile the publishing industry is gearing up with the Frankfurt book fair, the avalanche of books just released on “Super Thursday”, and the rush for pre-Christmas sales. Amid the autumnal air of bookish celebration, the picture presented by the books industry is far from gloomy: thanks to the popularity of cookery, lifestyle, colouring and children’s books, sales figures for physical books remain surprisingly resilient, despite the onslaught of Amazon and e-readers. On the literary side, the Booker longlist this year was notably strong and diverse, a true reflection of the weird, wonderful and varied writing that is emerging from these weird (and not so wonderful) times. But all those reasons to be cheerful are set against a backdrop of real anxiety about the future of the literary novel. Writers from Will Self to Howard Jacobson, from Robert Harris to Claire Messud, have raised the alarm about declining attention spans, and the time that people previously spent reading now losing out to competition from digital media. Eminent publishers predict a long-term decline for the entire industry, as younger people turn to other forms of entertainment. From a personal perspective, such worries feel well-founded: I organise the books events for the Brighton festival, and it’s been interesting to observe the pattern in ticket sales. With a few big-name exceptions, events with literary fiction authors are hard to sell unless they are talking about how to write, or taking part in a discussion panel related to a broader theme. It also feels as though my friends read less than they used to. Parents of young children seem to push their offspring towards books and limit their screen time (hence the robust sales of children’s books), while they themselves spend every moment of leisure time plugged in. Those with older children report that an early interest in reading gives way to the easier, faster-moving temptations of Netflix, Facebook and Instagram. Working out whether these observations are supported by sales figures is no simple task. The Publishers Association reports a 7% decline in fiction sales in 2016, a decline of 23% since 2012; other sources such as Nielsen BookScan present a less dramatic drop of around 1%, with strong growth in graphic novels and comics. According to Philip Jones, editor of the Bookseller, “sales of commercial fiction are in rude health, but there is a general awareness that sales of literary fiction are suffering”. Why does it matter? After all, there are plenty of issues that currently seem more pressing than the fate of the novel. Fiction can feel like a luxury in a world of nuclear and environmental threat, crumbling political and economic systems, and general chaos. But that is also precisely why proper, challenging reading is so important: to read a good novel is to spend a serious amount of time immersed in the consciousness of another person; to reach out across the barriers that separate us from one another. It is to take the time to cultivate the focus necessary to step back from the distractions of day-to-day life and think bigger. Surely we all need that now, more than ever. • Alice O’Keeffe is a freelance literary critic and journalist based in Brighton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/06/ioc-suspends-rio-2016-chief-carlos-nuzman","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T18:09:18Z","webTitle":"IOC suspends Carlos Nuzman after gold bar corruption allegation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/06/ioc-suspends-rio-2016-chief-carlos-nuzman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/06/ioc-suspends-rio-2016-chief-carlos-nuzman","fields":{"headline":"IOC suspends Carlos Nuzman after gold bar corruption allegation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The International Olympic Committee has suspended the head of the Rio Games after his arrest on bribery and fraud charges linked to a bid vote-buying scandal, which he denies. Carlos Nuzman, 75, was involved in a commission organising the Tokyo 2020 Olympics but has been removed from the role after Brazilian police accused him of involvement in alleged bribery of IOC members to vote for the Rio Games during campaigning in 2009. Because he is president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee that body has also been suspended, meaning any IOC payments are frozen and its right to vote on Olympic-related matters is revoked. Brazilian police revealed 16 solid gold bars weighing 1kg each were found in a depository in Geneva and alleged they were among Nuzman’s hidden assets. They also claimed the value of his estate had increased by 457% over a decade as head of the country’s Olympic association and have requested legal assistance from the Switzerland attorney general as they build their case. Nuzman is accused of acting as a middleman between Brazilian businessman Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho, nicknamed King Arthur, and Lamine Diack, the disgraced former president of international athletics. Soares allegedly paid £1.2m into company accounts controlled by Diack’s son Papa Massata Diack in order to sway a band of African IOC voters. The IOC has been criticised for not acting sooner but said Nuzman was only temporarily suspended pending further investigation. “This decision shall not affect the Brazilian athletes,” an IOC spokesman said. “The IOC will accept a Brazilian Olympic Team in the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018 and in all other competitions under the umbrella of the Brazilian Olympic Committee with all rights and obligations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/can-never-eat-chicken-again-antibiotic-resistance","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T09:00:28Z","webTitle":"Read this and you may never eat chicken again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/can-never-eat-chicken-again-antibiotic-resistance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/can-never-eat-chicken-again-antibiotic-resistance","fields":{"headline":"Read this and you may never eat chicken again","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every year I spend some time in a tiny apartment in Paris, seven storeys above the mayor’s offices for the 11th arrondissement. The Place de la Bastille – the spot where the French revolution sparked political change that transformed the world – is a 10-minute walk down a narrow street that threads between student nightclubs and Chinese fabric wholesalers. Twice a week, hundreds of Parisians crowd down it, heading to the marché de la Bastille, stretched out along the center island of the Boulevard Richard Lenoir. Blocks before you reach the market, you can hear it: a low hum of argument and chatter, punctuated by dollies thumping over the curbstones and vendors shouting deals. But even before you hear it, you can smell it: the funk of bruised cabbage leaves underfoot, the sharp sweetness of fruit sliced open for samples, the iodine tang of seaweed propping up rafts of scallops in broad rose-colored shells. Threaded through them is one aroma that I wait for. Burnished and herbal, salty and slightly burned, it has so much heft that it feels physical, like an arm slid around your shoulders to urge you to move a little faster. It leads to a tented booth in the middle of the market and a line of customers that wraps around the tent poles and trails down the market alley, tangling with the crowd in front of the flower seller. In the middle of the booth is a closet-size metal cabinet, propped up on iron wheels and bricks. Inside the cabinet, flattened chickens are speared on rotisserie bars that have been turning since before dawn. Every few minutes, one of the workers detaches a bar, slides off its dripping bronze contents, slips the chickens into flat foil-lined bags, and hands them to the customers who have persisted to the head of the line. I can barely wait to get my chicken home. * * * The skin of a poulet crapaudine – named because its spatchcocked outline resembles a crapaud, a toad – shatters like mica; the flesh underneath, basted for hours by the birds dripping on to it from above, is pillowy but springy, imbued to the bone with pepper and thyme. The first time I ate it, I was stunned into happy silence, too intoxicated by the experience to process why it felt so new. The second time, I was delighted again –and then, afterward, sulky and sad. I had eaten chicken all my life: in my grandmother’s kitchen in Brooklyn, in my parents’ house in Houston, in a college dining hall, friends’ apartments, restaurants and fast food places, trendy bars in cities and old-school joints on back roads in the south. I thought I roasted a chicken pretty well myself. But none of them were ever like this, mineral and lush and direct. I thought of the chickens I’d grown up eating. They tasted like whatever the cook added to them: canned soup in my grandmother’s fricassee, her party dish; soy sauce and sesame in the stir fries my college housemate brought from her aunt’s restaurant; lemon juice when my mother worried about my father’s blood pressure and banned salt from the house. This French chicken tasted like muscle and blood and exercise and the outdoors. It tasted like something that it was too easy to pretend it was not: like an animal, like a living thing. We have made it easy not to think about what chickens were before we find them on our plates or pluck them from supermarket cold cases. I live, most of the time, less than an hour’s drive from Gainesville, Georgia, the self-described poultry capital of the world, where the modern chicken industry was born. Georgia raises 1.4bn broilers a year, making it the single biggest contributor to the almost 9bn birds raised each year in the United States; if it were an independent country, it would rank in chicken production somewhere near China and Brazil. Yet you could drive around for hours without ever knowing you were in the heart of chicken country unless you happened to get behind a truck heaped with crates of birds on their way from the remote solid-walled barns they are raised in to the gated slaughter plants where they are turned into meat. That first French market chicken opened my eyes to how invisible chickens had been for me, and after that, my job began to show me what that invisibility had masked. My house is less than two miles from the front gate of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal agency that sends disease detectives racing to outbreaks all over the world. For more than a decade, one of my obsessions as a journalist has been following them on their investigations – and in long late-night conversations in the United States and Asia and Africa, with physicians and veterinarians and epidemiologists, I learned that the chickens that had surprised me and the epidemics that fascinated me were more closely linked than I had ever realized. I discovered that the reason American chicken tastes so different from those I ate everywhere else was that in the United States, we breed for everything but flavor: for abundance, for consistency, for speed. Many things made that transformation possible. But as I came to understand, the single biggest influence was that, consistently over decades, we have been feeding chickens, and almost every other meat animal, routine doses of antibiotics on almost every day of their lives. Antibiotics do not create blandness, but they created the conditions that allowed chicken to be bland, allowing us to turn a skittish, active backyard bird into a fast-growing, slow-moving, docile block of protein, as muscle-bound and top-heavy as a bodybuilder in a kids’ cartoon. At this moment, most meat animals, across most of the planet, are raised with the assistance of doses of antibiotics on most days of their lives: 63,151 tons of antibiotics per year, about 126m pounds. Farmers began using the drugs because antibiotics allowed animals to convert feed to tasty muscle more efficiently; when that result made it irresistible to pack more livestock into barns, antibiotics protected animals against the likelihood of disease. Those discoveries, which began with chickens, created “what we choose to call industrialized agriculture”, a poultry historian living in Georgia proudly wrote in 1971. Chicken prices fell so low that it became the meat that Americans eat more than any other – and the meat most likely to transmit food-borne illness, and also antibiotic resistance, the greatest slow-brewing health crisis of our time. For most people, antibiotic resistance is a hidden epidemic unless they have the misfortune to contract an infection themselves or have a family member or friend unlucky enough to become infected. Drug-resistant infections have no celebrity spokespeople, negligible political support and few patients’ organizations advocating for them. If we think of resistant infections, we imagine them as something rare, occurring to people unlike us, whoever we are: people who are in nursing homes at the end of their lives, or dealing with the drain of chronic illness, or in intensive-care units after terrible trauma. But resistant infections are a vast and common problem that occur in every part of daily life: to children in daycare, athletes playing sports, teens going for piercings, people getting healthy in the gym. And though common, resistant bacteria are a grave threat and getting worse. They are responsible for at least 700,000 deaths around the world each year: 23,000 in the United States, 25,000 in Europe, more than 63,000 babies in India. Beyond those deaths, bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics cause millions of illnesses – 2m annually just in the United States – and cost billions in healthcare spending, lost wages and lost national productivity. It is predicted that by 2050, antibiotic resistance will cost the world $100tn and will cause a staggering 10m deaths per year. Disease organisms have been developing defenses against the antibiotics meant to kill them for as long as antibiotics have existed. Penicillin arrived in the 1940s, and resistance to it swept the world in the 1950s. Tetracycline arrived in 1948, and resistance was nibbling at its effectiveness before the 1950s ended. Erythromycin was discovered in 1952, and erythromycin resistance arrived in 1955. Methicillin, a lab-synthesized relative of penicillin, was developed in 1960 specifically to counter penicillin resistance, yet within a year, staph bacteria developed defenses against it as well, earning the bug the name MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After MRSA, there were the ESBLs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, which defeated not only penicillin and its relatives but also a large family of antibiotics called cephalosporins. And after cephalosporins were undermined, new antibiotics were achieved and lost in turn. Each time pharmaceutical chemistry produced a new class of antibiotics, with a new molecular shape and a new mode of action, bacteria adapted. In fact, as the decades passed, they seemed to adapt faster than before. Their persistence threatened to inaugurate a post-antibiotic era, in which surgery could be too dangerous to attempt and ordinary health problems – scrapes, tooth extractions, broken limbs – could pose a deadly risk. For a long time, it was assumed that the extraordinary unspooling of antibiotic resistance around the world was due only to misuse of the drugs in medicine: to parents begging for the drugs even though their children had viral illnesses that antibiotics could not help; physicians prescribing antibiotics without checking to see whether the drug they chose was a good match; people stopping their prescriptions halfway through the prescribed course because they felt better, or saving some pills for friends without health insurance, or buying antibiotics over the counter, in the many countries where they are available that way and dosing themselves. But from the earliest days of the antibiotic era, the drugs have had another, parallel use: in animals that are grown to become food. Eighty percent of the antibiotics sold in the United States and more than half of those sold around the world are used in animals, not in humans. Animals destined to be meat routinely receive antibiotics in their feed and water, and most of those drugs are not given to treat diseases, which is how we use them in people. Instead, antibiotics are given to make food animals put on weight more quickly than they would otherwise, or to protect food animals from illnesses that the crowded conditions of livestock production make them vulnerable to. And nearly two-thirds of the antibiotics that are used for those purposes are compounds that are also used against human illness – which means that when resistance against the farm use of those drugs arises, it undermines the drugs’ usefulness in human medicine as well. Resistance is a defensive adaptation, an evolutionary strategy that allows bacteria to protect themselves against antibiotics’ power to kill them. It is created by subtle genetic changes that allow organisms to counter antibiotics’ attacks on them, altering their cell walls to keep drug molecules from attaching or penetrating, or forming tiny pumps that eject the drugs after they have entered the cell. What slows the emergence of resistance is using an antibiotic conservatively: at the right dose, for the right length of time, for an organism that will be vulnerable to the drug, and not for any other reason. Most antibiotic use in agriculture violates those rules. Resistant bacteria are the result. * * * Antibiotic resistance is like climate change: it is an overwhelming threat, created over decades by millions of individual decisions and reinforced by the actions of industries. It is also like climate change in that the industrialized west and the emerging economies of the global south are at odds. One quadrant of the globe already enjoyed the cheap protein of factory farming and now regrets it; the other would like not to forgo its chance. And it is additionally like climate change because any action taken in hopes of ameliorating the problem feels inadequate, like buying a fluorescent lightbulb while watching a polar bear drown. But that it seems difficult does not mean it is not possible. The willingness to relinquish antibiotics of farmers in the Netherlands, as well as Perdue Farms and other companies in the United States, proves that industrial-scale production can be achieved without growth promoters or preventive antibiotic use. The stability of Maïsadour and Loué and White Oak Pastures shows that medium-sized and small farms can secure a place in a remixed meat economy. Whole Foods’ pivot to slower-growing chicken – birds that share some of the genetics preserved by Frank Reese – illustrates that removing antibiotics and choosing birds that do not need them returns biodiversity to poultry production. All of those achievements are signposts, pointing to where chicken, and cattle and hogs and farmed fish after them, need to go: to a mode of production where antibiotics are used as infrequently as possible – to care for sick animals, but not to fatten or protect them. That is the way antibiotics are now used in human medicine, and it is the only way that the utility of antibiotics and the risk of resistance can be adequately balanced.

He wrote a brief concurrence in the case, Coker v Georgia, citing his opposition to the death penalty, which then as now disproportionately targeted African American men. Marshall’s experiencewith capital rape cases, and specifically with cases of black men accused of raping white women, was uniquely deep. For while the later decades of his career found Marshall enrobed as the country’s first African American supreme court justice, in his early years he had virtually lived from a suitcase, crossing the country as an activist lawyer known for defending innocent black men from a system of white justice that craved their freedom and their blood. Of the 455 men executed for rape between 1930 and 1972, 405 were African American, Marshall had noted in a separate court decision. Were it not for him, the number would have been even higher. As a lead lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), beginning in the late 1930s, Marshall would leave his home in Harlem, get a train from Pennsylvania Station and ride for days into hostile territory:Oklahoma, Florida, Texas, Tennessee. His calling – and the NAACP was flooded with calls – was to defend against criminal charges and to represent plaintiffs in segregation, equal pay and voting rights cases. In some criminal cases, Marshall might be able to win a life sentence instead of execution. In rare cases, he might win a not-guilty verdict. By the late 1940s, he was logging an estimated 50,000 miles a year, according to Gilbert King, whose Pulitzer-winning Devil in the Grove tells the story of Marshall’s defense of an infamous 1948 Florida rape case. “The places he was going were places where there weren’t any other lawyers who were going to do this work,” said Kenneth W Mack, a Harvard Law School professor who wrote Representing the Race: the Creation of the Civil Rights Lawyer. “They were also places where almost nobody had ever seen a black lawyer before. And he had to do things like challenge the local practices of segregation, come into a courtroom, call white people as witnesses, cross-examine them. “He had to do things that, if he did them outside of court, it would have gotten him killed.” As a pantheonic civil rights figure, Marshall is best remembered for arguing Brown v Board of Education (1954), which struck a decisive blow against racial segregation in public schools, and for his later, historic ascent to the bench itself. Those towering achievements have mostly obscured his dramatic early years. But the popular portrait of Marshall may be about to shift, with the release next week of a new film, Marshall, which tells the story of a salacious 1941 rape case in high-society Connecticut and of Marshall’s intervention at age 32 on behalf of the defendant, a butler-chauffeur named Joseph Spell. While Hollywood has taken cracks at supreme court biopics before, going back to Oliver Wendell Holmes in The Magnificent Yankee (1950), Marshall promises a more visceral excitement. The film unites the producer of Django Unchained (Reginald Hudlin, directing this time) with the star of the upcoming Black Panther Marvel Comics blockbuster (Chadwick Boseman). In Marshall, the young lawyer who will become the old justice not only batters his intellectual inferiors in court – he also strikes the bar with a bat and throws punches in a bar. “The thing about Thurgood Marshall is his whole life is incredible,” Hudlin said, in a phone interview. “What intrigued me was this figure of him as a young man – vital, dashing, with this swagger – very different from the mental picture that you may have of him. I think he’s one of the most underrated heroes in American history.” Hudlin, the director of House Party, Boomerang and The Ladies Man, is good at superhero stories, with a series of Black Panther graphic novels to his credit and a comics-inspired movie, Shadowman, in the works. But to hear historians tell it, his portrayal of Marshall as a kind of peerless crusader, striding the planet to achieve racial justice and salvage the soul of the nation, is more or less true-to-life. “There’s nobody like Marshall,” said Mack. “If you needed a lawyer and you were being railroaded, he is often your last and only resort. And what he did took an incredible amount of courage. In all those things I think the movie is accurate, and people ought to see it, because they ought to remember Marshall. And I think the movie does a great job of remembering and dramatizing that part of Marshall’s career and his importance.” Daniel Sharfstein, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School who has written about the Spell case, said the only atypical element of it for Marshall was that he probably did not face a risk of being lynched in Connecticut, as he did when he traveled in the South. “When Marshall had gone to Connecticut to help with the defense of Joseph Spell, one thing that his co-counsel would remember years later was a lunch that they had where Marshall says, ‘It’s just amazing to be in a place where I don’t have to fear for my life’,” Sharfstein said. “In so many of these places where Marshall went to defend an African American from all manner of unjust criminal charges, his life was in danger constantly.” The Spell case was a tabloid bonanza. One night a couple of weeks before Christmas 1940, Eleanor Strubing, 33, of Greenwich, Connecticut, the daughter of an investment banker and wife of a Princeton-educated advertising executive, was found soaked and shivering on the side of a highway, near a reservoir in New York. Her chauffeur, Spell, had raped her repeatedly, she said, then driven her to the reservoir, thrown her in and stoned her. Police claimed that Spell, 31, confessed to raping Strubing after a 16-hour interrogation. Spell told Marshall and his local co-counsel, Samuel Friedman, that he had admitted to having consensual sex with Strubing in the car, but not to rape. Then the pair had gone for a drive that ended when an agitated Strubing ran away from him, Spell said. There were no witnesses because Strubing’s husband was in Cincinnati, Ohio, on the night in question. It was not a capital case but Spell faced 30 years in prison. Marshall advised him to decline a plea deal that would have required an admission of guilt. When the trial began in January 1941, pitting Friedman and Marshall against a prosecutor who described Spell as a “lust-mad Negro” who stalked his victim “like a panther”, the Bridgeport Herald branded it the “most sensational sex mystery in history”. “With the Joseph Spell case, what’s amazing is it takes place in Connecticut,” said Sharfstein. “The prosecutor is the prosecutor for Greenwich, Connecticut. Yet when he opens his mouth to describe Spell to the jury, he engages in a level of race-baiting that could easily have taken place in Mississippi. “And I think the Joseph Spell case – in many ways it’s a footnote in the history of NAACP’s struggle against segregation. But I think it’s a case that shows just how much the north was also governed by the logic of Jim Crow.” Hudlin said: “This is a classic tabloid case. There’s sex, there’s violence, there’s all this racial tension. There’s all the things that make TMZ and the whole tabloid culture that we’re currently in a success. That same culture existed in the 1940s. Everything about the movie resonates with our culture today.” During the trial Marshall sat to one side, listening to his white colleague speak to the all-white jury, the same way he would listen more than 35 years later to lawyers trying to convince him and his fellow supreme court justices about rape and the death penalty. The stakes in Connecticut were high, but for once they were not life-and-death. “I don’t use words like ‘superhero’,” said Mack. “But when I say he’s extraordinary, I include his intelligence, his sense of strategy, and his talent as just a brilliant trial lawyer. “And it took a lot of courage. There was an ever-present threat of violence, by southern sheriffs or by white vigilantes. It wasn’t just the cases, it was also the travel, the things he had to do, the constant negotiation of Jim Crow and what could you say and not say, and what could you do and not do. And saying or doing the wrong thing could get you killed. “In that sense Marshall really is extraordinary. It took an extraordinary amount of courage to do what he did.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/the-guardian-view-of-the-white-nationalists-tomorrow-must-not-belong-to-them","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T18:01:37Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view of the white nationalists: tomorrow must not belong to them | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/the-guardian-view-of-the-white-nationalists-tomorrow-must-not-belong-to-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/the-guardian-view-of-the-white-nationalists-tomorrow-must-not-belong-to-them","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view of the white nationalists: tomorrow must not belong to them","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A blond youth on a small stage sings America the Beautiful with camp stylings for an audience whose neo-Nazi members give him enthusiastic Hitler salutes: the grotty little cabaret turn captured on video could have come straight from Cabaret, the musical about Berlin in the last days of the Weimar Republic. But this video was filmed last year, in Dallas, Texas, and the singer was an editor for Breitbart News, one of the most energetic supporters of Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency. The revelations reported this week sound like an air-raid siren to warn us that the institutions and the decencies on which our civilisation rest are under a determined attack. Steve Bannon, the leader of Breitbart, went on to become Mr Trump’s chief strategist in the White House before leaving earlier this year; while on the internet or at the ballot box the alliance between “respectable” authoritarian xenophobes and explicit white nationalist movements continues to make progress. This alliance, the “alt-right”, forms a new identity politics of wounded narcissism. White boys of all ages, consumed with rage and self-pity, dream of themselves as heroic blond warriors for civilisation, but in real life they mostly just gang up to bully women. They seem the pallid mirror images of the lost souls who form one of the most common sorts of jihadi sympathisers in the west. This makes the “alt-right” more powerful and more dangerous than previous far-right movements, since it uses the deceptive intimacy of online life to merge the political and the personal in a way that conventional democratic politicians find increasingly hard. One of the earliest manifestations was Gamergate, the campaign of bullying and abuse directed at female game developers three years ago. The relentless harassment, death and rape threats and deliberate violations of privacy were all parts of the larger fascist pattern. As individuals, the members of the online mob enjoyed their own cruelties, their angers, and self-righteousness. Pleasuring themselves with these vices, they form a shadowy collective larger and more frightening than anything any individual could become. This is a great part of the attraction of the movement, but it is also why we must resist it with an equally firm collective resolve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/08/lagarde-imf-warnings-global-economy-central-banks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T06:12:53Z","webTitle":"IMF warnings on economy will fall on deaf ears among world leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/08/lagarde-imf-warnings-global-economy-central-banks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/08/lagarde-imf-warnings-global-economy-central-banks","fields":{"headline":"IMF warnings on economy will fall on deaf ears among world leaders","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Christine Lagarde, boss of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to deliver a hard-hitting speech at the organisation’s annual meeting this week, urging world leaders to push ahead with reforms to turn the current global economic recovery into something more sustainable. Lagarde, who is now in her second four-year term as managing director of the Washington-based lender of last resort, will talk about a lack of education, training and productivity. She will, no doubt, develop the argument she put forward in London a fortnight ago that regulators need to be wary of lenders outside the mainstream repeating the same errors as the banks a decade ago. The need to tame a rapidly growing shadow banking industry will be set alongside concerns about government finances and how those administrations that are awash with cash, like Germany and South Korea, “can use this moment to invest more in their own economies”, to help others with large deficits, as she said last week in a speech at Harvard university. But who cares what Lagarde says about the future direction of the global economy? As far as the autocratic leaders who fill the UN’s assembly hall are concerned, the IMF served its purpose in the wake of the crash. Now its ideas for greater co-operation, investment and equality are surplus to requirements, like a wool coat in August or a Royal Navy landing ship in a cost-cutting defence review. Not only is the IMF seen as a hand-wringing liberal institution making nuanced and technical suggestions in an age of simpler, broad-brush solutions, it is wedded to a past that both left and right on the political spectrum are beginning to accept will never return. The normality of galloping productivity gains that lead to improving wage rates, bountiful tax receipts and declining government debts is still a long way off, and – given how much commerce is changing with the growing amount of business conducted over the internet, the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics – may never return. Not that the IMF is giving up its role as adviser to governments large and small about how they should move forwards. Last week it urged the G20 to focus on “rebalancing and ensuring the sustainability of growth, while fine-tuning the macroeconomic policy mix”. Rebalancing refers back to the call for Germany and South Korea to splash some of their spare money on the goods and services of their neighbours. In this way, the balance between debtor and surplus countries would narrow to reduce the risk of another financial crash. Except that no one is listening to the G20 either. Least of all the G20’s own members, despite their enthusiasm for a group created to rebuild the global economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. Mexico, Australia, Canada and Indonesia are keen to keep the global trading routes open with as few barriers as possible. But the majority of G20 of members are, in different ways, turning in on themselves and of the IMF’s recommendations, the most they can probably manage is the fine-tuning. China is about to embark of a phase of introspection as the Communist party wrestles with keeping control amid slowing growth. Germany is busy saving for its ageing baby boomers, while the Trump administration is busy putting America first, which initially means unwinding its trade agreements. The fact that the IMF’s global concerns are lost on its most powerful members means that all eyes in Washington next week will be on the real movers and shakers – the central bank governors, who turn up en masse for the IMF bash. Yet they have, almost in unison, expressed the limitations of their powers in recent weeks, not least the Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He will be in Washington with Lagarde and may hint again about an interest rate rise in November. Yet he is the first to say that a sustainable future is one only politicians can forge. More turbulence at Ryanair In a sector long beset by turbulence, the eventual crash of Monarch Airlines was predictable – if still a mighty shock to many staff, and hundreds of thousands of passengers who booked flights without protection. While other airlines, such as Air Berlin and Alitalia, have been kept on life support by their governments, Monarch’s demise was sudden. The venerable brand had lasted almost 50 years, carrying holidaymakers through oil shocks, recession and wars. But Britain’s great survivor could not withstand the latest blows, a combination of terrorism, Brexit uncertainty, a collapsing pound and fierce competition from low-cost airlines. Should other airlines fear trouble ahead? Not necessarily. Consolidation, the bigger aviation beasts like to argue, is inevitable. The effects of oversupply in key markets were fatally evident to Monarch: cheap-as-chips fares to Spain in summer meant its planes would never see the autumn. Monarch was too small to survive, but its demise is going to make life a little easier for rivals; already prices have surged on some routes. The greater ramifications for aviation could yet be in events unfolding at Ryanair, where a failure to factor in pilots’ leave led to two waves of cancellations. The Irish airline meets its own crisis from a vastly different position: cash-rich, leading the European market, with annual profits topping £1bn. Its unremittingly low-cost philosophy has come to dominate aviation. Yet at least one pillar of Ryanair’s economy is wobbling. Pilots, long derided by O’Leary and led into unusual contractual arrangements, have rediscovered their strength. While Ryanair looks to double its customers and awaits the arrival of a new fleet of 737s, it is going to need more people to fly them. Pilots’ salaries are not small: but neither is the investment they make in their training, nor the responsibility they hold. With its work culture in the spotlight, Ryanair is being forced to bump up pay for pilots; cabin crew, who suffer even greater indignities at the hands of Ryanair’s management for far less reward, might wait longer for a rise. Higher costs could mean higher fares. But it is time that Ryanair, which now preaches the virtue of niceness to customers, extended the same courtesy to its own employees. Both sides look to win the Uber battle Transport for London’s surprise banishment of Uber – and the subsequent bipartisan peace talks – increasingly feel like carefully staged theatre. The ride-hailing app’s chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi held a tête à tête with TfL commissioner Mike Brown last week, a personal touch designed to show he is taking the firm’s reputational struggles seriously. Both TfL and mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed this gesture of contrition and the script is ready for a deal allowing both sides to claim victory. Khosrowshahi need only make minor tweaks to allay TfL’s concerns about driver background checks and reporting of crime. That will cast him as the face of a new era of social responsibility at Uber, while TfL and Khan can boast that they took on a Californian tech giant and won. It would be no great shock if Uber won its licence back by Christmas. But concerns about issues such as labour rights for drivers will linger on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/12/the-square-and-the-tower-by-niall-ferguson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T06:30:33Z","webTitle":"The Square and the Tower by Niall Ferguson review – a new understanding of global history?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/12/the-square-and-the-tower-by-niall-ferguson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/12/the-square-and-the-tower-by-niall-ferguson-review","fields":{"headline":"The Square and the Tower by Niall Ferguson review – a new understanding of global history?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In a dark joke from the early 1930s, a Jewish man is gleefully browsing Der Stürmer, a Nazi propaganda rag. His baffled friends protest: “Why are you looking at that rubbish? And how come you’re enjoying it so much?” “Because,” he answers, “if you read the Jewish papers, it is going terribly for us. But in this one, the news is all good. We control the banks, we control the country – we run the whole world!” If the maddest conspiracy theories were true, it would be good news for historians, too. They would have rather an easy job, because wars, revolutions and economic crashes could be explained simply by exposing the cabals that engineered them. Niall Ferguson, the prolific historian and broadcaster, is no conspiracy theorist. But in his ambitious new book, The Square and the Tower, he claims that historians have paid too little attention to networks of all kinds. He wants to find a “middle way” between mainstream historians, who have, he thinks, underestimated the role of informal associations, and the conspiracy theorists who exaggerate the significance of such networks. It would be odd to seek a halfway house between your professional colleagues and a bunch of paranoid obsessives; fortunately, this is not what Ferguson actually delivers. His book “tells the story of the interaction between networks and hierarchies” from ancient times to the present, and argues that in two recent periods, networks have been especially important. The first was from the late 15th century, after the invention of printing, to the end of the 18th century. The second came in the wake of the information-technology revolution of the 1970s and continues to the present day. During the intervening years, from the late 1790s to the late 1960s, he reckons that hierarchical, centralised institutions reasserted their hold: he regards totalitarian regimes in Europe in the first half of the 20th century as prime examples of this. Ferguson construes the notion of a network broadly. The Bavarian “Illuminati”, a secretive group that lasted just a decade and never had more than around 2,000 members, counts as a network. So does Facebook, which has over a quarter of the human race as members, many of whom seem not nearly secretive enough. Between these extremes come the Jesuits, the Iberian conquistadors, European royalty in the 19th century, British abolitionists, al-Qaida, the Chinese Communist party and many more, all of whom are or were networks, in Ferguson’s expansive usage. Such social groupings can, to some extent, be analysed with the tools of network science, which is used to study communications technologies, ecosystems and all manner of connected things. Ferguson provides a primer on the subject, though readers will have to refer to a few of his footnotes to get much meat. The science originated with some mathematical diagrams drawn by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century, to solve a puzzle about journeys and bridges. From the early 20th century onwards, similar graphs, known as “sociograms”, were used to map social relationships. Ferguson’s book sports sociograms of (among others) the characters in Hamlet, the Medicis of Florence and their friends, the trade network of the British East India Company, Voltaire and his correspondents, the inevitable Bloomsbury group and jihadi sites on Twitter. These can be intriguing to browse, though it is not always clear why they are there. Ferguson perhaps overstates the novelty of the network approach to the past. An academic journal article in 2002 noted that influential work using network science to illuminate history had been published throughout the previous decade. And the role of informal social networks has for a long time been a mainstay of historians of the Enlightenment – D’Holbach’s Coterie: An Enlightenment in Paris, a renowned study by Alan Kors, was published four decades ago. Most of the tale that Ferguson has to tell, though, is recounted as conventional narrative history rather than applied network theory, and is none the worse for that. The canvas is vast and there are stories for all tastes. A few are perhaps too staccato in the telling – eight of the 60 chapters are three pages or fewer – but there are strong extended treatments of several of the subjects of Ferguson’s previous books, including Henry Kissinger (a “networker of genius”), Britain’s colonial past and the doings of the Rothschild family. George Soros, the philanthropist and financier, appears under two headings. First, as a staple of the most extreme conspiracists’ diet: he supposedly acts in concert with the fictional present-day incarnation of the 18th-century Illuminati, as well as with real clubs, such as the Bilderberg group. Second, at greater length, Soros is featured for his exploits in the currency markets in September 1992, when his hedge funds helped to bring about a devaluation of sterling, and he walked away with a fortune. It was “the collective efforts of Soros’s network” that broke the pound, Ferguson writes, by which he means that the feat could not have been pulled off if other investors had not followed Soros’s lead. Some of the book’s material will be familiar to readers of recent British history, such as a lively account of Cambridge’s Conversazione Society (or “Apostles”) and the university’s Soviet spies. Less familiar, perhaps, are the machinations of Alfred Milner, a British colonial administrator and politician, who became high commissioner of South Africa in 1897 and the subject of conspiracy theories that were partly well-founded. Another welcome vignette concerns General Sir Walter Walker, a pioneer of counter-insurgency, whose hostility to homosexuals and immigrants, and suspicions about the British prime minister, led him to “end up as fodder for the writers of sitcoms” in the 1970s. For Ferguson, Walker’s military triumphs in the jungles of Borneo and Malaya were examples of the success of “decentralised decision-making” and “networked warfare”. At the start of his book, Ferguson concedes that his all-encompassing dichotomy between hierarchies and networks is an “over-simplification”, but he contends that it is a useful starting point. There is room for debate about that. Since he regards the Reformation, the birth of modern science and indeed the whole Enlightenment as “network-based revolutions”, one has to wonder if the notion of a network is being overstretched. The result of the Brexit referendum “was a victory for a network – and network science – over the hierarchy of the British establishment”. And “networks were the key to what happened in American politics in 2016”. Ferguson asserts that Trump’s “network … beat Clinton’s hierarchically organised … campaign”, but it could just as well be said that Clinton’s network was beaten by Trump’s network. Ferguson plausibly claims that Trump could not have become president “without harnessing social networks through online platforms”, but it is also true that he rose to prominence in the first place on old-fashioned television. Whether or not the concept of networks in general can illuminate history quite as much as Ferguson thinks, he does a depressingly good job of evoking the dangers posed by our reliance on electronic networks. We are increasingly at risk of being coarsened, polarised and hacked, according to this Cassandra. The original Cassandra was not believed. But this time the juggernaut is audibly rolling towards us, and we know Ferguson is right. We just don’t know what to do about it. • Anthony Gottlieb’s latest book is The Dream of Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Philosophy. The Square and the Tower is published by Allen Lane.

In the rest of his article he mixed unrelated science from all over the globe with the peculiar claims of noted eccentrics, and suggested that we should plough unsuitable land to grow soya, which will not grow in this climate, to produce artificial meat in urban factories. He didn’t mention inconvenient features of the British ruminant livestock industry, such as the fact that most feed that animals get other than grass is made up of byproducts of the human food industry such as brewers’ grains, sugar beet and fruit-juice pulp, most of which would have to go to landfill if cows and sheep did not recycle it. Without the income from this form of recycling, the price of food in the shop would increase. We do need to moderate excessive meat consumption, and we do need to act on climate change, but this article sows confusion that will delay necessary change. Huw Jones St Clears, Carmarthenshire • Livestock has long formed part of the warp and weft of our countryside, and the issue of its potent role in greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution cannot be ducked. Compared to other sectors, farming has done poorly. Emissions have risen since 2010, despite the increasing urgency to act. That does not mean that we should get rid of all livestock. The issues are complex. Even the Food Climate Research Network, cited by George Monbiot, concludes that grazing livestock has a limited place in a sustainable food system. For us, this limited place means people in the UK should eat less but better-quality animal produce, whether dairy, eggs or meat. It also requires eating many more plants and challenging rising demand for animal-based proteins. The challenge for the farming sector is to make the shift to more sustainable and resilient systems, much less dependent on fossil fuels and set up to support a healthier population. We know this is possible because some farmers are doing this already, and very successfully too. Graeme Willis Food and farming campaigner, Campaign to Protect Rural England • On this occasion George Monbiot’s evangelical zeal obscures some fundamental practicalities. First, much grazing land is simply unsuitable for growing crops. For example, an organic farmer friend on Dartmoor tells me his land will successfully grow only grass. He farms organically and the manure allows insects to flourish, encouraging a high number and variety of farmland birds. Many arable farms, with their vast acres of monoculture, are often deserts where wildlife is concerned. Second, the implication that livestock farming is cruel is unfair and insulting. Like many farmers, my friend cares greatly about both the natural environment and the welfare of his animals. Third, would rewilding always be such a good idea? It would most likely produce impenetrable scrubland. We have a profound love of our farmed landscape, shaped in large measure by livestock grazing. Surely few of the 99% who are not vegans would consider veganism a price worth paying for its destruction. In any case, replacing meat with vegetables is a second-order priority beside the existential issues of population growth and global warming. And, yes, I am a meat-eater and the vast majority of people are firmly of the opinion that the tastiest dishes are those based on meat. David Thomas Hereford • Our dependence on meat is mirrored by the Vikings who colonised Greenland during the Middle Ages. Although fish was readily available, they continued to raise cattle as this conferred social status. When the climate turned colder they perished. By contrast, the inhabitants of Tikopia, a small Pacific island, abandoned pig-rearing in the 17th century as they were rooting up vegetables and competing for food. This may be the only example of a society voluntarily abandoning meat consumption, and it allowed the Tikopians to maintain a population of 400 inhabitants per square mile without any recourse to modern agricultural technology. The question posed in my book The Gilgamesh Gene is whether humanity is behaving like the Vikings or the Tikopians. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • This is another stimulating article, but I wonder why George Monbiot does not make the point that the essential reason for not eating animal products is that the breeding, rearing and killing of sentient and intelligent animals is cruel and brutal, and unnecessary for human beings to survive and thrive. Of course, the supplementary point that the evidence shows that it is also potentially damaging to the future wellbeing of humanity is also relevant, but it is not the essential reason for avoiding animal products.

The last of the monthly print editions will be released next month, publisher Condé Nast said on Friday. Jobs losses are expected as a result of the change to a “mobile-first, social-first” format, though the publisher declined to say how many. “The editorial and commercial departments will be fully integrated, offering our partners access to the whole team, with a unified and cohesive structure creating content for brands and editorial alike,” Condé Nast said. “Today’s Glamour consumer moves to a different rhythm than the one who bought the magazine when it launched in 2001. It is a faster, more focused, multi-platform relationship. “The quality of ideas, vision and execution remain central, but the way in which it is delivered must change fundamentally with Glamour’s new mix of digital, social, video, live and print, and its focus on beauty,” said Albert Read, the managing director of Condé Nast Britain. “We have the brand, the creativity and the access – an enormous competitive edge in the market – and we are rendering it in new ways around beauty to reflect the Glamour woman of today, and of tomorrow.” Condé Nast said further details would be announced “in due course. Changes to the site will begin in the coming weeks, and the new-look Glamour for the beauty obsessed will debut early 2018.” Simon Gresham Jones, Condé Nast’s chief digital officer, said: “Glamour’s authority across print, digital and social provides a powerful foundation for this transformation and future growth. We will be empowering our advertisers with creative, collaborative and data-informed opportunities, and look forward to inspiring the Glamour audience in new ways.” The changes will affect only the UK product – one of 17 produced under the Glamour brand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/06/sack-boris-and-reshuffle-cabinet-senior-tories-to-tell-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T08:11:33Z","webTitle":"Sack Boris Johnson and reshuffle cabinet, senior Tories to tell May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/06/sack-boris-and-reshuffle-cabinet-senior-tories-to-tell-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/06/sack-boris-and-reshuffle-cabinet-senior-tories-to-tell-may","fields":{"headline":"Sack Boris Johnson and reshuffle cabinet, senior Tories to tell May","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May must sack Boris Johnson and shake up her cabinet if she is to reassert her authority and silence talk of a leadership plot in the wake of this week’s calamitous party conference, Conservative MPs will tell her. Few backbenchers were willing to give their public backing on Friday to Grant Shapps, the former party chairman who emerged as the prime mover behind a bid to gather enough MPs to convince the prime minister to step down. But many remain furious about the foreign secretary’s recent behaviour and want May to show that she is willing to exert discipline. Younger backbenchers are also anxious to see a new generation of talent brought into government. The issue is set to be raised at next Wednesday’s meeting of the executive of the party’s powerful 1922 Committee. “There’s a general feeling that there’s support for her there, but I do think she needs to do a major reshuffle, and if she doesn’t act to sack Boris and to bring some new people on board, she has a problem,” said one member, who said several backbench colleagues had asked them to raise concerns about the makeup of May’s top team. Another said: “Some people are saying, ‘Impose some discipline, show that you can sack some people,’ and I think she has the authority to do that.” Johnson’s future became the talk of the Tory conference after the latest of a series of interventions in which he appeared to set out a distinct position on Brexit. The foreign secretary used his speech on the conference floor in Manchester to profess loyalty to May and “every syllable” of the stance set out in her Florence speech last month. But he sparked a row later the same day with controversial remarks about Libya. Three Tory MPs – Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston – called for Johnson to be sacked, after he said the war-torn city of Sirte only had to “clear the dead bodies away” to become a world-class tourist attraction. The prime minister took a day off after Wednesday’s speech, during which she was handed a mock P45 by a prankster, repeatedly lost her voice, and lettering fell off the backdrop. She emerged on Friday to carry out what aides said were her usual round of constituency engagements, including attending a charity coffee morning, and to insist she had the backing of cabinet colleagues. “What I think is necessary for the country now, what the country needs, is calm leadership. That’s exactly what I’m providing, and I’m providing that with the full support of my cabinet,” she said. Shapps toured TV studios on Friday morning, urging his fellow MPs to act. “A growing number of my colleagues realise that the solution isn’t to bury our heads in the sand and just hope things will get better. “It never worked out for [Gordon] Brown or [John] Major and I don’t think it is going to work out here either,” he said. Senior Tories – and some backbenchers – have been quick to defend May although none of them seem to be taking the threat too seriously. Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee, said the attempt to force a leadership contest lacked credibility and was doomed to fail. The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, who ran against May for the leadership in 2016 but pulled out, told BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions that May had the “absolute support” of her cabinet and her party. “I don’t think that there’s anything like 30 others and I think what Grant Shapps is doing is incredibly unhelpful. Like a lot of my colleagues have said today, he should shut up.” The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, said May’s critics should “put up, shut up and get off the stage” and that her party should “get its house in order”. “I have to say I’ve not got much time for them,” she told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast. “I think there’s an awful lot of people in our party that need to settle down. I think if the plotters were serious, they would be led by someone a bit more serious [than Shapps].” Few believe Shapps has much hope of gathering the 48 signatures necessary to trigger a leadership contest. One MP said: “I wouldn’t trust Grant Shapps any further than I could spit.” The backbencher Vicky Ford said Shapps was out of touch: “He’s not even in our WhatsApp group.” Shapps was reported to have since been added to the group on the messenger app, purely so other members could express their fury at his plot. Nigel Evans, the MP for the Ribble Valley and a member of the 1922 Committee executive, told the BBC’s Daily Politics the move was “more of a tantrum than a coup”. “What Grant’s got to do is just calm down. Theresa had the legendary conference cold, and when you get a cold you take Strepsils, you don’t take a revolver,” he said. But others said the concerns Shapps was voicing were widely felt and that even without the incidents during May’s conference speech, MPs would have been discussing the urgent need for a radical reboot. Newer MPs are also keen to see fresh faces brought into the leadership team, as the party struggles to show that it can restore its appeal to younger voters. May made a series of announcements in Manchester aimed at seizing back the initiative from Labour, including raising the threshold at which graduates will start paying back their student loans, and setting aside an extra £2bn for social housing. No 10 made a deliberate effort on Friday to stress that it was business as usual for May, with sources saying she would be working through her red boxes of paperwork as normal over the weekend. The government also announced that she would meet senior business leaders on Monday to discuss Brexit, as negotiations resume in Brussels between David Davis and Michel Barnier, the EU commission’s negotiator. Pro-Brexit MPs are known to be among up to 30 rebels signed up by Shapps, with some fearing that if May’s authority is threatened, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating hand. One senior EU official said the political uncertainty had made it even less likely the EU 27 would agree to Britain’s demands to move on from withdrawal issues to trade talks. Barnier gave an informal briefing to EU ambassadors on the position in the negotiations on Friday but the political turmoil in Britain was not discussed, one source said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/10/university-vice-chancellors-pay-office-for-students-nicola-dandridge","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T05:50:40Z","webTitle":"University poacher turned gamekeeper sets sights on vice-chancellors’ pay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/10/university-vice-chancellors-pay-office-for-students-nicola-dandridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/10/university-vice-chancellors-pay-office-for-students-nicola-dandridge","fields":{"headline":"University poacher turned gamekeeper sets sights on vice-chancellors’ pay","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is the middle of the Tory party conference and speculation over the future of student funding is frenzied. But Nicola Dandridge, the woman who, as head of the new Office for Students, will have to implement whatever funding system universities end up with, as well as keep an eye on management salaries and that universities remain solvent, doesn’t want to talk about it. “I don’t think the discussion about potential changes to tuition fees really makes a significant difference to the OfS,” she says. Nor does she want to discuss the review of higher education funding, announced by Theresa May, which could throw the entire funding system up in the air. “It is for ministers to decide the review’s remit and the involvement of the Office for Students, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.” Transparency may be “built into our DNA”, as she puts it, but only up to a point. Her job, she emphasises, is to carry out the instructions set out in the Higher Education and Research Act, passed this summer. The OfS assumes responsibility for funding universities (although not for funding research). It will oversee quality and standards, and decide which institutions deserve to call themselves universities and award degrees. It will be able to fine, suspend or even close any it considers inefficient or failing in their duties to students. This gives it unprecedented powers and has prompted plenty of opposition – not least the complaint that it threatens universities’ autonomy. Dandridge says that only when students’ interest is under threat will the OfS intervene, and while “you could argue that undermines institutional autonomy, it’s absolutely the right thing to do”. That the OfS is all about protecting students is a message she is determined to get across. She has spent her time so far talking to students and their union representatives about what they want to see from the body. She could also perhaps talk to her sons, both at university – one a second-year undergraduate, the other a third year. But, she says, she doesn’t want them to influence her thinking. “It’s very dangerous to draw conclusions about higher education policy on the basis of your children. Whenever I’m tempted to think: ‘Ah that’s interesting. You’re saying X’, I go, ‘No, hang on, that’s only two people’s perspectives’.” A few days after we meet she is due to give a speech at the National Union of Students about how to “ensure that students are meaningfully engaged in what we do and how we do it”. Her big idea is for a student panel that will bring together about 10 people to inform how the OfS is set up, chaired by the student representative on the OfS board. The board role was not included in the government’s initial plans but, after an outcry, the universities minister, Jo Johnson, agreed an amendment in the bill to include it. The full panel should be in place next month. Having a primary responsibility to students could mean making tough decisions, especially on funding and the viability of institutions. Would she really be prepared to see universities go to the wall? “Yes, if that’s in the student interest,” she says. “Our concern in those circumstances is not to protect, to prop up, a failing institution.” This is quite a turnaround for Dandridge who, only a few months ago, was in charge of lobbying for university head honchos as chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), the vice-chancellors’ umbrella group. Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer who has recently mounted a campaign against what he called the university “cartel” on tuition fees and vice-chancellors’ high salaries, was among those who questioned whether her appointment was “poacher turned gamekeeper”. Dandridge responds that she is used to shifting roles. After studying classics at Oxford and a law conversion course at London Metropolitan University (then City of London Poly), she qualified to practise law in Scotland, at Glasgow University – “I thought I just have to get out of this south of England bubble”. She worked as a City lawyer, then swapped sides and worked for trades unions. This was followed by a stint at the Equality Challenge Unit, responsible for pursuing diversity and social mobility among university staff and students, before she swapped again, to work for UUK. “Judge me on my record is what I say”. Perhaps her trickiest moment at UUK was when she defended its guidance on the voluntary separation of men and women at campus events. Gender segregation was not completely “alien to our culture”, she said then, and if participants at university events were happy to sit in separate groups and neither was disadvantaged, that would be fine. UUK sought legal advice but was forced to withdraw the guidance after an intervention by David Cameron, then prime minister. This is something she is not prepared to revisit – “it was a UUK issue” – but it was an uncomfortable example of how the law sometimes has to give way to political expediency. She is finding her legal experience invaluable her new role. “I think a legal background really assists in understanding the responsibilities of being a regulator,” she says. “I’m very comfortable operating in that space – between a piece of legislation and having an impact. What is it you want to achieve, and how can I use the law in a way that reflects government’s intentions?” If these intentions sometimes put her in conflict with vice-chancellors, so be it. This extends to their salaries. Dandridge agrees there needs to be “a greater sense of responsibility and accountability to students and the public purse in the way that salaries are set”. She took an 18% pay cut when she was offered the OfS role and earns £165,000. Full package? “I think I’ve got a potential for a bonus of £20,000.” Why did she take the cut? “Personal reasons. I’m not exactly saying I’m hard done by. It’s a substantial salary and at an appropriate level for the role.” It is also more than the £150,000 – about what the prime minister earns – beyond which Johnson says vice-chancellors should justify their salaries to the OfS. Is £150,000 what vice-chancellors should earn? “It’s got to be for the universities and university chairs to set the appropriate level for their institution,” she says, and that will vary depending on the scale of responsibilities and challenges. It is interesting, given Dandridge’s equalities background, that Michael Barber, chair of OfS, took a smaller, 10%, pay cut and Johnson didn’t mention whether Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, the new body funding research, would be taking one too. Last year Dandridge was accused by the Daily Mail of seeking exemption for universities from the Freedom of Information act in order to hide details of high salaries. She says that was never her position. Rather, she felt there were some jobs in universities, which, for reasons of confidentiality, needed to be protected because of the more “competitive environment” the sector faced. Transparency, she says firmly, “is going to be one of the values that is likely to underpin what the OfS is”. Transparency will also be part of the new regulatory framework for universities the OfS will oversee, but the details will depend on a consultation to be launched imminently. Also still to become clear is how the teaching excellence framework will work, now that the government has decided to freeze tuition fees. One of the incentives for institutions to take part in the Tef – supposed to measure teaching quality – was that those receiving gold and silver awards would be able to increase their fees in line with inflation. Now they won’t. Won’t some decide not to bother with it? This doesn’t seem to worry her. “I think and hope that they would understand that getting involved in further development of the Tef is likely to benefit students,” she says. “Why would they not want to be part of that?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/08/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:01:34Z","webTitle":"Observer Sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/08/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/08/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer Sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fill the grid using the numbers 1 to 9.

The Catalan referendum and the German election illustrate this spectacularly. The scale of the far-right vote in what was once East Germany and Catalonia’s apparent march towards independence may look like they happened on separate planets – to be sure, they are fuelled by different political beliefs – but they both have to do with pent-up frustrations. Citizens who feel that they have been insulted have gone to the ballot box, and in some cases taken to the streets, to protest. In both situations there is a vivid historical backdrop, with memories of Europe’s 20th-century nightmares playing an important role: in Catalonia, the fight against fascism and Franco; in the east of Germany, the experiences of Nazism and Soviet communism. In Leipzig and the nearby small town of Grimma, I was told about how citizens felt their self-esteem had been trampled on. German reunification has not led to a shared sense of community. Rather, it’s compared to colonisation: “westerners” took over everything – regional administrations, courts, education and the economy. Everything about life in the Communist state – the way people dressed, what they ate, what they learned in school, how they decorated their homes, what they watched on TV – became an object of scorn and ridicule. It’s not that life isn’t better now: of course it is. There is freedom. And living standards have improved immensely. But many eastern Germans feel their identity has somehow been negated, as if they were being asked to forget about it. Speaking with Catalan friends in recent days, I heard similar qualms: “We were waiting for a sign that our voice would be heard, but as the years passed nothing was changing” … “Our cultural difference isn’t being acknowledged as it should be”: these were common sentiments, even from people not altogether enthusiastic about breaking away from Spain. Identity isn’t just about power, rights and institutions. Former East Germans aren’t asking for secession, nor a special status. Catalonia is deeply divided on the question of independence. Nor can identity be boiled down to purely economic factors – wages, income, jobs, social class. It’s true that regions covering the former East Germany have higher unemployment (7.1%) than western ones (5.1%), but the malaise reflected in the east German far-right vote went beyond material circumstances. Catalonia’s economy has thrived in recent decades – that hasn’t prevented protests. A generation has passed since German reunification, in 1990; and Spain joined the European club in 1986. It’s hard to exaggerate the benefits. Anyone who visits Leipzig, with its beautifully restored facades and the amazing modern architecture of its university, will struggle to spot traces of the bleakness and poverty that once characterised eastern Europe. Catalonia’s transformation has also been stunning. I have spent many summers in the Pyrenees, regularly crossing into Spain from France. And over the years I have seen roads improved, hotels built, and prosperity spread – a region shedding the drabness left by the Franco years. The 1992 Barcelona Olympics celebrated that success. Yet these accomplishments don’t necessarily translate into people’s minds. The European project is built on the idea that economic ties and social improvement bring people together and help them overcome the traumas of history. In recent years, much has been said about how nationalism, populism and anti-establishment sentiment are a response to globalisation and inequality. Less has been said about a more specifically European ingredient: the shadow cast by 20th-century traumas born of war and totalitarianism, and the difficulty – which still persists – of dealing with that legacy. It is this history that sets continental Europe’s populist convulsions apart from the forces that have driven Brexit and Trump. Britain and the United States never experienced life under fascism, or behind a version of the iron curtain. Across Europe, populism and extremism, whether of left or right, plunges its roots into 20th century political battles and references. Catalan nationalism, I think, is different from Scottish nationalism in this way also: it can quickly reignite memories of oppression that are still vivid within families – stories of life and death, in one’s own country. When crowds in Barcelona start singing old songs of resistance against the Franco regime, history is back. It is also back when 22.5% of voters in the former East Germany (twice as many as in the western part of the country) cast their ballots for a party – Alternative für Deutschland – whose platform amounts to a rejection of everything Germany’s western-built democracy has stood for. Last month’s German election was a clear demonstration that the Wall has survived in people’s minds. Germany and Spain today find themselves confronted by ghosts of the past – not just to do with problems related to social cohesion and integration, or how to preserve a constitutional order. Yes, politicians exploit polarisation. But it is striking to see how, over a generation after democracy was anchored in countries that had experienced the worse of the 20th century, so many citizens feel that so much has still been left unaddressed. Isaiah Berlin once wrote that nationalism feeds on a sense of wounded pride and humiliation. As Europe tries to sort itself out and prepare for the future – including through grassroots “democratic conventions” due next year across the continent – it would do well to pay closer attention to those wounds left by history. We thought that they had healed – but they really haven’t. • Natalie Nougayrède is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/06/my-mother-caused-a-splash-with-margaret-thatcher-over-washing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T17:34:39Z","webTitle":"My mother caused a splash with Margaret Thatcher over washing | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/06/my-mother-caused-a-splash-with-margaret-thatcher-over-washing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/06/my-mother-caused-a-splash-with-margaret-thatcher-over-washing","fields":{"headline":"My mother caused a splash with Margaret Thatcher over washing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Other people’s washing habits are not a new subject for media frenzy (Letters, 6 October).

The country that gave us Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi could only manage a 0-0 draw against Peru in Buenos Aires last Thursday night in their World Cup qualifier. Thus, its qualification prospects “hang by a thread”. Hanging by a thread has been the default status of Scotland’s qualification prospects for any competition we have ever entered. If Scotland found themselves in a qualifying group comprising only itself and no other our prospects would still “hang by a thread”. Argentina have had a wretched qualifying campaign, epitomised by that disappointing draw the other night. Now they face the very real prospect of failing to qualify for the finals in Russia next year, the first time in 48 years that they will have failed to reach the business end of the competition. They currently lie sixth in the South American group standings. Only the top four countries qualify automatically, with the fifth-placed team required to face New Zealand in a play-off. Argentina would have a decent chance of securing that opportunity if they won their last group match. To do this, though, they have to defeat Ecuador in the highly rarefied atmosphere of Quito, something they have failed to do since 2001. South American football supporters are rarely calm in the face of adversity. When Brazil were beaten by Uruguay in the final of the 1950 World Cup in Rio, it was reported that at least seven people took their own lives. The goalkeeper, who was deemed to have been at fault for at least one of Uruguay’s two goals, was virtually exiled from his country. In 1969, Honduras and El Salvador fought a brief war when mounting tension between the two nations was brought to a head by rioting after a game between them. If Argentina do fail to make it to Russia, there will be national mourning. There is surely an opportunity for some enterprising Scottish grief counsellors here. I’d be advising them to keep an eye on advertising slots in the main Argentinian newspapers. If la mierda hits el ventilador, opportunities will exist for people with a track record in dealing with the emotional aftermath of football failure. The saltire is a globally recognised kitemark of resilience in the face of disaster on the playing field. Scottish football fans are currently at the familiar “daring to hope” stage of the road to ultimate disappointment. The last-minute victory against Slovakia at Hampden on Thursday night gives us a slim chance of qualifying for a World Cup for the first time since 1998. To do, this we must first beat Slovenia in Ljubljana this evening and then hope that this will be enough for us to be among the best second-placed teams. Then we must hope that we can avoid the likes of Portugal, Italy and Denmark in the play-offs. And even if we did we might face the prospect of running into Wales or Northern Ireland, who currently possess the best squads in their entire history. There simply isn’t enough optimism in Scotland to cover all of the hoped-for outcomes in these games. I hate it when people say that Scotland will always struggle to achieve success because we are a small nation. Other unheralded and small nations who possess nothing of our football heritage always seem to get a wee turn now and then. Belgium are having an extended period of success while Portugal have always punched well above their weight. Denmark won the European Championships in 1992 and Greece triumphed in 2004. England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales – all have not only qualified for a World Cup or European Championship but have also managed to reach the latter stages at least once… but not Scotland. All of these other nations get to have their time in the sun but for us it’s either winter or a watery autumn. We could have had a brilliant team in the late 1960s but failed to qualify for anything then either, due to the baffling decision to avoid choosing Celtic players from the great Lisbon Lions side who, for several years, were the best club team in Europe. No matter how long are the odds against Scotland, we always seem to fashion a new method of increasing them. At the centre of much of this is the Scottish Football Association, a body so inept and incompetent that it seems to have modelled itself on Freedonia in the Rufus T Firefly era. In the 1990s, it ripped the soul as well as the infrastructure out of Hampden Park, one of the great amphitheatres of world football. It is now a stadium reduced in size and stature and no longer deemed fit to host any matches of global importance. It possesses all the menace and sense of occasion of a municipal movie house. It does, though, have a gargantuan and state-of-the-art corporate and executive facility. By also deploying a pricing strategy for tickets that borders on the exploitative, it seems the SFA is very sportingly bent on sacrificing all facets of home advantage. The recent match against Malta was never going to be a sell-out but the attendance was smaller than usual owing to the SFA’s decision to charge fans £36 for the privilege. Last Thursday night, supporters were also stunned to see the Scotland team lining up for battle in a must-win encounter resplendent in pink. There is no pink anywhere in the colours of Scotland and there was no colour clash with their opponents that required them to forgo the famous dark blue. Obviously nothing must come before the opportunity to market your new second strip. On the field, another group of honest scufflers interspersed with a handful of players with genuine talent scraped a 1-0 win against a country that can best be described as decent. Two of the country’s brightest and most skilful prospects sat unused on the bench all night. So Argentina, this is what it means to be Scottish; welcome to our world.

The NRA’s concession, heralded as a breakthrough, is so small it is hard to see with the naked eye. The gun rights group broke its silence on the Las Vegas shooting Thursday as media reports suggested Republican members of Congress might support a ban on “bump stocks”, a device that allows semi-automatic rifles to mimic the rapid fire of a fully automatic weapon. Officials confirmed that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had 12 rifles fitted with bump stocks in the hotel suite he used to stage his attack. It is not clear how closely the Republicans and NRA coordinated on Thursday, but they moved in quick succession. “Clearly, that’s something we need to look into,” the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said in a television interview early on Thursday, noting that he had never heard of bump stocks before. At 2.14pm, the NRA sent out a press blast suggesting that bump stocks “should be subject to additional regulations”, and calling for more review. At about 2.30pm, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said during a briefing that “we’re certainly open to having that conversation” on regulating bump stocks. Rather than endorsing a law banning the devices, as Democratic gun control advocates proposed, the NRA said in its statement on Thursday that it was asking the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which had repeatedly ruled that bump stocks did not fall under the regulation of federal firearms statutes, to review its decision. This is a “pretty small giveback” but “may go a long way to placating people who are demanding action after Las Vegas,” said Robert Spitzer, a gun politics expert at State University of New York at Cortland. “If this can be changed through a simple administrative ruling from the ATF, you don’t even have to go to Congress to get a law passed. That would be a little plus from the NRA’s point of view,” Spitzer said. “Their basic political default position is no new gun laws. It wouldn’t be a new gun law.” Even NRA members, Spitzer added, regard bump stocks as having no legitimate use. “I think even the gun people on the inside are saying, ‘Why would you bother to even defend this stupid thing?’” he said. In a Thursday night interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, said that “the American people are struggling. They’re grieving. And so are the five million members of the National Rifle Association.” NRA members had been among those shot and killed in the Las Vegas attack on a country music festival, Cox said. “The American people are looking for answers, and so are we.” When asked about bump stocks, which Carlson called “ludicrous”, Cox said: “We didn’t talk about banning anything.” He added: “There are not a whole lot of people who own these things.” Dave Kopel, a gun law expert and gun rights advocate, said it was possible that the ATF might be able to reconsider the decision, but that such a reversal might be tricky. “It might be better to update the statute and say that any device that makes a normal gun fire as fast a machine gun should have to go through the same process as buying a machine gun,” he said. Having Congress update the 1934 National Firearms Act would be preferable to Senator Dianne Feinstein’s bump stock ban legislation, Kopel said, which was too broad and might fuel an underground market in bump stocks by not providing any way for current owners to register them legally. Kopel, who has been a gun rights expert and author for decades, noted that he had never heard of bump stocks before this week. Two of the most prominent online companies that sell bump stocks, Bump Fire Systems and Slide Fire Solutions, are based in Moran, Texas and sell variations on a single product for different models of semi-automatic rifle. Neither appears to be a major gun industry player, though bump stocks do appear to be a significant part of the industry in Moran, which has a population of about 350 people. If his business had to close, “It would hurt the whole town, the school. We pay a very large amount of property taxes,” Jeremiah Cottle, the 40-year-old owner of Slide Fire Solutions, said in a brief interview with the Dallas Morning News. At one point Slide Fire Solutions had employed about a 10th of the town’s population, according to the Dallas Morning News. Slide Fire Solutions and Bump Fire Systems shared a similar online message on Friday: “We have decided to temporarily suspend taking new orders in order to provide the best service with those already placed.” Bump Fire Systems also noted on its website: “Due to extremely high demands, we have temporarily stopped taking orders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/06/liberal-guilt-is-over-cosying-up-to-the-corporate-elite","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T17:35:18Z","webTitle":"Liberal guilt is over cosying up to the corporate elite | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/06/liberal-guilt-is-over-cosying-up-to-the-corporate-elite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/06/liberal-guilt-is-over-cosying-up-to-the-corporate-elite","fields":{"headline":"Liberal guilt is over cosying up to the corporate elite","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Devorah Baum (The long read, 3 October) refers to the guilt which modern-day liberals feel because they have lost faith in utopian politics and realise they are acting out of self-interest.

But this personalisation of liberal guilt is in itself a cop-out. It is not so much that liberals feel guilty, since they also experience great anxiety at their reduced status and relative income, but fear that it will only get worse if they take sides against the corporate elite. Liberals and centrists have played an honourable role, with support and pressure from organised working people, in wresting valuable reforms from the capitalist class. But mainly their history is one of cosying up with that class in the interests of preserving the privileges of the middle classes. These days, liberals are most likely to be found defending the actions of people like Clinton and Obama or, in this country, Tony Blair and the liberal social democrats whose pursuit of neoliberal policies has done so much to produce the present broken societies.

EU diplomats are grappling with how to deal with a weakened British prime minister who they believe has made compromises but has not gone far enough. Both sides are counting down to an EU summit this month, where EU leaders could offer an olive branch to a “fragile” Theresa May by starting to discuss the future relationship with the UK among themselves. But they have abandoned the idea of moving to the next phase of Brexit talks. Having watched the Tory party conference with grim fascination, senior EU negotiators want to send a positive signal to May, who has started to climb down from her hardline position. The prime minister has agreed the UK will pay €20bn into the EU budget as the price of a transition deal, while British officials have quietly recognised that European law will have a “direct effect” in protecting the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. In response to the more positive tone, the EU27 could agree to start discussing the future relationship and Brexit transition among themselves – an idea that could be agreed at the summit. An EU discussion on trade – even without the UK – is intended to keep momentum in the talks, but falls way short of the detailed negotiations Davis has been angling for. The British team has been stymied by the EU’s strict Brexit timetable, which requires “sufficient progress” on the divorce issues – citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and Ireland – before discussing trade. The UK had hoped to get the green light from EU leaders to move on to trade at the summit on 19-20 October. But in Brussels it is almost a foregone conclusion that EU leaders will decide more time is needed to sort out the divorce. “Barring any major titanic incident, there is a general consensus there won’t be sufficient progress in October,” said one diplomat, echoing the view of several sources. But even if the EU starts to discuss the future, Brussels believes the UK does not know what it wants. “The May cabinet needed a whole summer to get clarity on the transition. I think they will need three or four months of infighting to decide on the future [relationship],” a senior source said. “The real drama for me is where [the British government] will be in six weeks’ time,” the source added – referring to May’s “fragile” position and the jostling to replace her at No 10. Many in Brussels have pencilled in an EU leaders’ summit in mid-December as the date when the UK will clear the divorce hurdle. “[EU leaders] will say yes in December, probably, no matter what,” said another senior source. “We need an agreement as well.” The source discounted an agreement in November, saying Brexit was a low priority for the coming weeks: “[The leaders] have real work to do. [Brexit] is not real work, it is an accident they have to solve.” Meanwhile, EU negotiators are confident the UK will next week make further concessions towards their position on citizens’ rights in contested areas, such as family reunification, but also on the red-button issue of the European court of justice (ECJ). Senior Brussels players are encouraged by the signals they detect from the UK on citizens’ rights and are crossing their fingers for substantial progress. But they expect to be disappointed on the Brexit divorce bill and Ireland. The prime minister’s tacit admission that the UK would pay into the EU budget two years after Brexit has improved the mood, but there is renewed impatience over when the British will spell out what else they will pay. Davis has said the UK has “moral obligations” to the EU, but even senior British civil servants have been unclear what they are. France and Germany are upholding the EU’s strong line that the UK must sign up for a share of the EU’s unpaid bills and officials’ pensions, tripling the sum May has promised. On Ireland, both sides are tiptoeing around the acute problem of whether the UK’s exit from the single market and customs union will lead to a hard border – either between north and south or a sea border. Both sides are worried that a hard border would reignite tensions in Northern Ireland; neither want to say there could be no alternative. On the ECJ, outlines of a compromise are beginning to emerge: the British supreme court would not be obliged to refer contested cases on citizens’ rights to Luxembourg, but if they did, would have to accept an ECJ verdict. If accepted by member states, this would also be a concession by the EU, which has said the ECJ should be the final arbiter on citizens’ rights. Taken with the UK’s concession on “direct effect”, Brussels believes the UK is moving close to something that looks like the 1972 European Communities Act – the legislation that took Britain into Europe. Other diplomats are withholding judgment until British officials sit down at the negotiating table next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/09/apostasy-review-daniel-kokotajlo-jehovahs-witnesses","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T13:49:16Z","webTitle":"Apostasy review – faith and fellowship in potent account of hidden world of Jehovah's Witnesses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/apostasy-review-daniel-kokotajlo-jehovahs-witnesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/09/apostasy-review-daniel-kokotajlo-jehovahs-witnesses","fields":{"headline":"Apostasy review – faith and fellowship in potent account of hidden world of Jehovah's Witnesses","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is an utterly absorbing and accomplished debut feature from writer-director Daniel Kokotajlo, known before this for his well-regarded short films Myra and The Mess Hall of an Online Warrior. Apostasy combines subtlety and sensitivity with real emotional power. It also packs a sledgehammer narrative punch two-thirds in, after which life in the film carries on with eerie quietness as usual, while we, the audience, have no choice but to go into a state of shock. It shows that Kokotajlo can really do something so many new British film-makers can’t or won’t: tell a story. The film is set among a community of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Oldham in north-west England. Kokotajlo grew up in a Jehovah’s Witness family before leaving the faith while at college, and his writing – detached but calmly observant and sympathetic – is evidently based on a real knowledge of this culture, invisible to outsiders. He has apparently used the JW meeting hall in Oldham for the film: the building’s exterior, at any rate. I have to say that Apostasy exposes the slightly preposterous drama of Richard Eyre’s new film The Children Act, with a similar plotline about Jehovah’s Witnesses, based on the Ian McEwan novel. Apostasy is more knowledgeable, less excitable. Siobhan Finneran plays Ivanna, a middle-aged woman firmly in the Jehovah’s Witness faith: a world in which failure to believe, or to avoid unbelievers, can get you shunned or “disfellowshipped”. She has two teenage daughters: the older Luisa (Sacha Parkinson) is at college and the younger Alex (Molly Wright) is still in school. Both live at home, of course. As to the girls’ father, Kokotajlo leaves that as the great unmentioned subject: whether alive or dead, his past behaviour and current absence is a potent, silent countercurrent to the drama. Ivanna is concerned about the bad influences Luisa will encounter at college: people of no faith or, even worse, the wrong faith. (She dismisses Catholicism as “wishy-washy”.) Her fears are well founded. Luisa has an unbelieving boyfriend by whom she has got pregnant and her excommunication (to borrow the wishy-washy term) is inevitable. Meanwhile, delicate, shy, clever Alex is very flattered when a young man, an up-and-coming elder in the JW faith, introduces himself to her and her mother at the weekly meeting and asks them both to supper: this is Steven, played by Robert Emms. Alex sees perfectly well how the match is being made by her mother, in concert with the church, so that she will not go down the same route as her sister, and, concerned as she is for Luisa, this responsibility cements her already deeply committed attachment to the orthodoxy. Family tensions become unbearable. The performances of Finneran, Wright and Parkinson are tremendous and all the more moving for their restraint. Kokotajlo’s direction is lucid and direct. With cinematographer Adam Scarth (who also shot the recent Daphne), he conjures an undramatic world of cloudy days and dull workplaces, kitchens, front rooms. The women’s faces are captured mostly in intimate closeup. Parkinson’s simmering anger as Luisa is almost unwatchably painful, because her rebellion is always tempered by a need not to upset her mother; Wright’s gentleness and tenderness in the role of Alex is heartbreaking. Finneran’s Ivanna is the most mysterious of all. She is a world away from, say, Geraldine McEwan’s religious matriarch in the BBC TV adaptation of Jeanette Winterson’s Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1989. There is no righteous hysteria, no rage, just an utterly serene contentment with the worldview she has grown up with, and the inevitability of the “new system” that will come into being after this current world has come to an end. But Ivanna’s faith is severely tested, and there is a brilliant scene in which Kokotajlo comes in for another key closeup on Ivanna undergoing a silent dark moment of the soul in the midst of a prayer meeting. With the tiniest flinches and winces, Finneran conveys Ivanna’s suppressed turmoil, before she stumbles out to the lavatory to find the elder’s voice has been piped in there too, via the PA system. The word of God is omnipresent. Apostasy is a supremely intelligent and gripping drama."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/06/five-stars-for-michael-billington-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T17:34:25Z","webTitle":"Five stars for Michael Billington’s reviews | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/06/five-stars-for-michael-billington-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/06/five-stars-for-michael-billington-reviews","fields":{"headline":"Five stars for Michael Billington’s reviews","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In his letter (3 October) about Michael Billington’s review of King Lear, Frank Danes asks: “What is the point of reviewing productions we cannot get to see?” For me, a humble provincial living miles from theatreland, there is every point.

Don’t make me laugh","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When it came down to it, FC Barcelona – mes que un club, remember – could not bring themselves to go all in. The threatened loss of six points – three for the defaulted match, three more as a penalty – was enough to persuade them to stage their match against Las Palmas behind locked doors in a deserted Camp Nou, while outside the streets of the city rang with the echoes of violent confrontations between police and voters in an independence referendum ruled illegal by the national government. The club’s decision was an important one. Barça is a powerful international symbol of Catalan identity. A refusal to play Sunday’s match would have added tinder to the fire of the independence movement. But they compete in a league where their final standing against Real Madrid has been measured in the last three seasons by two points, one point and three points. So they took the safer option, leaving Gerard Piqué who has never made a secret of his Catalan pride, to join up with the Spain squad and face uncomfortable questions about divided loyalties. Meanwhile, fans who had voted for independence pointed to the example of Welsh clubs competing in the English league as evidence that independence from Spain would not have to mean ejection from La Liga. Few would want an entirely autonomous Catalonia to incorporate a future of Barça competing in a domestic mini-league made up by FC Girona, Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Lleida Esportiu. Keep politics out of sport? Don’t make me laugh. Politics infiltrates sport at all levels. Think about the decision to start next year’s Giro d’Italia in Israel. For one partner in the deal, that’s obviously a matter of money – €17m, apparently. For the other, it represents valuable image-polishing. This is not quite the same as launching the Tour de France in Yorkshire, which was not, the last time I looked, surrounded by walls aimed at keeping out people from Lancashire or County Durham. Or there’s Qatar, whose appalling treatment of migrant workers on the 2022 World Cup stadiums was exposed – not for the first time - by Human Rights Watch this week. Do we really think the Qataris are investing so heavily in football, at home and abroad, out of a sheer love of the game? The coming days might tell us whether FC Barcelona has a further role to play in the dramatic reawakening of old regional tensions and whether the events of Sunday will join the line of football matches that played a part in shaping history, a phenomenon that could be said to have begun in 1969 with a conflict between El Salvador and Honduras that became known as the Football War. Tensions between the two countries had been heightened by the migration to Honduras of hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans, leaving a country one-fifth the size of its neighbour but with a population 40% greater, prompting the Honduran government to enact reforms intended to keep land out of the hands of immigrant farmers while expelling Salvadoran labourers. The fuse for open conflict was lit when the two countries met in the qualifying tournament for the 1970 World Cup. The first match was held in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, where the visiting players were kept awake by crowds letting off firecrackers and breaking windows in their hotel. The home team won by a single goal, prompting an 18-year-old girl watching at home in El Salvador to take her father’s pistol from his desk and shoot herself dead. Amelia Bolianos was given a state funeral, her coffin accompanied by the president of the republic and the players of the football team. When Honduras arrived in San Salvador for the return leg a week later, the welcome included rotten eggs and dead rats thrown through their hotel windows. They made their way to the Flor Blanca stadium in armoured cars, passing through angry crowds holding portraits of the dead girl. El Salvador won this one 3-0, which meant that the tie progressed to a play-off on neutral ground in Mexico City. El Salvador won 3-2 with an extra-time goal from their right-winger, “Pipo” Rodríguez, a qualified civil engineer, a few hours after their government had dissolved diplomatic relationships with Honduras in protest against further mass expulsions. Two weeks later the Salvadoran army and air force launched an invasion which drew a swift response. The war lasted 100 hours and killed 3,000 people, the majority of them civilians, before both sides obeyed a ceasefire call from the Organisaton of American States. Three months later El Salvador beat Haiti in a play-off to reach the 1970 finals in Mexico, where they lost all three of their group matches. Twenty years later Red Star Belgrade travelled to meet Dinamo Zagreb in a Yugoslavian league fixture in the midst of rising fervour among Serb and Croat nationalists. Rioting between the home fans and 3,000 visiting supporters continued during the match itself and the game was on the verge of being abandoned, with several players having made it to the safety of the dressing rooms, when Zvonimir Boban, the Dinamo playmaker, kicked a police officer. Although criminal charges were brought and a suspension cost Boban his place in Yugoslavia’s team at the 1990 World Cup finals, his gesture made him a folk hero to his fellow Croats during the bloody war that raged from 1991 to 1995, by which time he was starring for Milan and sending part of his salary back home to help the fight against Serbia. Back in Mexico City, the black-gloved fists of Tommie Smith and John Carlos in 1968 and the raised hand of Diego Maradona in 1986 were political statements, the first an explicit protest against racial injustice in the United States and the second an implicit response to England’s victory in the Falklands War. Two years ago the flag of a notional “Greater Albania” was flown from a drone into the Belgrade stadium where Serbia and Albania were playing in a Euro 2016 qualifying match, provoking fights among players and fans that led to the match being abandoned. Like those examples, last weekend’s Barcelona affair and Donald Trump’s continuing assault on the take-a-knee movement in the NFL show that sport cannot seal itself off from the stresses and strains of the real world. From the anti-apartheid boycotts of the 1960s to the demonstrations against holding a grand prix in Bahrain, it offers a useful theatre for protest. And those who complain about the temporary inconvenience are seldom on the side of the angels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/mindhunter-jonathan-groff-david-fincher-serial-killer-gay-hollywood-frozen-hamilton","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T14:55:54Z","webTitle":"Jonathan Groff on Mindhunter: 'I walked into makeup and saw a scalped woman's head'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/mindhunter-jonathan-groff-david-fincher-serial-killer-gay-hollywood-frozen-hamilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/mindhunter-jonathan-groff-david-fincher-serial-killer-gay-hollywood-frozen-hamilton","fields":{"headline":"Jonathan Groff on Mindhunter: 'I walked into makeup and saw a scalped woman's head'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What turns someone into a serial killer? In the 1970s, the FBI was utterly in the dark. But a wave of seemingly unmotivated killings – by Charles Manson, David Berkowitz, Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy – forced them into uncharted territory. A new form of profiling was required, one that didn’t simply believe evil to be genetic, but took into account one’s formative years. Netflix’s ambitious new drama Mindhunter explores the early days of the serial killer. Based on a book co-written by John E Douglas, the FBI agent who was the inspiration for Clarice Starling’s mentor Jack Crawford in The Silence of the Lambs, it’s also created by David Fincher, director of Seven and Zodiac. “It seems like our culture is obsessed with serial killers,” Jonathan Groff tells me in the library of a Manhattan hotel. He plays a fictionalised version of Douglas, a young agent crossing the US to conduct harrowing interviews with serial killers about their motivations. It’s a far cry from Groff’s prior work – he has starred in Glee, the acclaimed HBO drama Looking, the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, and voiced iceman Kristoff in Disney’s Frozen. Mindhunter arrives during a renewed obsession with true crime – the success of Serial, Making a Murderer and The Keepers all providing fertile ground for a show that explores the origins of techniques we now take for granted. “All my friends while I was working on the show were in anticipation,” Groff says. “Friends you wouldn’t expect to be interested in the minutiae of how someone ripped apart a body and fucked their neck.” Groff laughs but there is a strange truth here: a prestigious, high-end drama like this provides a socially acceptable way to explore evil. It’s tough stuff and Groff admits that the gruesome facts were often difficult to swallow. “I had a hard time making it through the book,” he says. “I had to keep putting it down. Ultimately, we’re actors, I’m putting on a costume, so we’re playing pretend. But then I would walk into the makeup truck and there’s a scalped woman’s head and you go, ‘Fuck!’ You think, ‘Oh shit, this really happened, this is so intense.’ Then you just kind of shake that off and have a drink or have a laugh with Fincher.” The phrase “have a laugh with Fincher” isn’t one you hear often. The director, whose films also include The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl, is known for his meticulous nature (while shooting Fight Club, he took more than 1,500 rolls of film – three times the average in Hollywood). Zodiac star Jake Gyllenhaal once called him a “disciplinarian”. “There’s no pretension,” Groff says of Fincher. “Yes, he’s meticulous and, yes, occasionally there’s multiple takes but it’s really because he wants it to be good. It was so fucking amazing. I have withdrawal.” It’s a show Netflix clearly has confidence in, giving the green light to a second season before the first has even aired. It’s also set to provide Groff with yet another fervent fanbase. His role in Andrew Haigh’s critically acclaimed (but short-lived) drama Looking, about the lives of gay men in San Francisco, led to a loyal gay following who welcomed rare representation on screen, even if it received criticism for not being gay enough, being too gay, and not being diverse enough. “The cruelty was confusing,” he says. “And it was a bummer because that happened at the very beginning. The show might have gone on longer if we’d had a more supportive start, but the aggressive negativity was disappointing.” Groff is something of a rarity: an openly gay actor working in Hollywood, headlining a major drama as a straight character. “If I’ve had roadblocks along the way for being gay, I’m not aware of them,” he says. “I haven’t had anyone say no, we can’t because he’s gay. In fact, it’s been quite the opposite. Sex is such a huge part of Mindhunter and never for a second did I feel self-conscious sharing my own stories in the creative process. It was very fluid and free and open. Being a gay person didn’t affect anything about it, but being able to share my relationship history and my sexual history as Jonathan – that affects everything when you create a character.” The 32-year-old’s most widely seen character remains Kristoff in the $1.2bn smash Frozen, a film he refers to as “like crack for children”. He’s just started work on the sequel. “Kristin, Josh, Idina and I are on a text chain where we make voice memos as the characters to auction off for kids or kids with cancer,” he says. “It’s so fun to be a part of that and get them more excited. Often there are a lot of hilarious awkward moments when parents are like, ‘This is Kristoff from Frozen?’ They’re like, ‘What?’ They don’t understand that I’m the voice of the thing. I’m not blond and a cartoon.” His most notable fan is none other than Beyoncé, who approached him after she saw Hamilton to compliment his performance and his walk, which she proceeded to impersonate. “This is going to sound so weird and stalkery, but I just feel blessed to have been in her presence and shaken her hand. Nothing that I could have said to her could have articulated the depth of my feelings for her.” Groff wasn’t part of the Hamilton cast when vice-president Mike Pence attended to the sound of boos and a speech (“classy and heartfelt,” Groff says of their words) but there’s an odd political parallel in Mindhunter. The show revolves around the difficulty inherent in finding empathy with those you find distasteful, and how the intellectualism of the FBI was seen as an affront to smalltown police at the time. “Trump got elected while we were in the final months of shooting so it wasn’t like we were making this show with that in mind,” says Groff. “But I can’t help but think, when I watch it back, the idea of how divided everybody is. The idea of faking empathy to take a step forward to understanding – it’s a really powerful idea.” Mindhunter is on Netflix from 13 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/06/wayne-lotter-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T16:54:54Z","webTitle":"Wayne Lotter obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/wayne-lotter-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/06/wayne-lotter-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Wayne Lotter obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When he was offered a leading role in the documentary The Ivory Game (2016) by its producer, Leonardo DiCaprio, the conservationist Wayne Lotter modestly gave the credit instead to his wildlife rangers, who led the way in tracking down one of Africa’s most notorious poachers, thought to be responsible for 10,000 elephants’ deaths. Lotter preferred to be in the background, while the spotlight fell on the cause for which he fought: saving the dwindling populations of Africa’s wild elephants, through practical, dogged, on-the-ground tracking of poachers and protection of their prey. Lotter has been shot dead in Dar es Salaam, aged 51. Although the identity of his killers is not known, the murder may have been connected to one of the criminal groups involved in wildlife killing and ivory trafficking in Tanzania. These groups have turned what used to be small-scale ivory poaching into a highly organised international criminal enterprise that exists mainly to service Chinese demand for ivory and other rare animal products. “The more you go after them, the more situations where there is confrontation between poachers and rangers will take place,” Lotter said last year. “There are going to be risks.” Lotter knew early on that he wanted to work in wildlife. He was born in Johannesburg, son of Vera and Charles Lotter, and took a master’s degree in nature conservation at Tshwane University in 1990 before beginning his career as a ranger in South Africa. He rose to become invasive alien species programme coordinator for the government wildlife organisation Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife. As he gained experience in the field, it became clear to him that the dangers to the wildlife on his ranges were changing rapidly. Africa’s elephants are in crisis, owing to the threats of habitat loss, human encroachment and farming, climate change and above all the militarisation of poaching. At least 20,000 elephants were killed for their ivory in 2015, and last year the UN announced that elephants were being killed faster than they were being born. In 2006, responding to the new dangers, Lotter helped to co-found the Pams (Practical Area Management System) Foundation in Tanzania, having previously served as vice-president of the International Ranger Federation. Pams has 200 game scouts and other law enforcement personnel on the ground in Tanzania. He also helped establish the National and Transnational Serious Crimes Investigations Unit in Tanzania, which has been instrumental in bringing high-profile poachers and criminal syndicates to book. A charismatic man, described as having “an eccentric sense of humour”, Lotter espoused a particular sort of muscular conservationism. He recognised that high-minded promises made by governments and civic leaders on the need to preserve wildlife were meaningless unless matched by boots on the ground. Only the local community could provide the level of support and of practical protection needed, he believed, and when given the tools and educated in the necessary skills, they could provide an effective approach. This robust policing was also, he knew, a highly dangerous tactic. Like many of the “defenders”, he realised that the forces he was up against were murderous. He received numerous death threats over the years. Among those arrested as the result of his investigations were Boniface Malyango, nicknamed Shetani Hana Huruma, meaning “the devil has no mercy”, who is thought to have killed or ordered the killing of 10,000 elephants; and Yang Fenglan, accused of ivory smuggling. He is survived by his wife, Inge, two daughters, Cara Jayne and Tamsin, and his parents. • Wayne Lotter, conservationist, born 5 December 1965; died 16 August 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/06/grace-mugabe-denies-plotting-to-poison-rival-for-zimbabwe-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T22:14:51Z","webTitle":"Grace Mugabe denies plotting to poison rival for Zimbabwe presidency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/grace-mugabe-denies-plotting-to-poison-rival-for-zimbabwe-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/06/grace-mugabe-denies-plotting-to-poison-rival-for-zimbabwe-presidency","fields":{"headline":"Grace Mugabe denies plotting to poison rival for Zimbabwe presidency","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The wife of Robert Mugabe, the 93-year-old president of Zimbabwe, has publicly denied that she was behind the attempted poisoning of her biggest rival to succeed her husband. In remarks broadcast on state TV on Friday, Grace Mugabe, 53, said the charge was “nonsensical”. Her remarks – described as “extraordinary” by observers – followed the claim a day earlier by one of Zimbabwe’s vice-presidents, Emmerson Mnangagwa, that he had been poisoned when he fell ill at a rally in August and had to be airlifted to hospital in South Africa. Though the incident was widely reported in Zimbabwe’s media at the time, officials in Zanu-PF, the ruling party, have largely refrained from commenting on it or the suspicions it generated. But the increasingly obvious weakness of Mugabe, who delivered a halting and often rambling speech on a visit to South Africa this week, appears to have intensified the bitter contest to win power. Mnangagwa, 75, was appointed vice-president in 2014 and has long been considered the most obvious candidate to take over from Mugabe, who has led the former British colony for 36 years. In recent weeks, Mnangagwa, nicknamed the Crocodile, and the first lady have faced significant setbacks in their pursuit of power. Mugabe has made a series of disparaging remarks in public about the former intelligence chief at meetings, while his wife has suffered from the fallout of her alleged assault on a model she found partying with her spendthrift sons in a luxury apartment in Johannesburg, South Africa. Granted diplomatic immunity after the incident, Grace Mugabe was allowed to leave South Africa despite a police inquiry and denies all wrongdoing. Reports of extravagant purchases including property in South Africa and a Rolls-Royce have made Grace a deeply unpopular figure in Zimbabwe, where an economic crisis has deepened. Fears of a return of hyperinflation seen in 2008 have led to panic buying and rocketing prices, while confidence in the parallel “bond note” currency, launched by the government nearly a year ago, has collapsed. “Mugabe survives on pitting one faction against the other,” said Gabriel Shumba, a Zimbabwean political analyst and human rights lawyer based in South Africa. “He elevates one faction, discards it when it begins to feel comfortable and props up another one.” This week, a journalist who reported that underwear was among used clothes distributed by the first lady to supporters in Zimbabwe was arrested and charged for criminal nuisance. Lawyers for Kenneth Nyangani, a reporter from NewsDay newspaper, said authorities hoped to deter other journalists. At a press conference on Thursday, Mnangagwa said doctors had concluded that poisoning was to blame for his illness and not inadvertent food poisoning. An audio recording of Grace Mugabe’s speech to a public gathering on Thursday night reveals that she said Mnangagwa and his allies were plotting a power grab that amounted to a coup. “We are being threatened day and night that if this one does not become president, we will kill you,” she said without stating the origin of the threats. The first lady denied having any motives to eliminate her rival. “Why should I kill Mnangagwa? Who is Mnangagwa on this earth? Killing someone who was given a job by my husband? That is nonsensical,” she said in footage aired on Friday on state television. One commentator in Harare, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said the situation was extreme. “Whatever the truth of the allegations, when you have the first lady denying that she poisoned the vice-president then things have gone pretty far,” he said. The ruling party’s next leadership congress is due in 2019 and Mugabe, who plans to contest next year’s elections, has said he is staying put for now. The fractured opposition, meanwhile, has been unable to channel national discontent into a strong play for power. The main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has health problems and recently received treatment in South Africa. Zimbabwe’s constitution says that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice-president who last stood in as acting president takes over for 90 days, after which the ruling party must appoint a person who takes over until the expiry of the former president’s term. Mnangagwa, who has received the support of veterans of Zimbabwe’s 1970s guerilla war, was acting president during Mugabe’s trip to the United Nations last month. He is also seen as broadly acceptable to the international community despite charges of involvement in atrocities in the early 1980s. In 2014, Mugabe claimed that assassins had tried to kill Mnangagwa, then recently appointed as the president’s deputy, by sprinkling poisonous powder on his desk. His secretary inhaled the poison and was taken into intensive care."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/08/grenfell-tower-survivor-reunited-with-cat-she-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T14:41:08Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower survivor reunited with cat she lost on night of blaze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/08/grenfell-tower-survivor-reunited-with-cat-she-lost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/08/grenfell-tower-survivor-reunited-with-cat-she-lost","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower survivor reunited with cat she lost on night of blaze","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A survivor of the Grenfell Tower fire who believed her cat had died in the blaze has been reunited with the animal in a rare heartening story to emerge after the catastrophe. Kerry O’Hara, 53, escaped from the sixth floor of the tower at about 1.30am on 14 June. She, like other survivors, has been deeply traumatised by the fire and its aftermath. She said the depression and stress from which she has suffered for more than 20 years was made worse by the loss of her beloved cat, Rosey. On the night of the fire, O’Hara was in “hysterical mode, panicking, crying” after discovering Grenfell Tower was ablaze. “I made a plan to put Rosey in her cat carrier and cover it with a wet towel, but that went out of the window – I was too panicked and scared,” she said. “In the end, I just grabbed my keys and a jacket.” As O’Hara opened her front door to find thick black smoke, she turned for a last glance at her home of 18 years, and her cat. “Rosey was on the sofa, looking at me,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d ever see her again. “I couldn’t see anything, it was pitch black. I was feeling along the walls to get to the stairwell. I was coughing, and screaming ‘help me, help me, I’m here’. I managed to get down to the second floor on my own, then a firefighter grabbed my hand and led me out. I looked over my shoulder [at the burning building] and it felt like I was in a dream.” In the days and weeks after the fire, O’Hara repeatedly returned to the police cordon around Grenfell to ask if anyone had seen a black and white cat. She put up homemade “missing” posters in the area, but tried to accept the loss of her pet. Two months later, a resident of Oxford Gardens, a road less than half a mile from the tower, found an emaciated and frightened cat and took it to a vet who scanned the animal for a microchip. The cat’s registered address – Flat 34, Grenfell Tower – popped up on the computer. “I got a phone call from someone saying we think we’ve found your cat,” said O’Hara. “I was asking, is she OK, is she burnt? But she just had a scratch on her nose. She recognised me straight away. Now I don’t let her out of my sight.” Some of O’Hara’s personal possessions have been recovered from her partially burned flat: her passport, a few photographs, birth certificates, books. But she has lost the “homely flat, decorated just the way I wanted it”, surrounded by caring neighbours – a home she thought she would live in for the rest of her life. She is desperate to leave the temporary accommodation provided for her by Kensington and Chelsea council. Passengers on the top decks of buses stopping outside the small flat can see straight in through a window, which she is unable to open because of traffic noise. She said she had been forbidden from putting pictures on the walls. O’Hara said she had no idea how long it would take to find a permanent home. She is confused by the council’s priority system for rehousing, and said survivors were effectively forced to compete against one another for properties. Several permanent homes have been floated to her but, apart from one, all were unsuitable, she said. They included a flat on the upper floors of Kensington Row, the upmarket development in which 68 homes have been purchased for Grenfell survivors, and properties in Hammersmith and Victoria, which she said were too far from friends and her mental health support network. She was keen to accept one property, a basement flat in north Kensington, but two days after viewing it she was told it had been withdrawn. “I fell in love with it. It’s not nice the way they build your hopes up and then let you down,” she said. “I don’t think the council has handled this well at all. I didn’t ask to be put in this situation,” she said. “All I want is to settle down, but I just don’t know if it’s going to be days or weeks, or even after Christmas. It’s very stressful, and my depression has got worse. “Before I go to sleep at night, I see images of what happened. I’ve been back to look at the building that was my home. I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.” Kensington and Chelsea council said: “We have been working with all the families affected by the tragedy and they will only move in to properties they are happy with.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/10/school-funding-headteacher-challenge-jules-white","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T06:30:41Z","webTitle":"‘You want to shout: Stop saying that!

He does the wiggly-hips sport to keep his daughter company, he says, but it’s also a good distraction because the concentration needed to keep one foot on the ground at all times keeps his mind off a more pressing problem – school funding. White is the secondary headteacher who stuck his head above the parapet and started what could prove to be the most effective grassroots campaign in the history of British education. For the last two years he has led the Worth Less? campaign, joined by 4,000 other heads all speaking out about the funding system that leaves their schools millions of pounds out of pocket compared with others in different parts of the country. They recently wrote to 2.5m homes to tell parents about school cash shortages. Last week Justine Greening, the education secretary, appeared to have listened, saying at the Conservative party conference that her government had finally tackled “the iniquitous decades of postcode lottery in school funding in England” through a new “national fair funding formula, backed by £1.3bn of funding”. You’d think White, headteacher of Tanbridge House school, a 1,500 pupil comprehensive in Horsham, West Sussex, would be pleased. Instead, he’s even more anxious, believing the government is telling parents one thing when its own figures reveal a very different story. “What they are saying is neither accurate nor satisfactory. Under this new formula very little has changed. Children in some parts of the country – West Sussex, Norfolk, Barnsley, Cornwall and Devon for example – are still judged to be worth less than those in London, Manchester or Reading. Heads are not prepared to stand idly by when the facts are entirely the opposite. When you see the secretary of state stand up and deliver a speech saying this is the end of the disparities you want to shout, stop! Just stop saying that! Look at your own figures and then we can have a reasonable debate about it.” White challenges Greening’s claim that schools will get an extra £1.3bn, saying the government has not put in funds to bring up the lowest schools anywhere near the highest. “We are not wanting to take money away from the most highly funded schools, we want to bring the rest up. The differences between what a child is worth in West Sussex compared to many other parts of the country are still extraordinary,” he says. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has worked out that £3bn will have been taken out of school budgets over the course of this parliament, he says, so even with the promised £1.3bn, schools are down £1.7bn at a time of rising costs, increased pupil numbers and a desperate shortage of teachers. Extra burdens recently have been increased pension and national insurance contributions, and the unfunded – though much deserved – 1% pay rise for staff, he adds. So for White, the fight goes on. It’s apolitical, he says, because the unfairness has persisted for decades and Labour did nothing to tackle it. His campaign is based on the Department for Education (DfE)’s own figures. Look here, he says, jabbing a spreadsheet on the new funding formula: “Schools in York will get £4,704 a year for each secondary pupil, West Sussex £4,756, Reading £5,106, Greenwich £6,451 and Hackney £7,840. Is that fair? These are DfE figures. The difference between a secondary school in York and Reading, on average, will be half a million a year. Between York and Greenwich it’s £2.5m and between York and Hackney it’s a staggering £4.4m. There are schools in Barnsley, hardly a rich area, that are getting £4.5m less than schools in Hackney. The figures are eye-watering.” It’s not about deprivation, because schools in challenging areas receive additional help, in pupil premium, for example, which alone is worth between £925 and £1,900 a year for each disadvantaged pupil. At White’s 11-16 school, class sizes have had to go up from 25 to 30 over the last few years. “Why should some children get less support, work in much larger class sizes or have a more restricted curriculum?” he asks. Tanbridge House is, in fact, one of the most successful schools in England, rated outstanding on every count by Ofsted. White wants to keep it that way but it’s like trying to plug holes in a dam. His school budget this year is £6.3m and under the new formula this will increase by 6% in 2018-19. If the school were in Greenwich he would be getting an extra £2,383,420, or in Newham an extra £4,355,800. White says he does not enjoy the publicity but was spurred by desperation. “Although I appear relaxed at school I am incredibly anxious because I have a responsibility to 1,500 pupils, their parents and the staff. When you feel you can’t do what you are paid to do and you will be letting everyone down because you do not have the tools to do it, that generates huge anxiety,” he says. “I have been prepared to go out and say it like it is and it has not damaged our reputation. I go on television and say I can’t get a new science teacher, we can’t afford to employ a school nurse or counsellor. We are honest about it. We’ve opened up our accounts to MPs and to the Department for Education and every farthing is accounted for.” The worst part, he says, has been regularly asking his overstretched colleagues to take on even more work. The school has no supply budget to cover absences so he regularly teaches GCSE business studies and English literature himself, and the deputy head, a scientist, has been teaching art for eight to 10 hours a week on top of her own subject and her senior leadership role. “Our children sit the same exams and we are judged by the same league tables,” says White. “They don’t have a footnote saying ‘By the way, White’s school got £4m less than a school somewhere else’.” Parents say they back the headteacher “all the way”. Natalie McMillan says that her son was in a theatre production in July but the school could not afford props and scenery. David Gabriel says his son is doing his GCSEs and art is one of his subjects. “Last year there was only one art teacher for 1,500 pupils. I fear his education will be blighted because of this crazy funding system,” he says. The parents can see that there is money in the system for free schools and to pay the debts of failed academy trusts or build annexed grammar schools, but not for their children, says White. “It’s getting to the stage where families are not just moving house to be near a good school but actually moving away to better funded authorities. My school is suffering but the new formula penalises areas such as Crawley, Bognor and Barnsley even more.” White has had no media training and is up against a department with a 40-plus communications team. But, with the support of his family, pupils and parents, he plans to continue to wake up at 5am to fire off emails for the “relentlessly reasonable” campaign he hopes will be unstoppable – and irresistible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/06/late-night-hosts-trump-tim-murphy-tillerson","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T15:24:33Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Trump: 'He isn't content to botch just one crisis'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/06/late-night-hosts-trump-tim-murphy-tillerson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/06/late-night-hosts-trump-tim-murphy-tillerson","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Trump: 'He isn't content to botch just one crisis'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Thursday addressed potential legislation to ban “bump stocks” in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, plus congressman Tim Murphy’s scandal and subsequent resignation, and the infighting within the Trump administration. “On Capitol Hill, it looks like Congress might finally do something about gun control,” Stephen Colbert began. “Yesterday, congressional Republicans actually signaled that they would be open to banning gun conversion kits called bump stocks, which take advantage of a semi-automatic gun’s natural recoil, allowing it to bounce back and forth off a shooter’s trigger finger and unleash up to 100 rounds in seven seconds.” “It’s great for hunting, if you have seven seconds to kill every animal in the forest,” Colbert quipped. “Right now, these devices are totally legal because according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, a bump stock is a firearm part and therefore is not regulated as a firearm,” Colbert explained. “It’s not a gun, it’s just part of a gun. Like when your parents find your bong and you tell them, ‘Hey there’s no weed in there now, so technically that is a vape. If you’ll excuse me, I have some Pink Floyd to listen to.’” Trevor Noah weighed in on the scandal implicating congressman Tim Murphy, a staunch opponent of abortion. “This has been a particularly rough week so I thought we’d end it off with something lighter, so let’s talk about abortion,” Noah began. “Trust me, whether you’re pro-life or pro-choice, everyone is going to be pro-this story because it’s hilarious.” “I would like you to meet Tim Murphy,” the host continued. “He’s a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Tim Murphy has spent his whole career fighting abortion. He’s part of the pro-life caucus and just this week he co-sponsored a bill to ban all abortions after 20 weeks. Which is why this story is so insane.” Noah then showed news coverage of the scandal that’s engulfed Murphy; text messages were revealed in which Murphy encourages his lover to get an abortion. “The same week he puts up an abortion ban, this dude’s timing could not be worse,” Noah said. “Just so you know, Murphy’s mistress wasn’t actually pregnant, it was just a scare, which makes this even funnier. He didn’t even wait a day to confirm it before he abandoned his whole belief system.” Noah then showed clips of Murphy’s speeches opposing abortion, during one of which he said “there is no more humbling or proud thing to do than save a child’s life.” “If you’re wondering how on earth could someone say those things about abortion in public and then in private urge his side-chick to have an abortion,” Noah said, “well, his excuse is going to take you for a ride.” In a text message to his lover, who asked Murphy about his contradictory public and private stances, Murphy replied: “I get what you say about my March for Life messages. I’ve never written them. Staff does them.” The congressman resigned on Thursday. “It’s such a pity that Tim Murphy terminated his career before it came to term,” Noah concluded. Finally, Seth Meyers of NBC, having discussed Donald Trump’s awkward visit to Puerto Rico, turned to the tensions between him and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. “The president isn’t content to botch just one crisis, which is why he’s in the process of botching another, North Korea’s nuclear program,” Meyers said. “The international community has been desperately pursuing every diplomatic angle to avoid what would certainly be a catastrophic war. And Trump’s own government has been working with the UN security council, China, and even through back channels of North Korea itself to resolve the conflict peacefully.” “So once again,” Meyers continued, “Trump threw all that out the window when he tweeted, out of nowhere over the weekend: ‘I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man …’” “So all the careful diplomacy and bargaining and angling just got out the window with one tweet,” Meyers said. “It’s like everyone is playing an intense game of Jenga and Trump is the rambunctious golden retriever barging through the doggy door. So Trump has once again undercut the diplomatic efforts of his secretary of state, which has happened so many times that Tillerson apparently threatened to resign over the summer.” Meyers then referenced the NBC report that Tillerson, dismayed by Trump’s speech over the summer at the Boy Scout’s jamboree, almost didn’t return to Washington. “But the fact that Tillerson threatened to resign is not the most damning part of the story,” Meyers said, referring to the report that Tillerson openly called Trump a moron. “Obviously, this story is based on anonymous sources and the state department denied it, which is why MSNBC did their own reporting on exactly what Tillerson said and issued an important clarification later that day.” Meyers then showed reports that Tillerson actually called his boss a “fucking moron”. “Tillerson, of course, was forced to issue a statement at a hastily arranged press conference yesterday where he took the extraordinary step of trying to assure the American people that the president is not, in fact a moron,” the host explained. “In fact, cabinet officials are apparently now so concerned about the president’s volatility that several of them have forged an agreement to quit if Trump tries to fire one of them.” “Secretary of state Rex Tillerson, defense secretary Jim Mattis, and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin reportedly forged a suicide pact in which all three members would leave if one of them became a target of the president,” Meyers said of reporting published on Thursday. “So three cabinet officials have to band together to deal with their out-of-control boss. They’re treating him like he’s Dabney Coleman in 9 to 5.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/06/england-new-alternate-kit-may-only-be-worn-once","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T18:57:33Z","webTitle":"England unveil new £95 kit that may be worn in only one Test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/06/england-new-alternate-kit-may-only-be-worn-once","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/06/england-new-alternate-kit-may-only-be-worn-once","fields":{"headline":"England unveil new £95 kit that may be worn in only one Test","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"England have unveiled a dark grey alternate kit – the 10th replica shirt released by the Rugby Football Union in a little over three years – which is likely to be worn in just one Test by Eddie Jones’s side. The new kit, which follows the release of a new home jersey in August, replaces the blue strip worn by England in both summer Tests against Argentina as well as last autumn against Fiji and the Pumas. The shirt costs £95 and is “accentuated with a fiery red fade – designed to mask player movement”. It is also billed as the lightest kit ever to be made by Canterbury. England will wear it when they begin their autumn campaign against Argentina on 11 November, while the women’s team will also wear the kit against Canada in the second of their three-match autumn series. It is understood that both sides will wear white in their other two autumn games, with the men’s team hosting Australia (18 November) and Samoa (25 November) at Twickenham. Considering England traditionally wear white for all their Six Nations matches, if Jones’s side are to wear the grey kit in another Test this season they would have to do so in South Africa in June. England wore white in all three Tests in Australia last year and in each of their three matches against the Springboks the last time they were in South Africa in 2012. An RFU spokesperson told the Guardian: “At this point in time, these are the only matches that have been confirmed that the teams will wear the alternate kit.” The RFU was criticised for launching a new kit at the start of last season, having released two special strips for sale ahead of the 2015 World Cup. That came just months after the RFU had unveiled two new jerseys for the 2014-15 season, featuring controversial Victoria Cross motifs. Upon unveiling the dark grey kit, an RFU release read: “In line with head coach Eddie Jones’s vision to be more disruptive and uncompromising on the field, the dark grey colour was chosen as a point of difference to the usual colour palette used by England. Inspired by distraction principles, the red fade feature is designed to make it harder to distinguish aspects of the body during the tackle.” Meanwhile, Jones has recruited Marc dal Maso as scrum consultant on a 12-month contract. Dal Maso was part of Jones’ coaching team with Japan at the 2015 World Cup, operating alongside Steve Borthwick, and is currently working as Toulon’s forwards coach. The 50-year-old former France hooker, who has Parkinson’s disease, will spend a total of three days with England during the 12 months but will also provide video analysis from overseas during the year. Jones has brought in several coaches on a short-term basis in the past, among them Jonny Wilkinson, George Smith and Glen Ella. The England captain Dylan Hartley will make his return from a hand injury for the league leaders, Northampton, against Gloucester on Saturday. He is joined in the Saints XV by Piers Francis, who makes his debut for the club at inside-centre having recovered from a jaw injury, while Gloucester will hand a first start to their summer signing Owen Williams. Freddie Burns, who like Williams left Leicester during the close season, makes his first start for Bath as the Premiership’s bottom club, Worcester, arrive at the Rec still seeking a first league win. Charlie Ewels captains Bath from the second row. Exeter welcome high-flying Newcastle to Sandy Park with Sam Simmonds and Jack Nowell restored to the starting lineup after missing the defeat to Leicester. Toby Flood is in line to make his first appearance since returning to Newcastle. Elsewhere on Saturday, Dan Tuohy will make his first appearance for Leicester following his move from Ulster as George Ford captains the Tigers for the first time at London Irish. On Sunday, Wasps travel to Saracens without Jimmy Gopperth, who picked up an injury in the defeat to Bath and joins Danny Cipriani on the sidelines. Dai Young can call on Willie le Roux, who comes in at full-back with Rob Miller moving to fly-half. For Saracens, Maro Itoje starts at blindside flanker again while Brad Barritt makes his 200th appearance for the club. Owen Farrell will remain on the bench with Alex Lozowski continuing at fly-half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/28/organic-or-starve-can-cubas-new-farming-model-provide-food-security","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Organic or starve: can Cuba's new farming model provide food security?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/28/organic-or-starve-can-cubas-new-farming-model-provide-food-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/28/organic-or-starve-can-cubas-new-farming-model-provide-food-security","fields":{"headline":"Organic or starve: can Cuba's new farming model provide food security?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the town of Hershey, 40 miles east of Havana, you can see the past and the future of Cuban farming, side by side. The abandoned hulk of the Camilo Cienfuegos sugar plant, shut along with 70 other cane refineries in 2002, towers over the town. But in the lush hills and grasslands around Hershey, fields of cassava, corn, beans, and vegetables are a sign that there is life after sugar. Once owned by the famous Pennsylvania chocolate maker, the Cienfuegos plant supplied the sugar that sweetened Hershey’s candy bars. After the 1959 revolution, it was nationalised by Fidel Castro’s government and became property of the state, its sugar shipped to the Soviet Union and allies. As the world’s largest sugar exporter, Cuba relied on pesticides and fertilisers and heavy mechanisation to produce up to 8.4m tonnes of sugar – its peak harvest, in 1990 – nearly all of it exported to the Communist bloc. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 eliminated Cuba’s preferential market and, coupled with a tightening of the US trade embargo, sent the Cuban economy into an extended coma. The sugar industry muddled along for another decade until the government ordered the closure of 71 of the island’s 156 sugar refineries. Places that had depended on sugar for a century became ghost towns. The trains that once carried Hershey’s sugar to port sit idly on the tracks, apparently abandoned. Old timers rest under a tree reminiscing and drinking rum from a bottle. Yoanki Valdés lives across the street from the carcass of the plant where, for 30 years, he went to work every morning at the sound of the 7am whistle. He was dedicated to the job, received training in industrial engineering in Czechoslovakia and had risen to the position of foreman by the time he heard the news: the plant was closing. A week later it was shut. “The most normal thing for everyone was to work in the sugar plant. Sugar gave work and a way of life,” said his son, also named Yoanki. Yet the two men don’t sound bitter. They understand the reasons for the closure: sagging prices, inefficiencies, dependence on a single, distant market, and the continued refusal of the United States to restore Cuba’s sugar quota long after the ostensible reason for revoking it – the alliance with the Soviet Union – was gone. In the wake of the Soviet collapse, Cuba lost 80% of its international trade in under three years. The result was severe food shortages. Castro dubbed it “the special period in peacetime,” a euphemism for what many Cubans describe as one of the worst traumas of their lives. It dragged on for five years, but its psychological effects lasted much longer. One woman I met remembered people fainting in the street from hunger. An artist remembered regular rations for children, but, for adults like himself, an endless diet of sugar water. Another stressed years of blackouts and boredom, relieved only by lots of marijuana. An agronomist described to me the death of hundreds of thousands of farm animals due to the loss of imported feed. “We came very close to starvation,” he said. Out of the special period came a resolve that it must never happen again, and so Cuba’s food-focused farming movement was born. “The way people thought about food and agriculture changed drastically with the special period,” said Miguel Angel Salcines, who runs a 25-acre organic farm in the outlying Havana district of Alamar, which started in those years. “Boats had arrived from the Soviet Union full of chemicals and fertilisers and suddenly there were no more boats from the Soviet Union, and people asked, do we need all those chemicals?” The farm fields around Hershey don’t employ many people, but they sell their produce to local cooperatives so residents can buy them to supplement their meagre monthly rations of state-produced or imported food. In the revolutionary heyday, all this farmland was used to cultivate sugar. Cuba has never been able to feed itself. It currently imports 60-80% of the food it consumes, at a cost of about $2bn a year. Two-thirds of its corn is imported and a similar amount of its rice, the latter mainly from Vietnam and Brazil. At markets around the country, sacks of rice can be seen piled to the rafters. Cubans love bread, but wheat doesn’t grow well in the tropical climate, so that has to be imported as well — mostly from the United States, which, in an exception to the Cold War-era trade embargo, sells food to Cuba for cash. In response to this dependency, officials are promoting small, local farms as one way – perhaps the only way – for the country to finally start feeding itself. Although it has happened gradually, the shift to smaller, often organic farming marks a radical change from the monocrop sugarcane economy that ruled Cuba for a century. Small-scale farming is receiving the blessing of once-sceptical agricultural officials who set food priorities in this tightly controlled society. Urban farming, with its backlot gardens and rooftop chicken coops, took hold in Havana and other Cuban cities in the early 1990s. That movement, also promoted by the government, brought greenery and fresh vegetables to Cuba’s dilapidated inner cities. However, while tourists love to visit them, urban farms have had little impact on Cuba’s overall farm output. The new organic movement is different. Its goal is high yields in rural settings, with an eye toward a reliable, systematic output of staple crops at farms that are close to consumers and usually smaller than 40 hectares (100 acres) or so. Rather than a reaction to a crisis, the current push into organics is planned and promoted on the ruins of the industrial sugar economy. “Organic farming does not bring the kind of large yields that will solve all our problems. But it solves many of our problems, and it is starting to become important,” said Juan José León, an official at the Ministry of Agriculture. “Ecological farming arose as a response to a reality that smacked us,” he continued. That reality was the collapse of the Soviet Union. “They were difficult years. We had to produce food somehow, somewhere.” Tall, lean and bald as the farmer with the pitchfork in American Gothic, Agustín Pimentel takes a knife and cuts open one of his organic pineapples. It’s the size of a grapefruit, and its meat is a heavenly mix of sweetness and tart. “It’s sad that the immense majority of farmers in Cuba still use pesticides and chemical fertilisers. They’re poison, and they enter our food,” says Pimentel, who raises 45 different crops on four hectares in an isolated valley in western Cuba. He’s proud of the fact he never uses chemicals of any kind. Yet he’s not sure his farm could ever gain certification as organic. The land, in Pinar del Río province, was once planted with tobacco, which has a reputation for high reliance on pesticides. Chemical residues from other crops wash in from neighbouring farms with the rain. Pimentel is part of a small, intensely committed movement of organic farmers on this tropical island of red soil and royal palms. Numbering from 40,000 to a quarter of a million, depending on whom you ask. What exactly is meant by “organic” is not clear. Standards are not always known or consistently followed. But this movement of farmers sees locally grown, non-industrial farming as a vital part of the solution to Cuba’s chronic food shortages. Many of them see organic farming as nothing less than the future of Cuba’s socialist revolution; others see the potential for exports to European and eventually US markets. Miguel Angel Salcines hopes that former US president Barack Obama’s restoration of diplomatic relations presages the day when Cuba can export high-quality organic crops to American supermarkets, though the tough talk from Obama’s successor Donald Trump may make that a distant prospect. American consumers would welcome the quality and variety of Cuban organics, he says, and Cuba needs the cash. “I would love to export my mint leaves to Miami so they could put them in their mojitos. I’m sure they grow mint there, too, but it’s not the same,” said Salcines, half-jokingly. For now, vegetables for domestic consumption are the mainstays of Cuban organics. Those crops are almost the only area of farm production that has grown in Cuba, by about 15% in the last decade to 5.3m tonnes, according to official figures released in June. The central government issued farm titles to 223,917 people in the three years up to April, covering nearly 2m hectares, said León. They’re not ownership titles – 79% of Cuba’s land is owned by the state – but they give the holder the right to till the land in perpetuity. They’re not all necessarily organic. But nearly all are small, family farms, and each one marks a sharp break from the way Cuba conducted its agriculture in the sugar heyday. Much of the impetus for small-scale farming has come from the Programme for Local Agricultural Innovation (Pial). The initiative started around 2002 as a way of getting organic farming beyond urban plots in favour of larger-scale, locally-geared agriculture to relieve food shortages and bringing fresh produce and meats to Cuban tables. It’s a very Cuban mix of organisation, idealism and state direction, with help from sympathetic foreigners. Pial is regulated by Cuba’s agriculture ministry but funded largely by European and Canadian foundations. Its founder, Humberto Ríos Labrada, won the Goldman environmental prize in 2010. Pial has helped small, organic farmers share knowledge, get good-quality seeds and connect with buyers, said Sandra Miranda, a biochemist and one of the programme’s designers. But Pial’s main achievement, she said, was to show farmers that organic production was no locavore foodie fad. It was, rather, Cuba’s food future. Today about 250 farm cooperatives across Cuba are enrolled in the programme, Miranda said, or about 50,000 farmers. Each cooperative can include anywhere from half a dozen to hundreds of small farms. The organic farmers among them face the kinds of barriers that organic farmers face everywhere. They get lower yields and hence less money for their crops and livestock. Pimentel gives his pigs strictly organic fodder, but, he said, “even giving them organic feed all their lives, I’m still going to get the same price per kilo as if I’d stuffed them with chemicals.” His smaller-than-average cassava roots and pineapples regularly fetch a lower price from the cooperatives than his neighbours’ chemically-enhanced varieties. About half the farmers involved in Pial are fully organic, said Miranda. Those that aren’t will fumigate some crops such as garlic and cabbage, but the non-fumigated ones typically form the bulk of their production. More and more are phasing out chemicals – even though, Miranda acknowledged, “their motivation for pursuing organic farming was economic, not environmental, because people could not obtain chemical inputs at any price.” The gains in organic farming, though tentative and tough to quantify, stand in contrast to the dismal performance of Cuban agriculture overall. New government figures show that efforts to increase food production have made little progress, despite repeated calls from president Raúl Castro to boost production, smooth out inefficiencies, and reduce food imports. Cuba produced 2.4bn eggs last year, for example, nearly unchanged since 2011 and still insufficient to change the monthly ration of five eggs per person. Farm yields are pathetically low, despite Cuba having possibly the richest soil of any tropical country in the world, said Pedro Sanchez, an agronomist at the University of Florida who was raised on a farm in Cuba and returns regularly. “They’re raising one tonne per acre of corn. It’s ridiculous,” he said. Cuba’s slow shift toward organic farming owes much of its inspiration and technical knowhow to one family, the Funes clan of Havana. Fernando Funes Aguilar and his wife Marta Monzote, who died in 2007, spoke and wrote passionately about the damage that indiscriminate use of chemical inputs and the sugar monoculture were doing to Cuba’s ecology and food supply. A committed revolutionary who speaks proudly of his service with Cuban forces in Angola, Funes Aguilar nonetheless argued in favour of sustainable farming – industrial-scale compost heaps instead of boatloads of imported fertiliser, rotating crops instead of year-round sugar cane. His warnings won a vindication of sorts with the 1990s collapse. “The mentality here used to be that the solution to the problem of feeding ourselves was to use more chemical inputs. That had to change for the movement toward agro-ecology to take root,” said Funes Aguilar, 76, in his modest apartment in Havana. He believes organic or nearly-organic farming now accounts for about 20% of Cuba’s total output, up from close to zero only a decade ago. He sees organic farming as not just Cuba’s best hope for avoiding mass starvation again, but a route to gaining its deepest – and repeatedly frustrated – dream of lasting independence. His son, Fernando Funes Monzote, is a scholar-farmer with a doctorate in agronomy from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. He runs an eight hectare organic farm about 20km west of Havana called Finca Marta, named after his mother. The land was practically abandoned when Funes Monzote started farming here in 2011. After some lean years, the place is booming with crops including corn, avocados, mangoes and radishes. Every few days, the younger Funes loads up his Lada sedan with sacks of arugula, carrots and other produce and sells it to restaurants all over Havana. You need special licenses to sell privately in Cuba, and Funes has them. “Organic farming is not a mirage, and closing one half of the sugar refineries was the first step toward our food independence,” says the younger Funes, wearing a straw hat and boots as he plants endive seedlings. While his father stresses the sins of Cuba’s agricultural past, seeing sugar dependence as one of the revolution’s wrong turns, the son looks instead at the promise and shortcomings of Cuba’s current, messy organic boom. He rails against farmers who falsely claim to be organic, sprinkling chemicals on crops while passing themselves off as organic to cooperatives and restaurants. “I don’t think Cuba actually needs to produce more food. It needs to make better use of what it already produces and waste less,” he says. “It pisses me off when people talk about Cuba as if we’re some organic utopia,” says farmworker Maikel Márquez. When he’s not spreading manure over fields or pruning fruit trees on Funes’s farm, he’s studying agronomy at the National Agriculture University of Havana. He’s part of the first generation of entirely organic Cuban farmers. “People from abroad see us as this paradise of sustainable farming but we’re not. We’re coming out of a very bad model of agriculture, to something better.” • Produced in collaboration with the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit investigative news organisation based in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/08/origin-by-dan-brown-digested-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T16:00:54Z","webTitle":"Origin by Dan Brown – digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/origin-by-dan-brown-digested-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/08/origin-by-dan-brown-digested-read","fields":{"headline":"Origin by Dan Brown – digested read","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Edmond Kirsch, the world’s richest man and its greatest futurist, took the train up to the monastery in Catalonia, Spain, Europe, wearing Barker ostrich shoes. There he was going to meet Bishop Valdespino, Rabbi Koves and Islamic scholar al-Fadl. What I am about to tell you is going to end religion as we know it, he thought to himself in italics. “What you have told us is going to end religion as we know it,” the three religious leaders gasped. Too bad! In three days’ time, everyone in the world would know it. Three days later Robert Langdon, the world’s leading professor of symbology, arrived at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, Europe, home to some of the world’s most famous works by modern artists such as Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning according to Wikipedia. I am about to hear a talk from one of my cleverest former students that could change the world! He, too, had a habit of thinking in italics. Admiral Avila smiled grimly. He had managed to secure a late invitation to Kirsch’s talk. Lucky that no one had searched him for his 3-D printed gun. Now to avenge the world for the loss of his family who had been blown up in a cathedral in Seville, Spain, Europe. Langdon donned the headset Kirsch had left for him. “Hi, I’m Winston,” said a voice. “I’m your tour guide for the day.” “Wow,” exclaimed Langdon, exclaiming loudly. “You are the most advanced artificial intelligence in the world. I would never have known you weren’t a real person.” “Dan Brown dialogue is a low bar,” replied Winston. “Can you help me with one thing?” enquired Langdon, enquiringly. “Why have we got to page 100 and almost nothing has happened?” Just then the lights dimmed and Ambra Vidal, the director of the Guggenheim and fiancee to Prince Julian, heir to the Spanish, Europe, throne, walked out on to the dimmed stage to introduce Kirsch. A shot rang out. Kirsch fell dead. Time stood still. And then it started again. In the ensuing panic that followed, only Langdon, Ambra and Winston were quick to react. Winston’s supercomputing abilities quickly spotted Avila leaving in a car with a U on the windscreen. “That U is only found in Leonardo da Vinci’s Annunciation painted in 1472 when the artist was just 20, having been born on April 15, 1452,” said Langdon. “It was a sign used by Gabriel to say he was going to Rome. Avila must be going to Rome.” “Actually it’s a U for Uber and he’s going to Barcelona by taxi,” said Winston. “I’ve found another clue,” gasped Langdon, excitedly in a state of excitement. “Edmond left a message EZY-BIL-BAR which is an anagram of ZEY-RAB-LIB which is a pseudonym for Rembrandt. “It’s a fucking plane ticket, you moron,” said Winston. Conspiracy theories were literally setting the world aflame. Koves and al-Fadl had been murdered by Avila, who had been hired by the breakaway orthodox Palmerian Catholic sect, linked to General Franco, leader of Spain, Europe (1939-75), and the King of Spain, Europe, and Bishop Valdespino were implicated. All these stories came from one source: monte@iglesia.org. In Barcelona, Spain, Europe, Langdon and Ambra hunted for Kirsch’s 47-character password that would unlock his computer and complete his address that would change the world. What could it be? In Kirsch’s bedroom they found a large stash of drugs. “This is exactly like the scene from Titian’s Bacchus and Ariadne (1520-23),” Langdon announced. “It can only mean the password is a codex from the painting” “What it actually means,” said Winston, “is that, like Steve Jobs (1955-2011), Edmond had pancreatic cancer and was going to die any minute.” “Did I mention that Prince Julian proposed to me on live TV and that I can’t have children?” cried a sobbing Ambra. What had this got to do with anything, everyone thought. Langdon kicked Avila down the stairs of the Sagrada Familia, in Barcelona, Spain, Europe, designed by Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926). Inside he couldn’t help sulking. Why give the world’s leading symbologist a plot where none of the clues were symbols? The password had just been a few lines of Blake that he had come across by accident. Five hundred people from around the world all listened to Kirsch’s amazing discovery. It turned out that though God hadn’t created life it was still OK to believe in him and that man was going to have a nice future in which technology would play a leading part. A game changer! The world would never be the same! Ambra returned to Madrid, Spain, Europe to make up with Prince Julian after the king had secretly confessed to him that he had been having a secret gay relationship with Bishop Valdespino. “So it was you all along, wasn’t it, Winston? You were Monte,” said Langdon in a knowing way. “Yup,” admitted Winston, making an admission. “Edmond was going to die anyway, so I thought that if I created a conspiracy to kill him then more people would pay attention to what he said.” “That’s amazing,” said an amazed Langdon. “But why did you have to kill the rabbi and the imam?” “To be honest, I’m not really sure. It’s just one of Dan’s many loose ends. Now if you don’t mind, I am about to delete my files and die.” “Take me with you,” Langdon pleaded, pleadingly. And us, shouted everyone.

Over on BBC1, millions are wallowing in the spangles of Strictly. But here on BBC2 you wonder how many are similarly glued as the professor of American Literature at London University and a former ICA director debate the wonders of the Basquiat exhibition. It’s good that Front Row has made it to television. It’s good that the arts have a weekend niche. But (as numerous critics cry) is there any fresh thinking on display? Professor Sarah Churchill and Ekow Eshun were staples of the old Friday Newsnight Review before it was axed for lack of interest. Yet where is their special expertise to judge theatre, cinema, music, art? Where is the expertise of specific professional critics? Thus, suddenly, a much broader theme surfaces, for the role of those selfsame critics has been shrinking – and disappearing – over years. One recent American survey found staff newspaper critics have virtually ceased to exist, once you leave the east coast. Editors in a financial bind have wielded the axe of least resistance. Critics who know their stuff have two main jobs. One, by far the most dominant, is to guide readers to what to buy tickets for, consumer advice with added sensibility. That applies to films, plays, art shows, and so on. Anything readers can go to see for themselves. The other task is to reflect knowledgeably on events that will never be precisely repeated: say a particular symphony orchestra concert. There, telling the audience who sat through it what you made of the performance and, perhaps, opening new windows on the world of Wagner or Brahms. Both roles belong on a printed page or screen as part of a newsroom service. Both add an extra dimension that goes with a fuller life. Both are vanishing. Chris Tookey, for many years the Daily Mail’s film critic, reflects on this phenomenon in a new book Better Criticism: Ten Commandments for a Dying Art (Arena £17.99). “The old professional critical elite had its merits,” Tookey insists. “It was never a closed shop and became increasingly egalitarian. It did adhere to standards of justice and veracity. It was subject to quality control by editors. Though there have always been lazy or inept professional critics, most really do know a lot about the fields they cover.” So what’s going wrong? A belief, in the internet age, that “everyone’s a critic”. A deluge of blogs that, too often, have to find advertising to exist and compromise to keep that ad stream flowing. A breed of editor-newsmen who push the arts to the peripheries of coverage. And an audience flitting back and forth across the net who don’t buy tickets in any numbers as the result of one good review. There are no butchers left on Broadway. James Warren of the Poynter Institute expands that point. Deep “in the mix of industry decline, commercial marketing machines and social media” is the curse of celebrity. “Having sweated blood, some authors might prefer a recommendation via tweet by Taylor Swift... to praise in The New York Review of Books.” And Tookey gets equally glum when he looks at the celebrity roster of critics in Britain – “stars” such as Johnny Vaughan, Jonathan Ross and Steve Wright. Now, of course, Tookey himself is not above criticism. His book (in description-packed Tookeyspeak) is chaotic, slightly pompous and plaintive, as well as entertaining, thought-provoking and a rich compendium of anecdotes. But there are absolutely solid arguments to quarry here. And the one that resounds for me is what editors themselves do in extremis. If a film critic, say, has real value, then it’s in the build-up of recognition and trust between them and the reader. Week by week, you share the critic’s views and check them against your own cinema-going experience. One star for Mother! in the Times, five stars in the Guardian. You need trusted help to decide what to see. It’s a truly valuable service. Yet observe how little editors value that personal relationship. Tookey tells how he’d stood up bravely against demands from on high at the Mail to condemn or laud films as required. Goodbye Chris, without a word of explanation in the paper. Exit, clutching his arts reviewer of the year award. But he is not alone, by any means. In recent years, we’ve said abrupt goodbyes on the film front to Anthony Quinn from the Indie, Nicholas Barber from the Sindie, Cosmo Landesman from the Sunday Times, Derek Malcolm from the Evening Standard, Jenny McCartney from the Sunday Telegraph and Kate Muir from the Times. It’s a rather pointless catalogue of change. Muir, for instance, had settled in sensibly after a stiff transition from feature writing, become someone you could relate to. But then she’s gone. Major newspapers still have the resources to develop critical mass. Their eye on the arts, day by day and week by week, adds richness and information to the mix. They have the possibility of authority that blogs or compilations in the Rotten Tomatoes style lack. They have the gift of trust – and one-to-one communication. Maybe they can’t shift bundles of tickets any longer (though I’m not sure that applies to some food and theatre critics). But their learning, their wit and their judgment can bring something beyond the kerching of cash registers. I think that, in small but important ways, critics help civilise journalism. And, golly, they’re needed now more than ever. In the Front Row and beyond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/12/rose-mcgowan-amazon-studios-harvey-weinstein-ignore-rape","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T06:38:13Z","webTitle":"Rose McGowan alleges rape by Harvey Weinstein – and Amazon ignored claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/12/rose-mcgowan-amazon-studios-harvey-weinstein-ignore-rape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/12/rose-mcgowan-amazon-studios-harvey-weinstein-ignore-rape","fields":{"headline":"Rose McGowan alleges rape by Harvey Weinstein – and Amazon ignored claim","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The actor Rose McGowan has alleged that Harvey Weinstein raped her and that Amazon Studios ignored her complaints and dropped her show after she spoke up. McGowan is one of the most prominent women to accuse the disgraced movie mogul of sexual misconduct, and although she was named in the recent New York Times investigation as an accuser, her tweets Thursday were the first time she publicly alleged that Weinstein raped her. “I told the head of your studio that HW raped me,” she wrote in a tweet to Amazon’s CEO, using Weinstein’s initials. “Over &amp; over I said it. He said it hadn’t been proven. I said I was the proof.” She further claimed Amazon had “won a dirty Oscar” while “funding rapists”. McGowan spoke last year about being raped by an unnamed studio head, but did not name Weinstein. The producer reached a settlement with McGowan when she was 23 years old after “an episode in a hotel room” during a film festival, according to the New York Times piece. McGowan declined to comment for that story and she did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on Thursday. Weinstein has apologized for causing “pain”, but has said he denies many of the sexual harassment allegations in the New York Times. After a New Yorker piece reported on multiple accusations of sexual assault and his rape, his spokesperson said: “Allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied.” In her latest tweets, McGowan said she had sold a script to Amazon, which was in development, when she learned a “Weinstein bailout was in the works”. “I forcefully begged studio head to do the right thing. I was ignored. Deal was done. Amazon won a dirty Oscar,” she wrote. “I called my attorney &amp; said I want to get my script back, but before I could, #2 @amazonstudios called to say my show was dead,” she continued in her tweets directed at Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Bezos has not responded on Twitter and multiple Amazon spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It’s not clear what script McGowan is referring to, but in September 2016 she told an audience at a film festival in Brooklyn: “I just sold my show to Amazon, that I wrote and [will direct].” McGowan did not reveal the subject matter, but she has previously talked about her desire to make a show about her early experience in the Children of God cult, from which her family fled in 1980. Amazon won two Oscars this year for Manchester By The Sea, including Best Screenplay and Best Actor, which went to Casey Affleck. Affleck was sued for sexual misconduct in 2010 by two female colleagues who worked with him on mockumentary I’m Still Here. Cinematographer Magdalena Gorka and producer Amanda White alleged that Affleck verbally and sexually harassed them, propositioning and grabbing White and sliding into Gorka’s bed uninvited. Affleck denied wrongdoing and settled both claims in 2010. The Weinstein Company, which fired Harvey Weinstein over the weekend, is working with Amazon on two upcoming series. In the wake of the scandal, the executive producer credit for Weinstein is being removed from the series and Amazon is considering severing ties with The Weinstein Company altogether. “We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with the Weinstein Co,” Craig Berman, VP communications at Amazon Entertainment, said in a statement on Tuesday. McGowan’s tweets came just as the television producer Isa Hackett accused Amazon’s programming chief, Roy Price, of sexual harassment in the Hollywood Reporter. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian that Price was “on leave of absence effective immediately”. The company spokesperson did not respond to questions about McGowan. Price declined to comment to the Hollywood Reporter. McGowan had earlier tweeted “fuck off” to actor Ben Affleck and accused him of lying about his knowledge of Weinstein’s history of sexual misconduct. She criticized him after he released a statement, saying he was “saddened” Weinstein “used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades”. Twitter subsequently suspended McGowan’s account after she posted a screenshot that had a phone number in it. Twitter reinstated her account after she deleted the message, saying in a statement that it was “proud” to provide a platform to people who “speak truth to power”. Ben Affleck has since been forced to apologize for groping actor Hilarie Burton on air in 2003 after video resurfaced this week.

In the background, faded ochre walls and windows precariously closed against the outside world. On the floor, a huge gold chandelier flung down like a carcass. And at the centre, hurdy-gurdy gaiety, sudden bursts of gunfire, Keystone Cops goofiness, leering satanic intervention. This is Europe in the early to mid-20th century. This is Günter Grass. This is the Kneehigh company at its best. Putting The Tin Drum on stage is an act of audacity by Carl Grose (adapter) and Mike Shepherd (director). The novel’s range is so enormous – parable, magical tale, warning of the rise of the far right, inward reflection. The Shandyesque sprawl, and the fact that chaos and destruction are at the heart of the action, does not excuse confusion in some of the storytelling on stage. But the main, urgent drive is never lost. And Kneehigh, mixing wistful melancholy and stamping heartiness, embody some flavours of Grass’s prose. Details of the novel fly lightly on to the stage: the moth that appears to the narrator, Oskar, to be a winged drummer; the fizzing powder that rouses him sexually. A bright green swimming costume. And the eerie Oskar is cleverly conjured: Grose has said that he was part inspired by David Bowie. Allergic in the womb to the outside world – “Put me back, put me back, in the amniotic sac” – Oskar escapes an unwished-for future as a greengrocer by retaining for ever the body of a three-year-old. He is played by a puppet a couple of feet tall whose wooden face has at different angles a hostile gleam and an innocent gaze. A warning but not exactly a moralist. One of Oskar’s main means of expression – a piercing scream that can shatter glass – is brilliantly caught here. At his eldritch yelp, paper window panes are torn apart. The noise that he makes on his tin drum – his proclamation of resistance, a successor to the drum in Mother Courage – is made by the composer Charles Hazlewood to supply not only a beat but a shimmer of sound that ripples through the action. Hazlewood’s marvellous music is crucial to the evening’s success. There is rarely silence or stillness on stage – this is almost an opera, sung by flexible, alluring, gender-deceiving voices. These songs have sometimes the insinuation of Kurt Weill, sometimes the roar and flounce of rock. And with lyrical fatalism the play begins and ends with a waltz. As if to say, we must cleave together, but history is always a loop. • The Tin Drum tours until 23 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/13/weinstein-sex-predators-baroness-lady-trumpington","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"To stand up to sex predators like Weinstein, learn from this defiant baroness | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/weinstein-sex-predators-baroness-lady-trumpington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/weinstein-sex-predators-baroness-lady-trumpington","fields":{"headline":"To stand up to sex predators like Weinstein, learn from this defiant baroness","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Lady Trumpington was a young woman fresh out of finishing school, she worked for a while as a second world war land girl on a farm belonging to David Lloyd George. It was a rather odd set-up, to say the least. The former prime minister kept his mistress in a bungalow near the main house while his family were resident, moving her back in when they departed; the young Jean Campbell-Harris, as she was then, was stabled with the mistress. She describes in her autobiography how Lloyd George would make her stand against a wall while he measured her with a tape, which she thought was probably the “nearest to flesh he could get” with a watchful mistress around. Not quite Harvey Weinstein territory, but creepy nonetheless. Trumpers, as she was known, retired this week from the House of Lords at the age of 95, after a gloriously eventful career that took her from working as a translator in the Bletchley Park code-breaking huts to becoming one of only a handful of senior female ministers under Margaret Thatcher. But she will be immortalised for future generations by that film clip of her cheerfully sticking two fingers up at her old friend, and a former minister, Lord King. (He referred ungallantly to her age; she forgot there were cameras around.) Which is quite as it should be – for every young woman should have a Trumpers in her life: an indomitable great aunt figure, unashamedly enjoying the luxury of being old enough not to worry all the time about what others – men, especially – think. No wonder older women were once feared as witches, given the devilish difficulty of controlling them otherwise. The compensation of old age, once the male gaze moves on, is the freedom not to care. And who wouldn’t secretly thrill to the idea of addressing disagreeable arguments over lunch (as Trumpers reportedly did) by putting down one’s gin and shouting “Balls!”? Never mind wearing purple when we are old, as the Jenny Joseph poem has it, with a red hat that doesn’t go. How tame that seems in comparison with wearing ermine, flicking Vs, and effortlessly embarrassing young comedians on Have I Got News For You by making fruity jokes, as Lady Trumpington did at the age of 90. What extraordinary strength of character they must have had, that pre-war generation of women raised and educated only for marriage, who nonetheless overcame considerable obstacles to make something exciting of their lives. And yet it’s not a generation to be viewed through rose-tinted glasses, still less used to rebuke younger women. If they were tough, it’s because they had no choice, and precious few chances to complain. In her 90s, Lady Trumpington could comfortably tell the Lloyd George story to the world. The young Jean presumably didn’t dare. Some things never change, and yet they could. The Trumpers figure in my own life was quite literally a great aunt, whose war years were spent as an army nurse in Africa before driving home overland across Europe with a dashing-looking young officer, whose role in this adventure was only ever vaguely explained. If it was a wartime affair, it can’t have survived the peace, but at any rate this road trip furnished her with some tremendous stories. By the time I knew her, she was thrillingly immune to disapproval of any kind and at family parties would swear with impressive creativity, fluency and disregard for the presence of children. (Small ones clearly rather bored her, at least until old enough to be introduced to the Telegraph crossword.) The older I get, the better I wish I’d known her. But it was from her I learned the story of another elderly relative, a sweet old lady whose sole introduction to the facts of life had been a warning on her wedding day from her mother that her husband would want to do something beastly to her, that must be endured in order to get a baby. “But what nobody told me,” this woman confided to my great aunt, “was that it would be such fun!” Old ladies are so much less shockable than the young think. We patronise them at our peril, that generation whose lives were so rich in hidden depths and so fraught with dangers. They dared not get too close to men – shame lurked at every corner, and pregnancy spelled unmitigated disaster in a time before freely available contraception or abortion – yet risked destitution without them. A bad marriage was to be endured not ended, and opportunities for work were still heavily circumscribed by class. At Bletchley they chiefly recruited daughters of the landed gentry, on the grounds that posh girls were thought less likely to gossip. A less well-connected woman might conceivably have struggled to achieve Trumpington’s impressive late life career in politics too, which she entered via a life peerage. Nostalgia for that era is, then, misplaced. It is a far, far better time to be a young woman now, as Hollywood’s predators face days of reckoning and old barriers are starting to be dismantled. But there are lessons to learn from the Trumpington generation all the same. There has been much talk about courage in the Weinstein case, of how victims must be brave to come forward. But perhaps it is more useful to talk about the absence of shame, the emotion on which Weinstein’s modus operandi relied. Why do women still feel so mortified when this happens to us, so embarrassed about discussing it publicly, when it’s obvious we weren’t the ones doing wrong? Yet still we worry that somehow we might have been; that we sent the wrong signals, or should have made more fuss, or else are fussing about nothing. At least it wasn’t rape. Maybe we misunderstood. There’s always something to apologise for. It’s striking how many victims describe Weinstein telling them, before lunging, that they needed to lose weight if they wanted to get better roles. They were primed from the start to feel there was something wrong with them, rather than him. And that’s why the one vital lesson younger women can take from older ones is not that they should be tougher or more courageous. It’s that life is vastly improved by no longer being made to feel shame for things that are not rationally shameful. Contrive somehow to care less about what others think of our bodies or our behaviour, get rid of that useless anxiety – and living wouldn’t require half so much courage. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/13/quentin-letts-radio-4","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Arrogance, misogyny … no blow is too low for the likes of Quentin Letts | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/quentin-letts-radio-4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/quentin-letts-radio-4","fields":{"headline":"Arrogance, misogyny … no blow is too low for the likes of Quentin Letts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What to do when reactionaries attack? Do you give them the satisfaction, the oxygen of publicity? Do you play the game and be the po-faced, politically correct Guardianista glumbucket of their imagining? A bit of a poser, that one, as the Daily Mail’s Quentin Letts might say in his best Boris-Greyfriars lingo. There I was on the Today programme, lined up against Letts as he plugged his latest quicky book, Patronising Bastards: How the Elites Betrayed Britain. He lists 100 people he hates. I make it in at No 51. His trope is that a “Brahmin caste” has “posed as liberals” and “crouched behind ‘enlightened’ attitudes while imposing on a populace it claims to esteem but truthfully disdains.” You know the whole schtick at a glance. “Common sense” has been abolished, “Britons voted Brexit because they were fed up being taken for fools”, and “children were exposed to sex education by schools more interested in dogma than declension. Sex crimes rocketed.” Murderers are set free by sociologists, while smokers feel like criminals, all “bossed about” by “know-alls” on “diet, gender, sexuality, race, even the weather”. His is a life of purest torment. He especially hates “railway Tannoys saying ‘see it, say it, sorted’”. If you didn’t hear Today, you can imagine what transpired. He took a swing at “our new establishment”, the “new elite … schmoozing and networking”, the “mass of people forever wagging fingers” and “telling us how to live our lives”. And as he did so, he betrayed again that curious paranoia of those who hold power, wealth and influence, and their defenders in the Tory press, pretending that they are the victims. For most of my life, the Tories have been in power, with brief social democratic interludes showing that democracy still functions, if intermittently. They are the captains of just about every commanding height – except, maybe, the most senior figures in the arts. That’s why they are Letts’ great bete noire. This perverse positioning is always particularly rich from those who take the Daily Mail shilling, for who could be more powerful, more elitist than Paul Dacre, the paper’s grand and pugnacious editor, whose personal portfolio, if we leave to one side a £2m salary, includes a cattle farm in Sussex and a Scottish grouse moor with deer stalking and salmon fishing, handsomely subsidised by the EU? Shouldn’t he be in the book? “I’m not a suicide bomber, for God’s sake,” spluttered Letts. He was losing the argument. So what does the right do next, what does a Mail man do next? He turned personal and patronising: “Do you know, whenever I’m on with Polly I wish I could just pin her to the ground and tickle her under the armpits and make you smile my dear!” It was creepy, disgusting. In the panic of the live radio moment I cringed and simpered a bit. “I do smile!” I said, falling for the trope of the “miserable humourless Guardian old girl can’t even take a joke!” (Old girl is what he called the prime minister on the Mail’s front page last week). And then I kicked myself a thousand times for all the things I might have said. Pin me down? Tickle me? Can you imagine him saying that to Simon Jenkins or Jonathan Freedland? There was no harm done: I’m not vulnerable. But on Twitter there was anger at another wearying reminder of the extent to which contempt for women informs the Mail culture. This isn’t pussy-grabbing or masturbating in front of actresses. Letts isn’t Trump or Weinstein – but his twee, over-physical little put-down comes from an adjacent place. Men are men and women forever silly girls – old or young. I guess that this week all women my age have been mentally re-running the bum-pinching, grabbing, intimidating humiliations from men in power of our youth. I remember as a gauche and inadequate 22-year-old reporter, that interview with the author Saul Bellow. Bored, bullying, he ordered me to walk ahead of him in the park so he could look at my legs as they were better than my questions. And shamingly, I did. Mordecai Richler, the Canadian novelist, assumed a fixer had set me up for the night with him on his publicity tour in exchange for an interview. He was outraged when I ran off. I never wrote those things into my interviews, as now we would. I’m prepared for what might come next, for the right often strikes back and the Mail usually retaliates. I’m a champagne socialist, a hypocrite, a glumbucket, a misery of an old girl who can’t take a joke; just tickle me to death, Dacre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/12/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-owes-us-an-apology-over-russian-meddling","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T18:28:22Z","webTitle":"Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook owes US an apology over Russian meddling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/12/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-owes-us-an-apology-over-russian-meddling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/12/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-owes-us-an-apology-over-russian-meddling","fields":{"headline":"Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook owes US an apology over Russian meddling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook owes the American people an apology for the way it handled Russia’s interference in last year’s presidential election, its chief operating officer said on Thursday. “It’s not just that we apologize. We’re angry, we’re upset. But what we really owe the American people is determination” to do a better job of preventing foreign meddling, Sheryl Sandberg told the Axios news website during an interview in Washington. She also told the website that her social network was not a media company. “At our heart we’re a tech company,” she said. “We don’t hire journalists.” The live interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia in the months before and after the presidential campaign. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin and Trump have repeatedly denied. Sandberg said ads linked to Russia trying to influence the US presidential election should “absolutely” be released to the public, along with information on whom the ads were targeting. Previously, Facebook has declined to make the ads public, and Sandberg did not say when the company would do so. The company disclosed last month that it had found ads linked to fake accounts – probably run from Russia – that sought to influence the election. Facebook says these ads focused on divisive political issues, such as immigration and gun rights, in an apparent attempt to sow discord among the US population. The ads included promoted events and amplified posts that show up in users’ news feeds. Facebook has turned over the ads – and information on how they were targeted, such as by geography or to people with a certain political affiliation – to congressional investigators. Congress is also investigating Russia-linked ads on Twitter and Google. Sandberg said Facebook had a responsibility to prevent the kind of abuse that occurred on its service during the election. She said Facebook hoped to “set a new standard in transparency in advertising”. But she also said that had the ads been linked to legitimate, rather than fake, Facebook accounts, “most of them would have been allowed to run”. While the company prohibits certain content such as hate speech, it does not want to prevent free expression, she said. “The thing about free expression is that when you allow free expression, you allow free expression,” Sandberg said. The move comes as critics and lawmakers are increasingly calling for the regulation of Facebook and other internet giants. Sandberg is meeting with elected officials in Washington this week ahead of a House hearing at which executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google are expected to testify. Congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russian interference in the election, including whether there was any collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Sandberg is no stranger to Washington. Before her time at Google and later Facebook, she worked for Larry Summers, treasury secretary for Bill Clinton. Sandberg said Facebook did not catch these ads earlier because it was focused on other threats, such as hacking. Sandberg didn’t say whether she believes Facebook played a role in electing Trump as president, as critics have said it did by allowing the spread of fake news on its service. She said only that the role Facebook plays in elections went “beyond any one campaign, any one country”.

Most of the time, to the delight and profit of the parliamentary sketchwriters’ guild, she is scripted and self-disciplined to a fault. She repeats her lines until the repetition is a form of torture. So how do we explain it if, just once, she strays momentarily off piste? Don’t get this wrong. Off piste for May is an extremely relative concept. It is not the same as for Boris Johnson. Blink and, in May’s case, you miss it. Most of the time, the vicar’s daughter’s approach to her job seems to echo the words of Lucy Baldwin, wife of the Tory prime minister Stanley, who, when asked at Lord Curzon’s funeral in 1925 whether she was a believer, replied: “I am indeed, and I must tell you that every morning when we rise, we kneel together before God and commend our day to Him, praying that some good work may be done in it by us. It is not for ourselves that we are working, but for the country and for God’s sake. How else could we live?” Nevertheless, there was no blinking or missing the brief spark of anger and combativeness this week, when May was challenged in the House of Commons by Labour’s Heidi Alexander, who accused her of “running scared” of her party’s extreme right over Brexit. May got to her feet, threw her briefing notes on the desk, said “whoops” as she gathered up her straying papers, and glared at the Labour MP. Alexander, May insisted with unusual emphasis, “could not be more wrong”. For May to react in that way is tremendously out of character. So the more one reflects on why she had that brief and uncharacteristic rush of blood in the Commons, the more it feels as if Alexander touched a nerve. If that’s right, then the thing that matters about the exchange is surely this. May is weakened and under pressure. She had a rotten party conference, and Johnson and the press are incorrigible troublemakers. But the big thing May thinks she is doing as prime minister, as the moment of truth on Brexit gets closer, is to stand up against the dogmatic Brexiteers while trying to hold the Tory party together. That moment got a little nearer on Thursday when it became clear that the European commission and the UK government have failed to reach agreement on the first tranche of Brexit talks. That outcome, confirmed in Brussels by Michel Barnier and David Davis, is no surprise to anyone involved. Both sides have been saying for ages that December is the crunch month on the issues – citizens’ rights, money, and Ireland – that the EU has prioritised. Even that deadline may be pushed back. This reality is what lies behind the exaggerated and in some respects confected argument that is supposed to have taken place this week between May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over the extent to which Britain should start to prepare for a failed article 50 negotiation and a “cliff-edge” breakdown between the two sides – the outcome that the dogmatists in the Tory party crave so irresponsibly. The Daily Mail attempted to portray the chancellor as a traitor in a daggers-drawn battle with the true-believing Brexiteer prime minister. In fact, May and Hammond are far closer on this issue than is characterised. It is hardly a surprise – let alone wrong – that the chancellor is risk-averse on this issue, especially a month before his budget and with the finances looking very tight. Crucially, though, the two are on the same side over the necessity for the UK to require transitional arrangements between Brexit in March 2019 and the operation of formal new EU-UK relationships – the issue on which they carried the cabinet in September. The real knife fight is between May and the majority of the cabinet on the one side, and the fanatics on the other who actively desire no special new relationship with the EU. If that’s right, then pro-Europeans of all kinds, Tory or not, have a champion in this fight, and that champion’s name is Theresa May. The issues at stake here for pro-Europeans are multiple. One is to prevent the “cliffites” getting their way, which is to drive the UK into the arms of Trump’s America and move closer to the bonfire of the regulations that is their other ultimate goal. A second is to promote the softest possible Brexit, in terms of UK relations and arrangements with the EU single market and customs union, that best preserve the jobs, living standards and economic prospects of British people – while also placing the right priority on keeping Ireland at peace. And a third is that supporting May on this issue is the best way – not an ideal way, but the best there is at the moment – of keeping the EU remain ball in play for the future. There are other reasons for still taking May’s form of Toryism seriously and hoping that it eventually gains the upper hand over the deregulatory, small state right. One of these was on show this week, in the shape of the bill to control energy prices that May foreshadowed at the party conference. Another, in Washington, was the International Monetary Fund’s embrace of the viability of increased income taxes on high earners in advanced economies such as Britain. That’s a call that some Tories, including the former Cameron-era minister Oliver Letwin in his new book Hearts and Minds, have embraced too. While May remains prime minister, it does, at least, stand some chance of being considered. But the massive importance of Brexit is the clincher. Within the cabinet, the party and the country there are fundamental divisions about what Brexit means. You don’t have to admire or support May to recognise that she and Hammond are on the far better, more cautious, side of those Conservative divisions. On almost every issue that matters in the modern world, May’s broad approach towards the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with Europe remains more desirable and responsible – in spite of all its many faults and huge limitations – than the approach her opponents would put in its place if they could. None of this makes May a great prime minister, a successful leader or a big thinker. Heidi Alexander was right to challenge her. But May’s response was revealing. Right now, and as the big calls on Brexit draw closer for the government, May remains, however improbably, the best hope the Tories have got – and even, while this government remains, of others too. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/12/penguin-catastrophe-leads-to-demands-for-protection-in-east-antarctica","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T06:31:38Z","webTitle":"Penguin disaster as just two chicks survive from colony of 40,000","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/penguin-catastrophe-leads-to-demands-for-protection-in-east-antarctica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/12/penguin-catastrophe-leads-to-demands-for-protection-in-east-antarctica","fields":{"headline":"Penguin disaster as only two chicks survive from colony of 40,000","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A colony of about 40,000 Adélie penguins in Antarctica has suffered a “catastrophic breeding event” – all but two chicks have died of starvation this year. It is the second time in just four years that such devastation – not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation – has been wrought on the population. The finding has prompted urgent calls for the establishment of a marine protected area in East Antarctica, at next week’s meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart. In the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs on Petrels Island, French scientists discovered just two surviving chicks at the start of the year. Thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the island in the region called Adélie Land (“Terre Adélie”). The colony had experienced a similar event in 2013, when no chicks survived. In a paper about that event, a group of researchers, led by Yan Ropert-Coudert from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, said it had been caused by a record amount of summer sea ice and an “unprecedented rainy episode”. The unusual extent of sea ice meant the penguins had to travel an extra 100km to forage for food. And the rainy weather left the chicks, which have poor waterproofing, wet and unable to keep warm. This year’s event has also been attributed to an unusually large amount of sea ice. Overall, Antarctica has had a record low amount of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony has been an exception. Ropert-Coudert said the region had been severely affected by the break-up of the Mertz glacier tongue in 2010, when a piece of ice almost the size of Luxembourg – about 80 km long and 40km wide – broke off. That event, which occurred about 250km from Petrels Island, had a big impact on ocean currents and ice formation in the region. “The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.” The link between climate change and the sea-ice extent around Antarctica is not very clear. Sea ice has been increasing in recent years, which could be attributed to a rise in the amount of freshwater in the ocean around the continent caused by climate change. However, over the long term, climate change is expected to cause the sea ice to shrink dramatically. “For the moment, sea ice is increasing and this is a problem for this species as it pushes the feeding place – the sea ice edge – farther away from their nesting place,” Ropert-Coudert said. “If it shrinks it would help but if it shrinks too much then the food chain they rely on may be impacted. Basically, as a creature of the sea ice they need an optimum sea-ice cover to thrive.” Elsewhere, human pressures including climate change have already been having a severe impact on the numbers of Adélie penguins. On the Antarctic Peninsula, which has been badly affected by climate change, populations have been decreasing, and some researchers suggest they may become extinct there. Ropert-Coudert said there were more anthropogenic threats on the horizon – fishing and possibly tourism – that the penguins needed protection from. He has called for a marine protected area (MPA) to be established there. “An MPA will not remedy these changes but it could prevent further impacts that direct anthropogenic pressures, such as tourism and proposed fisheries, could bring,” he said. Next week, 24 countries and the European Union will meet at the CCAMLR in Hobart to discuss the potential creation of more MPAs around Antarctica. At last year’s meeting, after years of failed negotiations, the members agreed to create the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, and many expect the group to agree on East Antarctica next. This has also been proposed by Australia and has been on the table at the CCAMLR for eight years. The head of polar programs at WWF, Rod Downie, said: “Adélie penguins are one of the hardiest and most amazing animals on our planet. This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins. It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land. “The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adélie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off East Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.” Ropert-Coudert and his colleagues are in the process of completing a scientific paper on the breeding failure and plan to submit it to a journal in the coming weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/13/mull-islanders-launch-appeal-to-buy-up-neighbouring-ulva","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T11:22:10Z","webTitle":"Mull islanders launch appeal to buy up neighbouring Ulva","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/mull-islanders-launch-appeal-to-buy-up-neighbouring-ulva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/mull-islanders-launch-appeal-to-buy-up-neighbouring-ulva","fields":{"headline":"Mull islanders launch appeal to buy up neighbouring Ulva","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Islanders on Mull will launch a worldwide appeal to help buy the tiny Hebridean island of Ulva after Scottish ministers stopped its owner selling it for as much as £5m. The appeal is likely to include Australians whose forebears left Ulva during and after the Highland clearances, which resulted in its population plummeting from about 600 people two centuries ago to just six. The 1,860 hectare (4,600 acre) island, reached by a short ferry ride from a pier on Mull that is part of the island property, nestles just off the west coast of Mull. It is the largest of Mull’s sister islands, which include the more famous monastic island of Iona, and Staffa, known for its remarkable basalt columns and its sea cavern Fingal’s Cave. Ulva features some of the same basalt columns found on Staffa, Neolithic standing stones, a little-used Grade II-listed church and the remnants of a once-sprawling township. Rebecca Munro, whose husband Rhuri grew up on the island, where they are raising their two children, said they hoped to see Ulva thrive again. Rhuri is a creel fisherman, and the nearby seas are rich in lobster, langoustine and crab, and she runs a small seafood cafe there with her sister-in-law, catering to about 5,000 visitors a year. “It’s just such a lovely place to bring up children. We have such an excellent primary school at Ulva Ferry and the children have a freedom that they wouldn’t get elsewhere,” she said. “The idea that we could bring more people back and support the school at the same time would be lovely. When [Rhuri] was growing up they had Burns suppers and Christmas parties there in the church, and it would be nice to get that heart back into the place. “When you walk around and you see the ruins and the houses still there but empty, you get a sense of what it could be like again. Just to get people and families and young people back in the empty houses would make such a difference.” The community buyout bid was announced over the summer after it emerged that its laird, Jamie Howard, whose family has owned Ulva for 70 years, was about to put it on the market for offers over £4.25m. Its sale brochure boasted of Ulva’s “truly unique combination of peace and privacy”, and highlighted its links to the authors Beatrix Potter and Sir Walter Scott, who used Ulva as inspiration for his poem Lord of the Isles. An article in the Sunday Times put the price tag at £5m, comparing it favourably to the cost of property in London. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, announced at the Scottish National party’s annual conference on Tuesday that the sale had been blocked by ministers to allow a community bid using new rights for residents to buy up local land, forests and buildings, partly with public funds. The Ulva bid is seen by campaigners as a significant moment in Scotland’s land reform movement, which wants to end Scotland’s highly concentrated land-ownership patterns. The introduction of a national-lottery-backed Scottish Land Fund, which has £10m a year to spend, has seen a surge in interest in community buyouts. Linsay Chalmers, of Community Land Scotland, a representative group, said there were about 180 bids either under way or being explored, but most were small. Purchases of entire islands are rare and this is the largest bid of any kind for some time. Until now, just two have been bought by their residents: the Hebridean islands of Eigg in 1997 and Gigha in 2002. The Ulva bid has been lodged by North West Mull Community Woodland Company, which has already taken large areas into shared ownership. Its plan is to integrate Ulva in a wider regeneration strategy across north western Mull, where it has already set up nine new woodland crofts, a type of agricultural smallholding. Funding the buyout will be a challenge and much hinges on how much the island is valued by a government-appointed assessor. Although Howard had sought offers in excess of £4.25m, it had been valued at £3.1m when he inherited it from his mother in 2015. Howard has not responded to requests for an interview. Ulva loses about £100,000 a year and Howard’s agents estimate modernising its properties and infrastructure could cost another few million pounds. Much of the purchase price will need to be raised through crowdfunding, said Ian Hepburn, a director of the woodland company. “We have been inundated with offers of help since the first time this was mentioned,” he said. Part of that will focus on Australia, and the wider Scottish diaspora. Ulva’s most famous emigre was Lachlan Macquarie, perhaps the most revered colonial governor of New South Wales, who has a university, bank and library named after him and whose statue stands in Sydney’s Hyde Park. His granite mausoleum, which sits a few miles from Ulva in a small enclosure on Mull, is frequently visited by Australian tourists. The woodland company has told ministers it plans to slowly repopulate the island, doubling it to 10 in five years and again to 20 in a decade, by offering long-term secure tenancies. It would resurrect the island’s farm, build new homes and focus on eco-tourism for travellers arriving on Mull for its famous sea eagles and whale-watching tours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/12/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-how-much-progress-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp two years on – how much progress has been made? | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/12/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-how-much-progress-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/12/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-how-much-progress-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp two years on – how much progress has been made?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Welcome back, then, the Premier League. Now. Where were we? Tasked with hitting the big dramatic notes from the start after two weeks of international break, the Premier League’s focus groups and script-editing teams could hardly have come up with a better opening act than Manchester United’s trip to Liverpool this Saturday lunchtime. Skip the intro. Let’s just turn it all right back up to 11. Not that there’s anything new here, just some old, fond, familiar flavours. Cut the Premier League season open anywhere you like in the last decade or so and the chances are you’ll find José Mourinho contemplating another potentially season-spoiling trip to Anfield. Or the latest eminent tactician scratching his head and wondering why previously workable defensive systems have been infected with the dreaded Premier League flakiness. Not to mention an agreeably sweeping clash of styles, in this case muscular team defence versus adrenal, scattergun attack. As ever when these teams meet the occasion will be touched by a genuine spike of north-west derby bile. But this is a significant moment for other reasons. Most obviously the result on Saturday will bring into narrower focus Liverpool’s progress under Jürgen Klopp, seven games into a season that has seen them looking a little feverish and flustered, all trapped energy, legs whirring like a cartoon roadrunner suspended above the canyon floor, still trying to work out whether to fall or fly. There is a tendency to obsess over the influence of managers, to hoist them aloft as a straw man, patsy and all-round piñata for every misstep, every note of misfortune, every beached ambition. In this case there is an unavoidable circularity. On Saturday it will be almost exactly two years since Klopp became Liverpool manager. Progress has been made. Albeit, as ever in the Premier League, this raises the more metaphysical question of how exactly progress is measured, what gauge you apply to success. There are plenty of obvious ticks. Liverpool are in the Champions League. They have reached two cup finals. They play nice, engaging football, certainly nicer and more engaging than the tail end of the Brendan Rodgers era. But they are still to make the kind of alchemical step up some might have hoped for given Klopp’s record at Borussia Dortmund and his enduring aura, a way of engaging with those around him that suggests all possibilities are open, a managerial presence that even in defeat has something oddly evangelical and proselytising about it. Opponents have been less amenable. Liverpool will pick up their season on a horrible run of one win in seven across all competitions since the end of August, with no clean sheets and 14 goals conceded. Sadio Mané is out for six weeks with a hamstring strain. Even the manager has begun to gripe a little, looking bemused by the recurrent defensive mistakes of players he coaches every week, selects every weekend, and in some cases brought to the club himself. Last week Klopp insisted, as he must when asked a silly question, that Liverpool are still in the title race. Given the lavish spending elsewhere, the sense of a three-team elite ready to break away at the top, few will have expected Liverpool to be pushing for the title right to the end of the season. This, though, is all a bit sudden. Should United win at Anfield the gap between Liverpool and the league leaders will be 10 points. To concede any meaningful presence in the title race this early in the season, to narrow the focus so early to a 30-game slog for fourth place, is not the progress club or manager will have been hoping for when he turned down offers elsewhere to make Anfield his home. Klopp has always been about method and coaching rather than headline recruitment. He does, though, need the basic human tools. It has become fashionable to pick away at his tactics, his previous successes, to take a shot at a much-trailed overseas coach. But the current tactical plan – press hard, play on the edge – is being undermined by faulty execution. There isn’t a great deal wrong that could not be solved by centre-halves making the right decisions at the right moment and a high-class centre-forward who can do both parts of the job, running hard and still managing to finish like a sniper. This is the conundrum Klopp faces at a club without the will to recruit the correct personnel. The hard-running Klopp style demands, as a first principle, a striker to run and harry and lead the press. These players are available. But those who can also finish every half‑chance while also leading the charge are both rare and prohibitively expensive. Klopp needs a centre‑forward with Daniel Sturridge’s eye and Roberto Firmino’s heart. They had one a while ago. He went to Barcelona for £75m. Looking back to that first game in charge, a high-energy 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane, it is remarkable how little has changed. Liverpool were defensively shaky, kept in the game by Simon Mignolet’s saves. Eight of the starting XI are still at the club. Liverpool have spent just £20m or so net since Klopp arrived, which includes £35m of actual UK currency on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. A striker like Diego Costa or Harry Kane would transform this team, transform the perception of Klopp’s methods to date. Instead he will work on refining what he has, faced this early in the season with a derby game that could in effect kill Liverpool’s title challenge before the clocks have gone back. This is something of a Mourinho speciality. It is three and a half years since his Chelsea team came to Anfield and produced a brilliant defensive performance to do something similar to Liverpool’s most persuasive title challenge of the Premier League era, winning a deathly, bruising game on the break. Mourinho is likely to produce another well-laid, physically robust game of counterattack. Anfield has both haunted and inspired him since 2005 and the Champions League defeat to a scrambled Luis García goal that Mourinho still disputes. He has lost one Premier League game there since, winning three and drawing two, and always arriving a little more sandpapery, a little more combative. For Saturday United will have Phil Jones back and Romelu Lukaku up front despite an ankle niggle. Marouane Fellaini might have played if fit but Nemanja Matic plus Ander Herrera is still an energetic midfield. Mané’s absence will probably see Coutinho move into Liverpool’s front three and Emre Can come into midfield. Klopp will hope Can’s exhilarating long range net-buster for Germany this week is an omen of something similarly penetrative. Nobody even resembling a centre‑forward has scored a league goal for Liverpool since the 4-0 thrashing of Arsenal in August. United, for their part, have conceded just six goals in their last 14 matches going back to the middle of May, two of those to Real Madrid, one at home to Burton in the EFL Cup. Defences may or may not win titles but they do often close out the tightest of games. At a similar break in the season last year Antonio Conte spent a few days brooding in Italy and recalibrated his own defence so dramatically Chelsea set off on an unstoppable spree. Klopp will have been desperate to get his full squad back after the break and wreak something similar. With Tottenham away to follow next week, this already looks like an unusually urgent meeting of city neighbours, of styles and personalities, of press high and defend deep."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"membership/2017/oct/18/uk-needs-coordinated-strategy-to-tackle-knife-says-mp","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"UK needs coordinated strategy to tackle knife crime, says MP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/oct/18/uk-needs-coordinated-strategy-to-tackle-knife-says-mp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2017/oct/18/uk-needs-coordinated-strategy-to-tackle-knife-says-mp","fields":{"headline":"UK needs coordinated strategy to tackle knife crime, says MP","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain needs a 10-year, coordinated strategy to tackle knife crime among young people, similar to the successful long-term effort to reduce teenage pregnancy, the chair of an all-party group on knife crime has said. Instead of considering knife crime as mainly a police issue, the government should be bringing together those working in health, education and social media, Sarah Jones, the MP for Croydon Central told the Guardian. Without this kind of approach, which has proved effective in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy, the government will struggle to permanently reduce knife crime, she warned. “You can’t tackle it overnight and you can’t possibly say all knife crime happens because of just one thing. There are so many different factors at play. So we need someone in the centre to be holding the rings of a plan that goes across education, health, social media, mental health, that spans across it because otherwise it’ll go up and down as it has done.” Jones highlighted the importance of building a full picture of the issues affecting knife crime, including problems with young people and academy schools. “Every single agency I spoke to said academies are a problem, because increasingly there are these managed moves where kids are not expelled because they haven’t done enough to be expelled, but they are managed out of the system. They are just put into a pupil referral unit and they end up staying there for longer than they should.” Jones believes a focus on social media will be essential, and that platforms must take more responsibility for posts that glamorise knives and violence. “I think there’s been a fuss, quite legitimately, about what’s been going on with extremism and hate crime on social media. We need to make it the same with glamorising violence and gang crime – the kind of thing where somebody posts something horrific that violates somebody else online and then somebody else has to respond,” she said. “A lot of that will involve Facebook and Google investing in enough people who are monitoring the right kind of artificial intelligence to identify these things, and people [who] might be able to do something about it.” Jones, who was elected MP for the first time in June, was talking to the Guardian as part of Beyond the Blade, a long-term project exploring the issue of knife crime and young people. Jones set up the new all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on knife crime after conversations with constituents on the campaign trail. “Knife crime came up on the doorstep a lot. It’s doubled in the last year in Croydon. So it’s a big problem that’s on everybody’s radar,” she said. “One of the things happening in Croydon, and I suspect elsewhere, is that levels of anxiety among young people has gone up. There are people who don’t carry knives and aren’t necessarily anything to do with knife crime, but they’re in a school where a kid was stabbed and the anxiety levels … so people were talking about it.” Britain halved the rate of teenage pregnancy within 20 years after a long-term commitment by Labour in 1998. The rate is still falling quickly in the UK, although it remains one of the highest in Europe. Jones argues that long-term strategy on teenage pregnancy provides a blueprint for taking on an issue such as knife crime, which involves both changing social attitudes and getting various government departments to work together to find a solution. “It was coordinated from the centre. It was multiagency. It was partly about education and making sure they had access to information, it was partly about their life choices, it was partly about funding. It was a broad strategy and I think that’s what we need for knife crime now,” she said. When Jones held an adjournment debate on the issue in parliament last month she was surprised by the number and range of MPs, both politically and geographically, who turned up. “There were quite a few Conservatives there,” she said. “The geographical spread was interesting too. There were the London MPs that you would expect, but there were also MPs from Birmingham, Aberdeen and Colchester.” The APPG plans to launch a series of evidentiary hearings, starting by listening to young people about why they carry knives. It will then move on to make recommendations to government. “It’s quite a difficult ask, getting kids to come to Westminster and tell us why they choose to carry a knife. It’s not the easiest thing,” Jones said. Over the summer, she started making inquiries in her constituency with organisations and agencies involved with knife crime and identified three key areas she thinks need to be addressed: social media, education and public health, towards which she says there should be a broader and more comprehensive approach, particularly with regard to mental health provision. In addition, Jones would like to see greater coordination between the judicial and probation services and employment. But she also acknowledges that some of the issues are about funding. “If you don’t pay for stuff it doesn’t happen. It’s going to depend on how strong an argument we can make,” she said. “One of the things about knife crime is that you solve some of the causes and you solve a lot of other things too. To some degree, knife crime is a symptom of a wider problem. You tackle some of these things, you tackle a lot of other things at the same time. “With the teenage pregnancy strategy, when they introduced loads of education about contraception and safe sex they didn’t just reduce teenage pregnancy they reduced sexually transmitted diseases.” Reducing knife crime will be difficult, but with sufficient determination Jones believes it can be done. “The thing that’s both positive and depressing at the same time is that a lot of these things we know the answers to.

Most men do not want to dominate and humiliate women. Indeed, while men are of course not the main victims of our misogynistic culture, they are not immune from its harmful effects. All men, at some time, will have felt the tedious and unrealistic pressure to appear to be “strong and masterful”. Men stand to gain hugely from women coming forward to expose their powerful male abusers. It’s a long overdue chance for our culture to be shifted decisively away from damaging preconceptions about the roles of both sexes. It’s another important, and far from selfless, reason why men should make much more effort to call out and challenge abuse by other men whenever they see it happening. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland • Rebecca Solnit calls for a rethink of masculinity and suggests we change the way we raise our boys. She cites examples from the US and Sweden, but also in the same day’s paper are articles about hair-chopping in Kashmir and the failure of the Indian government to revoke a law that allows men to rape their wives. FGM, child marriage and the use of rape as a weapon of war have been widely reported for years. Asking our boys to “play nice” is pointless. As long as the power imbalance which is at the root of all oppressive behaviour continues, these horrors will continue to blight humanity. Ruth Eversley Paulton, Somerset • The bystanders Zoe Williams writes of (G2, 11 October) include us all. The fact that racism, insane and horribly oppressive, still thrives is the proof that we must do something, not just feel bad. Make a change: say something, sign something, write something, do something about supremacists and abusers. Trump and Weinstein are touchstones. They remind me I am not powerless.

The stock market made up of the UK’s biggest companies closed up 22 points (0.3%) at 7556.24. The rise reflected the weaker pound, which makes British goods and services cheaper abroad and tends to increase the share price of multinational companies with a large proportion of foreign earnings. At one point, the pound was down as much as one cent against the dollar at $1.3123, after the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said talks over Britain’s divorce bill were in a “very disturbing state of deadlock”. Currency traders reacted swiftly to the lack of progress, also sending sterling down to a four-week low against the euro at €1.109, although the pound later recovered after markets closed. Multinational exporters were among the FTSE 100’s biggest risers on Thursday, with Burberry gaining 2.7% and Unilever up 2.1%. Energy companies also helped push the index to the record closing high. SSE and Centrica, two of Britain’s biggest providers, gained 2.5% and 1.9% respectively after it emerged that the government’s price cap was unlikely to come into effect until 2019. Analysts said the high on Thursday was not a vote of confidence in the UK economy. “The bullish move was achieved for the wrong reasons, as the dip in the pound on the back of the stalled Brexit talks helped the British index,” said David Madden of CMC Markets. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, said: “The continued ascent of the FTSE has had much to do with the negative effect of the disjointed Brexit negotiations, with daily updates seemingly highlighting just how unsuccessful the initial rounds of talks have been.” The FTSE’s showing beat its previous closing high of 7,547 points in June, but was below the record intraday high of 7,598.99. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The UK stock market continues its winning streak despite concerns over economic performance and the unfolding Brexit process. The question is whether the market’s strong run means it’s fit to burst. “Factoring in earnings, from where we’re sitting, valuations in the UK stock market look reasonable, neither particularly cheap nor particularly expensive. That means in the short term the stock market can turn in either direction without defying the laws of statistics.” The FTSE 250 also reached a record closing high on Thursday, up 0.4% at 20,251.24. The index comprises medium-sized companies that are not large enough to make it into the FTSE 100, and tend to be more focused on the UK market. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said the FTSE 250’s figure reflected a wider appetite among investors to buy equities. “The FTSE 250 is also at a high and I think this is a sign of a broader risk-on attitude across global markets that has pushed Germany’s Dax and America’s Dow to new records,” he said. The Dow Jones index in the US also hit a record high of 22,884.00, but later dropped back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/15/saint-george-and-the-dragon-review-brexit-fairytale-national-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Saint George and the Dragon review – Brexit fairytale’s sappy ending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/15/saint-george-and-the-dragon-review-brexit-fairytale-national-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/15/saint-george-and-the-dragon-review-brexit-fairytale-national-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Saint George and the Dragon review – Brexit fairytale’s sappy ending","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Returning to his village having failed as a knight, our chivalrous hero George is called upon to save a damsel in distress and free his people from the clutches of a three-headed dragon. Offstage, George dispatches the monster with terrific whiz-bangs and flashing lights. The village is drawn together, and is on the way to creating a bright and brilliant future as a forward-looking community. Rory Mullarkey’s new take on the legend of Saint George neatly addresses questions of leadership and nation-building to an audience familiar with the frustration and discontent of Brexit Britain. But there’s a strong whiff of the Christmas panto here, subverting any sustained attempt at heftier engagement and analysis of our current predicament. Designed by Rae Smith, the cartoonish and graphic set plays well to the comic-book style of director Lyndsey Turner, while John Heffernan makes a witty and engaging Saint George. Elsa (Amaka Okafor) is a terrifically mouthy damsel, and throughout the piece jokes, verbal and visual, are often genuinely funny, particularly the creation of the flag of England. George is summoned away, but returns a year later to find the village transformed into an industrialised city and the dragon returned in a different form. Events repeat again and again, Groundhog Day-style, until Mullarkey brings us up to date with an exaggerated view of current British culture, all concrete towers, football and pub brawls. The questions are all there: who are we, how can we build a nation, where do our leaders come from; and should we rely on them anyway? But Mullarkey and Turner’s too-simple answers and naive presentation miss the opportunity to explore these questions in more dimensions than one. • Saint George and the Dragon is at the Olivier London, until 2 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/14/for-the-record","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:05:14Z","webTitle":"For the record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/14/for-the-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/14/for-the-record","fields":{"headline":"For the record","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"An article on antibiotics included this quote from England’s chief medical officer, Sally Davies: “In the Ganges during pilgrimage season, there are levels of antibiotics in the river that we try to achieve in the bloodstream of patients.” Dame Sally had inadvertently conflated two studies: one on bacteria levels in the Ganges and another on industrial discharges in the Hyderabad area.

Marie Conlon, 68, was found in her bedroom in West Belfast last Friday. A local councillor and detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Thursday that she had last been seen in January 2015. Ch Insp Alan Dickson said a 23-year-old man was arrested in West Belfast on Wednesday and remains in custody. Referring to the last sighting of Conlon, Dickson said: “It is our belief, supported by the medical evidence, that her death may have occurred at around this time.“Officers forced entry to her home and discovered her deceased in bed. It was apparent that she had lain undiscovered for some time.” He said postmortem examination results suggested the death may have been suspicious. “We have launched a murder investigation and a 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a number of offences, including murder.” More postmortem results were due on the remains, he said. The Sinn Féin councillor Séanna Walsh said Conlon’s family were shocked and “overwhelmed with grief”. “One of the tragedies, I suppose, of modern living is that in areas like this you don’t have the same sense of connectedness that you would have had if she had have lived in a house further into the estate,” he said. A local SDLP councillor Brian Heading said that it was tragic that someone like Conlon could fall off the community’s radar. “This is something that people need to think about; that if you don’t see your neighbour, knock on the door,” Heading said. “We don’t know all the circumstances yet, but by keeping in communication with someone there could have been a different outcome in this case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/12/us-journalist-who-broke-harvey-weinstein-story-to-get-channel-4-show","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T17:35:42Z","webTitle":"US journalist behind Harvey Weinstein story to get Channel 4 show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/12/us-journalist-who-broke-harvey-weinstein-story-to-get-channel-4-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/12/us-journalist-who-broke-harvey-weinstein-story-to-get-channel-4-show","fields":{"headline":"US journalist behind Harvey Weinstein story to get Channel 4 show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US journalist who revealed that Harvey Weinstein faced allegations of sexual abuse stretching over decades is to present a new late-night show on Channel 4.

Farrow is the son of the actor Mia Farrow and the film director Woody Allen, and used to work in the Obama administration. He is working on the new show with Madeleine Smithberg, who is one of the creators of The Daily Show in the US, which is presented by Trevor Noah. Channel 4 said the programme intended to offer a “satirical take on the UK as seen through the eyes of America”, and it wanted to build on the success of The Last Leg, which is one of the closest programmes on British television to the late-night shows in the US. The broadcaster’s entertainment division is working on the show with Soshefeigh, a Canadian production company. Ed Havard, the head of entertainment at Channel 4, said the combination of Soshefeigh, Farrow and Smithberg “taps into some of the strongest satirical and journalistic pedigree in the US, and we’re excited about the possibility of bringing that perspective to a UK audience. “This is part of our wider strategy of identifying new and emerging talent – on and off screen – who we can build satirical and topical formats around.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/12/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T20:00:13Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/12/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/12/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• We inadvertently referred to the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, in a report about Ofgem, the energy regulator (Ofcom extends energy bill cap, but MPs say more needs to be done, 12 October, page 7). • An article said that Theresa May had recently decided to raise the income threshold that triggers graduate repayment of student loans from £21,000 to £24,000.

While George is a fundamentalist, I must confess I agree with much of what he says! The problem is that, as an extremist fundamentalist, he just goes too far. Here on our rented family farm of 100 dairy cows with some beef and sheep, we are in the first year of a three-year, final-stage experiment to challenge the idea that treating our animals, land, environment and the people who work and live here with respect is somehow incompatible with financial viability and our industry’s ability to provide adequate amounts of affordable food, and is therefore unsustainable. This is the final part of a much longer-term experiment, incorporating agroecology, agroforestry and calf-with-cow dairying along with appropriate technologies that allow us to achieve these public benefit outcomes. On paper this could work. In practice it hasn’t been easy. But there are glimmers of daylight. We are on the final stretch and many of our targets have been met: substantial (90%-plus) cuts in the use of antibiotics, anthelmintics, vaccines, soluble fertiliser and pesticides (and diffuse pollution) without compromising productivity or animal health; and substantial increases in biodiversity and reductions in staff working hours. We have greatly extended the period of time the calves remain with their mothers, from 24 hours to between five and six months. This is the final challenge, but when you see something you know is right, it’s about finding ways to make it work, not giving up. So please, don’t bundle all farmers into the same pigeonhole, George. The consensus – outside of vested interests – is that there is room for meat and dairy in sustainable diets.

The only problem is that outside the Washington Beltway – DC’s version of the M25 – few people seem terribly excited about the supposed evils of Facebook, Google and co. (That’s not entirely true: lots of intellectuals and commentators not in the United States, including this columnist, are concerned about these companies, so for current purposes we can think of the “Beltway” as a metaphorical filter bubble.) But outside that bubble, life goes on. People log on to Facebook every day and use Google to find recipes or train timetables, regardless of whether these platforms might be playing a role in undermining democracy. One can see why people don’t care. Antitrust lawyers and European commissioners may be concerned about the monopoly powers of internet companies, but it’s very difficult to persuade the average internet user that s/he is being gouged by outfits whose services are free. Given that, the prospect of a popular uprising against Google and Facebook seems pretty remote. At the root of the problem posed by Google and Facebook (as regular readers of this column know only too well) is their business model, which trades free services for the right to exploit people’s personal data. In order to make this as efficient and profitable as possible, the companies have automated every aspect of their respective businesses. When you want to place ads on Facebook, for example, you never deal with a human being – unless you’re a very large advertiser indeed. Instead, you interact with a robotic interface that guides you through the process of selecting categories of user you want to target with your ads. It’s quick and helpful and all you need is your credit card. Until now, Facebook’s robot hasn’t cared who you are. So long as your credit card is valid then you’re good to go. The discovery that some of those credit-card wielders seem to have been agents of the Russian state has come as a rude shock to Facebook, which has vowed henceforth to investigate the bona fides of anyone seeking to place “political” ads. The company is also going to employ thousands of humans to ensure that bad actors don’t slip through the net and weaponise Facebook’s money-making machine. This is good PR but it doesn’t make much sense. First, a human inspection programme would have to employ humans on a Chinese-censorship scale to cope with the volume of Facebook’s ad business. This would make Facebook less efficient, slow the growth of advertising on the platform, annoy legitimate users and shareholders and cause slippage in the share price. Second, how do you decide what’s “political”? None of the complained-of Russian ads seems to have been overtly political, even though they might have had a political impact. Also, what you think is “political” depends on which filter bubble you inhabit. And here we all have a problem. As a recovering techno-utopian, I still celebrate the empowering aspect of the internet – the way it can give everyone a voice and a platform for their views. But when viewed from inside my “liberal” filter bubble, I am also distressed by the nastiness, untruthfulness and cant that flooded on to the net during the Brexit and US presidential campaigns. I see this abusive torrent as confirming my view that the technology holds up a mirror to human nature and that much of what we see reflected in it is appalling. One man who feels this sharply is the Harvard scholar Yochai Benkler. His landmark 2006 book The Wealth of Networks celebrated the democratising power of the internet. But his research on the 2016 election campaign confronted him with an uncomfortable truth. “An important part of what happened in this election,” he said afterwards to the New York Times, “is that a marginalised community, with views that were generally excluded, forced their way into the mainstream.” Was that a democratising effect or not? The answer, Benkler concluded, depended on “how much emphasis you put on people being able to contest an election versus how much you put on civil rights, protection of minorities, rule of law. You could say that if it translates into denigration of minorities, it’s antidemocratic. But as long as you are focused on the question of, ‘Do you have an intensely engaged minority able to clarify its message so clearly that it can contest politically in a way that it couldn’t before?’, then it’s a democratising effect.” Yep: you pay your money and choose your bubble."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/17/nba-2017-18-predictions-our-writers-forecast-the-winners-and-trump-baiters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T11:39:25Z","webTitle":"NBA 2017-18 predictions: our writers forecast the winners and Trump baiters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/17/nba-2017-18-predictions-our-writers-forecast-the-winners-and-trump-baiters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/17/nba-2017-18-predictions-our-writers-forecast-the-winners-and-trump-baiters","fields":{"headline":"NBA 2017-18 predictions: our writers forecast the winners and Trump baiters","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What I am most looking forward to ... Seeing how Oklahoma City will fit Paul George and Carmelo Anthony with Russell Westbrook. The Thunder have essentially rented George and Anthony for a season. Both will want the ball and while Westbrook’s reputation is as a player who craves control he also knows he must share to win – and challenge Golden State. LC The regular season is the least exciting part of the NBA calendar – with the offseason and playoffs being tied for most exciting, of course. But since the October to April portion of the season has to happen, the best part will be watching how the Sixers look with all of their young players in place. Joel Embiid, if healthy, is instantly a Top 10 player. But if he gets hurt again, the regular season officially becomes the worst part of the league. DG How the Western Conference plays out after this offseason. It’ll be intriguing to see Chris Paul and James Harden together for the Houston Rockets. It will be interesting to see if Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony combine to form a Big Three (Big Two &amp; A Half?) for the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Warriors will be the best team in the West, but the battle for No2 will be as fierce as any in recent memory. HF The Sixers’ bold bet on failure demanded patience from their fans but has paid off with a Big Three of Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz, who will finally take the court together. Whether they can stay healthy and intact could determine just how far Philly can go in a wide-open Eastern Conference. BAG What, if anything, can stop the Warriors? Remember, San Antonio were dominating the Warriors when Kawhi Leonard went down in Game 1 of the conference finals last year. Golden State are beatable, especially against a team that can challenge the Warriors shooters defensively. LC Injuries can stop the Warriors, but no one wants to see the Warriors get injured, even Cavaliers and Thunder fans. (Well, maybe.) It doesn’t seem possible, but Golden State enter this season in even better shape than last. This time last year we didn’t know how Durant would fit with all the other talent, but now we know that he fits quite well. And that he is capable of raising his game in the playoffs. The only way they lose is if LeBron and his new cast of stars straight up outplay the Warriors stars in their inevitable Finals matchup. DG The crazy part is that even with the Western Conference being as competitive at is, it’s still going to be a battle for second place for the teams that aren’t the Warriors. It’s hard to see anyone coming out of the West to block the Warriors barring an injury to Durant or Curry. That leaves it up to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who probably took a step back during the offseason. Basically, we’re looking at LeBron James having the best season of his career. Do I think that will happen? Read on. (Yes, I’ve learned to write teasers during the off-season.) HF Injuries, I guess, but Golden State managed to win 14 in a row without Durant last year before closing the show with wins in 20 of their final 22. It’s the Warriors and everybody else. BAG The biggest surprise package will be ... The Los Angeles Clippers. The West is loaded again and five or six teams will be fighting to separate from the middle of the playoff pack. The Clippers are intriguing, having lost Chris Paul but might have more chemistry and a more-balanced offense with the additions of Danilo Gallinari and Patrick Beverley. They might be the team who faces Golden State in the conference finals. LC With all of the big names finding new teams in the offseason, the Nuggets signing Paul Millsap didn’t register much. But adding the solid veteran to a nice young core of Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Gary Harris should be enough to let the Nuggets fly under the radar all the way to the fifth or sixth seed. DG I don’t really expect there to be a true Cinderella team this season. The Western Conference is too stacked for an unexpected team to push through and the Eastern Conference is too weak. That said, there’s a chance that the Utah Jazz could end up standing their ground despite losing Gordon Hayward and George Hill. It’ll take a breakout year from Rudy Gobert and the piecing together of a workable offense, but this is a defense that could throw a wrench even in the best teams’ plans. HF If Joel Embiid plays 65 games without a minutes restriction, the Sixers will challenge for a top seed in the East. BAG The best Donald Trump takedown will come from ... Draymond Green. The Warriors star forward is a good choice for any takedown. But already he has asked: “Still wondering how this guy is running our country.” It’s only a matter of time before he says more, especially since Golden State won’t be visiting the White House this year. LC While Colin Kaepernick gets all the credit for launching this era of athlete activism, it really started a few months prior to his kneeling when LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade and Chris Paul spoke at the start of the 2016 ESPYs. So I’m picking the NBA as a whole giving Trump the biggest takedown just by being itself night after night. The NBA is a league full of strong, outspoken players and it’s backed by a diverse fanbase that will only support the league more if the players fall into the president’s crosshairs. Any attacks by Trump will just show he’s powerless against the NBA. DG It’ll come from LeBron James and it won’t have anything to do with basketball. Trump will somehow cross the line further than he ever has. Maybe he goes on Twitter to brag about how much better he is than a pediatric cancer fund? To this, LeBron James simply asks the question that the vast majority of the world is thinking: “what is wrong with you, man?” It becomes the most RT’d tweet in history. HF It may have already come this week when Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, long regarded as the NBA’s most fearless political voice, called the president a “soulless coward” in a memorable broadside. But it’s early. BAG Your MVP will be ... John Wall. Many of the league’s best individual players have added big-name sidekicks this year – which means the numbers for Westbrook and James Harden will be down. Wall, the Wizards point guard, had a tremendous season last year and is just coming into his prime. Washington are the sleeper Finals contender in the East. LC Russell Westbrook won’t put up quite the same numbers with Carmelo Anthony and Paul George – nor will he have to now that he has some help. Kevin Durant and LeBron James’ candidacies will be hurt by all the star power around them, same as James Harden due to Chris Paul and vice versa. So I’ll pick John Wall, who should earn plenty of votes for one-manning the Wizards into the upper half of Eastern Conference teams. DG LeBron James. This is going to sound out there considering how good he’s been so far, but I’m betting on LeBron as having the best year of his career. Think about it: the decline years are coming, this will probably be his last year in Cleveland, he is as motivated as ever with last year’s loss to the Warriors and Kyrie Irving’s “betrayal.” Also Durant and Curry will split the votes, but mostly it’s the LeBron James On A Rampage script. HF It’s hard to remember an MVP field with this depth: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo each have a reasonable shot. But it says here San Antonio point forward Kahwi Leonard takes the final leap forward for the NBA’s top individual honor. BAG One bold prediction ... No coaches will be fired during the season. This is a bold prediction, indeed, because NBA coaches are always getting fired. But this offseason has been especially unstable with so many key players switching teams. Owners and general managers will be more patient and wait until after the season to make their coaching changes. LC The Spurs finish in the bottom half of the West. While the Rockets, Thunder and Timberwolves all made huge upgrades to their rosters, the Spurs added … Rudy Gay? All due respect to Gregg Popovich’s coaching abilities and the San Antonio system, but at some point talent matters against the top teams. But if there’s an upside of the Spurs losing more, it’s more angry Popovich tirades against the president. DG The Boston Celtics will falter early on, stumbling below .500 for the first half of the season. Expect their new players to struggle to play together as a team before stabilizing right when the “did we get the Celtics wrong?” thinkpieces start to emerge. They’ll have the best record in the second half and then go on to win exactly one game against the Cavaliers in the postseason yet again. HF The Nets had the NBA’s worst record last year but an intriguing mix of young talent including D’Angelo Russell, Caris LeVert, Allen Crabbe and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson will propel Brooklyn into the playoffs. BAG Which rookie will impress the most? Ben Simmons. Believe it or not, last year’s top rookie is a rookie again since he missed the entire season through injury. A year of building himself physically while experiencing the NBA life should make Simmons a veteran with a rookie designation this season. Finally we will see the versatility and scoring ability he promised before last season. LC Ben Simmons. The No1 overall pick of 2016 missed all of last season to injury, but has a clean bill of health now. He’ll fill the stat sheet for the Sixers. As for 2017 rookies, let’s go with Dennis Smith Jr of the Mavericks. He put up big numbers in summer league and has the starting point guard job from the get go. As for impressing with the amount of media coverage, the obvious choice is Lonzo Ball. DG Oh Lord help us: it’s going to be Lonzo Ball isn’t it? He’s going to make flashy, game-winning plays, appear on multiple Sports Illustrated covers and he’s going to keep the Los Angeles Lakers on SportsCenter despite not being that good. LaVar Ball is going to be all over the news and he’s going to spend all of his time predicting that LeBron is going to join his son in the offseason and (deep sigh) he may end up being right again. HF The Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz show will be appointment viewing, but the high-flying athleticism of the Mavericks’ Dennis Smith Jr will be the talk of the league. BAG Western Conference playoff teams Warriors, Thunder, Spurs, Rockets, Clippers, Timberwolves, Pelicans, Jazz. LC Warriors, Thunder, Rockets, Timberwolves, Spurs, Nuggets, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies. DG Warriors, Rockets, Thunder, Jazz, Spurs, Trail Blazers, Clippers, Nuggets. HF Warriors, Rockets, Thunder, Spurs, Timberwolves, Jazz, Nuggets, Clippers. BAG Eastern Conference playoff teams Celtics, Cavaliers, Wizards, Raptors, Bucks, Heat, Hornets, Sixers. LC Cavaliers, Celtics, Wizards, Sixers, Raptors, Heat, Bucks, Pistons. DG Cavaliers, Wizards, Celtics, Raptors, Bucks, Pistons, Heat, Hornets. HF Cavaliers, Wizards, Celtics, Hornets, Sixers, Raptors, Bucks, Nets. BAG Eastern Conference final Cavaliers over Wizards, 4-2. LC Cavaliers over Celtics, 4-0. DG Cavaliers over Celtics, 4-1. HF Cavaliers over Wizards, 4-3. BAG Western Conference final Warriors over Thunder, 4-1. LC Warriors over Thunder, 4-1. DG Warriors over Rockets, 4-2. HF Warriors over Thunder, 4-0. BAG NBA finals Once again, we get the Warriors and Cavs and once again Golden State wins. The Warriors have too many weapons for anyone to challenge their dominance. Even the remade Cavaliers fall short offensively. Golden State 4-2. LC The Cavaliers are better than they were last year, assuming Isaiah Thomas is 100% healthy for the playoffs. Derrick Rose, Jose Calderon, Jeff Green, Dwyane Wade, Jae Crowder, Thomas … all added to the remaining core of LeBron, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and JR Smith. Will I be surprised if the Warriors still win it all? Not at all. But don’t be shocked if this much deeper Cavs teams wins in seven. That’s my pick. DG Cleveland Cavaliers 4-3 Golden State Warriors. How the heck does this possibly happen? LeBron James caps off the best year of his career with a ridiculous Finals performance. Isaiah Thomas has the best series of his career after being outplayed by Kyrie Irving in a brief but surprisingly competitive Eastern Conference Finals. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry suffer the on-court after-effects of a “whose team is this” drama that flairs up in the Western Conference Finals, James hands Cleveland one more championship before The Decision 3.0. HF Warriors in six. The core four of Durant, Curry, Thompson and Green make Golden State as unbeatable an enterprise as we’ve seen in the NBA in some time – and that was before the shrewd off-season additions of Nick Young, Jordan Bell and Omri Casspi. The Cavs, even without Kyrie Irving, will be better equipped this time around, but it won’t be enough.

New York City property records show the 6,319 sq ft (587 sq m) penthouse with sweeping views of Central Park was sold for $26.3m less than Candy had first listed the apartment for in 2013. Candy, best known for the luxury One Hyde Park complex he developed with his brother Nick, has sold or remortgaged more than £300m of assets over the past year. The sale of the Plaza penthouse comes shortly before a high court judge is expected to rule on the brothers’ bitter legal dispute with their former friend and businessman Mark Holyoake, who is suing the Candys for £132m in damages after they fell out over a loan. A spokesman for Christian Candy did not respond to requests for comment about the timing of the sale. He bought the penthouse, which spans floors 19 to 21 of the hotel, from Andrei Vavilov, a former Russian finance minister and hedge fund manager, for $26m in 2012. Vavilov had sued the penthouse’s developer, claiming that what was sold to him as the “epitome of luxury” was little more than an “attic-like space”. The One Hyde Park developer had hoped that his makeover skills would attract a super-rich buyer to spend $59m when he first listed it in 2013. At the time, the brochure for the four-bedroom property with five bathrooms said: “The penthouse is being delivered with custom furnishings personally selected by world renowned design firm Candy &amp; Candy. They have created a contemporary New York loft-style residence in an uptown setting.” Christian Candy reduced the price to $49.9m in 2015. Previous Guardian research suggested that Christian Candy had sold, mortgaged or listed for sale eight homes and developments, including a villa on the French Riviera and a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in London with a swimming pool and staff quarters. The disposals have prompted legal letters from Holyoake. His solicitors wrote to the Candys in July threatening to ask for a court ruling to freeze their assets. Such an order would prevent the brothers from making any further disposals. However, Holyoake has yet to take any such action. The Candys, former Monaco tax exiles known as the “brothers bling” for their high-rolling lifestyles, have dismissed Holyoake’s concerns as misplaced and without foundation. They have defended the claims brought by Holyoake and expect to be successful in the case. They say their remaining assets would, after the disposals, be sufficient to cover any penalty were Holyoake to succeed. The court case has drawn in an extraordinary cast of characters, from the singer Katy Perry and the Queen’s grandchildren Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, all of whom attended Nick Candy’s wedding, to the murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who worked for an investigations firm used by the brothers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/14/old-1-pound-coins-where-spend-them","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T09:32:40Z","webTitle":"Old £1 coins: don’t get short-changed after Sunday’s switchover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/14/old-1-pound-coins-where-spend-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/14/old-1-pound-coins-where-spend-them","fields":{"headline":"Old £1 coins: don’t get short-changed after Sunday’s switchover","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British households have got rid of £60m-worth of the old “round pound” coins over the past week – but there are still more than £400m-worth still in circulation – and down the backs of sofas – with just this weekend to spend them. From midnight on Sunday the round pound will no longer be legal tender. Many retailers have made it clear they won’t take them anymore, including Sainsbury’s, M&amp;S and Lidl. But there’s no need to panic as Tesco, Aldi, Iceland and Poundland, plus lots of small retailers, say they will continue accepting them for a short period, while the big banks will let you deposit them into an account for months yet. The UK’s largest retailer, Tesco, says it will allow shoppers to pay with the coins at tills and self-service machines for an extra week. Aldi and Iceland will take them for two weeks, and Poundland will accept them until 31 October. However, you are likely to find that the coin will be useless in most coin-operated machines, so that stack in the car won’t help at the station or hospital car park. Already, some supermarket self-checkouts, such as those at Lidl, are no longer taking the old-style coins. How do you make sure you don’t get short-changed in the great coin changeover? Hopefully, this guide will help. Can I take them to the bank and change them there – and if so for how long? Most high-street banks will take old £1 coins as deposits into bank accounts, but they have different policies on how long for and whether they will exchange old coins for new. It is entirely up to individual banks, says the Royal Mint. “The current round £1 coin can continue to be deposited into a customer’s account, either business or personal, at most high-street banks including RBS, NatWest, Ulster, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander, Nationwide, Clydesdale, Yorkshire Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland,” says a spokesperson. “[But] specific arrangements, including timings and deposit amounts, may vary. It is recommended that members of the public consult with their bank directly.” Lloyds told Money it has not set a final deadline for accepting the coins, although traders wanting to deposit them must separate them from the new £1 coins. “Lloyds Banking Group [which includes Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and Halifax] has no plans to stop accepting old £1 coins. Customers can either use old £1 coins to deposit into their bank accounts or we can swap them for new ones,” said a bank spokeswoman. What about the Post Office? The Post Office will not be exchanging old £1 coins for new ones, but it has an agreement that allows anyone to deposit old coins into their high-street bank account at their local Post Office branch after 15 October until further notice. It will also be taking part in Pudsey’s Round Pound Countdown for the BBC Children In Need charity ahead of its appeal day on 17 November. Can I give old £1 coins to charity? Yes, you can continue to donate them to any charity for the foreseeable future, says the Royal Mint. Together with HM Treasury, the Royal Mint has officially partnered with Pudsey’s Round Pound Countdown campaign mentioned above, which aims to collect as many as possible before 17 November to help disadvantaged children and young people across the UK. What shops will still accept them? A lot of small shops will continue to accept your old £1 coins. The Federation of Small Businesses, a trade association representing 170,000 small shops, has advised its members to continue taking them after 15 October to provide a “useful community service” to customers. “Shopkeepers will not want to let their loyal customers down by saying they cannot pay with a round pound if they do not have any other change,” said a federation spokesperson. Poundland managing director Barry Williams has said that the move to accept old pounds for a few weeks longer was a “no-brainer”. “Providing an extra convenience for shoppers to lighten their pockets while doing the weekly shop rather than making a separate trip to the bank or Post Office will come as good news,” he said. Will I still be able to use them in trolleys, slot machines and so on? Probably not. Vending machines, slot machines, parking meters, toilet turnstiles and supermarket trolleys should all have been adapted by 15 October. “It is our understanding that the majority of coin machine operators [have made these adaptations] and are ready,” says the Royal Mint, “Industry has had a number of years to prepare for the upgrade. Many businesses have made the preparations to be ready to accept payments using the new £1 coin. However, this is a significant task and not every machine will be ready on the day of introduction.” Contrary to recent reports, both Tesco and Sainsbury’s say their trolleys will all be updated and ready by Monday. “We’ve already updated the vast majority of our trolleys and are on track to update the remainder over the coming days [before the deadline],” a Tesco spokesperson said. But it appears that machines belonging to some rail companies have not been updated. Companies including Govia Thameslink, which operates Southern, Great Northern, Gatwick Express and Thameslink, said some of their ticket machines would not be ready in time. Will my £1 trolley fob be useless? If you have a key ring fob the same size as an old, round £1 coin that fits into supermarket trolleys, then probably so. But you can now buy keyring trolley fobs the same size as the new 12-sided coin to use in future at, for example, Amazon and Ebay. Why is it being replaced anyway? The new 12-sided, bi-metal £1 coin came into circulation on 28 March as part of efforts to cut back on counterfeits. The old pound, which has been in circulation since 1983, is one of the most counterfeited coins in the world – one in 30 is a fake says the Mint. The new coin has a raft of security features."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"break-into-tech/2017/oct/17/its-not-just-coding-why-theres-more-than-one-way-to-work-in-tech","type":"article","sectionId":"break-into-tech","sectionName":"Break into tech","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"It's not just coding: why there's more than one way to work in tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/break-into-tech/2017/oct/17/its-not-just-coding-why-theres-more-than-one-way-to-work-in-tech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/break-into-tech/2017/oct/17/its-not-just-coding-why-theres-more-than-one-way-to-work-in-tech","fields":{"headline":"It's not just coding: why there's more than one way to work in tech","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As fears grow of a robot-driven jobs apocalypse in the coming decades, it is reassuring to know that the technology field offers a wealth of lucrative career opportunities even, for graduates with non-technical degrees. Jobs in technology range from the highest skilled roles, such as data scientist, algorithm developer or cybersecurity specialist, to less data-intensive work, such as repairs or support roles in sales and HR. For graduates, technology careers fall into two broad areas. First, there are the most advanced technology jobs: coding mobile apps and web pages, creating computer games or writing algorithms to interrogate data, for example. For these roles, often in specialist agencies or consultancies, candidates need an impressive portfolio of their own work, showing off the designs and apps they have created. The other category covers the exciting and futuristic areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), for which candidates tend to be very highly qualified. But there are many other roles where you don’t have to be a technical prodigy to excel. Graduates can also follow a more traditional route, working in long-established IT and business functions at big organisations. There are opportunities for those with a sharp business brain and an ability to communicate with non-specialists. “Every company needs a successful technology strategy to support their business and to have one eye on how their world might be disrupted, as well as try to guess the next big thing,” says Doug Rode, a technology specialist at recruitment consultancy PageGroup. “A lot of people come into technology support roles and this gives them business knowledge. I know of chief information officers who have worked their way up through business support and business analysis roles,” says Rode. “Companies need people who understand tech, but have a broader business understanding. The trick is translating tech issues for people without technical knowledge,” he says. A good way to develop these skills is working in a retail environment, at an Apple Genius Bar, for instance. Staff in these hi-tech stores sell and service Apple products and advise consumers on using and repairing them. Behind the scenes, staff are fixing and restoring gadgets. An Apple spokesman says the company employs 14,400 retail staff across Europe, including its “highly trained geniuses”. He says the requirements are “an ability to learn and time management”. Across Apple, 37% of new hires globally are women, and 54% of new hires in the US are from minority groups, he says. There are also jobs at other consumer technology retailers, such as Dixons Carphone’s technical service arm Team Knowhow. As Feilim Mackle, chief executive of the company’s services business, explains: “We do a very wide range of roles, everything from being on the road delivering and installing our customers’ kit, to being on the phone dealing with service enquiries, and roles that require very specific technical skills,” he says. With automation, robotics and AI forecast to affect many areas of the jobs market, including white collar roles, graduates may find that a career in technology helps them stay one step ahead of the robots."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"housing-network/2017/oct/13/social-housing-grenfell-survivors-chaotic-government","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T06:27:25Z","webTitle":"Everyone who lives in social housing needs action, not this chaos | Dawn Foster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/oct/13/social-housing-grenfell-survivors-chaotic-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/oct/13/social-housing-grenfell-survivors-chaotic-government","fields":{"headline":"Everyone who lives in social housing needs action, not this chaos","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tomorrow, 14 October, it will be four months since the Grenfell Tower fire: survivors, the bereaved and supporters of the community will observe a silent march from Notting Hill Methodist church to the shadow of the tower. Yet progress on rehousing survivors and the bereaved, and work to ensure such a tragedy can never happen again, has been painstakingly slow. After the fire, Theresa May announced that all survivors would be rehoused within six weeks. Instead, more than 17 weeks on, only 10 households have been rehomed permanently. Kensington and Chelsea council now says it hopes to rehouse every family by Christmas. The majority of survivors are still living in hotels, frustrated by the lack of communication from officials, and made to bid against each other for homes. Similarly, after migrant charities called on the government to confirm it would not seek deportation for Grenfell survivors, the government has finally confirmed that the small number of survivors with uncertain status (fewer than 20) to whom this applies will be given permanent residency, to enable them to participate fully in the inquiries that follow. At a hearing of the Commons communities select committee this week, communities secretary Sajid Javid was pressed on the slow rehousing of Grenfell survivors and reports from councils that requests for funds for fire safety work were being refused. Javid claimed that fire safety works in Nottingham, for instance, were “additional” rather than “required”. Helen Hayes, the MP for Southwark, stated she’d seen letters from housing minister Alok Sharma that contradicted this claim, and expressed concern that there would be no grant for additional fire safety works for councils and housing associations. Javid also admitted he could not guarantee that local authorities might not have to “reprioritise” work, such as repairs and maintenance, in reassessing and refitting blocks to ensure adequate fire safety. The fact that many works are now deemed inadequate is a result of the Grenfell Tower fire revealing problems within the building and fire safety systems in England and Wales. David Cameron’s onslaught on quangoes and red tape brought a huge shift in checks and balances. The Conservative response to the housing crisis was not to look at the foundations of systems across the country and consider how we had reached this situation, but to ascribe it simply to a stifling of the market. The market, the philosophy held, would solve all if only it was allowed to. And what was holding it back? Building regulations, and the requirement for more expensive fire safety methods and fire resistant materials, we were told. The result was not a boom in the number of homes built, but instead a decrease in the safety and standards of those homes. Councils have found many buildings and much retrofitting work to be unsafe – while being also squarely within building regulations and perfectly legal. After the blaze, the criticisms of the initial inquiry included the fact that it was too narrow in scope: survivors, the bereaved, the local community and many social housing tenants felt any inquiry should review the state and philosophy of social housing in the UK. May has promised such an inquiry, albeit with no timeline or detail. Instead, we’re met with a government dragging its heels on every aspect of the Grenfell Tower crisis: too slow to respond to survivors’ most basic needs, too slow to give builders and the housing sector the guidance and reappraisal on safety it needs and, for the rest of Britain, too slow to accept that social housing needs to be examined, rethought and protected. For too long, people in social housing were forgotten and denigrated, and estates were left to disintegrate under the last Labour government and every Conservative government since the 1980s. We need an urgent focus on housing, yet are met with a government in chaos: clinging to a shaky premiership, in May’s case, and preoccupied with Brexit and flatlining popularity in the polls. For survivors of Grenfell Tower, stuck in hotel rooms, this is deplorable. And for the millions of people in social housing, worried that their home isn’t safe and that the government refuses to stump up the cash to prevent more lives being lost, it isn’t good enough.

In London, the Metropolitan police are assessing a sexual abuse allegation made against Weinstein, while in his home town of New York police are carrying out a “review” looking for new complaints. Scotland Yard told the Guardian on Thursday: “The Met has been passed an allegation of sexual abuse by Merseyside police on Wednesday 11 October. The allegation will be assessed by officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command.” There is no indication the complaint relates to child abuse. Lt John Grimpel of the NYPD said in a statement: “Based on information referenced in published news reports the NYPD is conducting a review to determine if there are any additional complaints relating to the Harvey Weinstein matter. “No filed complaints have been identified as of this time and as always, the NYPD encourages anyone who may have information pertaining to this matter to call the CrimeStoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS.” Underworld star Kate Beckinsale joined the large group of women accusing Weinstein – producer of Oscar winners Shakespeare in Love, The Artist and The English Patient, and patron to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh – of inappropriate conduct on Thursday in a deeply personal Instagram post. The British actor, who starred in several Weinstein Company films, recalled her first meeting with the producer when she was 17. Like more than a dozen of the women who have now come forward to speak on Weinstein’s pattern of inappropriate behavior, she recalls being sent to his hotel room for a business meeting where he greeted her in a bathrobe. “A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realized he couldn’t remember if he had assaulted me or not,” Beckinsale wrote in the post. Beckinsale concluded her post with a plea to the industry: “Let’s stop allowing our young women to be sexual cannon fodder, and let’s remember that Harvey is an emblem of a system that is sick, and that we have work to do.” Beckinsale follows a string of other high-profile actors, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Léa Seydoux and Cara Delevingne, who have accused the producer of sexual harassment or assault. Three women have accused Weinstein of rape. Weinstein has said many of the details of those public accounts are inaccurate, and has denied accusations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault. Sallie Hofmeister, a spokeswoman for Weinstein, said on Tuesday: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein … With respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.” In a statement issued on Wednesday in response to his wife’s decision to leave him following the allegations, Weinstein said: “I support her decision, I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild. Over the last week, there has been a lot of pain for my family that I take responsibility for.” He was reported to be heading for treatment in Arizona. Before he left, Weinstein told photographers in LA: “Guys, I’m not doing OK but I’m trying. I gotta get help … You know, we all make mistakes … second chance I hope.” But he added: “And you know what? I’ve always been loyal to you guys,” he told the paparazzi photographers who captured his remarks, adding “not like those fucking pricks who treat you like shit. I’ve been the good guy.” As pressure grew on Hollywood celebrities to explain what they had known about Weinstein’s alleged conduct over a period of decades, Jane Fonda said she had been told about accusations against him last year, and regretted not speaking out about them. “I wish I had spoken out,” the Oscar winner told the BBC. “I will admit I should have been braver, I think from now on I will be when I hear such stories. “I think it’s because if I had I would have had to out someone that wasn’t prepared to speak out. She subsequently has. If it had happened to me I would now.” The NYPD’s reference to “additional complaints” may relate to the March 2015 case in which Filipina-Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez accused Weinstein of groping her breasts and putting his hand up her skirt during a meeting at his office. She filed a complaint with the NYPD, and the next night met with Weinstein again, supported by an NYPD undercover operation and while wearing a wire, according to the New Yorker, recording the producer appearing to confess to groping her. The NYPD said it investigated a misdemeanor sexual abuse complaint against Weinstein and the case was referred to the Manhattan district attorney’s office. The office decided not to file charges. Questioned about that decision at a public appearance in New York on Wednesday, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, said: “It’s obviously sickening. But at the end of the day we operate in a courtroom of law, not the court of public opinion, and our sex crime prosecutors made a determination that this was not going to be a provable case.” The International Business Times has reported that David Boies, a prominent defense attorney who has represented Weinstein’s company, though was not doing so at the time of the alleged groping incident, donated $10,000 to Vance – an elected official – in 2015, after the alleged incident. NYPD officials denied published reports that they were investigating a specific 2004 incident involving Weinstein, calling that claim “inaccurate”. Meanwhile the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it would hold a special meeting on Saturday to discuss allegations against Weinstein, as speculation grew that it would follow the lead of its British equivalent, Bafta, in suspending his membership. “The Academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents,” it said in a statement. Weinstein could face five to 25 years in prison on sexual assault charges if the latest abuse allegations are tried in criminal court, legal experts told the Guardian. Specifically, the claims described by Lucia Evans, a former aspiring actor, rise to the level of a felony rape under New York laws. Because a criminal conviction could be difficult to achieve, however, prosecutors may be reluctant to file criminal charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/12/black-swan-best-restaurant-world-head-chef-people-like-chilled-out","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T18:47:38Z","webTitle":"Black Swan head chef: 'I think people like that we're quite chilled out'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/12/black-swan-best-restaurant-world-head-chef-people-like-chilled-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/12/black-swan-best-restaurant-world-head-chef-people-like-chilled-out","fields":{"headline":"Black Swan head chef: 'I think people like that we're quite chilled out'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Black Swan in the village of Oldstead on the edge of the North York Moors isn’t exactly what you’d expect of “the best restaurant in the world”.

But in an annual tally of millions of customer reviews on the travel website TripAdvisor, the Black Swan came out with the best average rating, making it the first British restaurant to top the list. On Thursday, the phones in the family-run business were ringing off the hook. The restaurant, with its Michelin star and four AA rosettes, is normally in demand, taking around 25 bookings a day. But by Thursday afternoon it had taken more than 1,000 calls in 24 hours. “The best restaurant in the world is a funny thing, isn’t it?” said Tommy Banks, the restaurant’s head chef. “It’s not a real thing. It’s so subjective.” The 28-year-old said that despite the sneering from some on Twitter, the accolade from TripAdvisor was especially meaningful to him because it was based on reviews by real customers. “The great thing about this award is that it’s not just about the food,” he said. “When people leave you a TripAdvisor review, they’re reviewing everything, and I think they like the fact that we’re quite chilled out, quite friendly people.” Farmers Tom and Anne Banks bought the pub in 2006, and their sons Tommy and James, aged 17 and 19 at the time, were put in charge. Seven years later, Tommy – who may be familiar to viewers of The Great British Menu – became the youngest recipient of a Michelin star. Oldstead is made up of a handful of cottages, and is a 15-minute drive down a single track lane. Most of the restaurant’s guests travel there specially, with many staying in the guest rooms. Behind the picturesque building, with its tiny kitchen designed for cooking “chicken in a basket and microwave meals”, according to Tommy, are three acres of farmland, on which the majority of the ingredients for the restaurant’s dishes are grown. A taster menu of around 12 courses will set you back £95, which includes a £50 deposit. Tommy conceded that, like other Michelin-starred restaurants, the prices were high, but said the cost of running the restaurant, farm and guest rooms with the help of 40-odd staff meant they could not charge less. On Thursday evening, the taster menu starts with a delicate celery and walnut tart with caramelised cream, and works its way through a course of rare local beef (from cows who reportedly drink four pints of beer a day) and a serving of beetroot cooked for four hours in beef fat and decorated with goats’ curd. Each dish is unusual, subtle, interesting and utterly delicious. The simple restaurant room, with its locally made furniture, overlooks fields of crops, and figures can be seen among the rows of vegetables as the light fades. Tommy and James make their way between the candlelit tables to explain each dish to customers. The experience is set apart by its calm and comfortable atmosphere. Asked what made a brilliant restaurant, Tommy said it was important that it offered “something you’ve not had before”. He said some of his best food experiences had been at the Fat Duck, Heston Blumenthal’s restaurant in Bray, Berkshire (which came 12th in the TripAdvisor list), and Fäviken in Åre, Sweden. “I feel [Fäviken] is a kindred spirit because it’s in the middle of nowhere – really in the middle of nowhere. We’re almost metropolitan in comparison.” Although Tommy said he would consider opening another restaurant – possibly in York – he is committed to the Black Swan, and to staying in the area where he was born and raised. “This place isn’t going anywhere,” he said, gesturing to the pub around him. “We’re just going to keep making it better and better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/12/pressure-grows-to-make-universal-credit-helpline-free-of-charge","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T16:59:42Z","webTitle":"Pressure grows to make universal credit helpline free of charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/12/pressure-grows-to-make-universal-credit-helpline-free-of-charge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/12/pressure-grows-to-make-universal-credit-helpline-free-of-charge","fields":{"headline":"Pressure grows to make universal credit helpline free of charge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pressure is growing on ministers to make calls to the universal credit helpline free, after it was revealed that low-income claimants could be paying up to 55p a minute for calls to fix problems with their claim. Campaigners want charges dropped as more evidence emerged of claimants being forced to spend long periods waiting on the phone to resolve issues, and often having to make a number of calls. There are also concerns that poor training of call centre staff and underlying problems with the complex universal credit system are contributing to long waiting times. The chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, Frank Field MP, called for the universal credit helpline to be moved to an 0800 number. “The country will be flabbergasted that people without any money at all should be expected to pay for a call to try and gain some help,” he said. The government needed to “iron out difficulties with telephone costs before they blast the poor to bits”. One Department for Work and Pensions employee, who spent eight months managing a team of staff answering calls from universal credit claimants in one of the trial areas, said workers struggled to stay on top of the volume of calls, and often failed to answer queries within the required time period, causing claimants to call back to chase problems. “The work was backing up, and the calls piled up. Sometimes I felt terrified and exasperated for them, sometimes we were shrugging our shoulders. We were doing everything we could, running overtime, trying to break down the outstanding work,” he said. The employee, who asked not to be named, was concerned about the length of time clients were put on hold. He said this was often because staff had not been properly trained, so were “looking round the systems trying to find the information that could be needed”. “The issue is that there aren’t enough people on the phones who know the system well,” he said. Campaigners say official guidance supports switching a government helpline to a free 0800 number – which would transfer the cost of the call to the DWP – when callers are likely to be vulnerable and on low incomes. Cabinet Office guidance published in 2013 states: “‘Free to call’ numbers [080] can be considered in certain circumstances, for example where a department provides a service to callers who are likely to be part of a vulnerable or low-income group, particularly when the typical call duration is long and could result in substantial charges.” David Hickson of the Fair Telecoms campaign group said the helpline should be offered as an 0800 number for initial claims, in line with other DWP customer phone lines. “Until universal credit has completed its pilot phase and the system is working as smoothly as other benefits, the 0800 number should be available for inquiries at all stages. This is what is demanded by the Cabinet Office guidance, which we campaigned to secure.” The majority of calls to the current 0345 universal credit helpline will be free because they are covered by inclusive call plans, but callers who have exceeded their monthly call allowance incur charges on a mobile of up to 55p a minute, depending on the network provider. A survey by Citizen’s Advice in England in the summer found the average waiting time was 39 minutes, and claimants often had to make multiple calls. Almost a third of survey respondents in full service universal credit areas said they made more than 10 calls to the helpline. The DWP said its staff worked hard to answer calls as quickly as possible, and to resolve queries during the first call whenever possible. It said callers could request a return call if they were concerned about the cost. Several claimants told the Guardian that they were not given this option. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, raised the cost of accessing the universal credit helpline at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, calling on Theresa May to “show some humanity” to claimants. Helpline costs have become an issue because of the difficulties many users have in getting through to officials to fix myriad problems with their claim, including under and over-payments, lost claims, wrongly-cancelled claims, and to report changes in their personal circumstances. Although universal credit is a digital-by-default service, and claimants are expected to carry out transactions online, many vulnerable or disabled users turn to the helpline because of difficulties in accessing the internet or operating their online journal. The issue of helpline call charges and waiting times came up frequently in a Guardian investigation into claimants’ experience of universal credit published last week. One claimant reported: “Not only does it cost money to get through, my maximum [call length] has been just shy of an hour. Not great when you can’t buy a tin of beans to keep you alive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/12/shoe-colour-question-could-put-2015-dress-debate-in-the-shade","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T15:58:10Z","webTitle":"Shoe colour question could put 2015 dress debate in the shade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/12/shoe-colour-question-could-put-2015-dress-debate-in-the-shade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/12/shoe-colour-question-could-put-2015-dress-debate-in-the-shade","fields":{"headline":"Shoe colour question could put 2015 dress debate in the shade","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was one of the most fractious debates in modern times – by 2015’s standards, at least. Now a new argument has erupted that has shades of the blue/white dress controversy. Many people on social media sites are arguing whether the picture below shows a turquoise and grey shoe, or a pink and white one. It is a hotly contested debate with understandably strong views on both sides. But the truth is, those suggesting it is blue and grey are spreading fake news. An original, unmanipulated image makes clear the footwear is really pink and white. That does not explain, however, why some people have described beginning to see the edited, grey image as increasingly pink over time. Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist at the National Eye Institute in the US, explained that it was because people’s brains were trying to separate what they identified as colour cast by the source of light from that reflected by the surface they were looking at. “Basically, your visual system is constantly trying to colour-correct the images projected on the retina, to remove the colour contamination introduced by the spectral bias in the light source,” he said. “The sky is blue, but everything you see under a blue sky isn’t blue. This is because your visual system is pretty darn good at figuring out what part of the light that you’re seeing is caused by the light source, and what part is caused by the surfaces themselves. We only really care about the surfaces – this is the part of the light that tells us about objects. The color of the light itself is usually pretty meaningless.” Conway said the debate was similar to the famous one over the dress because they were both related to issues of colour constancy. The manipulated photograph, he explained, had a lot of the turquoise cast over the whole image. “When you first look at it, after having looked at the pink version, your visual system is still adapted to the lighting conditions of the pink version and so you see the turquoise in the other version, and you attribute this to the shoe itself. “But, after a while, your visual system adapts to the turquoise across the whole of that image and interprets it as part of the light source, eventually discounting it and restoring the shoe to the original pink version – or, at least, pinker.” He said people could reset their visual systems, and see the shoe again as turquoise, by looking back at the original photo, or even just by looking around the room, as long as it was not illuminated with a turquoise light. “Everyone has a very strong prior belief that shoelaces are white. So when your visual system sees the manipulated photograph, where the shoe laces are a weird turquoise, it then subtracts that colour from the rest of the scene, restoring the canvas of the shoe to pink,” he said. “In the original photograph the human hand is clearly a normal colour, whereas in the other photograph it is clearly weird. So when your visual system sees the weirdly lit hand, it tells your brain ‘hang on, the colour of the light must be kinda funny, fix it!’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"break-into-tech/2017/oct/17/why-you-need-to-get-into-the-tech-sector-and-how-to-do-it","type":"article","sectionId":"break-into-tech","sectionName":"Break into tech","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Why you need to get into the tech sector (and how to do it)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/break-into-tech/2017/oct/17/why-you-need-to-get-into-the-tech-sector-and-how-to-do-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/break-into-tech/2017/oct/17/why-you-need-to-get-into-the-tech-sector-and-how-to-do-it","fields":{"headline":"Why you need to get into the tech sector (and how to do it)","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Discovering cleaner forms of energy, finding new ways to beat hackers, designing the next generation of video games: a career in tech is full of possibilities. Technology is fast-moving, endlessly innovative, financially rewarding – and you don’t even necessarily have to be “technical” to make your mark. “We are employing in just about every segment across our business – everything from marketers to product developers, as well as technical roles,” says Alan Laing, managing director UK and Ireland at Sage, a British software company that employs about 13,000 people worldwide. “I’ve never seen a better time to get into tech. There’s more opportunity and more chance to apply creativity, technical excellence and multiple different skill sets to the opportunities out there than ever before. The tech industry is going to employ more creative people in the next two years than any other industry.” But the industry needs new blood: a recent study from the British Chamber of Commerce found that three out of four UK businesses reported a digital skills shortage. This means salaries for the right people are going up. According to the Tech Nation Survey 2017, the average salary in tech is now just over £50,000 – 44% higher than non-digital jobs. What’s the best way in? There are multiple routes: a degree and postgraduate study, for example, are essential for some roles. Sam Cooper, 24, is in the final year of his PhD in cancer research at the Institute of Cancer Research, Imperial College London, where his work is funded by Stand Up To Cancer, a joint national fundraising campaign from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4. “I’m using artificial intelligence (AI) to try and improve the way in which we treat and diagnose cancer,” he says. “There’s a huge amount of excitement in AI at the moment. Having spent decades playing games, doing cool things with pictures and toying around in simulated worlds, it feels like the field is finding a deeper purpose and tackling several massive challenges facing humanity.” Many companies are also realising the value of apprenticeships. These are available at levels ranging from NVQ Level 2 right up to honours degrees and beyond. “The new degree apprenticeships, in particular, are really set to shake up the way we bring people into industry,” says Colin Bannister, head of presales, northern EMEA, at global tech company VMware. “You can get a recognised degree without any of the debt and, in the intervening period, work and earn a salary.” Daniel Burton, 19, is currently undertaking an apprenticeship at hospitality IT specialist Lolly. He spends three days a week testing products and software at Lolly. The other two days are focused on programming and development. “The team at Lolly have really encouraged me and put so much trust in my work, which has really helped with my own self confidence,” says Burton. “This role has really cemented my thinking that I would like a job in IT. I love the work I am doing, and believe it will really help to support my future within the IT sector.” Go for a career in tech, says Bannister, and you’ll find a sector ripe with opportunities for everyone. “This is about transforming businesses, not just about coding,” he says. “Every single industry is being either disrupted, enhanced or changed by technology. It’s a fabulous time to be entering the sector, as it is so relevant to every industry, bar none.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/harvey-weinstein-hollywood-white-men","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T18:10:51Z","webTitle":"Anything’s possible in America – even a Harvey Weinstein comeback | Emma Brockes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/harvey-weinstein-hollywood-white-men","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/harvey-weinstein-hollywood-white-men","fields":{"headline":"Anything’s possible in America – even a Harvey Weinstein comeback","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The cycle of public transgression, humiliation, apology and rehabilitation is nowhere better exemplified than in the case of Kathy Griffin, the US comedian who got into trouble earlier this year for holding up a model of Donald Trump’s severed head. She had her TV appearances cancelled, apologised profusely, backed away from her apology when it all blew over, and is now back to doing Trump jokes again. So it goes. The question of whether the joke was acceptable is, of course, beside the point. What mattered was the clockwork predictability of how the “scandal” played out, and the stages through which Griffin moved: from offender (“I went too far”), to victim (“The death threats that I’m getting are constant and detailed”), to defiant survivor in the face of unjustified attacks (“I am no longer sorry”). Griffin’s attorney during the mess was Lisa Bloom, lately adviser to Harvey Weinstein, until sense got the better of her, and as more women step forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault, we see him attempt to kickstart the same machinery. The language Weinstein used in his statement, superficially claiming responsibility for his actions, sought to present himself as a victim of forces beyond his control. “I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild,” he said. “When I am better” is a nice touch. It’s not me – it’s my helpless addiction to being a jerk. He took a similar line in a private email to other Hollywood players unearthed by the New York Times. “All I’m asking is let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counselling,” begged Weinstein, and perhaps therapy would help him. But really, who cares? There is almost nothing in American public life from which you can’t come back: Mel Gibson is on the awards circuit again; accusations of molestation haven’t hurt Trump. Weinstein may have a tougher time given the weight of allegations against him, but let’s see. Powerful white men don’t tend to stay out in the cold very long. Not me, guv Part of the fallout from Weinstein is the amazing domino effect of big names being dragged into the imbroglio. Along with Ben Affleck’s pivot from condemning Weinstein to smartly apologising for his own inappropriate behaviour, Jessica Chastain leapt to the defence of Matt Damon – accused of coming to Weinstein’s aid in the suppression of a New York Times story many years ago, not entirely fairly, it seems – with the inadvertently comic tweet: “I’ve spent time with him on The Martian and he’s a really good guy.” As silence is the determining factor in so much sexual abuse, there is understandable dismay at the number of Weinstein beneficiaries declining to comment. But there is also, in the rush to judgment, an awkward need on the part of many movie stars to excuse all the back-slapping photos of them grinning on a podium beside Weinstein. “I can tell you that I’ve never seen any of this behaviour – ever,” George Clooney told the Daily Beast. Well, no. In other quarters, the constant recalibration of celebrities in the credit/debit columns rearranges itself around the scandal. Brad Pitt, lately painted in his divorce with Angelina Jolie as erratic and unreasonable, is suddenly a great guy again for fronting up to Weinstein when Gwyneth Paltrow, his then girlfriend, reported being propositioned by him. Meanwhile, the deadening familiarity of more women coming forward. Many of the alleged victims are the wealthiest, most powerful women in the world, even if they weren’t at the time of the alleged assaults, and yet the shame and fear are such that it has taken them decades to speak up. And this is how it goes, too. Friends in low places The game of Who Knew will go on for some time. Among those refusing to play is Lorne Michaels, legendary creator of Saturday Night Live, who in response to reporters asking why he nixed jokes about Weinstein on the show this week, said with gruesome honesty and the clanking sound of ranks closing: “It’s a New York thing.” • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/15/dirty-laundry-claybody-theatre-stoke-powerful-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Dirty Laundry review – dark truths unearthed in the Potteries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/15/dirty-laundry-claybody-theatre-stoke-powerful-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/15/dirty-laundry-claybody-theatre-stoke-powerful-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Dirty Laundry review – dark truths unearthed in the Potteries","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The title of Deborah McAndrew’s new play for Claybody Theatre is charged with multiple meanings. In 1950s Stoke, pottery worker Nora knows not to hang out the washing if the bottle kilns are firing – the air will be filthy. She knows when the cloths stained with the blood her dying father coughs from “potter’s rot” lungs are beyond washing. Nora also knows not to pass on to well-meaning but nosy neighbour Frances the name her father deliriously repeats: “Emeline”. The family dirty laundry Nora begins to suspect exists is, though, more than a domestic issue. It’s the reason why Nora’s former foreman father receives visits not only from the hardworking local doctor (concerned Robin Simpson) but also from the factory’s owner (suave Philip Wright) and a local politician (bluff-to-blustery Jason Furnival). Although Dawn Allsopp’s set and costumes underline the fact that McAndrew’s action is set in the past, the environmental, political, medical and economic issues that trouble her characters continue to affect much of the world today. Time collapses. We are in the yard of the old Spode works, once the site of artistic industry, now a space shared by cultural industries and charities. Tonight, its sky-open yards and brick walls are transformed by community actors into bustling streets. Promenading towards our destination, we, the audience, become an invisible presence in this returned-to-life world. A box-set faces ranked seating, taking up barely half of this former factory workroom. It has the feel of a TV studio (though, probably, rather darker and colder). McAndrew’s text comes across as part-soap opera, part-Ibsen, with its details of daily life, resurgent past reconfiguring the present, and metaphor of private life as a focus of wider society. Under Conrad Nelson’s clear direction, Rosie Abraham’s Nora and Angela Bain’s Frances are powerful linchpin characters in this atmospheric drama. The complexities of site-specific performance and community engagement mean opening nights are often not quite fully glazed (in comparison with traditional productions). Hence, three stars for the press-night performance.

Those who decline the jab will have to tell the NHS trust that employs them why, and it will have to record their reasons, as part of a bid to drive up what the NHS admits are “disappointing” staff take-up rates. The move comes as the chairman of NHS England admitted on Thursday that health service chiefs were “more scared than we have ever been” about how bad winter could be. There is a strong likelihood of hospitals being inundated with flu sufferers, Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said. The prospect of a flu epidemic presented a real crisis, added Grant. NHS leaders are seriously concerned that Britain could be hit by its biggest flu outbreak in years this winter. There is acute anxiety because Australia and New Zealand have been experiencing their worst flu season for many years with struggling to cope. NHS bosses have got tough on staff’s jab uptake as part of a new series of “intensified cross-NHS winter preparations” in a bid to reduce the estimated 8,000 annual deaths from flu in England and Wales. They are sending out letters to healthcare workers across England urging them to get vaccinated as soon as possible, to reduce the risk of them passing on the flu virus to vulnerable patients, especially older people and those with breathing problems such as asthma, pneumonia and emphysema. It is staff’s professional duty to have the jab, they say. The letter says: “As winter approaches it is worth reminding ourselves that flu can have serious and even fatal consequences. “Healthcare workers, as members of the general population, are susceptible to flu. When coupled with the potential for a third of flu cases being transmitted by asymptomatic individuals, it means patients are at particular risk.” Although a record proportion of NHS staff received the jab last year – 63% – in some trusts as few as 20% of staff took up the offer of free vaccination at work. In another previously unused tactic, NHS England bosses are writing to all 234 NHS trusts telling them to do much more to ensure staff have the jab. “We require each NHS organisation to ensure that each and every eligible member of staff is personally offered the flu vaccine, and then either signs the consent form or states if they decline to do so,” that letter says. Grant, speaking at the national children and adult services conference in Bournemouth, said: “We face winter better prepared than we have ever been, but more scared than we have ever been. “We have the strong likelihood of hospitals being inundated with people suffering flu.” The NHS is expanding its £237m winter flu campaign by offering free vaccination for the first time to over 1 million people who work in care homes, at a cost of £10m, and also to the 670,000 eight- and nine-year-old pupils in school year four. Those aged two, three and four will be offered a flu vaccination in the form of a nasal spray rather than an injection, however. In all, 21 million people in England will be offered free immunisation on the NHS. They include pregnant women and anyone over 65 and anyone deemed at clinical risk, for example due to asthma. “This move to help keep care workers stay well during flu season is a really positive step by the NHS. Not only will it help to protect thousands of care home residents from getting sick, but it sends a strong signal about the importance of social care staff in providing an integrated health and care service,” said Imelda Redmond, the national director of the campaign group Healthwatch England. Last winter, 133 people died as a direct result of flu after being treated in an intensive care or high-dependency unit in England, Public Health England said. The NHS has also responded to the widespread shortage of A&amp;E doctors by deciding to expand the number of doctors training to become specialists in emergency medicine from 300 to 400 a year for four years from next year. Currently, about 6,300 different grades of medics work in A&amp;E units across England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/16/when-good-tv-goes-bad-house-of-cards","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: how House of Cards came tumbling down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/16/when-good-tv-goes-bad-house-of-cards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/16/when-good-tv-goes-bad-house-of-cards","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: how House of Cards came tumbling down","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When House of Cards first premiered on Netflix in 2013, the biggest story in American politics was that nothing was happening – that Congress, gridlocked over the budget of President Obama, was stuck in a frustrating state of paralysis. By comparison, the show was a parallel universe in which Washington, so mundane in reality, became the domain of snakes and raptors, of machiavellian masterminds epitomised by Democratic congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the house majority whip with ambitions of absolute power. Moodily lit and beautifully shot, it was still always considerably trashier than it looked, but none the worse for it, full of ridiculous dialogue and knowing hyperbole. But not since The West Wing had politics looked so possible, politicians so impressively full of agency. In the words of Obama himself: “Man, this guy’s getting a lot of stuff done.” House of Cards has always thrived upon topicality. Its third, Russia-centric series riffed upon the homophobic policies of Vladimir Putin; its fourth gave Frank a scandal involving the KKK. Season five had him calling for a travel ban, and also saw his wife, Robin Wright’s Claire, attain power – obviously banking on a Hillary Clinton administration. But yes: in recent years, its outrageous portrayal of American politics doesn’t seem so outrageous any more. If anything, House of Cards has found itself in the impossible position of not being stupid enough to compete with Donald Trump (Claire becoming vice president, despite having no political experience, suddenly seems tame), and yet being too frivolous for the alarming times we live in. In spite of all these factors, however, House of Cards didn’t ultimately crumble because of context. It was simply text: at the end of season two, Frank Underwood became president and – after the novelty wore off in series three – the show seemingly had nowhere to go. No longer was Frank thrillingly attacking, but stuck in defence, limited by his office, doomed to repetition. Here comes Frank, yet again, with a scheme that makes no sense; there goes Claire, yet again, testing the limits of nepotism; welcome back Doug Stamper, here to brood, relapse and hit someone? Cool; and let’s not forget everyone’s favourite writer, Tom Yates, the live-in lover of Claire who just … sits around a lot? Worse than all that, though, was that the show had lost its edge, its wit, its dark sense of fun; it didn’t even break the fourth wall that much any more. It was still ludicrous, of course, but in a much more earnest, straightforward way. It asked viewers to believe in Frank and Claire, to take seriously what they were doing, which was difficult, considering that by this time their motivations had grown vague, the show had lost interest in them as people and they were nowhere near as smart as the scripts thought they were. Hark at the great political operator Frank Underwood, for example, whose grand solution to a problem in season five is to push his secretary of state down some stairs. Even Donald Trump isn’t that stupid. Probably."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/12/wellbeing-enhanced-more-by-places-than-objects-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T14:30:55Z","webTitle":"Wellbeing enhanced more by places than objects, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/12/wellbeing-enhanced-more-by-places-than-objects-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/12/wellbeing-enhanced-more-by-places-than-objects-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Wellbeing enhanced more by places than objects, study finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The poet WHAuden is credited with first coining the word “topophilia” to describe a strong emotional pull to a special place. Now scientific research, using cutting-edge brain imaging, suggests Auden was on to something. According to a study commissioned by the National Trust, people experience intense feelings of wellbeing, contentment and belonging from places that evoke positive memories far more than treasured objects such as photographs or wedding rings. A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study commissioned by the NT set out to “understand this visceral but intangible feeling more deeply”. The NT report, Places That Make Us, commissioned Surrey University academics and research experts to conduct fMRI scans as well as in-depth interviews with volunteers, and an online survey of 2,000 people, about their special places. “Working with leading researchers and academics, and using cutting-edge fMRI brain technology, we examined how places affect people, how they become special and why we feel a pull towards them,” said Nino Strachey, head of research for the NT. It found places that are intensely meaningful invoke a sense of calm, space to think and a feeling of completeness. Researchers measured 20 volunteers’ brain activity as they were shown pictures of landscapes, houses, other locations and personally meaningful objects. Places, rather than objects, with strong personal ties caused their brains to get the most excited. Specifically, an area of the brain associated with emotional responses, the amygdala, was fired up. “Therefore, we can conclude that significant places more likely contain greater emotional importance than objects, as areas in our brain involved in emotional processing respond more strongly to significant places,” the report states. “fMRI opens a window into the brain allowing us to explore automatic and hard to verbalise emotional responses,” said Bertram Opiz, professor in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Surrey and the Cubic fMRI facility, who conducted the tests. Volunteers looked at images of 10 places and 10 objects meaningful to them. Ten images of everyday places and objects, and 10 positive and 10 negative images that had been quantified for their emotional content were also shown. Each image was presented three times. Three response areas were identified, the left amygdala, which plays a key area in the automatic processing of emotion, the medial prefrontal cortex, which evaluates a positive or negative emotion, and the parahippocampal place area, which responds to personally relevant place. Volunteers were interviewed in depth twice – once at home and once at the location of their special place. The research showed favourite places stimulated a feeling of belonging, of being physically and emotionally safe, and of a strong internal pull to the place. The majority of those questioned (86%) agreed “this place is part of me”, while 60% felt “I feel safe here” and 79% described “I’m drawn here by a magnetic pull”. It found the brain’s emotional response to special places was much higher than towards meaningful objects. Two thirds of those surveyed (64%) said their special place made them feel calm, while 53% said it provided an escape from everyday life. Among younger people, 67% said their meaningful place had shaped who they were. Dr Andy Myers, consultant on the research, said: “For the first time we have been able to prove the physical and emotional benefits of place, far beyond any research that has been done before. “With meaningful places generating a significant response in areas of the brain known to process emotion, it’s exciting to understand how deep-rooted this connection truly is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/torture-survivors-uk-detention-centres-home-office-high-court-ruling","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T15:05:22Z","webTitle":"I sought refuge from torture in the UK.

Only to be locked up again","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I am a torture survivor who was once wrongly detained by the Home Office. So when I read that the high court has ruled that, by meddling with the torture definition and imprisoning survivors, the Home Office had acted unlawfully, I was shocked and relieved. In September 2016 the Home Office introduced an “adults at risk” policy that redefined torture to exclude torture committed by non-state actors like rebel forces or other armed groups. They then used this policy to lock up survivors who were tortured in these circumstances. I came to the UK over 10 years ago after enduring months of torture. I don’t feel safe naming the country I am from, but what I can say is that it was in Africa. I didn’t know where I was going when I managed to escape. I arrived in the UK with a dislocated knee, sustained while escaping my torturers, and claimed asylum on arrival. I immediately found myself in Harmondsworth immigration detention centre. Detention in any form is a living hell for people like me. Back then I was in the detained fast track system, set up by the government to detain asylum applicants whose cases they believed could be determined quickly. Back then the Home Office’s own policies stated that torture survivors should be excluded from detention. I was taken to a small room. I still remember the sound of clinking keys and far-off voices laughing. My head was spinning. I couldn’t understand what was happening. Flashbacks of the torture I had escaped came back immediately. I was scared that it would start all over again. It made me suicidal. I became paranoid and started hallucinating. On the day of my asylum interview, the Home Office official, with no explanation or charge against me, put me into detention. He told me: “We are taking you to a safe place where you will be given a phone card to contact people back home. You will be given food and you can see a doctor.” Five minutes later I was handcuffed like a criminal and taken to Harmondsworth. On my second day there, the doctor gave me antidepressants. I was allocated a solicitor who saw that I was in a bad state. I was beginning to feel that my life was not worth living. My solicitor referred me to the charity Freedom from Torture for help. Two days later I had a Home Office interview that to me felt like an interrogation. After the interview, I was back in Harmondsworth. I heard the noise of keys as the officers came for me. They opened the door and asked me to follow them. The idea that I might be put on a plane to return home began to sink in. Each step for me felt like suffering falaka – the method of torture I had endured that involved hitting the soles of my feet with heavy rubber each time I could not answer a question. I was shaking and I could not speak. Three weeks later, I was released. Shortly afterwards, I started clinical treatment at Freedom from Torture, but even now that I have permission to stay in the UK, and am working professionally and closely involved with various human rights organisations, I still worry that immigration control will come for me, that they will lock me up. I regularly have nightmares, magnified by the time I spent in Harmondsworth. And these fears return each time I hear its name. Things are supposed to have changed for the better in more recent years. The detained fast track was abolished because the courts found it so unfair. As home secretary, Theresa May commissioned the Shaw review to strengthen safeguards against the detention of vulnerable people, including torture survivors. Survivors Speak Out, a network of former clients of Freedom from Torture that I co-founded, contributed to this review, calling for more effective safeguards to prevent survivors from being detained. We hoped that it would mark an end to the trauma of detention that torture survivors like me experienced in the UK. But instead the Home Office released their “adults at risk” policy, which made it easier for officials to detain torture survivors – and harder for doctors and lawyers to secure our release. If you can try to imagine the long-term impact of detention on torture survivors, then you’ll understand how sad it is for us that our calls fell on deaf ears. It is painful to think that others continue to face what we have. So we welcome the high court judgment, in response to a challenge brought by seven victims of torture in conjunction with Medical Justice, but now it needs to be acted on. As well as fixing its flawed policy and restoring the wider definition of torture to recognise torture by non-state actors, the Home Office should deliver other reforms to protect torture survivors from detention, including access to independent heath assessments and good legal advice. Frontline staff in detention centres must also be trained to identify signs of trauma in order to release survivors of torture from detention without delay. Furthermore, any independent medical evidence of torture must also be properly taken into account to ensure quality decisions on asylum claims. And crucially, survivors of torture must be immediately referred to specialist organisations who can help them to come to terms with their past. Torture survivors like me should never have been locked up. On the one hand, the government itself admits that immigration detention is unsuitable for torture survivors, while on the other hand it creates policies that increase the risk of this happening. Hopefully this judgment by the high court will put a stop to this absurdity once and for all. It may not have been physical torture in Harmondsworth, but for me and many others, it was mental torture of a kind you cannot imagine. • Serge Eric is a survivor of torture, and co-founder of Survivors Speak OUT"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/13/10-best-things-this-week-remembering-george-michael","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"The 10 best things to do this week: remembering George Michael","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/13/10-best-things-this-week-remembering-george-michael","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/13/10-best-things-this-week-remembering-george-michael","fields":{"headline":"The 10 best things to do this week: remembering George Michael","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Music Jessie Ware After a three-year gap, dinner-party favourite Jessie Ware is back with more sophisticated hush-pop in the shape of Glasshouse.

The pound dropped abruptly when Michel Barnier announced that all they had achieved was a “very disturbing state of deadlock” over money. With it should go the hopes of millions of citizens stranded on either side of the Channel who were promised early guarantees that their lives would not be turned upside down in 18 months’ time. At least the scales are falling from everyone’s eyes about how difficult it is going to be to keep this process from getting nasty as the deadline looms. Shorn of diplomatic niceties, the outlines of the impasse are now plain to see. By insisting that Britain cannot talk about a future trade deal until it agrees everything else, the EU is effectively holding a gun to the UK economy in order to extract the maximum amount of cash and political concessions. By refusing to provide water-tight assurances on the EU priorities in advance of such talks, Britain is in turn holding to ransom the rights of millions of EU citizens, tens of billions of euros in budget shortfalls and potentially peace in Northern Ireland. In the circumstances, it should be no surprise to see both negotiators beginning to look somewhat pursed-lipped. The British chancellor, Philip Hammond, warned of just such a dynamic only on Wednesday, when he told MPs that the UK should brace itself for the possibility of a “bad-tempered breakdown in which people are not working in their own economic self-interest”. His warning that planes might not be able to fly after a disorderly Brexit may be the least of our concerns if passengers don’t have visas either and exporters can’t put their goods in the hold. For this candour, Hammond was rewarded by a Daily Mail editorial calling for his resignation and accused of talking Britain down. But all sides are now talking about the need to imagine the worst and prepare for the prospect of negotiations breaking down entirely. “No deal will be a very bad deal,” said a grim-faced Barnier. “We will be ready to face any and all the eventualities.” It is all a long way from the sweet-natured prosecco summit promised by Boris Johnson and other Brexiters, who insisted that the prevailing interests of Italian winemakers and German car exporters would quickly bring EU diplomats to heel. Instead, Davis is digging in his heels for a long and bitter fight to the finish line. “There are points of tension in all negotiations, and there have been more than one,” admitted the Brexit secretary, calling on his critics to “focus on the end result, not the individual stages”. Barnier prefers to describe his desire for sequencing as immutable and not subject to concession. “We have got to do things in the right order,” he replied. “If we mix everything up, there are risks.” The reality is they are already talking about trade and money and sovereignty; just not agreeing very much. The cards are increasingly on the table. Britain can inflict pain on EU citizens and taxpayers; the EU can seriously damage the British economy. Like nuclear deterrence, implementing such threats would bring heavy collateral damage for both sides, but the Europeans feel sure they know who would come off worse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/mindhunter-review-like-mad-men-with-added-serial-killers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Mindhunter review – like Mad Men, with added serial killers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/mindhunter-review-like-mad-men-with-added-serial-killers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/mindhunter-review-like-mad-men-with-added-serial-killers","fields":{"headline":"Mindhunter review – like Mad Men, with added serial killers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What is it? It’s the Masters of Sex of murdering. Why you’ll love it: John Douglas is one of the most influential crimefighters ever. An FBI sniper turned hostage negotiator, he is the man responsible for bringing criminal profiling to the bureau. He spent his life interviewing serial killers – before “serial killer” was even a term – to gauge their motives; not only to figure out why they did what they did, but why they did it the way they did. By allowing himself to understand these monsters, by mentally submerging himself as both victim and perpetrator, Douglas forged a groundbreaking way of crimefighting that is still used around the world. If you have seen The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal, you will recognise Jack Crawford and Will Graham as cyphers for Douglas. Mindhunter is the story of John Douglas. Well, it is and it isn’t. Douglas is nowhere to be found in this new David Fincher-directed series, based on Douglas’s 1995 book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit. It is a show about his work, about a man from the late-70s who upends the FBI with cutting-edge sociological theory. Only here, the man’s name is Holden Ford (played by Jonathan Groff). Ford is awakened to the potential for psychology as a tool by a screening of Dog Day Afternoon, of all things. He meets a woman, enjoys a long talk with her about labelling theory, watches Al Pacino shout “Attica!” at some strangers and, suddenly, his new worldview clicks into place; maybe the key to catching criminals is understanding them. Before you know it, he is neck-deep in strife; it turns out that asking a roomful of law-enforcement grunts to empathise with Charles Manson is not the expressway to victory he expected. If you are after a whizz-bang cop show, Mindhunter – despite sounding like a Steven Seagal action film from 1997 – is not for you. The biggest visceral thrill of either preview episode made available to me happens when a hostage situation takes a turn. Outside of that, this is very firmly a TV programme about discussion. Men in diners talking. Men in offices talking. Men in prisons talking. There are real-life serial killers in Mindhunter, but so far they are limited to Edmund Kemper, the so-called Co-ed killer who murdered his grandparents and several young women in the 1960s and 70s before giving himself over to the police after apparently getting bored with outsmarting them. Even then, we aren’t seeing Kemper the killer, but Kemper the listless detainee, offering up a range of psychological motives for the things he did in the hope of wangling his way into a position of relative authority. In Mindhunter, even the murderers are talkers. All of which makes sense. After all, Mindhunter the book is basically a how-to guide for the implementation of systemic institutional change based on abstract theory, so the show should follow suit. Two episodes in, and it looks set to be more of a satisfying Mad Men slow-burn than anything else. If you have the time and patience to sit back and discover the men behind the monsters, it may reward you in spades. Where: Netflix. Length: Ten hour-long episodes, all available to watch now. Standout episode: Of the two I’ve been allowed to see, the first is the most outstanding, due purely to the confident languidness of its exposition. If you liked Mindhunter, watch: Masters of Sex (Amazon), Hannibal (Netflix)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/15/the-week-in-tv-our-girl-snowfall-norskov-game-face-lucy-worsley-ray-mears-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Our Girl, Snowfall, Norskov, GameFace and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/15/the-week-in-tv-our-girl-snowfall-norskov-game-face-lucy-worsley-ray-mears-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/15/the-week-in-tv-our-girl-snowfall-norskov-game-face-lucy-worsley-ray-mears-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Our Girl, Snowfall, Norskov, GameFace and more","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Our Girl (BBC1) | iPlayer Mindhunter (Netflix) | Netflix Snowfall (BBC2) | iPlayer Norskov (C4) | All 4 GameFace (E4) | All 4 Lucy Worsley’s Nights at the Opera (BBC2) | iPlayer Australian Wilderness with Ray Mears (ITV) | ITV Hub I’m possibly irrationally biased against Our Girl from the very start, though the first series had a few nice touches. I suspect it’s simply the title, with its reference to “our boys” and unthinking tabloid tub-thumps, still spaffing on about the Falklands. This third series looks to be trying to dishearten me even further. The premise is that there is a feisty, outspoken, heart-of-gold army medical lass – in the first series it was EastEnders’s Lacey Turner, now it’s Michelle Keegan, ex-Corrie – out there amid the dirt and the danger and the bombs and the macho bullcrap. Keegan’s Georgie Lane is this time not in a war zone but in earthquake-struck Nepal, which looked remarkably still-standing to my untutored eye, BBC budgets being what they are. But it certainly looks worse than our Georgie, who never looked anything but serenely beautiful: even that stray wisp of hair, after she’s floored during an aftershock, simply adds to the allure. And Keegan, to be fair, does well: there are fine subtleties to her character, and the performance. Unfortunately, that’s where the subtleties end. There’s the infuriatingly gobby Private Maisie, who gets away with the kind of backchat which in any real, non-soap army would have her cashiered; the impossibly handsome Nepalese engineer and aid worker, who sponsors whole villages out of simple goodness; the charming, calm, officer type, wise beyond his years. And the rest of the squaddies. Dear God, but they’re an awful lot: disastrously proud of their lack of education, bombastic, crude, misogynist, xenophobic, bantering about sex and footie, cracking jokes about earthquakes even as bodies lie stinking in the dust. Can this really be in any way a poster-call for (or, actually, at all representative of) the British army? Never mind an advert for education and social mobility in the Britain of today? But I’m guessing the boys, our boys, will have hidden strengths, and step, albeit boorishly, banteringly, up at some stage to the plate, or wire, or whatever it is they need to do. And what are the chances that mouthy Maisie, with her casual inability to obey any order, ever, will be the very one next week to bravely rescue our Georgie and her perfect eyebrows, and her pretty engineer, from the rubble? Both literal, and script-wise. On the other hand, an unashamedly cerebral and gloriously promising new Netflix series. Mindhunter, from the pen of acclaimed playwrights Joe Penhall and Jennifer Haley, and exec produced/directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network), comes with startlingly good credentials but, unlike so much that looks that good on paper, actually delivers. It’s 1977 in the FBI’s Quantico HQ, five years after J Edgar Hoover’s incarceration in the grave, and a few sharp young turks are starting to argue that criminals, especially inexplicable criminals, can be understood, predicted even, by psychology. It’s the era of febrile social breakdown, with the likes of Charlie Manson and the Son of Sam (and Dog Day Afternoon, which takes centre stage at one point: goodness but wasn’t Pacino once extraordinarily good) seen to be reflecting the post-Nixon, post-Vietnam angsty zeitgeist. Chief turk is Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff), who begins to dare to wonder “how do we get ahead of crazy if we don’t know how crazy thinks?”, a sentiment that, to many Hoover-era throwbacks, violently contrasts with theirs, best voiced by one as “it is not our job to commiserate with these people. It is our job to electrocute them.” As such, it’s nothing less than the tale of the genesis of criminal profiling, in the days before “serial killer” was even a term, if not, in fact, the tale of the very beginning of the rise of the geek. Netflix is not known to be overtroubled by the leanness of its wallet, but no budgets have been blown on whizzy explosions or car chases, or even big names: instead, we just get a wash of style, and brownstone bars, and captivating intellectual argument, as Ford begins to visit jails to interview killers. It’s probably the best thing Netflix has done all year, which is saying rather a lot. Two rather spiffing dramas about cocaine this week. Snowfall tells the story of the rise, in south LA in the 80s, of the crack cocaine epidemic centred on Compton. At the other end, both of the timeline and the world, Norskov relates the tale of a chill northern Danish city struggling today with coke overdoses. They both arrive with background credentials. Snowfall is exec-produced by John Singleton, of Boyz N the Hood fame, whereas Norskov won best series at this year’s Copenhagen TV festival. In both cases, the quality shows, but I suspect Snowfall suffers a little from having too many storylines crammed into a simple hour. It’s indeed ambitious, though it careens occasionally into cartoonish glamour in a manner at which the social realist Boyz would have shuddered. But any one of the three strands – the (true) CIA plan to flood LA with drugs, the Mexican wrestler turned cartel courier, the bright black lad, Franklin Saint, impeccably rendered by British lad Damson Idris, drawn inexorably in by a fatal combination of social injustice and very human greed – could have stood quite proudly and discretely alone. For a scene-setter, though it punched many buttons, so far I’m only really taken by Franklin’s story. Also, great music. The eventual impact was, of course, a few global cities brought to their knees by drugs. The jumper-casual Danish police of Norskov could hardly be more different from their LA counterparts, and the devastation threatened to their relatively rich (and white) coastal town is hardly comparable to what happened to Compton in the 80s, but there are disturbing parallels in the twisting fear, the ignorances, the dark deeds and the political imbecilities. It’s rather raw-boned, and rather good, and just getting going: compared to the last big Scandi-thing, the daft Black Lake, which owed far more to Scooby-Doo than Borgen, it’s Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. GameFace, which had its pilot in 2014, has been commissioned as a series, which is good news for writer and star Roisin Conaty and for us. Oh, it’s not something we’ve not seen before. Shambolic thirtysomething singleton drinks too much, eats too much cake, reads self-help books – it’s more scatological than Miranda, less whimperingly funny than Fleabag, but firmly in that part of the spectrum. Yet Conaty still has the ability to pull something truly leftfield from nowhere, such as the nice, if overdone, gag about the guy who had, somehow, never seen Friends. Immensely likable, surprisingly moreish. I had early reservations about Lucy Worsley’s latest outing, a not-unambitious attempt to relate the history of the last three European centuries through the story of opera. When Nights at the Opera rolled out Pavarotti and Nessun Dorma and the hairgripped one asked, “We all know what that’s about … football, surely?”, I sighed a little sigh. But quite soon and quite suddenly here she was being immensely clever, arguing how both The Marriage of Figaro and Fidelio had served to hasten the fall of the very Habsburg empire. Wonderful stuff, and Lucy got to dress in so many dresses I’m not surprised at the paucity of the Nepalese earthquake budget, though I’m unconvinced that Royal Opera House music director Antonio Pappano, the nuts-and-bolts music guy, can hold any guttering candle to the Proms’ chord-of-the-week guy David Owen Norris."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
