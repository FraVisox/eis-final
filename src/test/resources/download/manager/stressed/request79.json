Will AMD Ryzen machines be cheaper?","bodyText":"The “light but mighty” (in speed and capacity) laptops from Dell, HP and Microsoft seem to me to be very expensive because Intel sells processors at premium prices. Now that AMD has produced Ryzen chips, can you foresee if and when these makers will produce desirable laptops with cheaper AMD chips? I can afford to pay Intel’s price premium, but I’d be more likely to buy if the £1,600 price came down to, say, £1,200. Cliff The good news is that Ryzen-based laptops will be here soon. The bad news is that the first ones won’t be ultralight models like the Dell XPS 13. Also, they probably won’t bring prices down as much as you hope. Suppose you buy a new laptop with the latest Intel Core i7-8550U. For that processor, Intel suggests a “recommended customer price” of $409 (£310). You can safely assume that leading PC manufacturers, who are buying thousands of chips, are not paying the recommended price. Even if AMD supplied Ryzen Mobile processors free, it wouldn’t knock £400 off the price of high-end laptop. In fact, I’ll be quite surprised if it knocks £100 off, though that may change if AMD can sell chips in large volumes. I know people are hoping that increased competition will force Intel to lower the prices of its high-end chips. However, so far there is no evidence that the current range of Ryzen desktop processors is having that effect. For example, Amazon.co.uk is charging £281 for the Core i7-7700K, which is its best seller. It was £312.97 in July. The Core i5-7500 costs £161, down from £176.97 in July. However, the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 now costs £262, compared with around £278 in July, while the Ryzen 5 1600X has fallen from around £220 to £187. The Intel chip prices have fallen by around 10%, but the AMD chips are down by 6% and 15%. Historically, AMD has undercut Intel: you can buy its 6-core FX6300, for example, for only £70. With the Ryzen line, it’s getting closer to Intel pricing levels but competing on features instead. It seems more likely to increase AMD’s average selling price than to bring Intel’s crashing down. However, it may have some effect in giving PC manufacturers a bargaining chip when they negotiate prices with Intel. Behold the Ryzen It’s no secret that AMD had fallen a long way behind Intel both in high-end processor design and in manufacturing. AMD was still making chips on a 28nm fabrication process when Intel had moved to 14nm. AMD needed to make a big leap forward. To do that, it re-hired a very experienced designer, Jim Keller, and asked him to design a next-generation architecture, which is called Zen. Keller had worked on the DEC Alpha – once the world’s fastest processor – before moving to AMD and working on the successful K8 and Athlon chips. After leaving AMD, he eventually ended up at PA Semi, a chip company that was taken over by Apple. There he worked on the A4 and A5 SoC (system on a chip) processors used in products from the iPhone 4 to the iPad 2. Keller spent the next three years at AMD (2012-2015), with the Zen-based chips due to appear in 2016. The first Ryzen chips were manufactured on a 14nm process and finally reached the market in March this year. These are hot-running chips for desktop PCs, and tests suggest they are quite competitive with Intel’s Core range. AMD has even adopted a BMW-style 3/5/7 naming scheme, which prompts you to compare a Ryzen 3 with a Core i3, and so on. The Ryzen Threadripper tops the range – there are versions with 8, 12 and 16 cores and double the threads – and will compete with Intel’s new Core i9. Ryzen Mobile Selling desktop processors doesn’t get you very far. AMD is now working to fill out the range with Ryzen Mobile and Mobile Pro chips for laptops and ultraportables, plus a version for servers, which is called Epyc. Ryzen Mobile chips are due to appear this year. Ryzen Mobile Pro chips are expected in the first half of next year. This will involve reducing the heat generated from a TDP of 65W and 95W in the mainstream desktop versions to around 30W for pro laptops and 15W for ultraportables. You may have heard that Asus has already launched a Ryzen laptop. However, it didn’t wait for the mobile chips. Instead, its ROG Strix GL702ZC packs a Ryzen 5 or 7 desktop processor and an AMD Radeon graphics card into a gaming laptop with a 17in screen. (ROG stands for Republic Of Gamers.) Ultralight it is not. As before with AMD, the Ryzen Mobile SoCs are APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) rather than CPUs, to indicate their built-in graphics processors. AMD says these chips offer up to 50% more processing power and 40% faster graphics than its previous 9000 series of APUs. This is comparing Ryzen Mobile (aka Raven Ridge) with its older Bristol Ridge chips, not with Intel processors. Yes, there’s a leaked Geekbench score, but I wouldn’t put too much faith in that. When, and how much? AMD said it expected to ship Ryzen Mobile chips in the second half of 2017, which could take you up to the end of December. Laptops may appear before then, of course, but they could be in short supply. Given the standard industry warning – never buy version one of anything! – I’d certainly leave it an extra couple of months before parting with any cash. If computing is your hobby, you might enjoy debugging systems. If not, let someone else do it. It often takes hardware a while to settle down, and early drivers can be notoriously buggy. Without good drivers, you won’t get the best out of any new hardware. Will it save you any money? I expect most of the large PC manufacturers will supply at least one or two Mobile Ryzen systems. However, this will involve extra costs in design and manufacturing, qualifying parts and system testing. There will also be extra stock-keeping, distribution, advertising, training and support costs. Some manufacturers may sacrifice some Intel advertising or marketing support, because Intel isn’t going to help promote AMD-based laptops. These extra costs will have to be covered by a lower volume of sales of Ryzen Mobile laptops, which is why it’s hard to compete with Wintel. Under those circumstances, would you really want to slash the price of Ryzen laptops? Margins on Windows laptops are thin as it is. If I was getting Ryzen chips a bit cheaper than Intel chips, I’d price the laptops the same and hope that – after swallowing the extra costs – I came out with a slightly better profit margin. For the next year or so, I expect Ryzen PCs to be sold on their extra cores and threads, better graphics, and other features that appeal to a geekier audience. Gamers are already the primary market. From there, AMD can expand into the wider market for people will pay for extra performance, such as video editors, programmers and graphics artists. There’s no rush for people like us.

The clampdown follows warnings that Britain’s debt mountain has risen to dangerous levels as households struggle with rising shop prices and low wage growth. The survey showed the net balance of lenders’ expectations for the availability of unsecured lending to households over the next three months fell from -16.2 to -28.6, indicating the sharpest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008, when the UK economy contracted by 2.2%. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “It does look like banks are starting to clamp down on the supply of unsecured credit.” He said a number of factors were making lenders more cautious, including a warning from the Bank last month that lenders could incur £30bn of losses on credit cards, personal loans and car finance if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. Demand for secured lending for house purchases fell slightly in the third quarter and was expected to be unchanged in the final three months of the year. Lenders made it more difficult for consumers to take out new credit cards and unsecured loans such as overdrafts in the third quarter, tightening lending criteria and approving fewer applications. “Some lenders reported that they had slightly tightened their credit criteria for some products,” the Bank reported. “Motivations for this included concerns about customer indebtedness and the squeeze in real incomes.” Last month, the chief financial regulator urged the government to step in to help tackle the mountain of debt being racked up by the most vulnerable consumers in Britain. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Guardian he was concerned about the number of people who needed loans to make ends meet. Lenders taking part in the Bank’s latest credit conditions survey reported a slight increase in credit card defaults in the third quarter and a “significant” rise in the number of defaults on other unsecured lending, which includes overdrafts and personal loans. A growing reluctance among banks to extend consumer credit comes as markets and economists bring forward their expectations for the timing of the first rise in interest rates in more than a decade. Policymakers at Threadneeedle Street are widely expected to increase rates from their all-time low of 0.25% to 0.5% when they announce their decision on 2 November. The last time the Bank raised rates was July 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Tombs said higher borrowing costs were likely to dampen demand for credit among consumers. “Faced with the prospect of higher interest rates, households are likely to be more cautious about their borrowing,” he said. Banks said they expected the availability of loans to businesses to remain roughly unchanged over the next three months. However, lenders expect demand for loans for capital investment in businesses to fall at the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/registered-blind-people-assume-things-dog-stick","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T10:16:39Z","webTitle":"I’m registered blind.

That doesn’t mean you can assume things about me","bodyText":"I’m standing in line waiting to get into a nightclub, bumping shoulders with people who are already having a good time. As I reach the front, a bouncer looks me up and down. Without a word, he places his hand on my shoulder and pushes me forward. I’m pinballed from security guard to security guard, fully expecting to be led directly into the club. Instead, I’m guided out of the queue, confused as to why I now find myself standing behind the metal barriers. “What’s going on?” I mean, I’ve had a few drinks but I’m certainly not drunk. He asks me to blow into a breathalyser, and we wait a few moments. All clear. “Are you OK?” he asks me plainly. “Yes?” Why wouldn’t I be? And then the penny drops. The first bouncer must have thought I was off-my-face drunk, simply because my eyes weren’t looking in one particular direction. The thing is, I’m visually impaired, but I don’t necessarily need a cane. What follows is my desperate vomit of different terms for blindness, trying to prove my innocence. “I’m visually impaired? Legally blind? I’m registered blind … Jesus! I can’t see properly!” But it is all too late. A fun night out had been soured by one tiny assumption and a judge and jury who had decided to put me on trial because I didn’t look them in the eye. This isn’t the first time this has happened and it certainly won’t be the last. But given that today is World Sight Day, I thought I’d shine a light on what people with vision impairments go through on a daily basis. Blindness and visual impairments are severely misunderstood. What people presume is that if you’re blind, you can’t see anything and you’re either going to be relying on a dog or swinging a stick about. If you’ve got neither … then hey, you’re not blind. This is entirely incorrect. People who are registered blind are statistically more likely to be partially sighted than completely blind. In reality, only a very small portion of people have no sight at all. Despite this, awareness regarding legal blindness is practically non-existent. Two million people are registered blind or partially sighted in the UK and, shocking as it is, we are actually able to participate in society. According to a report by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) almost half of blind and partially sighted people feel moderately or completely cut off from people or things around them, leading to a marked rise in the risk of depression among people with sight loss. That’s why the ignorance surrounding vision impairments needs to be addressed. If a night out is a way for a visually impaired person to enjoy themselves, shutting them out because they don’t carry a stick is a sure way to keep us cut off from society. There often seems to be a misconception that the only thing blind people do is … be blind. We don’t just sit at home decked out in our blind garb, hovelled up in our pyjamas and dropping curry down our shirts. It’s detrimental to our overall identity to assume that if a vision-impaired person says that they’re going to work, they must be going to the RNIB. People with varying capabilities of sight are able to lead lives that don’t revolve around blindness. Yes, we might have keen interests in issues surrounding blindness or want to rally around in support, but that doesn’t mean we don’t want to get out to a nightclub now and again. It’s not only able-bodied people who can have fun. I can appreciate that it’s difficult to really know a person’s situation, but making face-value assumptions, whether they’re a product of society or not, isn’t going to help anyone. We do exist in the outside world, even if we aren’t holding a cane. Like most things, blindness exists on a scale and what you know about one blind person certainly isn’t going to apply to another. • Alex Lee is a freelance writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/12/hamas-claims-deal-agreed-fatah-control-gaza-strip","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T15:33:13Z","webTitle":"Hamas and Fatah sign deal over control of Gaza Strip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/hamas-claims-deal-agreed-fatah-control-gaza-strip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/12/hamas-claims-deal-agreed-fatah-control-gaza-strip","fields":{"headline":"Hamas and Fatah sign deal over control of Gaza Strip","bodyText":"The rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah have signed a preliminary reconciliation deal in the latest in a series of attempts to end a decade-long Palestinian territorial, political and ideological split that has crippled statehood aspirations. The deal, signed in Cairo in the presence of Egyptian intelligence officials, focuses on who should control the contested Gaza Strip and on what terms. The two sides’ mutual hostility has defined the stark geographical and ideological division in Palestinian society between the West Bank and Gaza, which they have ruled separately since clashes that broke out in 2007. Hamas was represented at the signing by Saleh al-Arouri, who has been accused by Israel of masterminding attacks on Israelis from his exile in Turkey and elsewhere. Under the agreement, the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority is to resume full control of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip by 1 December, according to a statement from Egypt’s intelligence agency. According to reports the agreement would also see Palestinian Authority forces take control of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. In exchange, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the PA are expected to lift crippling restrictions on electricity supply to Gaza that have made the lives of its 2 million residents miserable in recent months. While significant on paper at least, the deal is similar to previous attempts at reconciliation between the two sides and which were unveiled with fanfares and public declarations of unity, only to quickly run into the sand. Despite the reported agreement on the Rafah crossing, it is unlikely to make much difference in practical terms for goods entering Gaza from Egypt, while truck traffic to the northern Sinai remains restricted by the Egyptian military because of the ongoing security crisis there. A top Fatah official said Abbas would visit Gaza “within less than a month”. If it goes ahead, the Abbas visit would be the first since 2007, when the Islamist Hamas movement assumed control of Gaza. In 2007, a year after winning Palestinian parliament elections, Hamas evicted Abbas’s western-backed Palestinian Authority from Gaza. Abbas was left with autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Over the past decade, each side deepened its control over its territory, making it increasingly difficult to forge compromises. Previous efforts to reach a negotiated reconciliation between the two factions – such as in 2014 – have been announced before but have always faltered. The current round of talks have focused on issues with broader areas of agreement between the two sides – leaving out the most contentious points, most significantly the future of Hamas’s 25,000-strong armed wing in Gaza. The fine-print of the agreement will be pored over by both Israel and international donors to the Palestinian Authority for its implications. The deal may have profound legal consequences in terms of aid funding from the US. Abbas has insisted he will only reassume control of Gaza if Hamas hands over power. Hamas, in turn, has said it will not disarm, even if it is willing to give Abbas control of the Gaza government. The breakthrough – while provisional – has been driven by the changing dynamics in the wider Middle East, which has seen Egypt move to displace Qatar and Turkey as the key broker in Palestinian affairs, with both Hamas and Fatah increasingly reliant on Cairo’s sponsorship. Struggling with the fallout from an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade since 2007, Hamas has found it increasingly difficult to govern or provide basic services to Gaza’s residents. The 82-year-old Abbas, meanwhile, might be thinking about his legacy. The political split has been a major stain on his rule, particularly at a time when attempts to negotiate the terms of Palestinian statehood with Israel seem to be going nowhere. Egypt too – which has long resisted becoming more deeply involved in Gaza – appears to have shifted its own position, driven in large part by the Isis-linked insurgency in northern Sinai centred around the city of el-Arish, a short drive from the Rafah border crossing. Palestinian officials speaking to the Guardian suggested that given Egypt’s role, neither Fatah nor Hamas wanted to be seen as obstacles to the negotiations – a fact that had given momentum to the talks. “Where the Qataris did not succeed, the Turks did not succeed, where Swiss and Norwegian efforts at reconciliation failed, the Egyptians have succeeded so far and in a few weeks,” said one official. Responding to news of the deal, Israel said that any Palestinian reconciliation agreement must abide by international agreements and terms set by the Middle East Quartet - including the recognition of Israel and Hamas giving up its arms. “Israel will examine developments in the field and act accordingly,” a government official said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2017/oct/13/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-i-felt-unsafe-about-returning-to-work","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T06:00:25Z","webTitle":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'I felt unsafe about returning to work'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/oct/13/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-i-felt-unsafe-about-returning-to-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/oct/13/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-i-felt-unsafe-about-returning-to-work","fields":{"headline":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'I felt unsafe about returning to work'","bodyText":"You interviewed me and offered me the job on the spot. You explained that the role was working nights in your dementia care home – with the plan to shadow other carers for the first week so I could get used to the role. But on my third shift I was thrown in the deep end. You told me it would just be me and two agency carers on shift for the night. One agency carer arrived late and the other didn’t give me a handover – so I had to work out what needed doing for myself. I didn’t even know the codes to get into different parts of the building and had to keep asking the agency staff, who got annoyed. After a couple of hours, the two agency staff settled into the lounge chairs and said they were taking a break and I had to answer the call bells. I started to panic as I didn’t know what the residents’ individual care needs were but I managed to assist them the best way that I could. After they settled into lounge chairs, the agency staff slept while I looked after the residents. A few times I asked them to help, but they only woke in the early morning to start getting the residents washed and ready. In that time I witnessed some of the quickest washes I have seen. One resident begged not to get up and I told the agency carer to stop but she shouted at me and told me to get out. We assisted one woman to wash, dress and mobilise into her wheelchair. The agency carer explained that she should really be hoisted but as there was no time to do it in the mornings that never happened. Personal care was also hit and miss. I asked about residents’ own prescribed incontinence pads and was told that the manager locked these away in a cupboard. This meant that each resident was not getting their own pad thickness and this could have caused them painful pressure sores. All the residents were up and dressed in the dining room by the time the day staff arrived for handover. As I said goodbye to the agency staff, one turned to me and whispered, “What happens on nights, stays on nights”. But I just couldn’t keep it a secret. After an internal battle, I realised resident safety was more important, and decided to tell you what I had witnessed. You called me in for a meeting and said my accusations were being investigated. Then you said I was being placed on paid leave to “protect me” while the agency workers continued to provide care. The paid leave lasted for over a month. I continually asked you when I could return, but received no reply. I was eventually given a date to discuss my return to work, but I started being harassed in the town by other carers who said you were against me and supported them. I told you I was beginning to feel unsafe about returning to work, but you said there was nothing you could do. In the end I felt like I had no other choice: I decided to leave the social care sector. The way you handled my complaint put me off care for life. It was difficult for me to tell you about the poor care I witnessed. Why didn’t you support me rather than suspending me? You not only neglected to give me the on-the-job training you promised, but, more importantly, by allowing those agency carers to continue you are still letting vulnerable residents down.

In 1982 it was being derided as a symbol of masculine confusion in Bruce Feirstein’s Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche. Thirty years later, it would take on a brief online life as a kind of ironic slang for “cute”, thanks to Australian comic Chris Lilley’s TV show, Ja’mie: Private School Girl. But, enduringly – in its periods of popularity and in its phases of quaint naffness – quiche is always with us. It is a key picnic and party food, served at weddings, christenings, family dos and, sadly, funerals, and, therefore, it is exactly the kind of thing you might suddenly find yourself bulk-buying in the supermarket. Not that native Lorrains would acknowledge the modern mass-produced quiche lorraine. Originally a flan with just smoked bacon, cream and eggs, it was first augmented by Parisians, who started adding gruyère, and later we Brits, who threw in various cheeses. This is not new. Elizabeth David was flagging up this evolution (or sacrilege) in 1962. Dairy deviations aside, do any of the supermarket versions achieve greatness? That is, a luxuriously rich, light, readily yielding custard boasting clear flavours, encased in a crisp, all-butter pastry? Or are they as damp and depressing as the baking at a rain-lashed church fete? Note: all quiches were reheated and eaten warm. M&amp;S, handcrafted smoked bacon 240g, £3 Hot from the oven the filling rises above the (sound, crisp, all-butter) pastry as if puffing out its chest out in pride, and with some justification. Beneath that top crust (draped with bacon rashers, beautifully browned; as attractive as the lacquered interior of a playboy’s yacht), you will find a filling which, if lacking the delicate finesse of the greatest quiches, is bold and balanced in its gruyère-spiked flavours, evenly mined with sweet, smoky bacon and confidently seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. It is, and this is not a given, tasty. 8/10 *Winner* Waitrose 400g, £2.59 This chunky example (its 3cm filling the deepest of those tested), looks terrible cold. Straight from the fridge, its surface is as pale and wrinkled as an old surgical stocking. Reheating gets some appetising colour in its cheeks, but the lightly trembling filling is gluey with strands of mature cheddar, a bullying ingredient which the lardons – pink, mushy, Spam-like pieces of “reformed bacon with added water” – are almost texturally indistinguishable from. Overall, a flavour failure. 4/10 Co-op 400g, £2 The filling’s body language is not promising. It visibly shrinks away from the pastry, which, left exposed to the oven’s heat, becomes dry and brittle. The flavour of that substantively creamy if shallow filling (1.5cm deep) is reminiscent of Walkers cheese and onion crisps or a Greggs cheese and onion pasty. The flavour-deficient lardons (more reformed bacon with added water), are notably scarce – which is a mixed blessing. 3/10 Sainsbury’s 400g, £2 Rather than being evenly distributed through the filling, the lardons (and there are plenty) have all risen to the top. It looks like a teenager with chronic acne. That technical flaw does mean that, in the oven, those reformed bacon pieces harden into a browned crust. They at least taste of something. But this is not great quiche. Its cheesy, hammy flavours are juvenile, the thick pastry (5mm) is rather powdery, and the shallow filling lacks luxurious creaminess. Functional, forgettable food. 6/10 Asda, Extra Special maple-cured smoked bacon 400g, £3 Draped in rashers of streaky bacon, this quiche takes on a handsome golden brown colour. The filling has a persuasively creamy texture too, even if it delivers only wafts of flavour from the advertised extra mature cheddar. Significantly, however, because this is a wide and shallow rather than deep-filled quiche, the ratio of filling (1cm) to pastry (5mm) is ridiculous. The filling is so thin, relatively, it is like eating a pastry-based pizza. 5/10 Morrisons, The Best British smoked Cherrywood bacon and cheddar 450g, £3 Another wide ’n’ shallow tart of similarly uneven pastry-filling dimensions that, as the overtly cheesy custard is generously threaded with nuggets of bacon and further rashers on top, produces a hearty, slightly dry mouthful rather than anything delicately eggy. It packs plenty of flavour and the pastry is a decent buttery shell. But if a fine quiche lorraine should have the grace of Brigette Bardot, this is more Inspector Clouseau – entertaining in its way but clumsy, and as French as a stick of Blackpool rock. 6/10 Aldi, Specially Selected West Country cheddar and maple cured bacon 420g, £2.19 There is a lot going on here. Too much, in fact. The pepper and nutmeg seasoning is unusually concentrated. The cheesy top of the quiche has taken on an almost parmesan intensity. The milky custard, the texture of just-set scrambled eggs, is liberally threaded with lardons whose “smoke flavour” further adds to this cacophony of somewhat jarring elements. It is like talking to a speed-freak at a party. Initially amusing but, ultimately, too confusing to be enjoyable. 6/10 Tesco, quiche lorraine 400g, £2.20 The thinnest pastry of those tested: a mere 3mm along the quiche’s tanned base. It had a smart snap to it and, if a shade oily, formed, as it should, a pleasantly unobtrusive container. Sadly, the skimpy 1.2cm deep filling is far less elegant, with its rubbery, reformed smoked bacon lardons (they look and taste like cheap ham), hints of nutmeg and big, booming savoury cheddar flavours. Think of this quiche as ITV. It has its good points. But it lacks depth and overall quality. 5/10"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/09/brexit-tories-eeyores-boris-johnson-philip-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T15:29:35Z","webTitle":"Brexit is deadly serious – so why do the Tories only want jokers in charge? | Stephen Moss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/09/brexit-tories-eeyores-boris-johnson-philip-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/09/brexit-tories-eeyores-boris-johnson-philip-hammond","fields":{"headline":"Brexit is deadly serious – so why do the Tories only want jokers in charge?","bodyText":"Ability used to be the principal requirement in a minister. But, post-Brexit, this, like so much else, has changed.

Rather than try to avert or mitigate the impending disaster, he argued, the officers on the Titanic are being judged – on the Brexit side at least – by the good humour with which they meet their fate.

Boris Johnson, ever cheery in his absurd shorts, attacked the FT in his conference speech last week, referring to it as a “distinguished pink newspaper [that] manages to make Eeyore look positively exuberant”. For good measure, he added that the Economist – which takes a dangerously reality-based view of Brexit – was “suspiciously unread”. Johnson (or can I call him Boris in this comedian-in-chief context?) is there to keep up the flagging spirits of the Tory party. At a conference that made most funerals look riotously joyous affairs, he managed to raise a few cheers with his usual stream-of-consciousness narrative, interspersed by the odd long word and Latin epithet. In a world of Bill Cashes and Bernard Jenkins, Johnson is Cicero. But he is also, allegedly, foreign secretary, and on the whole foreign secretaries have been serious figures. OK, one could have spent a marvellously entertaining couple of hours with Charles James Fox (no relation of Liam), who was foreign secretary three times in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but his stints were brief and he usually assumed office in rocky circumstances. Generally, though, foreign secretaries have not been a barrel of laughs. Lord Castlereagh held the post from 1812 to 1822, and oversaw the negotiations that followed the Napoleonic war – a settlement similar in complexity to our current pas de deux with the EU. He did a pretty good job in the negotiations, but was widely despised for propping up repressive governments at home and abroad. “I met Murder on the way/ He had a mask like Castlereagh,” wrote Shelley. Byron was even ruder. But at least Castlereagh took the job seriously. Wellington, the Earl of Aberdeen, Palmerston, Lord John Russell, Arthur Balfour, Ernest Bevin, Robin Cook, Margaret Beckett – all held the post without feeling the need to jog in swimming trunks, hang suspended from zip wires or make tasteless remarks about black people. They were committed politicians doing their best for Britain, rather than indulging their own egos. But Brexit has made fools of us all. With the government directionless, the economy stalled and the future grim, the Tory press and the party’s backbenchers just want jokers now. It’s time for the House of Commons to install a vat of gunk, so that dull speakers can be tipped in when they fail to entertain. Or perhaps backbenchers should have buzzers so they can respond to hesitation, repetition and deviation. We want jokesters not policy-makers. This is no time for a dull old stick like Gladstone or Peel, with their high-falutin’ principles, labyrinthine arguments and party-destroying soul-searching. Bring on the empty horses. Soon the country has to go over the top, and as we enter no man’s land, the Brexit brigade want us to be singing It’s a Long Way to Tipperary rather than questioning whether this is a war that we ought to be fighting in the first place. A second referendum, a quick renegotiation with the EU so we can tighten up on freedom of movement (plenty of rules on registration and benefits already exist), a continuation of our current highly advantageous trading conditions – no, let’s forget all that and go to our doom singing a merry tune. Nihilism is such fun. In this prevailing mood, the Brexiteers are gunning for the chancellor, Philip Hammond – another reality-based Eeyore who is decidedly off-message in wanting boring things such as transition periods and protection for the City of London. Who needs the City, who needs tax revenues, who needs jobs, who needs economic growth or political stability? They are all so boring. Come on in, the revolutionary water is lovely. Oddly, Brexit is the brainchild of the Conservative and Unionist party. They ceased, of course, to be Conservatives or Unionists a long time ago. They are now the insurrectionary party, the economic destruction party, the screw-the-Union party, the hard-border-in-Ireland party, the ideology-before-pragmatism party, the millenarian party, where all that matters is the rapture of Brexit. Go to your final reward having seen off Johnny Foreigner and taken back control. Neither David Cameron (the true begetter of Brexit) nor Theresa May is now the presiding spirit of the Tory party. Robespierre is – it’s perpetual revolution or nothing. How true Conservatives feel about this is an interesting question. Did they always favour the strenuous politics of Robespierre or Pol Pot over the practised passivity of Lord Salisbury or Stanley Baldwin? A reshuffle beckons. The Eeyores must all go – Hammond, Amber Rudd (who looked grim faced as she emerged from her home to face the press on Monday), those old bores Damian Green and Michael Fallon. Let the Brexiters rule the roost – Johnson of course, David Davis, with his brainless fixed grin (he would have been an ideal major on the Somme), Michael Gove, with his well-turned platitudes, Andrea “laugh-a-minute” Leadsom with her calls for a patriotic press. A purge of the moany remainers will open up positions for people who can really cheer us up. Let’s have Jim Davidson at defence, Ken Dodd at the home office, Mr Blobby as chancellor and the late Kenny Everett as first secretary and deputy prime minister. Then we will have a true ministry of all the talents, and we can embrace Brexit with a smile on our faces and a song in our hearts. As the incoming home secretary once sang: “To me this old world is a wonderful place/ And I’m just about the luckiest human in the whole human race/ I’ve got no silver and I’ve got no gold/ Just a whole lot of happiness in my soul.” How can a stable, well-run, progressive nation possibly compete with one that is thoroughly tickled by this wonderful new adventure? • Stephen Moss is a feature writer at the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/09/noel-conway-case-illustrates-the-difference-between-living-and-surviving","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T17:47:30Z","webTitle":"Noel Conway’s case illustrates the difference between living and surviving | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/09/noel-conway-case-illustrates-the-difference-between-living-and-surviving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/09/noel-conway-case-illustrates-the-difference-between-living-and-surviving","fields":{"headline":"Noel Conway’s case illustrates the difference between living and surviving","bodyText":"Noel Conway’s plight is desperately moving, and he argues his case with great lucidity (Terminally ill man loses high court fight for help to end life, 6 October). By contrast we hear from Not Dead Yet UK that what is needed is “a proper discussion on ensuring proper palliative care is provided for the terminally ill”. Yet again the argument is trotted out that with proper palliative care Mr Conway and patients like him will no longer want to have control over the time and circumstances of their death. This is wrong on two counts. First, as a retired GP with 33 years’ experience I saw that no matter how solicitous, expert and comprehensive palliative care was, it could not always ensure a “good death”. Second, even if Mr Conway could be guaranteed a good death, he would still be denied the control over it that he seeks. Other countries seem perfectly able to legislate to provide this basic human right to have a say over one’s own death, while protecting the vulnerable in society, and it’s high time the UK woke up to this. Dr Philip Cuttell London • Fay Schopen makes the point that “quality of life should underpin any and all medical research. For what is the point of simply surviving – not living – if your existence is a painful, feeble and miserable one?” (Cancer patients need more than survival, 6 October). This is the very point that those like Noel Conway, who know they are facing a traumatic, painful and long-drawn-out death, are trying to make; it is a truly nightmare situation to find oneself in. Yet judges continue steadfast in their resistance to offering such people a compassionate solution. Those of us trying to get the law changed do recognise the potential risks for abuse, but safeguards can be robust. With the best will and the best resources available – which are by no means universal – palliative care can only do so much; it is certainly not enough. Dr Brigid Purcell Norwich • I am in my 90th year and frequently worry when I read of research that shows more and more people are living to 100. They suggest we are all going to say “hurrah”. I would like to hear from all these 100-year-olds. Is the extended life they have been given a “quality of life worth living”? The “quality of life” should indeed be the key to all medical research.

We are of different cultural backgrounds: he is European and I am Asian. Shortly after our wedding, he was arrested for voyeurism. Since then, we have been having therapy and have discovered his undiagnosed autism. We both want children and my parents-in-law are very supportive. But although we are having fertility treatment, he was arrested again a few weeks ago. Our relationship is strong and we decided to see our counsellor more often. What I don’t dare to bring up in our conversation is my fear of him being a role model as a father. I am scared that he will be jailed or his “urge” will get out of control again. My parents and family are far away and none of these facts has been disclosed to them. I feel guilty hiding the truth, but I fear their judgments. I can’t stop wondering if I was blind to all these things that happened under my nose. You may have been blind before; we can all suffer from not seeing things that happen right in front of us. But you aren’t now. In your shoes, I would think really carefully about bringing a baby into this relationship, at this time. So carefully that I wouldn’t do it. You – rightly – have too many doubts and I think you have an inner voice that you should listen to. When we don’t dare “bring things up”, it is usually because we know it will shine a light on areas we are trying to ignore. But you have to ask yourself how long you can ignore this for. Although you gave me no more detail than is contained here, it is vital to say that what your husband has done is not consensual voyeurism (watching other adults, with their consent) but illicit. If it were consensual, but you weren’t part of it, this would raise different questions. But the fact that he has twice been arrested tells us that his behaviour is unlawful. You may want to look at the legal definition of section 67 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The legal definition is here. Part of the thrill for illicit voyeurs is watching people – adults or children – without their knowledge or consent. It doesn’t have to be watching them do something sexual. You didn’t give me more detail, so I am not sure if you know more but didn’t want to say, or don’t know. If the latter, I would strongly advise you to arm yourself with facts and not be fobbed off. This illicitness immediately takes it into a different arena, not only because he is indulging in illegal acts but also because of the impact on you and any children you may have. If you were to have a child together and he were caught again, the chances of social services being involved is high. I spoke to Krystal Woodbridge, an experienced sexual and relationship therapist (cosrt.org.uk). She was keen to know if your husband was “working with a specialist [with regard to the therapy] because this is very important, especially when dealing with sexual urges which take people outside of the law.” A conventional relationship therapist will not do here. I would add that the therapist should be experienced in dealing with people with autism. Woodbridge says: “If you have children and your husband is arrested again, you need to consider that social services may get involved. Even if he’s not a risk to children, they may still want to make an assessment. The non-consensual part of this is the key thing. He is on the other side of the law. You have to very seriously think about exposing yourself and your child to the risk.” Let’s face it, even if he is not caught, do you want to bring a child into this situation? You mention his autism but I wasn’t sure if you were trying to explain away his behaviour – it is important that you don’t make excuses for his voyeurism. You may find the National Autistic Society (autism.org.uk) helpful. Woodbridge advises: “You need to decide on boundaries, what lines you don’t want crossed, and your husband has to understand that crossing these has consequences.” As to whether you discuss this with your wider family, that is up to you, but Woodbridge thinks it is “interesting that you feel guilty about not telling them”. You are entitled to privacy in your relationship, but I feel you need support and wonder if there is someone you can trust? “Family members will have opinions,” says Woodbridge, “and may well judge, but you do need a source of support.” She recommends Stop So (stopso.org.uk), an organisation that deals with sexual offenders and offers support to families. I would urge you to contact them, even if your husband doesn’t want to. Woodbridge said that voyeurism, which can be regarded in this case as a compulsive sexual behaviour, “can be treated successfully but you have to ask yourself how much you are prepared to take on”. You have some tough decisions ahead. In your place, I would ask myself some hard questions, I would press pause on the fertility treatment and contact the organisations listed to discuss your situation in more detail and in confidence. This situation is not going to get less complicated by adding a child, only more so.

Although Puigdemont had originally promised to make a unilateral declaration of independence within 48 hours of a victory for the secessionist campaign, he has so far held off from doing so, calling instead for mediated negotiations with the Madrid government. It is unclear whether Puigdemont will push ahead with a formal declaration of independence or choose a less drastic option in the hope of avoiding a further escalation of tensions. He is due to appear before parliament at 6pm. The Spanish government has repeatedly argued that the referendum was illegal and unconstitutional and has said it will use all the legal means at its disposal to prevent Catalonia from splitting from the rest of the country. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has threatened to impose direct rule on Catalonia, and a series of banks and businesses have announced plans to relocate from the region amid the enduring uncertainty. Police are stationed outside government buildings in Barcelona and have closed off the Ciutadella park around the regional parliament on security grounds. By mid-morning on Tuesday the park was ringed by Catalan regional police officers, the Mossos d’Esquadra, while Spanish national police vans were parked around the corner. Thousands of independence campaigners are expected to gather nearby on Tuesday afternoon to watch the parliamentary session on giant screens. A Catalan government source dismissed suggestions that Puigdemont would opt for a merely symbolic recognition of independence, but refused to be drawn on what he might do. “We’re still on track. We’re here to do what we’re here to do and we will do it, especially now that we know that people have voted in a referendum and the result is clear,” the source said. “We’re not doing anything apart from what we have committed to do. It is the president’s prerogative to establish the exact parameters on which this will be done.” A Catalan parliament official told the Associated Press that its governing board had “taken note” of the referendum results, in which 90% of participants voted in favour of independence. But the official said the board would take no action beyond acknowledging the poll results. Spain’s economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said he hoped common sense would prevail and that the Catalan president would not declare independence. Speaking in Luxembourg, De Guindos blamed Puigdemont’s “radical” and “irresponsible” government for the crisis and said his European counterparts were backing the Spanish government’s position. “This is not about independence yes or no,” he said. “This is about a rebellion against the rule of law. And the rule of law is the foundation of coexistence, not only in Spain but in Europe.” Rajoy has vowed to preserve national unity and shown himself willing to invoke article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which allows the central government to take control of an autonomous region if it “does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain”. Invoking the article, which has never been used, would provoke an angry response in Catalonia. Tempers in the region remain high following the Spanish police’s efforts to stop the referendum on 1 October. Officers raided polling stations, beat voters and fired rubber bullets at crowds. Rajoy has said the thousands of Guardia Civil and national police officers originally deployed in Catalonia to prevent the vote will remain there “until things return to normal”. Much could rest on the response of the Mossos d’Esquadra to either a unilateral declaration of independence or the imposition of direct rule from Madrid. Unions representing the two national forces have accused the Mossos of “clear disobedience” and an “unacceptable passivity” when it came to halting the referendum. While the Mossos agreed to seal off polling stations during the referendum, they warned that such actions risked public order. The head of the force, Josep Lluís Trapero, is being investigated for sedition by Spain’s national court amid accusations that the Mossos failed to assist Guardia Civil officers who raided government buildings and arrested 14 Catalan officials last month. According to the Catalan government, 2.3 million of Catalonia’s 5.3 million registered voters cast a ballot in the referendum. A full count has been complicated by the fact that 770,000 votes were lost due to the police disruption."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/10/john-green-turtles-all-way-down-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T06:30:41Z","webTitle":"Turtles All the Way Down by John Green review – a new modern classic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/10/john-green-turtles-all-way-down-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/10/john-green-turtles-all-way-down-review","fields":{"headline":"Turtles All the Way Down by John Green review – a new modern classic","bodyText":"Following the gargantuan success of John Green’s 2012 YA novel The Fault in Our Stars, Turtles All the Way Down is a publishing mega-event. It’s also a book some might find easy to not like. It is sentimental, occasionally cliched and ticks so many teen fiction boxes you sometimes wonder if the author has a form beside him (troubled teen narrator – check; love interest – check; adults who don’t understand – check; quirky best friend - check; scene where boy points out stars to girl – check; topical issue – check). I wondered at first if I wouldn’t like it, but, spoiler alert, I rather did. The story, narrated by a troubled Indianapolis teenager, Aza Holmes, begins as a mystery. Along with her mildly unscrupulous best friend Daisy, Aza decides to search for billionaire Russell Pickett, who has gone missing under a cloud of fraud and bribery accusations, in the hope of pocketing the $100,000 reward money. Early into their search, Aza begins to fall for Russell’s son Davis, who, despite his excessive privileges (including a mansion complete with a cinema) is also troubled: still mourning his mother, who died nine years ago, he now has to deal with his father’s disappearance, and the knowledge that if his dad has died he has left his fortune to his pet reptile (a tuatara, to be precise). There are many places in the first half where it feels as though you are reading a straightforward, even conventional mystery: perhaps a teen Grisham. The missing eccentric billionaire. The murky river. The mansion full of potential secrets. The trails and dead ends. You begin to expect, and predict, major plot twists. But it becomes clear that Green’s main focus is not the mystery – it’s the teenage friendships and love interests and, maybe most of all, Aza’s mental health. Green’s likeable, introverted, neurotic narrator suffers with invasive thoughts that centre around a fear of bacteria and infection. She keeps reopening a wound in a finger to “drain it” of infection. Aza and Daisy inhabit a recognisably teenage world of crushes and double dates, of late night texting and Star Wars fan fiction and conversations about unsolicited dick pics. And like the best of young adult fiction, the book has a deep understanding of what it means to be a teenager. There is a twist, but not a thrillerish one: a twist in the telling, not of what’s told. This is by no means a perfect novel. The mystery and love story and mental health aspects often feel compartmentalised and it is 50 pages too long. Aza can be a repetitive narrator: this may be appropriate for someone who suffers repetitive thoughts, but can make the reading experience frustrating. Some of the recurring mental illness metaphors couldn’t have been hammered harder by Thor himself; it feels as though the illness-as-spiral idea occurs at least once a chapter, and there are more stargazy sentimental Big Moments than at a Coldplay concert. But all this is overridden by the fact that where the author is good, he is very, very good. In short, this novel confirms John Green as a great chronicler of teenage life. He captures the insecurities of youth in the way Judy Blume used to, and he ranks alongside such American masters of teen conversation as SE Hinton and John Hughes. That’s to say, as with the dialogue in The Breakfast Club or The Outsiders, it may not be how young people actually speak, but it is how they might wish to speak – which is possibly more important. Though his characters are troubled and insecure, they articulate themselves with lucidity and wit and geeky self-awareness; conversations zip back and forth like a kind of verbal air hockey. Even Aza’s self-confessed lack of articulation is well articulated by her to the reader. Her obsessions mean there is a lot of germ knowledge – “Around eighty million microbes are exchanged per kiss”, and so on. There is a slight sense that Green wants to show he knows more than his narrator, here and there, which can come across as authorsplaining. However, Aza herself is continually clear and wise on the subject of her predicament: “True terror isn’t being scared; it’s having no choice in the matter.” The novel drips with high and pop cultural references, from The Tempest to Iron Man, via James Joyce and Jupiter Ascending. Green is very good at the inbetween nature of being a teen – existing between education and recreation, childhood and adulthood, online and “IRL”. Green’s characters can be deliberately annoying – such as Daisy, Aza’s overbearing friend – yet you ultimately warm to them as believable, redeemable human beings. The ever-strengthening thought-whirlpools of Aza’s mental illness are well handled, and feel unflinchingly raw and true (according to the author, the novel marks his first attempt to write directly about the kind of mental illness that has affected him since childhood). It often dwells in cliche, but only as pop songs and epic poems do, mining the universal to create something that speaks to the familiar rhythms of the heart. At one point Aza thinks about how the string from one musical instrument can cause the string of another to vibrate, if it’s the same note. That’s what this novel does. It will pluck the strings of those in tune with it. It will resonate with, and comfort, anxious young minds everywhere. It might just be a new modern classic. • Matt Haig’s How to Stop Time is published by Canongate. • Turtles All the Way Down is published by Puffin.

Specialisation has tended to shut down the possibilities of wider speculation. In an interview in 2012, three years before his death at 82 from cancer, he suggested to me that he mourned the passing of the medical practice of telling the story of a life, as well as the progression of a disease, the way in which case histories were being eclipsed by “diagnostics, which causes doctors to simply tick off criteria without ever once describing a particular patient in detail”. Sacks had particular reason to place his faith in the importance of thinking of a patient in all his or her possibility. The miracle of his application of the drug L-dopa to catatonic patients, described in Awakenings, was as much the result of his wider curiosity about consciousness, and his human tenderness, as his chance encounter with the chemistry of that drug in another context. The autobiography he completed just before his death revealed the roots of that humanity in a sort of Wordsworthian childhood wonder, a sense that he clung to and expanded throughout his scientific life. Along with that book, Sacks left instruction for this collection of essays to be issued after his death. You can see why he did so. The essays – which dwell on his scientific heroes: Darwin, William James, Freud and others – locate him exactly and properly on the margins between experimental discovery and literature, head and heart. The delight of his meditation on Darwin and the Meaning of Flowers, the opening essay here, lies not only in its acute examination of evolutionary theory, but also in his love of Darwin’s method. In trying to understand how reproduction occurred in flowers, Darwin “painstakingly tried acting as a pollinator himself, lying face down on the lawn and transferring pollen” between primroses with different stigmas and styles before collecting the seeds to discover that the healthiest plants came from cross-bred varieties. Sacks loves these details because he shared the excitement of them. He was desperate as a child – as Darwin had been – to observe a plant growing in real time, the way climbers set out tendrils as if they had eyes to find suitable support. He set up time-lapse cameras in his garden to watch how ferns unfurled “their tightly wound crosiers or fiddleheads, tense with contained time, like watchsprings with the future all rolled up in them”. He delights in Darwin’s obsessive efforts to anatomise the “mind” of earthworms, and Freud’s early drawings that proved the nerve cells in jellyfish and crayfish were basically similar to those of human beings. Sacks’s enthusiasms are so finely and conversationally expressed as to be entirely seductive. Each essay contains a careful lifetime of observation and reading. His account of the action of false memory takes you from his own experiences – real and conjured – during the blitz to the Freudian “slippages and errors of memory that occur in everyday life” to the mysteries of unconscious plagiarism and borrowing in everyone from George Harrison to Helen Keller. His accumulated wisdom of our experience of time and consciousness, meanwhile, which the essays worry at and return to, makes a marvellous discrete series of meditations – and a profoundly moving one, since several of these pieces were written with the knowledge that his experience of both mysteries was soon coming to an end. • The River of Consciousness by Oliver Sacks is published by Picador (£18.99).

Last year at least 542,000 Britons considered themselves vegan, up from about 150,000 10 years ago, according to the Vegan Society. Although more than one in 10 (11%) of UK consumers have tried a vegan diet, that figure rises to 20% for the under-35s, according to a February 2017 report from Mintel. “Plant proteins have gained a lot of traction in the UK in recent years, thanks to their associations with naturalness and nutritious credentials,” says Emma Clifford, senior food and drink analyst at Mintel. Vegan businesses are sprouting up across the UK to service this demand. Between 2012 and 2016, there was a 185% jump in the number of vegan products launched in the UK, while 9% of food products launched in the UK in last year carried a vegan claim, up from 3% in 2012, according to Mintel. Consumers’ aspirations for healthier lifestyles are helping to drive this, says Clifford. “Vegan products in particular have moved into the focus of public attention, capturing the imagination of consumers on health-related as well as ethical and religious grounds.” Devout vegans Kelly Slade and Chrissy Leyland helped organise the Vegan Pledge campaign, where participants try going vegan for one month, before launching subscription-based business Vegan Tuck Box in 2013. “Meeting lots of wannabe vegans gave us lots of useful insights into the challenges people face when transitioning to a vegan diet,” Slade says. “We discovered that finding quality vegan snacks can be a stumbling block to achieving a more compassionate lifestyle. Some also find reading labels time consuming and are unsure of which products are vegan.” The problem presented a business opportunity, and they came up with the idea for monthly subscription boxes filled with up to eight different snacks, from vegan chocolates to kale crisps. Prices start from £9.50 per month. Slade says that Vegan Tuck Box, which sends out more than 800 boxes every month, plans to launch a letterbox-friendly snack box in the near future. Vegan school friends Henry Firth and Ian Theasby started their Facebook food channel Bosh! in June last year after experiencing difficulties finding enticing vegan recipes. “Traditionally, vegan food has been seen as boring,” says Firth. “It doesn’t have to be. It can be easy to make and we wanted to share that.” Thanks to its inspiring videos of easy-to-whip-up recipes, such as a vegan kebab and a guacamole potato salad, Bosh! has racked up almost 1.4m likes on Facebook. “We’re surprised and humbled by the success,” says Firth. “I think we’ve nailed the format – we instantly had high-quality content and good recipes. But there’s a growing tide of people interested in eating more plants, and not just vegans.” Earlier this year, the duo secured a six-figure book deal with HarperCollins; their vegan recipe book will be published in April. However, it’s still early days for the startup. The pair have other jobs and share a house in east London where they have a studio for filming. “We’re keeping costs ridiculously low,” adds Firth. Companies worldwide are drumming up alternative ways to get people to try vegan food. In San Francisco, start-up Le Cupboard has launched vegan vending machines offering everything from lentil and baby spinach salad to chia pudding with strawberries. “It’s not about pushing veganism,” insists Lamiaa Bounahmidi, chief executive and co-founder of Le Cupboard’s parent company, Looly. The aim of the business, she says, is to help people organise their lives around healthy meals. Bounahmidi prefers to use the term “plant-based” food because vegan does not necessarily mean healthy. “Oreo is vegan, but fully processed and full of sugar,” she says. She says she opted for vending machines because “stores are not rooted in the mobile reality of today”, adding: “I don’t want customers to be having to pay towards my rent. We want to offer more value and super-fresh food everyday that’s cheaper than if you were making it yourself.” Bounahmidi, who raised $2.5m in funding two years ago, says her goal is to launch vending machines in public spaces across the city and beyond. “We want to offer this wherever people are stuck [in finding healthy food].” Although many vegan businesses are booming – Temple of Seitan, the UK’s first vegan chicken shop, has attracted long queues of devotees for example – Slade says running a vegan business can be problematic. “As veganism is still in the minority we are a very niche business, and sometimes finding advice can be difficult.” Anyone looking to launch a vegan enterprise should consider joining one of the rising number of vegan markets across the UK, such as Broadway Vegan Market in Hackney. Dominika Piasecka, a spokeswoman for the Vegan Society, adds that startups should engage the online vegan community too. “There is no better promotion for your business than a happy vegan posting about it on social media and recommending it to their friends,” she says. The market may be small but it’s fast-growing, as even more high-profile people, including Jeremy Corbyn, back the movement. “The plant-protein trend is still in its early stage with ripe opportunities for further development as it gathers momentum in the mainstream,” says Clifford."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/11/connor-sparrowhawk-justice-laughing-boy-death-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T06:30:04Z","webTitle":"My son Connor Sparrowhawk died needlessly.

Anger spurred me into action","bodyText":"Getting accountability or justice for Connor’s death in Slade House assessment and treatment unit was to be a gargantuan task as Southern Health NHS foundation trust continued the fight to protect its reputation. Nearly four months after Connor (nicknamed Laughing Boy), 18, had been found unconscious in the bath at the unit after he’d had a seizure and drowned on 4 July 2013, the trust commissioned an independent investigation into what happened. Our concerns before its publication were stacking up, partly through the careful scrutiny of documentation from trust meetings and commentary from a growing number of people on social media. This group, which became known as “Team LB”, included George Julian, a freelance knowledge transfer consultant, members of Oxfordshire self-advocacy group My Life My Choice, and professor Chris Hatton who published a bespoke blog, Data for LB. Many more people offered support through my blog and via Facebook, and some time in February 2014 these streams coalesced into a #JusticeforLB campaign with a blog, hashtag and Twitter feed. It was followed by social workers, students, academics from a range of disciplines, self-advocacy and advocacy groups, journalists, documentary film-makers, charities, health professionals, parents and carers, and data protection and human rights specialists. This diversity was to be a great strength. The trust’s independent investigation was published just after 6pm on 24 February 2014. Before the advent of social media, people would have pretty much gone home by then, but Twitter doesn’t close. Outrage was generated by the incontrovertible evidence that a young man had been failed by an NHS trust, despite initial claims that he had died of natural causes. The report, together with the failings identified by the Care Quality Commission inspection, painted a picture of an NHS unit bereft of leadership, the most basic of healthcare provision and an almost wanton carelessness around the lives, and deaths, of patients. Connor hadn’t had a chance. The level of care was negligible. The report authors defined Connor’s death as preventable because the unit staff had both knowledge (that Connor was diagnosed with epilepsy) and opportunity (Connor’s previous seizure on 19 May) “to take steps to stop the incident from happening and did not do so”. As I read the report in familiar tears, one extract from the minutes of a meeting on 3 June 2013 made me pause. It described a discussion about Connor saying he’d “remembered” biting his tongue. By this stage the documentation, records, email exchanges and minutes replayed across my eyelids like a remorseless and relentless ticker tape when I tried and failed to sleep. Experience gained through pretty much 18 years of negotiating, and trying to keep on top of, various appointments, reports, blows and pronouncements relating to Connor had seamlessly shifted to a post-death mastery of the micro-detail of records, documentation and other minutiae that related to his time in the unit and earlier. I knew I had not read anything about Connor remembering that he bit his tongue in anger. It turned out that, instead of full sets of minutes for some of the weekly team meetings, we had been sent “notes”. These did not include reference to the tongue biting. So we had no idea that Connor’s seizure activity was dismissed in a meeting four weeks before he died. We had no idea that Dr Valerie Murphy [the lead clinician responsible for Connor’s care], agreed to reduce his observations to hourly given there was “no evidence” of any seizure activity. I can barely type these words as I feel such incredulity, rage and deep sadness at the grotesque absurdity of these actions. In desperation I tweeted David Nicholson, then chief executive of NHS England, who agreed to meet. The night before myself and [my partner] Rich banged out The Connor Manifesto – a document showing what justice for Connor but also for other learning-disabled people in NHS care looks like and presented it to him. He agreed to one of the main points: to commission an investigation into the death of all patients with mental ill health or learning disabilities between 2011 and 2015. This investigation was to become known as the Mazars review. . A remarkable sense of collectivity and generosity was generated by those rallying against what had happened to Connor. Just weeks after the investigation was published, we launched #107daysofaction, to coincide with the first anniversary of Connor’s admission to the unit in which he spent the last 107 days of his life. We asked people to adopt one of these 107 days to raise awareness, fundraise or do whatever they wanted to do. There were no rules and little planning other than matching empty days to people asking to adopt them, and setting up a new website, #107daysofaction. We asked people to share a few words about why they wanted to adopt the day and to focus on the positive. The first day of the campaign was marked by a hard-hitting account in the Guardian of what had happened to Connor and of our family’s experiences, as well as providing a broader analysis of the experiences and treatment of learning-disabled people in the UK. Day 9, Fiona Fisher, parent carer, wrote: “I first ‘met’ Sara and LB on Twitter and we soon chatted passionately and amicably about our common loves and hates about being mums to incredible dudes with additional needs. I feel utterly inadequate to the task of capturing anything but the tiniest flavour of horror, outrage and disgust that LB died a preventable death … but there’s also the feeling of tenacity, forensic analysis and solidarity among the #JusticeforLB posse.” Day 83, Alicia Wood wrote: “Housing and Support Alliance is supporting #JusticeforLB because Connor and his family only wanted something simple and straightforward – to get the help they needed and had a right to in difficult times – and it ended in the most unimaginable tragedy. We know that people with learning disabilities who have the most complicated needs can and do get good help, a good place to live and the support they need to live there. It is doable and affordable, yet all over the country there are still many people with learning disabilities and families getting poor and mediocre support, being sent away from the people they love because there is no decent support locally and being needlessly hospitalised when all they need is for professionals to listen and respond. It is an outrage.” Each contribution was, in its own way, magical. It was as if the format – no fuss, no pressure, just do something – gave people the freedom and confidence to step up and get involved. People clearly thought carefully about what they could do, often referencing Connor’s enthusiasms which they had come to know through my blog. London buses regularly featured, and a group of mothers arranged a day trip to Connor’s favourite bus museum. Two double-decker red school buses and a Scania truck were named after him. There were blogposts, academic presentations and lectures, a balloon launch, an animation by David Harling called Far Beyond the Pale, an EP; a hair competition; a performance dedicated to Connor by comedians John Williams and King Cnut, and sporting activities, including one by 15-year-old Madi Barnicoat who canoed over 100 miles to the House of Commons with a photo of Connor on her back. The magic spread to New Zealand where a group of Brownies drew buses in chalk on the playground. A letter, signed by 600 people, was published in The Guardian on 12 June 2014 on the day of a House of Lords debate into the premature deaths of people with learning disabilities. It called for support for people with learning disabilities and/or autism and their families to be based on four basic principles including respecting, valuing and working closely with families and others who care about the person, and making sure that commissioners and providers are using the best available evidence to make decisions. The whole campaign was an unexpected but much-welcomed distraction countering the constant companions of despair, blackness and heartbreak. We left Day 107, the first anniversary of Connor’s death, unplanned as we couldn’t bear to think about it. In the end, we suggested that people changed their Twitter profile photos to a black and white picture of Connor in a white shirt and jacket at his school prom to mark the day. We spent that day at home. I dipped into Twitter a few times as my iPad beeped constant notifications; it was astonishing to see Connor’s photo spread across my timeline. When I eventually fell into bed in the early hours of the morning, beyond sad, drunk and exhausted, I couldn’t believe the support for the final day of the campaign.

Now scientists claim that the stereotype is supported by evidence that the brain’s reward system may be geared towards more “prosocial” behaviour in women. “It was known that women and men behave differently, but it was not known why, or how this comes about in the brain,” said Philippe Tobler, associate professor of neuroeconomics and social neuroscience at the University of Zurich, and co-author of the research. The team note it is not clear whether the gender differences they see in the brain’s reward system are in any way “innate”, or whether they are the result of social pressures, but in short: women seem to get more of a chemical reward for being generous than men do. “It is known that girls receive different kinds of feedback than boys for being prosocial,” said Tobler. “It is perfectly conceivable that [the root of the differences here are] only cultural – we simply don’t know.” Writing in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, Tobler and colleagues from Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands carried out two studies looking at whether dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the brain’s reward system, is linked to different social behaviours in men and women. In the first, a group of 56 men and women were randomly allocated to two groups, and either given a placebo or amisulpride – a drug that blocks the action of dopamine in the brain. Neither the scientists nor the participants knew which pill was taken. The participants were then presented with a hypothetical situation in which they could either claim a wad of cash for themselves, or split a chunk of money evenly with another person, ranging from someone close to a complete stranger. After completing the task, the experiment was repeated with participants taking the alternative pill. The results revealed that when taking the placebo, 51% of the time women chose to share the money, while for men the figure was lower, at 40%. But after taking the amisulpride, women were less keen to share, while men became more prosocial, opting to split the cash 45% and 44% of the time respectively. In the second study, the team looked at data from 40 men and women who had undergone brain imaging while undertaking decisions on whether to share money, focussing on the activity of a value-processing region of the brain that relies on dopamine signalling. The team found that when making prosocial choices, activity in this brain region was stronger for women than men, suggesting a greater dopamine response. The researchers say that, taken together, the studies support the idea that the dopamine-based reward system is geared towards sharing behaviour in women and more selfish behaviour in men. But others are far from convinced by the findings. Gina Rippon, professor of cognitive neuroimaging at Aston University who was not involved in the work, said that while intriguing, the results were “questionable”. Among her concerns, she notes that the data from the first study does not show that women are particularly prosocial, pointing out under placebo they were split almost 50:50 for prosocial and selfish choices, adding that the effects of taking amisulpride were small. Rippon also pointed out that the imaging study pooled results from two different groups of participants, using two different scanners and two slightly different versions of the task. However, Angela Saini, author of Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong said that the results showed how closely intertwined biology and culture are. “We know that girls and women are socially expected to behave in different ways from boys and men. We encourage girls to be kinder, gentler and more generous, because these are seen as female virtues,” she said. “It shouldn’t really come as a surprise that research like this shows that women tend to show a greater reward response to this kind of behaviour.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/09/lost-in-la-mancha-jean-rochefort-french-actor-dies-terry-gilliam","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T12:34:08Z","webTitle":"Lost in La Mancha's Jean Rochefort, veteran French actor, dies at 87","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/lost-in-la-mancha-jean-rochefort-french-actor-dies-terry-gilliam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/09/lost-in-la-mancha-jean-rochefort-french-actor-dies-terry-gilliam","fields":{"headline":"Lost in La Mancha's Jean Rochefort, veteran French actor, dies at 87","bodyText":"Jean Rochefort, the French actor who played a key role in one of the most ill-fated movie sagas in Hollywood history, has died aged 87, his daughter said on Monday. Rochefort was a French national treasure when he was cast to play Don Quixote in 1998 by the former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, who dreamed of bringing Cervantes’ “unfilmable” novel to the big screen. But the wildly ambitious project – in which Johnny Depp was to play a marketing executive sent back in time who the elderly knight mistakes for his squire, Sancho Panza – quickly began to fall apart. The veteran actor was struck by a prostrate infection on the first day of shooting in Spain which left him in agony on the back of his half-starved horse. Then on the second day a flash flood washed away the sets. Four days later the production collapsed when Rochefort had to be airlifted to hospital for surgery for a double hernia. Over the next two decades Gilliam failed seven times to get the project off the ground again, and his doomed efforts to revive it became the subject of an acclaimed documentary, Lost in La Mancha. But last year Amazon finally agreed to fund the film and The Man Who Killed Don Quixote – without Rochefort – is due for release in 2018. Rochefort was withering about working with Gilliam, telling French television in 2014 that the American director had starved his horse before shooting began to make it look haggard. An experienced horseman, Rochefort said he was shocked to see “the people around me had apples tied to their backs” so the horse would follow them. He said the horse died the day after he left the set. Rochefort was a mainstay of the French film industry for more than half a century, appearing in comedies and popular blockbusters as well as art films. He won three Césars - the French answer to the Oscars - the first for Bertrand Tavernier’s 1975 costume drama Let Joy Reign Supreme and another three years later for the naval drama Le Crabe-Tambour (Drummer-Crab). A lifetime achievement César followed in 1999. Famous for his wit and self-deprecating humour, he later joked: “I am part of [French] national heritage. There is Bayonne ham, [Philippe] Noiret, [Jean-Pierre] Marielle and me,” in reference to two other well-known ageing actors. Born in Paris to prosperous parents, Rochefort claimed to have had a deadly dull childhood in the western city of Nantes. “Lord, I was bored as a child,” he said. Listening to the radio sparked his interest in theatre, and he fled to study acting in Paris. His movie breakthrough did not come till he was nearly 30, however. Roles in movies such as Angelique and Le Masque de Fer (The Iron Mask) followed, and director Yves Robert began casting him on a regular basis, starting with Le Grand Blond avec une Chaussure Noire (The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe) in 1972. The lugubrious-faced actor had a major international hit in 1990 with The Hairdresser’s Husband, directed by Patrice Leconte, and subsequently acted in a number of Leconte’s better know films, including Ridicule and The Man on the Train. Aside from his appearance in Lost in La Mancha, Anglo-American audiences might recognise him from cameos in Robert Altman’s Pret a Porter, and as the waiter who presents Rowan Atkinson with a plate of shellfish in Mr Bean’s Holiday. He formally retired after starring in his last film Floride (Florida) in 2015, playing a former industrialist who appears to be suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. “I do not want to make horror films, so I had better stop,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/11/blade-runner-2049-to-bond-25-denis-villeneuve-director","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Blade Runner 2049 to Bond 25: yes, Mr Villeneuve, we expect you to direct","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/blade-runner-2049-to-bond-25-denis-villeneuve-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/11/blade-runner-2049-to-bond-25-denis-villeneuve-director","fields":{"headline":"Blade Runner 2049 to Bond 25: yes, Mr Villeneuve, we expect you to direct","bodyText":"Sam Mendes may have done more than just reload 007’s Walther PPK with box-office bullets when he took on Skyfall five years ago. For decades, Bond production company Eon vacillated between recruiting indie directors with a handful of arthouse hits on their hands (Quantum of Solace’s Marc Forster; Die Another Day’s Lee Tamahori) and tried and tested industry stalwarts (Casino Royale and GoldenEye’s Martin Campbell; The World Is Not Enough’s Michael Apted). But in the wake of Mendes’ success in taking Bond past the $1bn mark for the first time, then almost repeating the feat with 2015’s Spectre, an entirely new calibre of film-maker is being mentioned to take charge of 2019’s 25th official 007 movie. While suggestions that Christopher Nolan might be prepared to take on Her Majesty’s top suave super spy seem to be little more than wishful thinking, whispers surrounding the involvement of Blade Runner 2049’s Denis Villeneuve appear to be more grounded. Villeneuve was named by Deadline in July as a frontrunner to take over from Mendes, and the Daily Mail’s well-connected Baz Bamigboye reported last month that the French-Canadian director of Sicario and Arrival was Daniel Craig’s top choice for the role. Both Nolan and Villeneuve are members of a rare coterie of Hollywood film-makers who have proven themselves both as directors of original, intelligent cinema and as trusted carriers of the franchise flame. Warner Bros is still struggling to reinvent Batman five years after Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy closed, and Villeneuve has just resurrected a 35-year-old sci-fi saga to rapturous critical acclaim (even if the film’s US box office looks pretty disappointing). Like Mendes, both men know how to play the studio game. Nolan would never have been given the greenbacks to film brainteasing sci-fi blockbuster Inception, or this year’s Dunkirk, had he not proven his box-office clout with a trilogy of hit superhero movies. Likewise, Villeneuve and Mendes will find their personal projects easier to greenlight now that they have proven their value to studios desperate to inject the rarefied alchemy of visionary film-making into safer franchise fare. Looking at the other mooted candidates for Bond 25, neither has quite the same standing. David Mackenzie’s Hell or High Water is a fine modern spin on the western, while Yann Demange’s ’71 is a lean and muscular Troubles-set thriller with just the right balance of genre thrills and historical grit. But Blade Runner 2049’s mesmerising visuals and its sheer echoing, cerebrum-twisting existential weight suggest Villeneuve has the chops to not just keep 007 rolling along nicely but take the suave spy to another level entirely. His partnership with 13-times Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins also bodes well, for the Bond series has perhaps never equalled for bravura visual eloquence the dazzling Deakins-shot sequences in which 007’s adventures took place against the ice-blue cityscapes of Shanghai and golden, gilded opulence of Macau. Spectre, while a beautifully shot movie in its own right, did not get audiences’ eyes shooting out on stalks in quite the same way. It is surely these little touches of quality that help elevate franchise films to a higher status, and Villeneuve has proven he has what it takes. The problem with increased expectations, of course, is that it becomes tougher to meet them. With luck, Eon chiefs Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson will have learned from the mistakes of Bond’s past, when safer film-makers were perhaps recruited because producers knew working with relative Hollywood ingenues or industry veterans would help them retain greater creative control. The noughties’ answer to Villeneuve and Nolan was Peter Jackson, who was once considered for 1999’s The World Is Not Enough – before the director’s Oscar-winning success with Lords of the Rings – but was ultimately passed over in favour of the more experienced Michael Apted. The result was a movie that continued a Brosnan-era decline for 007 that would not be reversed until Daniel Craig’s debut in 2006’s Casino Royale. If producers truly want Craig’s stint in Her Majesty’s hot seat to end on a high, there can be no other choice than Villeneuve. The director says he would love to get the job, though he also suggests he is unable to talk about his interest in Bond for undisclosed reasons. Let’s hope that’s because the powers-that-be have already invited the director to Bond HQ and forced him to sign the film-making equivalent of the Official Secrets Act – because he’s about to be announced as 007’s next director."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/09/greens-still-have-potential-to-change-politics-says-co-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T15:14:30Z","webTitle":"Greens still have potential to change politics, says co-leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/greens-still-have-potential-to-change-politics-says-co-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/09/greens-still-have-potential-to-change-politics-says-co-leader","fields":{"headline":"Greens still have potential to change politics, says co-leader","bodyText":"The Greens are hurting after losing half their votes at the general election but have the potential to become the most influential party in 21st-century politics, Jonathan Bartley, the party’s co-leader, has claimed. Bartley, who shares his job with MP Caroline Lucas, said the Greens had suffered from a return of two-party politics after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, successfully wooed many of its voters and its candidates stood aside in 22 areas to help other parties beat the Conservatives. Defending the party’s strategy, Bartley said the decision for candidates to stand aside had been “brave” and argued that “if the other parties had been willing to work with us, Theresa May wouldn’t be sitting in No 10 today”. Speaking at the Green party’s annual conference in Harrogate, Yorkshire, he said: “It hurt. And I know many of us still feel that hurt. I do. But conference let’s not forget what we achieved together. Our ideas and policies are now common currency. Part of the mainstream. We achieved the party’s second best general election result. And we helped deny Theresa May her majority and her mandate.” The party gained 1.6% of the vote in the June poll, compared with 3.8% in 2015, and made no inroads in target seats such as Bristol West and Norwich South, where the incumbent Labour MPs increased their majorities. But Bartley gave his party credit for the policies adopted by Corbyn’s Labour party, which appeared to be popular with the electorate. “Where we lead, others follow. Our London assembly members forced a living wage. Our MEPs stood up for refugees when others stood back. And in parliament, we have consistently kept climate change on the agenda,” he said. “And you know what? I believe we will be the most influential party in 21st-century politics.” He went on to attack the Conservatives as a party “led by a zombie prime minister” and “rotten to its core”. But he saved his biggest attack for the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, whom he described as a “poison” at the core of the Conservative movement. “In many ways he is a joke. But then you listen to what he’s actually saying. Let’s not pretend that Boris Johnson’s comments about dead bodies in Libya was an aberration. It wasn’t,” Bartley said. “This is the man who calls Barack Obama ‘part Kenyan’ with ‘ancestral dislike’ of the UK. Who describes people from the Congo as having ‘watermelon smiles’. Calls Commonwealth citizens ‘flag-waving piccaninnies’.” Referring to when Johnson was editor of the Spectator and the magazine suggested Liverpudlians were wallowing in their “victim status” after the Hillsborough tragedy, he said: “This is not new bigotry. It’s old. It’s unacceptable. And it’s time the Conservative party took collective responsibility for this human wrecking ball and kicked him out of the cabinet.” The party’s four-day conference has not approved many major new policies, but Bartley highlighted a vote by delegates in favour of a new bank holiday for Windrush Day on 22 June to mark the contribution of migrants to the UK. Other sessions at the conference are focused on the decision to step aside for Labour and Lib Dem candidates, which hit Green votes. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Bartley defended the move, saying it was “a very bold thing to do”. He said: “We’ve seen a profound change in British politics as a result of what happened. “Many commentators suggest that if we hadn’t stood aside, if local parties hadn’t made those decisions, we wouldn’t have the hung parliament now, we wouldn’t have seen the change of agenda that we’re seeing from the government. A profound impact – I think it was worth it.” But he said there was “a whole lot of difference between us and Labour” on policy, citing the Greens’ opposition to new nuclear power stations, Trident, and support for free movement of people, a shorter working week and a universal basic income. “There is a huge agenda which Labour are not taking on board,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2017/oct/11/why-wont-ministers-acknowledge-social-cares-growing-emergency","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T06:48:09Z","webTitle":"Why won’t ministers acknowledge social care's growing emergency?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/11/why-wont-ministers-acknowledge-social-cares-growing-emergency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/11/why-wont-ministers-acknowledge-social-cares-growing-emergency","fields":{"headline":"Why won’t ministers acknowledge social care's growing emergency?","bodyText":"How close to the brink is the social care system? In the severest warning yet that it is fast becoming unsustainable, council leaders will on Wednesday warn that their ability to support older and disabled people is “veering steadily towards the impossible”. The picture in children’s services is no better. The body representing directors of those services reports that their ability to make any impact at all on the lives of 4 million children living below the poverty line is increasingly constrained by relentless funding cuts. As leaders of both children’s and adult services in England meet this week in Bournemouth for their annual joint conference, they will reflect ruefully on the deafening silence from last week’s Conservative party gathering in terms of any relevant policy or funding initiative. Most alarming for the adult sector was the complete absence from the prime minister’s ill-fated conference address of any reference to the system reform that had been flagged in the party’s general election manifesto, promising “dignity and protection in old age”. It was left to social care minister Jackie Doyle-Price to announce that the consultation trailed in the Queen’s speech in June would not begin until 2018. Mark Lever, co-chair of the Care and Support Alliance, a grouping of more than 80 care charities, describes the news as incredibly disappointing: “This year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of the royal commission on care and there have been 12 separate consultations and reviews since then. Yet the big questions on funding have repeatedly been dodged and the system is on its knees.” Twelve months ago, the adult sector was described by its regulator, the Care Quality Commission, as “approaching a tipping point”. In a report on Wednesday, the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, will lament that “inertia remains the characteristic we typically associate with the prospects for future funding and reform”. While welcoming the £2bn one-off emergency cash injection unveiled in the spring budget, the LGA says the sector still needs £1.3bn immediately to help stabilise the care provider market. It also projects a £1bn funding gap by 2020 – not accounting for further cost pressures, such as the question of who will pay for care workers to receive the full minimum wage when doing sleep-in shifts. Izzi Seccombe, who chairs the LGA’s community wellbeing board and is Tory leader of Warwickshire county council, says: “Councils have a proud record of getting on with the job of delivering for their local residents, and doing so in partnership, but it is no exaggeration to say that the circumstances are now veering steadily towards the impossible.” Seccombe’s reference to partnership is pointed. Relations between local government and the NHS have soured in recent weeks amid recriminations over responsibility for delayed hospital discharges of older patients and intense government pressure to clear beds in time for a feared winter flu crisis. The LGA is furious that some councils deemed to be not pulling their weight face penalties. One example given in Wednesday’s report is Sheffield council. Despite being one of the 20 authorities with the highest rates of delayed discharge locally, it has nearly halved the daily number of hospital beds occupied by people medically fit to go home – but held up by issues such as arrangement of a social care package – from 171 in February to 90 in July. A survey by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services of about 100 councils, also released on Wednesday, will reveal that some have already been fined – by up to £100,000 – since April for causing delayed discharges. More than half are expecting to be overspent on adult social care in 2017-18. Amid mounting concern over the fragile state of the homecare market, 48% of the councils surveyed say that homecare providers have handed back contracts in the past five months because they cannot fulfil them or make them pay. That’s up on the 37% who said the same in a previous survey in the spring. More than 45% of councils say they find it difficult to find homecare providers, while 20% report difficulty securing places in residential homes and 52% say spaces in nursing homes are hard to come by. The Association of Directors of Children’s Services will use the Bournemouth conference to set out an eight-point plan for government to tackle poverty, including making good what the LGA forecasts will be a £2bn shortfall in funding of the children’s sector by 2020.

The big picture Brexit talks are under way again in Brussels but, after a calamitous few days in Manchester last week that saw the future of her mandate openly questioned, all eyes in Britain were on the prime minister’s statement on Brexit in the House of Commons. Theresa May said nothing very new, reiterating that Britain was leaving the European Union, that “good progress” was being made in all aspects of the talks, that the UK wanted a “dynamic, creative and unique” partnership with the bloc, and the ball was now in the EU’s court. She did, though, confirm the line from her speech in Florence that the European court of justice would continue to have jurisdiction during any transition period. This pleased British business, but risked upsetting Brexit-backers. However, both the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, took to social media to say, in effect, it was a price worth paying for the prize – as Britain’s ultimate status – of a clean, hard Brexit well clear of the EU’s orbit. There was more to appease the hardliners. The government also published two Brexit white papers, including one outlining detailed contingency plans that would see a raft of regulations imposed on business to cope with new customs arrangements, a legal vacuum and potential chaos at Britain’s borders if the UK crashes out without a deal. Pro-Brexit ministers and MPs generally liked the sound of that, because it suggests the prime minister is seriously entertaining the idea of walking away from Brexit talks without an agreement. The view from Europe The EU27 remain frustrated. Cabinet in-fighting makes the UK an unreliable negotiating partner and unable to convince the EU that any agreement it reaches will survive, the former Irish prime minister, John Bruton, said: If it gets into detail, the disagreement between cabinet members is so deep that the Conservative party would split and the government would fall. Labour has a similar problem. UK party and public opinion has been polarised and is unready for compromise. EU diplomats, while encouraged by British concessions on the financial settlement and citizens’ rights, are grappling with how to deal with a weakened British prime minister who they believe has made compromises but has not gone far enough. They also believe (and, indeed, have said) that the ball is in the UK’s court. But it is pretty much a foregone conclusion in Brussels that EU leaders will decide at their 19 October summit that more time is needed to sort out the divorce before moving on to trade talks – and even then, Brussels believes the UK does not know what it wants. As one source told my colleague Jennifer Rankin: The May cabinet needed a whole summer to get clarity on the transition. I think they will need three or four months of infighting to decide on the future relationship. Denmark’s finance minister, Kristian Jensen, however, said the EU’s wrangling over the UK’s divorce bill was “a game” that required swift political compromise and that both sides should be ready to move the talks on: In any political negotiations, there is not enough time, not enough money, not enough this, not enough that. This is part of the game. Because what we are dealing with here is not rocket science. Meanwhile, back in Westminster With MPs back in Westminster following the post-conference recess, talk of a challenge to May’s leadership has switched to endless protestations of loyalty. Some background rumblings about a challenge were forced to the surface when party whips in effect outed Grant Shapps, the former party chairman and now backbench MP, as the source of the half-hearted rebellion. As Shapps toured the broadcast studios to claim the support of around 30 fellow MP, most other Conservatives almost literally lined up to be rude about him, saying he had scant support and was little more than a bitter former minister. Parallel talk from some MPs then switched to the idea that Johnson should be dismissed for disloyalty, something May is viewed as being too weak to do, while hardliners in turn demanded the demise of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, seen as altogether too soft on Brexit. The next stage was an all-round insistence that all is well. Johnson himself responded to a fresh round of briefings by “friends” that he would refuse to be demoted by May, taking to the Tory MPs’ WhatsApp group to denounce such supposed allies, insisting they did not speak for him. And Labour? As you might expect, they have spent much of the past week trying to sit as quietly as possible, for fear of distracting attention from the Conservative in-fighting. You should also know ... UK ministers deeply pessimistic about Brexit talks progress. Brexit should be stopped if we get poor deal, says Nick Clegg.

Read these: In the Guardian, Jessica Simor says legal advice shows that article 50 allows EU member states to change their mind on withdrawal from the bloc and the government must make that advice public: Article 50 provides for the notification – not of withdrawal but of an “intention” to withdraw. In law, an “intention” is not a binding commitment; it can be changed or withdrawn ... It is important that this advice is made available to parliament as soon as possible. At any point from now, but certainly when parliament is finally faced with the likely reality; a bad deal or no deal at all, it must act in the interests of the people and order the prime minister to revoke the notification. It can do this whether or not the government says so; parliament is sovereign ... The British public needs to understand that there is now a small window of time in which we still have it in our power to retain the fundamental rights and freedoms that the EU treaty guarantees us, our children and our businesses and in so doing, to protect the future happiness and prosperity of our country. Jonathan Freedland says the Tories are tearing themselves apart over a hard Brexit, focused entirely on leaving Europe as dramatically as possible – at the expense of their own grasp on power: Conference delegates cheered any speaker who promised the hardest possible Brexit: the more cliff-edge the departure, the better, even though crashing out on WTO terms would be a devastating shock to the UK economy and would destroy the electoral hopes of the government that did it. The applause was ecstatic. For the Europhobes, no Brexit is ever quite hard enough. Not content that Britain is walking out on our nearest neighbours and most important trading partners, they insist we slam the door shut – and give a two-fingered salute on our way out. If a leadership contest happens, it will – yet again – be a proxy battle over Europe, the same issue that has poisoned the Tory party, and with it British political life, for decades. It has become the acid in the eyes of British Conservatism, blinding them not only to the national interest but to their own principles – and even their loosening grip on power.

Britain, said the national security strategy hastily written by the incoming Tory government, should have the ability to zap any location on the planet. Now, as the government trawls through the defence budget to try to find ways to plug a £20bn hole, the entire concept is being held up to ridicule. It is our already depleted navy that’s getting zapped. Two Royal Navy amphibious landing ships – HMS Bulwark and HMS Albion – are being considered for the chop, together with 28 brand-new Wildcat helicopters, designed for warfare against ships and submarines. Other options include cutting 1,000 soldiers from the Royal Marines, on top of 200 lost already, and scrapping the helicopter ship HMS Ocean. The move has prompted outrage in south-west England, where much of the Royal Navy is based and was, it emerged last week, the trigger for the resignation of the commander of the UK’s maritime forces. Predictably, even backbench Tories are now agitating to save this or that favoured segment of the military. What is needed is something much more radical: to scrap the policy of “global reach” and start afresh. The strategic defence review and the accompanying strategy statement were hailed in 2015 as a triumph of process. Guided by the cabinet’s two least inspiring figures – Philip Hammond as foreign secretary and Michael Fallon at the Ministry of Defence – Britain managed to re-commit itself to a vast military presence east of the Suez canal without anybody in parliament seeming to notice. On top of that, it had begun the conversion of the two army units into “strike brigades”, designed to invade other countries by land or sea. And it had committed the UK to both replacing the Trident missile submarines and deploying both of the new aircraft carriers commissioned under Gordon Brown. The only thing missing amid the flurry of maps and organograms, was a clear understanding of the evolving threats to Britain. These, as we now understand, are the jihadi terrorism of Islamic State and the hybrid warfare being waged against all western democracies by Vladimir Putin. Even in 2015 it was clear that the major and strategic threat to the global order came from unilateral actions by Moscow. Crimea had been annexed, Ukraine for all practical purposes partitioned and the mass murder of passengers on MH17 traced to Russian backed and armed rebels. Yet the security strategy busied itself with trade issues, the aid budget, a vanity naval base in Bahrain and training missions to Malaysia and Singapore. At the core of the strategy was the protection of a “rules-based international order and its institutions”. But since 2015, two rather big holes have appeared in that rules-based order. First, British voters decided to break up one of its vital institutions, the EU; then the Kremlin manipulated the US electoral system so effectively that a man under investigation for links with Russian intelligence is now commander-in-chief of the US military. The rules-based order is in disarray; the UK’s place in it uncertain – and the UK’s military capabilities are being slashed piecemeal to the diktats of an austerity budget that does not make sense. As to the foreign secretary – the person nominally in charge of handling these problems – it does not seem likely that he will be around long enough to apply his mind to them. The whole situation calls for a rethink and it looks, incredibly, as if Labour is better equipped to lead it. Theresa May offered, in her Florence speech, a new security treaty between Britain and the EU. But she did not say what would be in it. They know what is not in it: the Tories have ruled out any participation in the EU armed forces, or EU foreign and security policy after Brexit. Yet Europe has to be the main security focus of the UK for the foreseeable future for two linked reasons. First, because Europe is where Islamist terror cells have been planning operations against British citizens, both here and abroad. Second, because Putin’s strategic aim is to disrupt Europe, rendering it “multipolar” – with some states and many opposition parties polarised towards Moscow’s interests. The mini-review going on behind closed doors in Whitehall should be halted and brought out into the open. The ships and naval helicopters being earmarked for the chop are vital components of the conventional deterrent Britain is committed to providing via Nato in the Baltic. Instead of another round of piecemeal cuts, the government has to decide how the forces and equipment specified in 2015 are supposed to work amid the new global and regional insecurity. There is a big opportunity here for Labour. Having buried the issue of Trident renewal, it could bury concerns about its commitment to national security with a clear commitment to stop and reverse defence cuts. The changed pattern of terrorist attacks in the summer has prompted a scramble to centralise intelligence resources and rethink counter-terror tactics. That’s good. But ask “What are we doing about Putin’s attempt to dismember Europe?” and the most honest answer you’ll get is: helping him. Between 2011 and 2015, the Tories implemented real defence spending cuts totalling 13%. Even if the government meets in full its obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defence, with GDP growing slowly and sterling depressed against the dollar, that is already delivering fewer resources than intended. Nobody can predict how threats to the UK will evolve. But when you see Spain wracked with civil unrest and some parts of Germany voting 20%-plus for the far-right, it is rational to believe those threats will evolve in Europe. All we can ask of the military technocrats is that they design forces and commission equipment flexible enough to meet the evolving challenge. What we can ask of government is strategic clarity and money. But there is none."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/10/margaret-thatcher-papers-sex-pistols-bread-and-keeling-over","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T23:01:32Z","webTitle":"Margaret Thatcher papers: Sex Pistols, bread and keeling over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/10/margaret-thatcher-papers-sex-pistols-bread-and-keeling-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/10/margaret-thatcher-papers-sex-pistols-bread-and-keeling-over","fields":{"headline":"Margaret Thatcher papers: Sex Pistols, bread and keeling over","bodyText":"Margaret Thatcher was briefed by civil servants when she was prime minister that punk was “the most extreme form of ‘pop’ rebellion” and had peaked under the previous Labour government, newly released private papers reveal. Thatcher was also told before a 1987 interview with the teenage pop magazine Smash Hits that punk was “a very basic musical style featuring a strange bunch of anti-establishment acts, the most famous of which were the Sex Pistols, with songs such as God Save the Queen and Anarchy in the UK”. Her official briefing paper, released by the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, added that punk was popular for a while but died out after the Sex Pistols split up in 1978, to be replaced “by the current technological musical era featuring computers, synthesisers and videos”. The Downing Street press office briefing for the interview in February 1987 included the ominous warning: “You may not enjoy this interview. Mr Hibbert (Smash Hits’ deputy editor) may ask superficial questions which betray a lack of understanding. The challenge of the interview will be for you to demonstrate that just because you are not part of the pop scene, you are still in touch with youngsters and understand their needs.” ‘She’s keeled over again’ Thatcher was always prone to fainting, according to Chris Collins, the historian of the foundation. In the autumn of 1987, rumours about her health started after she left the annual royal reception for the diplomatic corps 20 minutes early because she felt faint and went to bed a little earlier than usual. Thatcher is reputed to have fainted at her first meeting with the Queen many years before and, according to Robert Hardman’s 2011 book Our Queen, the monarch was said to have remarked on this occasion in 1987: “Oh look, she’s keeled over again.” ‘Bad enough to cry’ The Downing Street press office was inundated with complaints after an appearance by Thatcher, a chemist by training, on a BBC children’s science programme in January 1987. The programme, Take Nobody’s Word for It, with Prof Ian Fells of Newcastle University, was designed to demonstrate basic chemistry and the then prime minister was required to provide a recipe that could be tried at home. Unfortunately the bread recipe Thatcher offered did not prove to be foolproof. Downing Street was inundated with letters of complaint from people who had tried Thatcher’s bread. One complained it was “just like chewing gum” and another wrote that it was “was bad enough to cry”. To their relief Fells agreed to take over the correspondence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/09/royal-mail-postal-strike-october-union-pension-pay-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T16:55:23Z","webTitle":"Royal Mail seeks injunction to halt 48-hour postal strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/09/royal-mail-postal-strike-october-union-pension-pay-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/09/royal-mail-postal-strike-october-union-pension-pay-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Royal Mail seeks injunction to halt 48-hour postal strike","bodyText":"Royal Mail is seeking a high court injunction to stop a planned 48-hour strike by postal workers after the Communication Workers Union did not meet a midday deadline to withdraw industrial action. Members of the CWU voted overwhelmingly in favour of strikes last week and are to take action from 19 October. Staff could also stage walkouts during the Black Friday retail sales event next month or during the festive season. If the strike over pensions, pay and jobs goes ahead, it would be the first national walkout since Royal Mail was privatised four years ago. Royal Mail said the CWU had missed a Monday deadline to remove the threat and agree to peace talks. The company claims that, under an agreement with the union, the CWU must enter mediation with Royal Mail before embarking on industrial action. The CWU, in turn, claims that it has been attempting to find a solution to the dispute for 18 months. The company has written to the CWU, invoking a “legally binding external mediation process”, and reiterated that any industrial action would be unlawful. Royal Mail said: “The company requested that CWU withdraw its notification of industrial action by 12 noon today and commit to following the dispute resolution procedures. “CWU has declined to withdraw its notification. As a result, Royal Mail will today lodge an application with the high court for an injunction to prevent industrial action so that the contractual external mediation process can be followed.” A week ago, 89% of the CWU’s 111,000 workers backed a walkout, with 74% of members turning out to vote. The vote was a major test for the union after the introduction of the Trade Union Act, which requires strike ballots to have a 50% turnout. The ballot came amid a flurry of union activity this autumn as public sector and health workers discuss the possibilities of industrial action. Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: “The fact Royal Mail Group have tried multiple angles to stop our members exercising their democratic right to take strike action shows how desperate they are. Instead of playing courtroom politics they should be listening to the overwhelming ballot result. We call on the public and businesses across the country to back their postal workers in what was always going to be a watershed dispute.” A spokesperson for Royal Mail said the company had contingency plans in place should the strike go ahead and would “do everything we can to minimise any disruption to our customers”. He said the company was committed to further talks to reach agreement with the CWU. “There are no grounds for industrial action. We want to reach agreement.” The company insisted that it was “making a very good offer on pay” – continuing to provide the “best pay and terms and conditions in the industry” alongside a proposal for a pension scheme that “compares favourably to other large employers”. The spokesperson said: “We are not proposing to change our core terms and conditions or our commitment to a predominantly permanent workforce. Many competitors pay around the national living wage. Royal Mail pays 45%-50% more than this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/british-iranian-woman-jailed-in-tehran-faces-new-charges-says-husband","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T15:56:53Z","webTitle":"British-Iranian woman jailed in Tehran faces new charges, says husband","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/british-iranian-woman-jailed-in-tehran-faces-new-charges-says-husband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/british-iranian-woman-jailed-in-tehran-faces-new-charges-says-husband","fields":{"headline":"British-Iranian woman jailed in Tehran faces new charges, says husband","bodyText":"A British-Iranian woman serving a five-year jail term in Iran after being accused of trying to orchestrate a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic Republic is facing fresh charges that may lead to an additional 16 years in prison, her husband has said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, a project manager at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been in jail for 18 months and was due to become eligible for early release next month, but the new trial means she will remain behind bars. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said that at a court hearing on Sunday inside Tehran’s Evin prison, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told her case had been reopened and she was facing charges including demonstrating outside the Iranian embassy in London, based on a photo found from accessing her private email account. He said she was also facing charges relating to her work at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news agency of the same name, and her previous work at the BBC. The judge purportedly claimed both organisations were “specifically working to overthrow the regime”. Judicial authorities in Iran have not yet confirmed there will be a new trial. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 when she and her young daughter, Gabriella, were about to return to the UK after a family visit to Iran. Since then she has spent most of her time in Evin while Gabriella, now three, has been in the care of her mother’s Iranian family, who are only able to visit her during regular prison visits. Richard Ratcliffe has said his daughter is losing her grasp of English. Ratcliffe said his wife and the rest of the family were bewildered by the new development in her case. “I have told Nazanin that these are just games by the IRGC [Revolutionary Guards], games that look more and more desperate. Inventing new charges to prevent her early release does not make them look intimidating, it makes them look foolish,” he said. “It also brings the integrity of the Iranian legal system into question, as the IRGC play their games with my family’s lives [and] look to extract more privileges from the Iranian and UK governments. They are treating their justice system like a bazaar, making up stories to get a higher price. They are bringing their country to shame.” The Revolutionary Guards, the elite forces responsible for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s arrest, have accused her of attempting to orchestrate a soft overthrow of the Islamic Republic – charges that her husband has vehemently denied. There have been indications that Zaghari-Ratcliffe may be a victim of Iran’s animosity towards the BBC. She was a project assistant at the BBC’s charity Media Action in 2008/9. Iranian authorities loathe the BBC because of its Persian service, which is watched by millions of Iranians via illegal satellite dishes. BBC Persian staff have been victims of a campaign of intimidation and smears orchestrated by Iranian authorities in recent years. In August, in the latest crackdown against the corporation’s Iranian employees, it emerged that Iran had imposed an asset freeze on more than 150 BBC Persian journalists and former contributors. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s original conviction was upheld by Iran’s supreme court in April. A string of dual nationals from other western nationals including the US also languish in Iranian jails, but exactly how many is unclear. Kamal Foroughi, a 78-year-old British-Iranian businessman, has been imprisoned in Iran since 2011. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said the latest charges brought against her constituent were “an outrage and must not be allowed to stand”. She called Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case a travesty and urged the UK government to act. “These developments are particularly cruel at a time when her family had increasingly hoped that she would be granted temporary release. With the possibility of 16 years being added to her sentence, it is high time the government intervened with tangible effect,” she said. “There is a clear pattern of Iran treating British dual nationals in this way, and the government’s soft-ball approach to the Iranian authorities seems to be doing little to improve their plight.” Theresa May raised Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly last month. Rouhani was also pressed on the matter during a CNN interview and suggested it was out of his control because the judiciary acted independently of his government. Monique Villa, the Thomson Reuters Foundation chief executive, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a “political hostage” being subjected to “another mockery of justice” by the Revolutionary Guards. “These charges are linked to her work at BBC Media Action and at the Thomson Reuters Foundation,” Villa said. “This is a complete invention as the Thomson Reuters Foundation doesn’t work in Iran and has no programme or dealings with Iran. We continue to assert that she is 100% innocent and that these ludicrous charges must be dropped immediately, and Nazanin released and reunited with her daughter Gabriella and her husband Richard.” She added: “This inhumane treatment is breaking up a young family and has already caused irreparable damage to Nazanin’s physical and mental health. What happened yesterday and the description that the family has given is harrowing. Hearing that Nazanin, who we know to be a very strong woman, almost collapsed in court is another sign of how traumatised she must be now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/09/man-murdered-infant-daughter-two-weeks-after-adoption-trial-told-elsie-cardiff","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T13:54:31Z","webTitle":"Man murdered infant daughter two weeks after adoption, trial told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/09/man-murdered-infant-daughter-two-weeks-after-adoption-trial-told-elsie-cardiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/09/man-murdered-infant-daughter-two-weeks-after-adoption-trial-told-elsie-cardiff","fields":{"headline":"Man murdered infant daughter two weeks after adoption, trial told","bodyText":"A fitness instructor murdered his 18-month-old daughter just two weeks after he and his husband formally adopted her, a jury has been told. Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, allegedly physically abused Elsie for months before shaking her to death at the four-bedroom family home in the Cardiff suburb of Llandaff. The jury was told that Scully-Hicks was struggling to cope with the girl, telling his husband, Craig Scully-Hicks, that Elsie was “a psycho” and “satan dressed up in a babygrow”, while neighbours allegedly heard him swearing at and insulting the child. Cardiff crown court heard that the couple began looking after Elsie in September 2015 and the adoption process was finalised on 12 May 2016. Matthew Scully-Hicks stayed at home to look after Elsie and her adoptive sibling while Craig, a company director, went out to work. On 25 May 2016 at 6.18pm, Wales ambulance service received a 999 call from Matthew Scully-Hicks. “I was just changing my daughter for bed and she went all floppy and limp,” he told the operator. During the 999 call, Scully-Hicks could be heard saying: “Oh my God” and “this is horrible”. Paramedics and police found Elsie not breathing and in cardiac arrest. Scully-Hicks allegedly explained to a paramedic the child had “screamed out as if in pain, then collapsed”. At the hospital, Scully-Hicks told police, doctors and his husband that he had changed Elsie on the floor in front of the television. He said he took the dirty nappy out to the kitchen, leaving Elsie on the floor and returned to find her apparently sleeping. He said she did not respond and he began CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Paul Lewis QC, prosecuting, said: “The injuries that caused Elsie’s death were inflicted upon her by the defendant shortly before he called the emergency services. “We allege that his actions on 25 May were the tragic culmination of a course of violence conduct towards a defenceless child – an infant he should have loved and protected, but whom he instead assaulted, abused and ultimately murdered.” A postmortem found Elsie had recent and older bleeding on both sides of her brain. She had haemorrhages in both eyes and fractures to her skull and her ribs. Lewis told the jury that a consultant paediatrician, Stephen Rose, said he believed Elsie died after she was shaken violently. Consultant neuroradiologist Neil Stoodley concluded Elsie suffered “abusive head trauma that involved a shaking mechanism”. The prosecutor outlined previous injuries Elsie allegedly suffered. On 5 November 2015, she sustained two fractures to her right leg and in December a bruise to her head. Scully-Hicks claimed in each case she had fallen. On 10 March, Craig Scully-Hicks received a phone call from his husband saying that he was in an ambulance with Elsie as she had fallen down the stairs. Elsie’s injuries were considered to be consistent with such a fall and she was allowed to go home. Jurors were told the child was described as “tiny and delicate” but with a “brash and bouncy” personality by Craig Scully-Hicks. But the court heard that on 22 September 2015 – 12 days after Elsie arrived – Matthew Scully-Hicks sent a message to a friend saying: “I’m going through hell with Elsie! Mealtimes and bedtime are like my worst nightmare at the moment. She’s been up there screaming for 10 minutes non stop. She’s just stopped but I doubt that’s the last I’ll hear tonight.” That evening he also sent a message to Craig calling Elsie “a psycho” and on 29 September, he sent a message to his husband describing Elsie as “Satan dressed up in a babygrow”. Mother and son Susan and James Bevan, who lived next door, said they heard Scully-Hicks apparently shouting at Elsie. One one occasion he was allegedly heard yelling: “Shut up you little fucking brat.” The court heard that Matthew Scully-Hicks has no criminal convictions. He met his husband while living in Wiltshire in about 2006. The couple relocated to south Wales, where Scully-Hicks is from, in 2010. They married in Portugal in August 2012 and applied to become adopters later that year. It was agreed that Scully-Hicks would give up full-time work to care for any children, with his husband continuing with his job. Representing Scully-Hicks, Robert O’Sullivan QC said his client denied causing the injuries to Elsie. He said: “You will hear witness after witness speak of Mr Scully-Hicks’ palpable love and devotion to both of his children and of the deep and loving bond that he had developed with Elsie.” O’Sullivan said his client had repeatedly taken Elsie to the doctor and other healthcare professionals. He said the couple were closely monitored by social services and the authorities through the adoption process. Elsie may have had insufficient vitamin D levels, affecting the density and structure of her bones, making them more susceptible to fracturing, he added. Elsie was removed from her natural mother, a drug user, within days of her birth in November 2014, the court heard. She was placed in the care of Vale of Glamorgan council and later went to live with the Scully-Hicks when she was 10 months. Scully-Hicks denies murdering the child. The trial, expected to last five weeks, continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/09/more-than-half-of-londoners-in-poverty-are-in-working-families","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T13:36:01Z","webTitle":"More than half of Londoners in poverty are in working families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/09/more-than-half-of-londoners-in-poverty-are-in-working-families","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/09/more-than-half-of-londoners-in-poverty-are-in-working-families","fields":{"headline":"More than half of Londoners in poverty are in working families","bodyText":"More than half of the 2.3 million Londoners living in poverty are members of households in which someone is earning money, research has found. The overall poverty rate in London has fallen slightly from 29% to 27% over the past six years, because of rising employment levels, but having a job is not enough to protect a huge number of residents from financial hardship. According to a study by the Trust for London, 58% of Londoners who are in poverty are living in a working family, the highest this figure has ever been. The proportion is up from 44% a decade ago and 28% two decades ago. Mubin Haq, director of policy at the Trust for London, which works to tackle poverty and inequality in the capital, said: “Despite record levels of Londoners in work, poverty rates have only nudged down slightly over the last few years. Over 2 million Londoners are struggling to make ends meet. That’s more than the entire populations of Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol and Newcastle combined. The reality remains, that for many work does not pay enough, or offer the security that people need.” The report also shows that wealth inequality is more extreme than income inequality in London, with the top 10% of households owning just over half the city’s wealth, and the bottom 50% of households owning 5%. The amount of wealth held by the bottom tenth of households decreased by a third in London between 2010–12 and 2012–14, whereas across Great Britain it fell by just 2%. The high cost of housing in the capital largely explains the higher rate of poverty in London (27% of Londoners, compared with 21% across England). The rising cost of rents and the lack of availability of social housing mean that more people in poverty now live in the private rental sector than in any other kind of housing tenure, nearly 1 million; the number of children living in poverty in this sector has tripled over the past 10 years. Low pay and insecure employment are both contributory factors. In the last decade, weekly pay in London has fallen, and a larger proportion of people were earning less than £200 a week in 2016 than in 2006, the study shows. The number of workers in London on temporary contracts was at an all-time high in 2016 (260,000), and the proportion of those on a temporary contract who were looking for full-time work had risen from one in four to one in three in the past decade. Overall, 700,000 children (37%), 1.4 million working-age adults (24%) and 200,000 pensioners (19%) live beneath the official poverty line. Households whose income after housing and taxes have been deducted is below 60% of the median income are counted as being in poverty, according to the official government definition. Although the poverty rate has fallen slightly, the number of people living in deep poverty (defined by those surviving on less than 50% of median income, rather than 60%) has risen by 1.5% in the past five years. About 8,100 people were recorded sleeping rough in 2016-17, almost three times the number in 2006. There has also been a huge jump in the number of families living in temporary accommodation, arranged by the local authority. There were 54,000 households in temporary accommodation in the first quarter of 2017, a 48% increase on five years previously. The number of people receiving out-of-work benefits has fallen substantially from the post-recession peak of about 700,000 in 2009 to 470,000 in 2016, but the report notes that only 41% of unemployed adults receive unemployment benefit. The number of families affected by the benefit cap has risen from 8,900 to 15,300 since the cap’s threshold was lowered in 2016. The Treasury has been approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/09/mi5-knew-prosecutors-lied-press-about-cyril-smith-inquiry-told-rochdale","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T14:18:12Z","webTitle":"MI5 knew prosecutors lied to press about Cyril Smith case, inquiry told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/mi5-knew-prosecutors-lied-press-about-cyril-smith-inquiry-told-rochdale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/09/mi5-knew-prosecutors-lied-press-about-cyril-smith-inquiry-told-rochdale","fields":{"headline":"MI5 knew prosecutors lied to press about Cyril Smith case, inquiry told","bodyText":"MI5 was told that prosecutors lied to journalists about their decision not to press charges against the late MP Cyril Smith, but took no action as its role was “to defend the realm”, an inquiry has heard. A police investigation into the Liberal politician’s alleged sexual abuse of young boys at care homes in Rochdale ended in 1970 when the director of public prosecutions (DPP) at the time, Sir Norman Skelhorn, concluded there was not enough evidence to prosecute him. This was despite a police report that warned Smith was “sheltering behind a veneer of respectability” and had “used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility”. Smith died in 2010 and was never prosecuted for his alleged crimes. On the first day of hearings into historical allegations involving council homes and schools in Rochdale, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard that the office of the DPP told the Rochdale Alternative Paper (RAP) – which published a series of articles detailing the allegations against Smith in 1979 – that it had no record of the case having been referred to it. Speaking on Monday, the lead counsel, Brian Altman QC, said the inquiry had contacted MI5 to ask for any information it had on the allegations against Smith. The security service provided documents showing it had been informed about “false representations to the press” by the DPP’s office. Altman said: “The documents show that the security service’s legal adviser was informed of the false representations to the press from the DPP’s office. Based upon their review of the information they hold, the security service considers they took active steps to ensure that those involved in investigating allegations of child sexual abuse against Smith were made aware of all information of relevance to their inquiries. “However, given their function was to defend the realm, at that time, and investigation was outside their remit, they simply filed the information related to the false representations that had been made to the press.” In May 1979, days before the general election, RAP printed an article titled Strange Case, detailing allegations that Smith, the then MP for Rochdale, had subjected boys at Cambridge House hostel to a series of “bizarre medical inspections” and beatings in the 1960s. With the exception of Private Eye magazine, the claims were ignored by the national media. The inquiry heard that when the DPP’s office was approached by the publication it said it had “failed to find a file relating to Cyril Smith”. A second approach produced the statement: “The DPP cannot trace such a case being referred to us but cannot confirm or deny receiving it.” In a report given to Lancashire police’s chief constable in 1970, the year Smith first stood for election as an MP, Det Supt Jeffrey Leach was unsparing in his assessment of Smith, the inquiry heard. “It seems impossible to excuse his conduct over a considerable period of time whilst sheltering behind a veneer of respectability,” the report read. “He has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility.” The officer said allegations that Smith spanked some boys’ bare bottoms and medically examined others “stood up”. The inquiry heard that Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister at the time, had probably been informed about the allegations against Smith before awarding him a knighthood in 1988. A draft letter from Lord Shackleton on behalf of the political honours scrutiny committee to the PM directly referred to the police investigation and coverage in RAP and Private Eye. Altman told the inquiry: “I mention this knighthood here for two reasons. First, because it demonstrates that the Lancashire investigation and the RAP article had been considered at the very highest level of politics and seemingly did not prompt more than consideration of the DPP’s decision not to prosecute. “Second, because it is important to bear in mind the extent to which Cyril Smith continued to involve himself in serious issues related to the welfare of children. A knighthood would only have reinforced Smith’s veneer of respectability and power.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/01/labour-mps-james-graham-labour-of-love-harriet-harman-tracy-brabin-david-lammy","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-01T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"'It's very sweary!'

What Labour MPs make of James Graham's political comedy Labour of Love","bodyText":"‘What happens in the constituency office stays in the constituency office’ Tracy Brabin Constituency offices are not glamorous places. There’s nothing remotely hi-tech about them. So I can’t tell you how real that set looked, with its bags of leaflets piled high and all the other assorted crap. James Graham’s research has obviously been forensic – but the warmth of the main relationship in the play rings true, too. The bond between an MP and a constituency agent, or between an MP and an office manager, is like husband and wife. You know you’ve got each other’s back – and understand that what happens in the constituency office stays in the constituency office. To me, the play shows that you don’t go into the Labour party because you want glory. Nor do you do it as an affectation, or to be in a gang. It’s a calling, a vocation. We all want a fairer world. But, through flashbacks, the play also personifies the rifts within Labour, the tensions that have always been there. As we said at the conference, unity is the most powerful tool that we have. That message is at the core of the play. If you don’t know anything about British politics, it’s a good history lesson about Labour’s triumphs and failures. It’s bang up to date, too. The line about the WhatsApp group for Labour MPs made me laugh – my own phone was buzzing with WhatsApp messages throughout. I don’t know how campaigns were ever run without mobile phones and the internet. There are some clever references – like starting with a blast of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army, which was the inspiration for the “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant. The play will stir a lot of emotions for Labour supporters, especially through the news montages: we see Ed Miliband on the screen, and feel a sense of disappointment, then cringe at Neil Kinnock delivering his “We’re all right” line again and again at Sheffield in 1992. David Lyons, Martin Freeman’s character, is parachuted into a safe seat in 1990, his old Nottinghamshire patch. I’ve only been in office for a year – I succeeded Jo Cox as MP for Batley and Spen, an area I’ve known my whole life. I’ve got no idea how anybody could represent a place they either didn’t grow up in or don’t know very well. Because I come from a council estate in Batley, I’ve never been cast as a character who needed a suit. Likewise, in my acting career, I never played a politician. But I really believe in the power of drama and go to a lot of local amateur productions. Earlier this year, we put on Jo’s favourite musical, Les Mis, in a warehouse, with 100 young people from across the constituency taking part. There’s some beautiful broad humour in Labour of Love, and a moving Much Ado-style relationship, but the play is really a celebration of the party’s achievements – from SureStart centres to peace in Northern Ireland. People forget that what we achieved in power was extraordinary. ‘I thought the MP was going to be a caricature of a New Labour leftover’ Harriet Harman Labour of Love showed the links between all the Labour leaders, from Callaghan right through to Corbyn, and the thread that unites them: shared Labour values and a shared struggle to get the party into power. I suspected the MP was going to be a caricature of a New Labour leftover but, as it worked backwards in time, you saw that the position he was in was a result of being tired of losing, being fed up with not being able to help people in his constituency. The play was sophisticated enough to recognise that it is not the case that there is one group of people in the Labour party who have principles and one group who want power. It showed that every Labour person has a bit of both. It was interesting that the leader of the council couldn’t do anything without Labour being in government because the council was being starved of funds – and of course we’re seeing that happen again. There were some things that just felt wrong. I think the idea that the majority of work for a Labour MP in a northern constituency is “dog shit” – as they say – is just wrong. The constituents have so many problems – yes, parks that are unusable, pavements that are fouled – but there are more problems than just dog shit, and it trivialised that. Also, I can’t bear to see yet another depiction of that Labour period – after the transformations of the 1980s – that says nothing about the change in women’s lives. Once again, I had to sit there watching as the only women depicted are the MP’s wife, or the woman who works for him. Actually, a huge part of New Labour getting into power was because women changed their votes. Once again, this was looked at through traditional male eyes and I’ve lost patience with that. The wife was a two-dimensional character who was so unpleasant it was misogynistic. At the end, the male MP gives his female agent papers to be the candidate and says she can step forward. But the way women have become MPs in Labour over the years is by struggling for it. They haven’t been gifted it by men who fancy them. While the newsreel was poignant and compelling, where was Mo Mowlam? Where was Clare Short? The women were invisible and I find that intolerable. ‘The play captures a candidate’s vulnerability. On election night, I always think I’ve lost’ David Lammy Politics is based on relationships. They’re behind the theory, policy and ambition. We hear a lot about spin doctors, special advisers and mandarins, but at the centre of Labour of Love there is an MP and his agent. That partnership is central to our political system. Similarly, behind the grand theatre of Westminster, there are political centres that can feel dreary and mundane, like the constituency office. Even Theresa May has a small office like this one, somewhere in Maidenhead. These places are nothing like the corridors of power. So it’s refreshing to watch a play about politics that is not set in the Westminster village. In his earlier play, This House, Graham went inside the whips’ office to show very salt-of-the-earth Labour folk for whom it was all trench warfare, but who felt uncomfortable with Westminster. In Labour of Love, Jean Whittaker – the agent played by Tamsin Greig – barely even goes to Westminster, but she plays just as important a role as David Lyons. We need more portraits of politics that are local and regional. The strength of our system is that, unlike American senators, we are not just politicians, we are representatives – and we represent a place zealously. I thought Graham did well to convey a real sense of place – Nottingham, over the last 25-odd years, is brought home to us. Graham, like me, is proud of the part of the world he comes from. There are points of detail that only someone from a former coal-mining community could possibly know. It takes us away from the chattering classes and the north London dinner parties and helps us to understand post-Brexit Britain and those who voted leave. The first half moves back in time, from Corbyn’s leadership to 1990. This gives you a perspective on the journey travelled and the one still to come. It also reminds us that the Labour party was only in power for 22 years of the last century. Labour has achieved so much but is not a natural party of government. It may be our best vehicle for progressive change but it remains a work in progress. The play is a love story between two individuals but also looks at each character’s relationship with the party. I fell out with Labour most recently when it took a very different position to me on Brexit – I felt like a stranger in my own party. Like any sort of marriage, there are ups and downs, moments when you can feel quite estranged. And to govern, you do need a broad church. All political parties are a coalition of interests, especially in a two-party system. During the good times, it all comes together, but during the tough times you can be at war among yourselves. Like David Lyons, I have one of the supposedly safest seats in the country. I’d been the candidate for two weeks when I was told the people of Tottenham would vote for a donkey if you put a red bow on it. Lyons is told the people of Mansfield would vote for a tub of cottage cheese if it had a red rose on it. But still, on election night, I always think I’ve lost. All of it counts for nothing when the ballot papers are being counted. I remember watching Oona King lose her seat after the Iraq war. The play captures that feeling, the vulnerability of the candidate. Nothing is safe at that moment. If you’re a politico like me, I’m not sure how much you’ll really learn from the play – but you’ll certainly recognise the world it presents, which people don’t often see. It is very funny in places. There’s a great working-class tradition of pulling laughter out of pathos. And Graham has a great sense of comic timing. It’s quite sweary but then politics is! It will certainly please anyone who enjoyed Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It. • Labour of Love is at the Noël Coward theatre, London, until 2 December.

On Friday, author and illustrator Mo Willems announced that he and two other authors – Lisa Yee and Mike Curato – would no longer be appearing at a scheduled event at the museum in Seuss’s hometown of Springfield, due to a mural that included a “jarring racial stereotype of a Chinese man who is depicted with chopsticks, a pointed hat and slanted slit eyes”. The illustration was taken from a page of Seuss’s first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. The 1937 story follows a young boy’s description of what he saw on a walk, which includes an Asian man carrying a bowl of rice and chopsticks and wearing a silk robe. “We find this caricature of ‘the Chinaman’ deeply hurtful and have concerns about children’s exposure to it,” the authors wrote in their joint letter. “While this image may have been considered amusing to some when it was published 80 years ago, it is obviously offensive in 2017.” Springfield Museums, on behalf of Dr Seuss Enterprises, later apologised for the mural and said it would be replaced “with a new image that reflects the wonderful characters and messages from Dr Seuss’s later works”. Its statement read: “This is what Dr Seuss would have wanted us to do. His later books, such as The Sneetches and Horton Hears a Who, showed a great respect for fairness and diversity.” The author, born Theodor Seuss Geisel, “would have loved to be a part of this dialogue for change,” the statement added. “In fact, Ted Geisel himself said, ‘It’s not how you start that counts. It’s what you are at the finish.’” Willems, Yee and Curato issued a second letter, thanking the museum for promising to remove the illustration. However, two local businessman then offered to buy it if it was removed, with one, Andy Yee, telling the Republican: “That’s my ancestors coming to this country in the 1930s. We did not come wearing Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Why do you want to change history?” Springfield mayor Domenic Sarno blasted the decision to remove the illustration, saying: “We should not have acquiesced to these authors’ demands. It’s their choice – their prerogative not to be part of the event. Again, where do we draw the line? This is political correctness at its worst, and this is what is wrong with our country. We have extreme fringe groups on both the right and the left dictating an agenda to divide instead of working together towards the betterment of our country.” The fight comes soon after a Massachusetts librarian sent back 10 Dr Seuss books donated by Melania Trump. In a letter to the first lady, Liz Phipps Soeiro wrote: “Dr Seuss’s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes.” Sarno responded by inviting the US president and his wife to visit the Dr Seuss Museum. Dr Seuss Enterprises’ president Susan Brandt told the New York Times that an artist was working to replace the illustration. “We are in the process of deciding the best course of action, without censorship, to contextualise any perceived racist content,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/matt-canavan-tells-qa-finkel-review-economic-modelling-is-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T21:24:08Z","webTitle":"Matt Canavan tells Q&A Finkel review economic modelling is wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/matt-canavan-tells-qa-finkel-review-economic-modelling-is-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/matt-canavan-tells-qa-finkel-review-economic-modelling-is-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Matt Canavan tells Q&A Finkel review economic modelling is wrong","bodyText":"The government’s sidelined resources minister, Matt Canavan, has refused to back a clean energy target and says he thinks some of the Finkel review’s economic modelling is wrong. On the ABC’s Q&amp;A program on Monday night Canavan, who quit cabinet when it was revealed he is one of seven politicians facing uncertainty about his eligibility to stand in parliament because of dual citizenship, did little to pour cold water on expectations the government is planning to walk away from a clean energy target. Asked about the clean energy target modelled in Finkel’s review of the national electricity market earlier this year, Canavan said the government should have a “policy of lowering people’s power bills”. “Finkel has some economic modelling showing a moderate reduction of prices, but I have some queries about that,” he told the program. Pushed further by host Tony Jones on whether the government would “stick” with a clean energy target, Canavan said it was a “recommendation from a report” but the government “doesn’t accept every [recommendation]”. “It’s about getting people’s power bills down, I don’t really care what it’s called, whether it’s a clean energy target or a renewable energy target I want to do something that works for people and that’s what I’m questioning right now.” Canavan also said the report was “wrong” after Greens leader Richard Di Natale said Finkel had said wholesale electricity prices came down when more renewables were brought into the system. “They were wrong by a large margin,” Canavan said. When Di Natale replied that “it was your own review”, Canavan said “yeah, and they were wrong”. When Di Natale repeated that increasing renewable energy supply would bring down prices, Canavan retorted: “how did that work for South Australia?” The long-awaited Finkel review found that a clean energy target based on a emissions reduction target of 28% on 2005 levels by 2030 would result in lower residential and industrial electricity prices than leaving policy settings unchanged. After months of political hand-wringing, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, signalled in a speech in Sydney on Monday that the government was likely to walk away from the recommendation, saying Australia’s electricity sector was looking for stability and “not necessarily” subsidies. Labor MP Amanda Rishworth said Frydenberg’s comments showed there was “no doubt” the clean energy target was “under threat”. During the program Canavan was also asked about his comments that same-sex marriage advocates should “stop being delicate little flowers” and “grow a spine and grow up?” Saying he had been talking about “both sides” of the debate, Canavan said he was “very worried about the fact that we are struggling in a modern democracy to respect other people’s opinions”. However when Di Natale challenged him on his criticism of the Westpac bank for linking LGBTIQ suicide rates with support for the yes vote, Canavan said they had been “wrong”. This week Westpac apologised for a staff email which said voting yes for same-sex marriage was a “no brainer”. The email claimed legalising marriage equality would prevent 3,000 suicides per year, and was criticised by Canavan and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, for rounding up the figure. In 2016 2,866 people died from intentional self-harm in Australia. Canavan was not asked directly about his citizenship, but one questioner asked if he would support a $1bn loan for the Adani coalmine. He said it would be a “matter for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund but that he didn’t “see any fundamental issue with governments investing in infrastructure”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/16/christmas-a-biography-judith-flanders-review-feast-of-illusions","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Christmas: a Biography review – ‘a feast of illusions’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/16/christmas-a-biography-judith-flanders-review-feast-of-illusions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/16/christmas-a-biography-judith-flanders-review-feast-of-illusions","fields":{"headline":"Christmas: a Biography review – ‘a feast of illusions’","bodyText":"One Christmas Day in the 1780s a London woman was murdered. Her husband testified that he had not the smallest recollection of where he had been that day because “he was so much in liquor”. Nothing unusual in that. In 1831 a man charged with being drunk and disorderly begged for leniency on the grounds that it was Christmas-time: the magistrate commented wearily that every person brought before him in the last three days had made the same plea. It is a persistent fallacy, suggests Judith Flanders, that Christmas has only recently been rendered tawdry by commerce. As she repeatedly demonstrates in this exhaustive history, what a medieval cleric called “swilling and riot” accompanied, and often eclipsed, piety from the very start. In the sixth century, a father of the church was inveighing against the “majority” who “became slaves to gluttony” in the festive season, raving “in drunkenness and impious dancing”. Flanders covers every aspect of Christmas – from mistletoe to the invention of Sellotape (essential for wrapping presents), from the knockabout violence of mummers’ plays to the 1914 Christmas truce (the respite, she notes, was used not so much for friendly football as for retrieving the corpses putrefying in no man’s land). She moves briskly over what is traditionally deemed to be the core of Christmas. Religion is a surprisingly small element. She is interested in nativity plays, not for their biblical content but for the way they illustrate her theory that modern Christmas is essentially performative. People “do” Christmas – lighting candles, cooking special meals, exchanging presents – to please an audience, usually of older or younger family members. Comparatively few single, childless adults decorate trees. The performance has always been rowdy. Since the mid-19th century the revelry has tended to take place indoors, around a decorated hearth, but medieval Christmases were public. Every region of Europe had its local traditions. Flanders describes an infinite variety of processions, fairs, miracle plays and dancing in the streets. These rituals turned the world upside down. King Edward I inserted himself into the story by offering the church a Twelfth Night gift of gold and myrrh and frankincense – but more often Christmas celebrated, not temporal power, but a vision of its overturn. Flanders describes lords of misrule and abbots of unreason, boy-bishops, costumed wild men and feasts of fools during which the powerless could play at power. This topsy-turvydom often involved cross-dressing – priests and clerks dressed as women. For a man to lay aside his male prerogative was to disrupt social hierarchy in the most radical way possible. Food is essential to Christmas. Flanders writes about prodigious pies and boars’ heads, and about songs celebrating feasts when “there was fire to curb the cold, and meat for great and small”. This vision of universal hospitality, she thinks, is mere illusion, a 17th-century antiquarian’s dream of good old days. But the idea of the groaning board was something to sing about, whether in the Boar’s Head Carol or in numerous ditties about figgy pudding and roasted apples and mince pies. The message we should take away from all the lip-smacking enumeration of Christmas goodies is not that our forebears were gluttonous, but how hungry they were. Flanders points out that in A Christmas Carol Dickens is describing a family facing, not just a gloomy day without treats, but the prospect of starvation. The giving of presents began as a bottom-up transaction. A medieval lord expected his tenants to make him presents of poultry or other produce from the land they worked for him. By the 17th century the process had reversed itself. Samuel Pepys noted the number of tradesmen and delivery-boys and servants who expected him to give them a Christmas box. The top-down principle applied within the family as well. Adults gave presents to children. To a German visitor to Boston in 1809 it seemed very peculiar to find that children were expected to reciprocate – making trinkets for their parents. By the 20th century the story of the migrant couple refused lodging, and the homeless mother obliged to give birth in a stable had become, however perversely, the occasion for a celebration of domesticity, a festival of family. In 1932 George V, in the first king’s Christmas speech to be broadcast, announced that he spoke “from my home” to his subjects “celebrating with their children and grandchildren”. So pervasive has this idea of Christmas as an occasion for family reunions become that it’s startling to hear from Flanders that in Japan it is considered – like Valentine’s Day here – a time for couples to be alone together. There Silent Night is the soundtrack for lovers seeking privacy in a secluded hotel. Flanders’s previous book, on the concept of home, was analytical and illuminating, using clues from social history and architectural imagery to tease out ideas about the psychological value of living spaces. This one is more of a catalogue of colourful information, as much of a ragbag of cultural references as Christmas itself, and as surprising an assortment of items as any you might find heaped up under a tree. • Christmas: A Biography by Judith Flanders is published by Picador (£14.99).

When it came to trying on clothing I discovered the entrance to the changing rooms was blocked by a concession stand. My wheelchair couldn’t fit through so I had to nudge some displays out of the way. When I eventually reached the changing rooms, I was told there wasn’t a disabled cubicle and I should go back across the shop floor to one in the lingerie section. I refused so I decided to put any embarrassment aside and got undressed in full view because the door wouldn’t close around my wheelchair. It’s a disaster with fixed door cubicles which have no room to swing a cat or a wheelchair! The simple adjustment of having curtains would have made this much easier. Although I have money to burn and like to look good, it feels like no-one wants to accept the disabled pound. ‘I was charged £50 for a voucher when I had asked for £15. They look the same when lip-read’: May, Ayrshire I am deaf so I either read or lip-read information. I like to check what prices are by reading the display on the till but it’s often obscured or not shown until it’s too late. One time I was charged £50 recently for a voucher when I had asked for £15. They look the same when lip-read! Although most assistants in shops are now deaf aware and will check how best to speak with you, there are still those who are not. This can spoil a whole shopping experience by totally knocking back your confidence and self-esteem. I am pro-active about getting the best service so I’m usually successful at enjoying a friendly experience. The provision of working loops and training in deaf awareness should be the norm for shops. We also need an alternative for making phone calls to retailers because these changes would give deaf people more equal access. ‘I just want to get in and out of a shop with minimum sensory distress’: Kathryn, Brighton I’m autistic, and my primary issue with shopping is sensory. Large crowds are very difficult for me, and the design of many shops - packing as much stock and shelving into a space as possible - means that the shop becomes crowded and difficult to get through. The noise level in shops is also a major issue for me. Many stores have music turned up to a very high volume, as well as other noise issues. For many autistic people, including me, fluorescent lights make a noise which is barely audible to most non-autistics, but which can seem like nails on a chalkboard to us. When I just want to get in and out of a shop with the minimum of minimal sensory distress, having a shop assistant come up to me and start talking at me can cause me a lot of trouble. When I do go shopping, I often need to wear headphones and stick to familiar areas. ‘I have been met with a variety of reactions’: Chris, London I’m a wheelchair user and I have tried repeatedly to get into several shops in London’s West End where there is a big step at the front door. In the shops I went to there is no provision for access for wheelchair users, not even the cheapest solution of a lightweight portable ramp. I have been met with a variety of reactions, from profuse apologies to haughty rudeness and utter contempt for the very idea that a wheelchair user might want to get into the shop. Some shops have level access at the front door, but no access to upper floors. Whilst it’s nice of staff to offer to bring me stuff from the other floors to examine, this is no substitute for browsing and certainly does not constitute equality of access. It is extraordinary and disgraceful that after 22 years of legally obligatory provision of access for disabled people, there are hundreds of shops in London which I cannot get into or around. ‘It would be great if retailers could use seated models’: Sara, East Yorkshire I am a paraplegic but I can go shopping because I have an adapted car. The biggest problem is the lack of disabled parking spaces, especially ones that have sufficient space to fully extend the door open. I need room be able to get into the car from my wheelchair, dismantle it and then lift it into the car. In addition to the physical challenges of a shopping trip, actually finding suitable clothes is sometimes problematic. I need close fitting jackets that will not get splashed with mud or caught in my wheels à la Isadora Duncan (who died by strangulation when her scarf got caught around her car’s tyre). A fastened jacket may look nice on a standing model but when sitting down it will pull across the hips unless vents are inserted at the sides. All in all, I find online shopping an easier experience but it would be great if retailers could photograph items of clothing on a seated model. It is a vicious circle, the perception is that there are not many disabled people about, but they are not about because shopping is often a problematical and unpleasant experience for us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/an-independent-catalonia-practicalities-of-leaving-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T14:00:59Z","webTitle":"An independent Catalonia: practicalities of leaving Spain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/an-independent-catalonia-practicalities-of-leaving-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/an-independent-catalonia-practicalities-of-leaving-spain","fields":{"headline":"An independent Catalonia: practicalities of leaving Spain","bodyText":"The immediate practical consequences of Catalan independence – like those of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal – would have far-reaching implications for the region, its businesses and its people. As with warnings of City firms fleeing a hard Brexit, industry is already alarmed: half a dozen Spanish companies, including major banks, are moving their registered head offices to guarantee access to their domestic and wider EU markets. Despite claims by pro-independence campaigners that the EU would not want to lose a wealthy region that would rank 15th or 16th in the bloc in terms of GDP, Brussels has made clear that the region will not automatically become a member. It would have to apply, and acceptance would require the agreement of every other EU member state – including Spain, which in 2014 threatened to veto an eventual Scottish accession bid precisely to discourage Catalan independence. Catalonia has much of the paraphernalia of statehood: it has a flag, a parliament, its own police force and broadcast regulator, and it provides some of its own public services such as healthcare and education. But an independent Catalonia would need to establish its own central bank, inland revenue, air traffic control and defence force, all of which are currently run from Madrid – as are electricity and gas transportation and distribution. The region’s telephone networks are run by major Spanish and foreign operators and also regulated from Madrid. Its airports are 51% owned by the Spanish state, and its railway tracks and rolling stock are operated by the state. Catalonia’s government debt as a proportion of GDP has more than tripled since 2009, standing at €76.7bn at the end of June. Its low credit rating means it cannot borrow directly on financial markets so depends on loans from the Spanish state. Outside the EU, Catalonia would also have to establish its own border controls and customs service. The borders between Catalonia, Spain and France would become external borders of both the EU and the passport-free Schengen zone. Britain’s apparent inability to devise a solution to precisely this problem for the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic that is practicable and that the EU will accept shows how complex such issues can rapidly become. An independent Catalonia would need to set up its own trading standards regulators and to start negotiating its own trade agreements. Unlike Britain, it is not a member of the World Trade Organisation, putting it at an instant disadvantage. Like British nationals, Catalans would lose their EU citizenship – but also their Spanish citizenship: if Madrid really plays it tough, they could conceivably find themselves having to apply for visas to visit not just the EU but also Spain. As Britain’s experience with Brexit shows, leaving the EU is not a straightforward process. An independent Catalonia, however, would face an altogether greater problem: it would also have to exit the eurozone, at least temporarily. A number of small states, including Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City, have signed agreements with the EU to use the euro, but their economies are minuscule compared with Catalonia’s, which is nearly the size of Ireland’s. The region’s main business lobby, Cercle d’Economia, last week said a unilateral declaration of independence “would plunge the country into an extraordinarily complex situation, with unknown, but very serious, consequences”: Brexit, but with bells on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/oct/10/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-tells-party-to-prepare-for-10-more-years-in-power-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T17:12:13Z","webTitle":"Theresa May gives first interview since conference speech - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/10/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-tells-party-to-prepare-for-10-more-years-in-power-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/10/snp-conference-nicola-sturgeon-tells-party-to-prepare-for-10-more-years-in-power-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May gives first interview since conference speech - as it happened","bodyText":"The prime minister faced the public for the first time since her party conference speech. She said talks needed to continue to determine the exact circumstances under which they would live but said: “We’re not going to be throwing EU citizens ... out of the UK in the future.” She was asked four times whether she would vote for Brexit if the referendum were rerun today - and she declined to answer four times. And, on the day of the racial disparity audit, she indicated she did not believe stop and search powers had been properly deployed, adding that no one should be stopped and searched based on the colour of their skin. You can read a brief summary of the party conference by the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, here. Or, for a more in-depth view, read Severin Carrell’s story: This live blog is now closing - thanks for joining us. Asked about the job losses at BAE, May says it is an “extremely worrying time for [those workers]” and says the government will try to help them into alternative employment. She also refers to a memorandum of intent signed by the defence secretary paving the way for the Qatari government to buy British munitions, which she suggested could help. Ending the session, she says the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, would be the cabinet colleague she’d most like to have keep her company on a desert island. This, she says, is because - as a doctor - he is likely to be quite practical and she’s recently had a cough. Theresa May accuses Jeremy Corbyn of making promises but not backing up how he’d deliver on them. For balance, the Labour party had argued its manifesto at the last election was fully costed. May reiterates she does intend to lead her party into the next general election. Asked about rumours of a reshuffle, she says: “Everybody can speculate away to their heart’s content.” And, pressed about Boris Johnson’s position in particular, she says: “Boris is foreign secretary,” adding that he agreed with her speech in Florence, as did the rest of the cabinet. Iain Dale repeatedly asks Theresa May whether she’d still vote to remain in the EU today and she repeatedly refuses to answer, saying it’s a hypothetical question and insisting she’ll deliver Brexit. Asked about Osborne’s reported comments about wanting her chopped up and in his freezer, May repeats her joke from the conference, saying she’s been described as an “ice maiden” but believes Osborne’s reported line went a bit far. May is asked about a story reporting that talks will not take place tomorrow because British officials are not available to get round the table. May says she believes talks were not scheduled for tomorrow. The call-in moves to Brexit. A caller from an EU member state calls about what happens to EU citizens in the case of no deal being agreed. “We want you to stay,” May says. But she adds there are discussions going on about “reciprocity of treatment”. She’s asked to clarify what happens in the case of there being no deal. She will only say the government is looking at that. Why can she not say people can stay under any circumstance? May says there are rights, such as benefits entitlements, that would need to be looked at if there was no deal. “We’re not going to be throwing EU citizens who are currently here in the UK out of the UK in the future,” she says. EU member states would also have to consider what happens to British citizens living there, she adds. May says she hasn’t experienced discrimination herself but some of her colleagues have and she hopes she can understand those who face it every day. May says stop and search is an important tool for the police but “should be used properly” and a recent study found a significant proportion of stops were effectively illegal. She adds that no one should be stopped and searched based on the colour of their skin. Dale says the Tory party is not representative and asks if it should not be leading by example. “Look at what we’re doing,” May responds. She says the party has new MPs from BAME backgrounds but that Conservative policies need to improve the lives of people from such communities for it to attract them. A caller, Carl, says he has experienced racism at the hands of the police, though he believes the problems posed by racism have eased in recent years. But Carl, who is mixed race, says there is racist news coverage by media organisations and asks May to look into that in more detail. “Interesting point about the media,” May replies, saying she has heard people from BAME communities complain about a lack of positive role models and media organisations should highlight more positive stories involving people from such backgrounds. Asked about affirmative action, May says she has presided over changes to recruitment practices in the police as home secretary. She adds that she “hasn’t looked at the possibility” of making blind CVs compulsory, adding she prefers working towards employers wanting to make changes, rather than forcing them through. The next question is from a listener on the racial disparity audit, which was published today and shows marked inequalities in British society: is there the will in the country to change? The prime minister says the necessary change will take time. That call is followed by one from a black woman who says she’s taken a surname that sounds more western European than African and refers to bias in employment. May says some employers are putting in place “name-blind” policies. She says she’s not sure about legislation on that but she’d hope the audit will at least lead people to see the problem. The presenter, Iain Dale, puts it to May that her colleagues have taken advantage of her looking weak on the conference stage. May says she has had a positive reaction and that “leadership is not about one speech”. The prime minister also declines to directly criticise Grant Shapps, the former party chairman who raised the possibility of her leaving Number 10, saying disagreements happen in politics but should be discussed in private and people should support the party leader. May says neither did she think about how difficult it was going to be to get through the rest of the speech once her cough started because there were issues she wanted to talk about. The prime minister, Theresa May, is giving her first interview since her trying conference speech last week. She says she was not initially sure how to react when approached by the prankster, Simon Brodkin, but did not consider the possibility she was under threat. That was as speech that showed Nicola Sturgeon has been listening. She repeated made the point that Scottish government policies are being implemented as a result of decisions taken at previous SNP conferences - a testament to the apparent power of activists that you would never hear from a Conservative prime minister (or any of the New Labour ones). More importantly, though, it showed she had been listening to voters. It does seem that a sizeable proportion of Scots did not like the SNP’s preoccupation with independence, and this was a speech that focused on pragmatic, mostly non-ideological reform. She left it to Angus Robertson to give the stirring ‘#indyref2 will happen’ message. She just seemed to say it might happen. In the meantime, she is getting on with her job. That’s all from me for today. A colleague will be taking over to cover Theresa May’s LBC phone-in at 5pm. Here is Sturgeon’s peroration. The late Canon Kenyon Wright once said this: “There is another way. It is marked ‘The Road of Hope’. Hope for a new nation at ease with its past, confident in its present and hopeful for its future.” This is the time to believe in and work for that better future. To put ourselves firmly in the driving seat of our own destiny. That is what the people of Scotland deserve. That is what we will deliver. Sturgeon turns to the timing of the next independence referendum. I have always said, Scotland should have the right to choose our future when the terms of Brexit are clear. We have a mandate to give the people that choice. That mandate was won fairly and squarely. But exercising it must be done with the interests of all of Scotland at heart. People want clarity about Brexit first. We respect that. But to all of you here in this hall and across our country who are impatient for change, let me say this. We may not yet know exactly when the choice will be made. But we can, we must, and we will always make the case for independence. (This is notably less committal than Angus Robertson was earlier. He said there would be a second referendum. See 3.29pm. Sturgeon is just saying there might be one.) Sturgeon says Westminster has acted against the interests of Scotland. She cites three examples. Over the years, there have been many decisions taken at Westminster that I disagree with. But in the course of my lifetime, there have been three defining moments when a decision taken there has changed fundamentally our country’s path. In all three, Scotland’s interests have been cast aside. In the 1970s, when oil was discovered in the North Sea Westminster had a decision to make - set up an oil fund or not. They chose not to. Independent Norway took a different decision. Last month, their oil fund topped one trillion dollars. One trillion reminders that taking your own decisions is better than letting others take them for you. After the financial crash, Westminster was faced with another choice. Stimulate the economy or impose austerity. They chose austerity. The result has been a £3 billion cut to Scotland’s budget, the dismantling of the welfare state and thousands more children growing up in poverty. It is shameful. And now, Westminster is pursuing the hardest possible Brexit, knowing that it will make us all poorer. Just think if those decisions had been taken in Scotland. The difference could be dramatic. The security of a multi-billion pound oil fund. Investment, not Tory-imposed austerity And a country at the heart of Europe. Sturgeon says the SNP are the party of independence. And we are the party of independence. The case for independence doesn’t depend on Brexit. But Brexit does show us what can happen when we don’t control our own future. Sturgeon criticises the EU for not speaking out against the Spanish government’s actions in Catalonia When the people of Catalonia - EU citizens - were violently attacked by police just for trying to vote, the EU should have spoken up, loudly, to condemn it. Friends, In Catalonia, I hope dialogue will replace confrontation. It is time for the Spanish government to sit down with the government of Catalonia. It is time for them to talk and to find a way forward. A way forward that respects the rule of law, yes. But a way forward that also respects democracy and the right of the people of Catalonia to determine their own future. Sturgeon condemns the EU withdrawal bill as a “blatant power grab”. Sturgeon confirms that, if the UK government says EU nationals must pay a fee to stay in the UK, the Scottish government will pay it for public sector workers. And she says Scotland should take control of immigration policy. An immigration policy designed to appease UKIP must go. A Scottish policy that meets Scotland’s needs and lives up to Scotland’s values must take its place. It is time to give control of immigration policy to our own Scottish Parliament. Sturgeon says her party is “internationalist to its core”. And she confirms her opposition to nuclear weapons. So let us restate this today. No ifs, no buts from the SNP. We say no to weapons of mass destruction. We say no to nuclear weapons on the River Clyde, or anywhere else. Sturgeon says there is a “bankruptcy at the heart of this Tory government”. It is a moral one. The rape clause. The misery being caused to so many by the shambles that is Universal Credit. Treatment of disabled people so appalling that the UN brands it a human catastrophe. And all the while tax cuts handed to those who earn the most. That is Tory austerity. Heartless, shameful, self defeating. Sturgeon turns to taxation. The prospect of more Tory austerity and the impact of Brexit pose growing threats to our public services and the most vulnerable in our society. That means it is right to consider how our limited tax powers might help us protect what we value most. As we do so, this question will be centre stage. What kind of country do we want to be?Too often, the debate on tax is framed as the economy versus public services. That’s wrong. Our taxes pay for the support that our businesses need to thrive just as they do for our health service and our schools. And our competitiveness as a country is about more than just our tax rates. It depends on the strength of our public services, the skills of our people and the quality of our infrastructure. It is a fact that a good society needs a strong economy. But let’s never forget this. No economy will reach its full potential without a strong, fair, inclusive society. And that’s what our government will always work to protect. (This seems to be pitch rolling - do use David Cameron’s term - for an announcement in the budget later this year that some taxes will go up.) Sturgeon says the free sanitary products for schools pledges will come in from the next academic year. And last month we announced free sanitary products for all in our schools, colleges and universities. Conference I can announce today that this groundbreaking commitment to tackle the gender injustice of period poverty will be delivered from the start of the new academic year next August. Sturgeon confirms that the 1% public sector pay cap will be lifted. To our nurses, teachers, police officers, firefighters - to all of our dedicated public sector workers - let me reiterate this commitment today. Next year, we will seek pay deals that are affordable but also fair. The 1% pay cap will be lifted. Sturgeon says the government wants to help islands and rural communities. The Scottish government is determined to help. So I am pleased to announce today that we will establish a new £6 million Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund. It will take bids from communities and work with local councils. And it will allow even more people to enjoy this, the most beautiful country in the world. Sturgeon turns to land reform. Exactly 20 years ago, the people of Eigg bought their island from its owner. And so started Scotland’s modern journey of land reform. That journey continues today. In recent months Ulva, an island off the west coast of Mull, has sought permission to follow in Eigg’s footsteps. If permission is granted, the residents can get on with raising the money needed. Conference The Scottish government has carefully considered the application. And I am delighted to announce that we have today granted permission to the people of Ulva to bring their island into community ownership. Sturgeon says the Scottish government will set up a publicly owned energy company. In our manifesto last year, we also pledged to explore the option of a new publicly owned energy company. The idea, at its heart, is simple. Energy would be bought wholesale or generated here in Scotland – renewable, of course – and sold to customers as close to cost price as possible. No shareholders to worry about. No corporate bonuses to consider. It would give people – particularly those on low incomes – more choice and the option of a supplier whose only job is to secure the lowest price for consumers. Conference We will set out more detail when we publish our new energy strategy. But I am delighted to announce today that - by the end of this parliament - we will set up a publicly owned, not for profit energy company. (Jeremy Corbyn promised something similar in the Labour manifesto.) Sturgeon says she wants Scotland to be a leader in green technology. We will end the need for new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2032 - 8 years ahead of the rest of the UK. An ambitious target, but one we know can be met. In 2007, we pledged that by 2020, 50% of the electricity we consume would come from renewable sources. Last year, ahead of schedule, we achieved 54%. That’s great for our environment. And the lesson for our economy is this - by leading the way in using new technology, we send a message to the world that Scotland is the best place to develop it. Already, we are home to the largest tidal power array in the world. And next week, we will celebrate a new global first. I will officially open the world’s largest floating windfarm, situated right here in Scotland, off the coast at Peterhead. Sturgeon says Scotland’s first low emission zone will be in Glasgow. In that programme, we committed to setting up Low Emissions Zones in our four biggest cities by 2020, to improve the quality of the air that we breathe. The first of these will be in place by the end of next year and I am very pleased to announce today that it will be located here in the city of Glasgow. Sturgeon says Scotland will meet its climate change targets. And she takes a swipe at Donald Trump. We will meet our obligations under the Paris Accord. Conference Every industrialised country, large or small, must play its part to meet our collective duty to safeguard the environment. And let me be blunt about this. That applies just as much to the White House as it does to Bute House. Sturgeon turns to children in care. Last year, I set out plans for a fundamental review of the care system. We want it to have love at its heart. We are also delivering practical help to level the playing field for care leavers - like full grants and guaranteed places for those with the grades to go to university. We want to make life a little bit easier for those leaving care. So I can announce today a further step. We will change the law so that all young care leavers are exempt from paying council tax. Sturgeon is now announcing the doubling of the funding for free nursery care. Again, this was briefed overnight. See 8.58am. Sturgeon is now talking about early years. The Scottish government’s baby boxes are beautiful, she says, not just because of what they are, but because of what they say. It is beautiful because of what it says. All children are born equal. All children are valued. All children deserve the same start in life. Sturgeon is now delivering the passage released overnight about looking ahead to the next 10 years. (See 8.42am.) Sturgeon says the Scottish government will deliver 50,000 more affordable homes over the course of this parliament. We are backing our commitment with record investment. £3 billion in this parliament - almost 80% more than in the last five years. We’ve already set out how much money councils will be allocated each year. And we will not allow any of it to be diverted to other priorities. Let me make this clear to every council today. If you don’t use all of your allocation to deliver new housing, we will take back the balance and give it to one that can. Sturgeon says the last Labour government build just six council houses. So 8 years ago, we started a new generation of council house building. And since then, we’ve built 8,500 council houses. Overall, we are building new social housing at a faster rate than any other part of the UK. Sturgeon says the SNP has settled this issue. Politicians elsewhere in the UK argue about whether fees should be frozen, reduced or abolished altogether. We’ve settled that issue. We abolished tuition fees. We restored education as a right. And we now have record numbers of young people going to university. Sturgeon says the SNP is showing the way for the rest of the UK. Last week, Theresa May said she would freeze tuition fees in England. She said they won’t rise above £9,250. Well, I can announce today that we will match that commitment. We will also freeze tuition fees. But we will freeze them at zero. Sturgeon says the Scottish government has rebuild infrastructure. Look and travel across our wonderful country - the evidence is all around us. Improved rail connections the length and breadth of Scotland... The new Aberdeen bypass, upgrading the M8... Dualling the A9 and making it our first electric-enabled highway... Superfast broadband being extended to 100% of premises. Conference We are connecting Scotland for the 21st century and beyond. Sturgeon says as long as the SNP is in office, the NHS will always be in public hands. As in health, so too in education. In our schools, higher passes are up by almost a third. Ten years ago, just 12% of young people in this city left school with 3 Highers. Today, it is 30% and rising. Now we are reforming school education - empowering headteachers and delivering more money direct to the classroom. Friends I said we would close the attainment gap in our schools - and, mark my words, that is exactly what we are going to do. Sturgeon says Scottish Labour is having its seemingly annual leadership election. Hypocrites, barrel scrappers - that is not what the SNP are calling them, but what they call each other. She says the Tories are in third place. And the racism and misogyny in their ranks has been on full display. Ruth Davidson should “find some backbone and kick the racists and the bigots out of her party”, she says. (That is a reference to this row.) Sturgeon says Glasgow was run by Labour for decades. In May the SNP took over. The “cronies and time-servers are out”, she says. A school janitor dispute, that had been rumbling on for ages, was quickly settled, she says. It may take a bit of time to fix Labour’s mess. “But fix it we will.” Sturgeon says the three years she has been leader can be described in many ways. “Dull isn’t one of them,” she says. There have been many elections, but the SNP has won them all. She says they lost good MPs at the election, and thanks them for their service. But she has a reality check: the SNP is polling higher than at the same point after its victories in 2007 and 2011. Ten years into government, the verdict of the Scottish people is clearer than ever: they trust the SNP, she says. Sturgeon pays tribute to Gordon Wilson, the former SNP leader who died this year. In 1979, when he became leader, he was one of just two SNP MPs. It was a tough time. But his groundwork paved the way for future success. His influence “cannot be overstated”, she says. Nicola Sturgeon thanks Robertson. He has seen and heard “just how much we all love you.” She says, at the risk of tempting fate, “I’ve come prepared.” She holds up a box of Strepsils. Robertson is rattling through some of the Scottish government’s achievements. And he introduces Nicola Sturgeon. Robertson urges members, here and watching at home, to go map out a plan for their constituencies. There are 1,300-plus days until the next Scottish elections. And he says: And there will also be a referendum on Scottish independence. This gets a huge round of applause. Robertson says this is not just down to chance. It is because of the hard work of its members and its leaders. But Roberston says the SNP cannot simply re-run the same approach at future elections. The next Scottish elections are not due until 2021. That gives it a chance to reach out, he says. He says 70% of 17 to 24-year-olds support independence. These should be natural SNP voters, he says. He says the SNP must get beyond voter identification, and find out what matters to voters. Everybody has a part to play, he says. Robertson says the most recent polls show SNP support up, and 17 points ahead of Labour’s. The Tories are even further behind, he says. He says that makes the SNP one of the most successful parties anywhere. Roberston says it was an honour to lead the SNP group at Westminster. The SNP group still has more MPs than all other parties added together in Scotland. And the SNP has more more members in Scotland than the Tories and the Lib Dems do in the UK as a whole. Robertson says the SNP is committed to delivering Scottish independence “as soon as we can”. Roberston says the SNP returned the highest percentage of candidates of any party in Britain. When he was first elected as an MP there were five of them. Now there are seven times that number. Robertson says he wants to be totally unapologetic: the last decade as been amazing for the SNP, and for Scottish democratic life. The SNP has the most members at Holyrood and at Westminster, and the most councillors, he says. He says it has won the last seven elections in a row, at all levels - local elections, Scottish elections, European elections and Westminster elections. And it still won a majority of MPs in Scotland, something neither the Tories nor Labour could do across the UK. Angus Robertson, the SNP’s deputy leader, is starting his speech now. The conference has passed a topical resolution calling for a ban o use mosquito anti-loitering devices, which emit a high-frequency sound which is supposedly only audible to teenagers. Christina McKelvie MSP said that they could be heard by babies, older people, and people with autism and that they breached the human rights of young people. This is from the Times’ Dan Sanderson. At the SNP conference a video has been shown making a charity appeal on behalf of the Rohingya crisis appeal. Scottish Labour has responded to Mhairi Black’s speech. (See 2pm.) This is from the Labour MP Danielle Rowley. She said: Mhairi Black’s anti-austerity posturing would be a bit more credible if she once had spoken out about the £1.5bn the SNP government had cut from local services across Scotland, or effectively stood up to to plans to downgrade the children’s ward at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in her own constituency. What this embarrassing rant reveals is that the SNP has no response to the growing number of people who see that radical change is possible within the UK with a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn. Delegates pass a resolution congratulating the Scottish government for its effort to protect and improve mental health in the workplace. One of the most moving speeches came from Alan Bithell, who spoke with dignity about his own difficulties. He told delegates: Why the workplace should not be as safe for our mental health as for our physical health I do not know. Bithell recalled being at work and told he would have to work an extra two hours. He said he could not, because he needed to see his counsellor. He was told that that was not important, and that if he did not stay on, he would be disciplined. Bithell went on: I know the things that damage my mental health and the things that help it. Completing a task for someone who appreciates it is a huge boost for my mental health. Work can be a great therapy. When going to work means facing constant criticism and threats from your line manager you will never be able to give your best, regardless of the state of your mental health. In my bad times I have some very convincing arguments that I should not be allowed to continue to exist. Going to work should not mean having these uncontrollable thoughts reinforced. I bring with me some useful skills and an eagerness to work. In doing my work I am fighting against my brain trying to destroy me. I fight very hard. The fact that that means a lot of work gets done for my employer is a secondary benefit. This is from Maree Todd MSP. The Daily Politics’ Emma Vardy has been surveying conference delegates to find out if they favour raising taxes to pay for better services. Overall they did, although it was relatively balanced and the number of people backing “hike it” was not that much larger than the number voting for “hold it”. (The SNP government, as Nicola Sturgeon signalled again in her Holyrood magazine interview [see 12pm] seems to be in the “hike it” camp. Delegates have just passed a resolution congratulating the Scottish government on being the first in the world to provide free sanitary products to women on low incomes and calling for VAT to be abolished for sanitary products, including incontinence pads and breast pads. Meanwhile, the UK government has released a collection of statistics showing the huge effect of people’s ethnic background on their life experiences. The ethnicity facts and figures website covers 130 areas including health, education, employment and the criminal justice system. It shows that black people are more than three times as likely to be arrested as their white peers. White British and Indian people are the most likely to be homeowners. But among children eligible for free school meals, those of white British origin were the least likely to reach expected academic standards. The conference has resumed, and the results of internal elections have been announced. The two parliamentarians elected to the SNP’s national executive committee are Stewart McDonald and Tommy Sheppard. We all like getting a herogram from the boss. Mhairi Black has received the equivalent, because Nicola Sturgeon has posted this on Twitter. Sturgeon was referring to this BuzzFeed write-up of Black’s speech. Here are some pictures of the queue to get into the conference hall for Nicola Sturgeon’s speech this afternoon. Here is a clip from Mhairi Black’s speech. And this is what the SNP MP Alison Thewliss said in the debate on the Sovereign Grant Act as she seconded the resolution. If you are the royal couple and you have a third child, Theresa May will congratulate you. If you are a poor person on tax credits and you have a tid child, the Tories will condemn you. We need to think about the injustice and unfairness of this. Here are some more quotes from the Sovereign Grant Act debate. SNP delegates have voted for the Queen to lose her state funding. The vote will have no practical impact, because the Sovereign Grant Act, which the resolution said should be repealed (see 12.06pm), is a matter for Westminster. And Derek Mackay, the Scottish government’s finance minister, said the move would not affect his government’s plans to change the way the Crown Estate is managed in Scotland. (See 12.31pm.) But the debate allowed delegates to complain about the inequality epitomise by the royals. Julie Hepburn, who opened the debate, said it was not about the monarchy, but about how public assets are used. But she went on: I don’t support a constitutional role or the provision of public funding for the monarchy. But, until such time as we are given a choice in the matter, the UK government will continue to fund them with public money - our money. After explaining how the Sovereign Grant Act works (see here for a briefing) she went on: It is basically the equivalent of the royal family winning the lottery every single year. No need for the royal family to play Euromillions. With the sovereign grant, Her Majesty is purring all the way to the bank. She said the grant had gone up from £31m “which is not to be sniffed at - that is a good rate of pay for charity work - to a whopping £76.1m in 2017.” And don’t be fooled by the whole percentage profits, like it’s extra money coming from somewhere. That is pure smoke and mirrors. It is just a funding formula ... This is our money, money that could otherwise be spent on the public good. Under the sovereign grant system, there is no accountability for the size of the payments to the royal household, or any limitations to ensure proportionality. If profits double, the payments double. At a time when the UK government is insisting we all tighten our belts, particularly the most vulnerable, because there is no money, there can be no moral justification for giving just one family over £70m. That could pay for a lot of mobility cars ... We need to keep taking a step back, look up and look out, and see how ordinary people are being shafted by a rich elite and how the odds are always stacked in favour of the most privileged in our society. The sovereign grant is the epitome of that privilege, and a symbol of everything that is rotten at the core of the UK’s political system. So let’s ensure that public assets like the Crown Estate are used to benefit us all, not just a privileged few. Repeal of the Sovereign Grant Act would be a start. Derek Mackay, the Scottish government’s finance minister who was chairing this morning’s session, told the conference just before the resolution was passed that it would not change the Scottish government’s policy, as set out in the manifesto. That was to return a proportion of revenue from the Crown Estates in Scotland back to local communities. He was referring to the SNP’s 2016 manifesto for the Scottish elections. It said: We will keep the Crown Estate as an ongoing entity until further public consultation on its future has taken place and ensure a smooth transition for tenants of the Crown Estates’ four rural estates at Glenlivet, Applegirth, Whitehill and Fochabers. We will ensure that Scotland’s coastal and island communities get to control and decide how to invest 100 per cent of net revenues raised from Crown Estate marine assets out to 12 nautical miles. In January this year the Scottish government launched a consultation on the management of the Crown Estate in Scotland. The resolution has been passed overwhelmingly. Graeme McCormick is opposing the resolution. It is “futile”, he says. He says the SNP should have debating the future of the monarchy. He says Scotland should have a constitutional convention, to let the public decide who they want as head of state. Brian Nugent tells the conference says money from the Crown Estate in Shetland was meant to go to Shetland. He says the SNP motion talks about the money going to “the wider public good”, which suggests that it would not benefit local communities. The conference is now debating a resolution that would cut state funding for the royal family. Here is the full text. Conference notes that the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 changed the way the Royal Household is supported financially by the state, scrapping the previous Civil List and Grants-in-Aid system with a method that pays the Royal Household a proportion of Crown Estate profits, including a guarantee that this Sovereign Grant will not fall from the previous year and is rounded up to the nearest £100,000. Conference further notes that this has resulted in the Royal Household receiving a significantly larger income year on year from the state, from the initial Sovereign Grant of £31 million in 2012-13 to £76.1 million in 2017-18. Conference believes that profits from the Crown Estate, which is a public asset, should be spent on the wider public good. Conference therefore resolves to support the repeal of the Sovereign Grant Act 2011. Introducing the resolution, Julie Hepbern said this was not about whether or not the SNP back the royal family. It was about how public money is spent. Explaining how the Sovereign Grant Act works, she said: It is the equivalent of the royal family winning the lottery every year. Delegates have passed a resolution criticising the UK government for introducing mandatory voter ID at election, on the grounds that it could discourage voting. The resolution also calls for measures to increase voter turn out, such as automatic enrolment on the electoral register. Holyrood magazine has published a long interview with Nicola Sturgeon. The most interesting passage is the one where she discusses tax, and explains why, up until now, she has been reluctant to use Scotland’s powers to increase taxes. But circumstances have now changed, she says. This is what she says in response to a question about why the Scottish government is now consulting on increasing tax. What’s changed? Well, we’ve seen the Brexit implications start to loom, which are going to inevitably have an impact on our economy, we are clearly facing continued Tory austerity, which has an impact on our own public spending and at the same time, rightly, given rising inflation, we want to reward our public sector workers better. Put together, all of that says we need to take a better look at how we could use tax powers to progressively help create the kind of country we want to be: good public services, good support for business, well rewarded public servants and a good strong social contract with free tuition and the benefits that people value. I don’t want to put people’s taxes up, and I make no apology for that, but sometimes the income tax debate over the past couple of years in Scotland has seemed, on the part of some people, to be like kids playing with a new toy – we’ve got it so we have to use it. Decisions that politicians make about tax should always be very, very carefully taken because a decision I make about tax is paid for by taxpayers across the country who are already grappling with all sorts of pressures on their household finances. So, I make no apology for being quite cautious on tax, I think it’s the right thing to do ... But we don’t have full power of the income tax system, we have power to set bands and rates, so if we’re going to have an honest, frank debate about that ahead of the budget then it should focus on the whole of that debate, not just a small part of it. Every tax decision you take is a balance and it’s why I have been very mindful when talking about the 50p rate and doing it just in Scotland without all of the powers over tax avoidance and tax evasion, to ask, do you end up losing more revenue than you raise? So, as I say, I don’t apologise for being very considered around these decisions because you’ve got to get the judgements absolutely right. Richard Leonard, the Corbynite candidate for the Scottish Labour leadership, has issued a “charge sheet” accusing Nicola Sturgeon of failing to justify her “plausible and even progressive” claims to stand up for the poor. Now favourite to beat Anas Sarwar, the centrist candidate backed by the Scottish party’s senior figures, Leonard has been attracting support from younger left-wing voters who backed independence in 2014. They like Leonard’s explicit support for Corbyn’s agenda, but are troubled by his staunch backing for the UK. Playing to that vote, Leonard said under the SNP 140,000 people were on housing waiting lists; council funding cut by £1.8bn; 19% of children in Scotland lived in poverty; economic growth was flatlining. In his statement, Leonard wrote: Under the SNP the Scottish parliament has in too many areas been used as a conveyor belt to implement Tory cuts. Whatever way you dress it up the SNP have been the Tories executioner’s assistant for public services in Scotland. Being too busy fighting the constitutional fight the SNP have literally forgotten to get on with doing the things that really matter to the people of Scotland. It is a tragedy that they have not fought and obsessed over tackling poverty in the same way they have fought and obsessed over constitutional change. I will never make that mistake; my overriding mission will be focused on fighting poverty and inequality and sharing the fruits of our economy much more evenly. Black says the Scots are up against an establishment that was once the most powerful in the world. You could say the Scots are up against a Goliath, she says. But she remembers who won that one. So let’s get out and fight for independence, she concludes. Black says the Labour party are a reminder to the SNP of what they must never become. Black says the no campaign was based on lies. The Scots are told they cannot eat flags. But they cannot eat broken promises either. The UK is economically reckless. It is a sinking ship, she says. And the idea that, because there has been one independence vote, there cannot be another is “utterly ridiculous”. Black says Scotland may not know where it is going. But it “sure as hell” knows what it is walking away from. Black says more than one in four of Scottish children live in poverty. Families earn less than when the Tories came to power, she says. It has been the worst decade for wage growth since the Napoleonic war, she says. She says the Tories are knowingly driving people into debt and poverty and hunger. The real question is, can Scotland afford not to be independent? Black says the importance of effective media as a critical component of democracy cannot be underestimated. So why was Ruth Davidson invited on the Andrew Marr Show to talk about the SNP conference when the SNP were not invited on to the programme to the talk about the Tory one. She says Catalonia gets its own 24-hour broadcasting channel. Scotland should have its own broadcaster too, she says. Black says she is sick of British nationalists saying Scotland is not big enough to survive on its own. Why would Westminster genuinely want to keep us if we were a financial burden? Mhairi Black MP is speaking now. She starts by saying she is suffering from a cough. (It’s a Theresa May joke.) She says she was humbled to to be re-elected again. People ask what she felt about losing votes to Labour. She did not mind, she says, because Labour had copied some of the SNP’s policies. She says she was encouraged by the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. But she is “so disappointed” by what he has done. Corbyn wants to scrap tuition fees, but Labour is increasing them in Wales, she says. And Labour is still committed to wasting billions of pounds on nuclear weapons. She also accuses Corbyn of coming to Scotland and “condescending” the Scots, by criticising them over welfare when the Scottish government does not have full powers over welfare. And Labour voted not to give them these powers, she says. Yousaf is now criticising Boris Johnson. He is “beyond a joke”, he says. And he says the SNP are the only progressive government on these islands. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government’s transport minister, is speaking now. He says the SNP’S ambition is not to make Scotland the best small country in the world. It is to make it the best country in the world. There is no greater threat to the world than climate change, he says. But he says he rejects the claim that protecting the environment will be bad for Scotland’s economy. I have two words for the Tory party: Frack off ... Under the SNP’s watch there will be no fracking in Scotland. He says Labour criticism of the SNP policy amounts to “SNP bad”. If the SNP invented the lightbulb, Labour would accuse them of inventing an anti-candle device, he says. Delegates have passed the resolution calling for nuclear weapons to be decommissioned unanimously. The conference is now debating a resolution calling for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons. It also says the UK government should implement a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons. The UK government does not rule out the first use of nuclear weapons. Here is an extract from a government paper published two years ago explaining this. We deliberately maintain some ambiguity about precisely when, how and at what scale we would contemplate use of our nuclear deterrent. We do not want to simplify the calculations of a potential aggressor by defining more precisely the circumstances in which we might consider the use of our nuclear capabilities (for example, we do not define what we consider to be our vital interests), hence, we will not rule in or out the first use of nuclear weapons. In the debate on universal credit George Adam MSP said the Westminster government “quite clearly doesn’t care”. He told the conference: This debate is quite simple. It is between what is right and what is quite clearly very wrong. There’s a difference between a Scottish government in Edinburgh that believes that communities should support those than need it at the time and one in Westminster that quite clearly doesn’t care. It’s that simple. The journalist Lesley Riddoch has some more quotes from the debate on Twitter. The resolution, saying the roll out of universal credit should be halted immediately until the system is reformed, was passed unanimously. The conference proceedings have just started. Drew Hendry MP is opening the first debate, on a resolution saying the roll out of universal credit should be halted. The resolution says the Scottish government is using “its very limited powers over flexibilities of universal credit to ensure there is choice over direct payments to landlords and twice monthly payments”. Angus Robertson, the Scottish National party’s former Westminster leader and one of its few heavy-hitters, will reemerge on the political stage this afternoon for the first time since his shock defeat by the Tories in June’s snap election. In most parties, losing a seat means enforced retirement or five years in the shadows until another constituency can be found. Not so with Robertson. He is due to introduce Nicola Sturgeon’s keynote speech at 3.20, in his first speech since the election. Despite losing his seat in Moray, he is staying on as the party’s deputy leader (an unpaid post) and is being primed for a leading role within the SNP, tasked with reinvigorating the party’s 120,000 members, capacity-building and preparing its activists for a putative second independence vote. One date on the horizon is late 2018, when Sturgeon is due to update Holyrood on her plans for a new referendum. Observers and insiders say this is preparation for a return to frontline politics: a Holyrood seat is mooted, perhaps replacing Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said to be mulling retirement as MSP for Perthshire South and Kinross-shire in 2021. Some speculate he is the most obvious party leader should Sturgeon step down, despite her apparent hints she plans ten more years. Several Holyrood frontbenchers, transport minister Humza Yousaf and finance secretary Derek Mackay, may see themselves as contenders. Robertson has never served in government, a significant gap in his CV, but helped orchestrate successive SNP election campaigns and repeatedly outperformed Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs with forensic, focused questions. Succession-planning may seem premature, but the SNP of today does not suffer fratricidal or factional wars. Its prime objective is remaining in power for the long term. Here is the Times’ Kenny Farquharson on Nicola Sturgeon’s childcare announcement. (See 8.58am.) There has been a lot of comment at this conference to the effect that the SNP have suffered a bit of a setback. My colleague Martin Kettle reflects that in his Guardian column today. But, as Martin himself points out, the SNP is still the leading party in Scotland. They suffered a setback at the general election, but they remain dominant. For background, here are two charts from the House of Commons library briefing paper about the general election result (pdf) that put the party’s election performance in context. In his Good Morning Scotland interview Mike Russell, the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, also said there was no prospect of the UK becoming a “glorious trading nation” after leaving the European Union. Referring to the way Downing Street and the European commission are both claiming the ball is in the other’s court, in relation to the Brexit talks, he told the programme: It sounds like Wimbledon rather than the serious negotiation it needs to be. It is the UK which has chosen to leave the EU, clearly they have to come up with the proposals for discussion. If they are refusing to come up with the proposals and now openly talking about not taking part in negotiation and walking, that’s a new degree of seriousness and it will cause enormous difficulty. This is a fantasy, they [the UK government] are pursuing a fantasy, there isn’t a good Brexit. It’s no secret we don’t agree with the policy, the policy was not voted for by Scotland. It is based upon a fantasy of the UK - some buccaneering, glorious trading nation - which just doesn’t exist and can’t exist, and it’s important to say that. Alex Rowley, the interim Scottish Labour leader, has responded to the trail of Nicola Sturgeon’s speech by accusing her of reheating a childcare announcement she first made in her speech to her party conference two years ago. In a statement he said: Once again, Nicola Sturgeon has been forced to re-announce that education is her top priority - but the reality is schools are struggling under the SNP with 4,000 fewer teachers, 1,000 fewer support staff and an attainment gap that is as stubborn as ever. The situation is now so bad that she has been forced to re-announce a commitment made two years ago. Nicola Sturgeon should listen to teachers, unions, parents and the Scottish Labour party and stop the cuts to Scotland’s future. On Good Morning Scotland this morning Mike Russell, the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, was asked how the Scottish government would fund its free childcare plan. (See 8.58am.) He said the details would be set out in the Scottish government’s budget later this year. When the budget is published at the end of the year into next year, which is how the budgetary cycle goes, then you will see it laid out in the public accounts. It will tell you exactly where that money will come from. Russell said the Scottish government had to “balance the books” because that was what the devolution settlement required. As Nicola Sturgeon prepares for her keynote speech at SNP conference later on Tuesday, the latest YouGov poll offers further evidence that the pro-independence vote is getting softer, despite the significant risks of Brexit and Scotland’s 62% remain vote last year. Bruised by the loss of 21 Westminster seats in June’s snap election, Sturgeon has dropped her demand for a second independence vote by spring 2019. She describes Brexit is a “slow motion car crash” that makes the case for independence even stronger, yet is resisting pressure from some activists to name a new date. The YouGov poll for the Times, published yesterday, offers further evidence on why she remains cautious, at this stage at least. It shows a significant minority of voters who backed independence in 2014 do not favour a new one in the near future. It found 21% of yes voters did not want one in the next five years, and 8% did not know; 16% of yes voters in 2014 now opposed independence. There has been evidence that Brexit has pushed no voters in 2014 to back independence now. But YouGov found far fewer of those. Only 10% of no voters in 2014 now support yes; only 12% support a new referendum in the next five years. Sturgeon has also struggled to convert pro-EU voters to independence. YouGov asked a question linking a new referendum to the UK’s Brexit deal being signed but before the UK left the EU, 47% of remain voters said yes but 43% said no. That resistance grew when responses to the first question on staging an independence poll within five years was divided into remain and leave voters. On that question, 45% of pro-EU voters backed a new independence vote before 2022 while 48% said no. These numbers matter: SNP delegates at this conference who voted leave have said a third of party members oppose EU membership after independence. It is doubtful all of those sceptics would vote no in a new independence referendum, but many might. So Sturgeon needs a large number of pro-EU no voters to switch sides, to guarantee victory if a new independence vote is held. Some senior SNP figures, including Pete Wishart, the party’s longest serving MP, are calling instead for her to delay a decision until they can frame a compelling new “independence 2.0” proposition. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, agrees. He told the Guardian last week that fixing a new date before producing a new independence blueprint would be “put the cart before the horse”. This is what Nicola Sturgeon is going to say in her speech about the Scottish government fully funding plans to double free childcare to 30 hours per week. According to the extracts released overnight she will say: At the heart of all that we do is a determination to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up. Right now, we deliver around 16 hours of early education and childcare a week - generally, that’s either a morning or an afternoon session each day. It means some parents still face a struggle to find and fund the childcare they need to allow them to work. We are going to change that. By 2020, we will deliver around 30 hours a week for every three and four year old and eligible two year old. It will give children the best start in life. And working parents will save around £350 a month on the costs of childcare. Often when I have talked about this policy, I’ve been asked – sometimes sceptically – if we will really be able to fund it properly. Well, today, we put our money where our mouth is. Over the past few months, we have undertaken detailed work to assess the investment needed. Right now, we invest around £420m a year in early years education and childcare. I can announce today that by the end of this parliament, that will rise to £840m a year. This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK. And it’s the best investment we can make in Scotland’s future. It is the final day of the SNP conference and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, will wrap it up with a speech focusing on some of the long-term challenges facing Scotland in a “fast changing world”. The SNP has recognised that prioritising independence cost it votes at the general election and last month Sturgeon responded by setting out an ambitious programme for government. There is a summary of the many proposals in it here. In her speech she will argue that the government needs “transformational” policies to address the problems ahead. She will also tell the SNP to prepare for another 10 years or more in power. As the Herald reports, the Tories have accused her of “breath-taking arrogance”, although they may be mistaking rhetoric for conviction. Party leaders routinely say this sort of thing (although, to be fair to the Herald, Theresa May would be laughed out of the room if she gave a speech suggesting her government might be around until 2027.) According to extracts from the speech released overnight, Sturgeon will say: Over the past ten years, we have led the way. We should be proud of what we achieved. Our focus now is on the next ten years and beyond. The world we live in today is changing at a faster pace than we have ever known. The challenges we face are generational. Our responses must be transformational. Last month we unveiled our programme for government – a new programme for a new Scotland. It offers practical solutions to the daily concerns people have, and aims to equip our country to prosper in a fast changing world. That world around us is being shaped by events that no country on its own can hope to completely control. But we face the added uncertainty of a UK now being driven down the most uncertain path in modern times. We know that Scotland does better when decisions are taken here in Scotland. So as we look ahead we face a choice: We can trail in the wake of the change that is coming – or we can choose to shape our own future. Let’s resolve this today: Let’s not wait for others to decide for us. Let’s put Scotland in the driving seat. As my colleague Severin Carrell reports in his overnight story, Sturgeon will also the the Scottish government’s pledge to double free childcare to 30 hours a week by 2021 (one of the proposals in the programme for government) will be fully funded, at a cost of £840m a year by 2021. I will post more on this soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Debates on universal credit, nuclear weapons, voter registration and the Crown Estate. 11.15am: Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government’s minister for transport and the islands, and the MP Mhairi Black speak. 2pm: Debates on VAT on sanitary products, mental health in the workplace and job insecurity. 3.10pm: Angus Robertson, the SNP’s deputy leader, speaks. 3.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon speaks.

The Crime and Corruption Commission on Tuesday announced it had laid six charges against the 65-year-old Ipswich man, including official corruption, fraud, perjury, misconduct in public office and drug possession. “The CCC will allege in court the official corruption charge relates to corrupt payments allegedly made by a property developer to the man,” the watchdog said in a release. Official corruption charges in Queensland local government carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. It would further allege the 65-year-old committed perjury in a secret coercive hearing – held by the CCC as part of its investigation – in which refusing to provide answers to questions is an offence. The CCC announced the charges the same day Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, tabled in parliament its response to a report by the corruption watchdog on issues in local government, including accepting its recommendation to ban donations by property developers. The state government said it would model its ban on a similar measure in New South Wales, and apply it at both the council and the state level. Pisasale had previously vowed to fight charges including extortion brought by the CCC. The former Ipswich mayor fronted media in a dressing gown at a hospital to announce he was standing down over health concerns in June, a day after the CCC raided his office with the involvement of the Australian federal police. Pisasale, who had strong ties to the governing Labor party in Queensland, enjoyed immense local popularity during his 13-year reign in Ipswich, west of Brisbane, taking 83% of the vote in the 2016 mayoral election. A longtime multiple sclerosis sufferer, Pisasale has spent time in a clinic in Brisbane’s New Farm in the months since charges were first laid against him. He told reporters outside court in June: “I hope the perpetrators behind this are brought to justice.” The CCC has since laid criminal charges against three current and former Ipswich council officials as part of an ongoing investigation. Pisasale is due to appear next in the Brisbane magistrates court on 7 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/11/liddell-extension-would-push-up-power-prices-analysts-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T17:00:02Z","webTitle":"Liddell extension would push up power prices, analysts' report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/liddell-extension-would-push-up-power-prices-analysts-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/liddell-extension-would-push-up-power-prices-analysts-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Liddell extension would push up power prices, analysts' report says","bodyText":"The government’s proposed extension of Liddell power station would push up power prices, with its proposed investment in the “Snowy 2.0” pumped hydro project only partially offsetting the extra costs, analysts have said. . If the government did nothing, electricity prices would remain elevated and be heavily influenced by the price of gas, according to a report by energy analysis firm RepuTex into the government’s two main initiatives to tackle the energy crisis. However, state-based energy policies that are incentivising 13GW of rooftop solar and 5GW of large scale renewables, would put some downward pressure on prices, it said. If Liddell were forced to stay open at the cost of $900m, that energy would not be cheap. In addition, it would likely jeopardise 4000MW of renewable energy that is poised to enter the market. With reduced competition from renewables, there would be increased reliance on gas, which would see prices rise, the report found. “Modelling this scenario suggests average wholesale prices will grow above $100 per MWh with Liddell in play instead of low-cost renewables”, said Ben Harper, head of research at RepuTex. But if Snowy 2.0 went ahead, RepuTex found Liddell would likely operate at a lower capacity, offsetting the impact it would have on renewables investment, leaving only 1000MW of likely renewables projects in jeopardy. “With Snowy 2.0 in the mix, modelling indicates less dependence on gas in NSW, with wholesale prices falling towards $80 per MWh, while greater firm capacity in the system would allow aging facilities to close with less impact on reliability”, Harper said. Overall, with gas prices likely to remain high, the report concluded that pumped hydro was likely to replace gas as the “transition fuel” and help the economy move away from fossil fuels towards renewables. “The outlook for gas to play a larger role in the energy mix is therefore dimming,” the RepuTex report noted. “While gas-fired capacity still has a role to play in providing available capacity, even this role is likely to eventually be eclipsed by energy storage and demand- side technologies.” “Should gas prices come down, this could lower electricity prices while tipping the scales toward gas, however, rising gas prices – and the subsequent increase in electricity prices - is already accelerating the search for alternatives.” Harper said gas didn’t look like a good bet. “Given the current domestic gas price outlook, it would be brave to bet that gas investment will out-compete pumped hydro as the primary transition fuel in Australia”, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/nsw-to-weaken-water-quality-test-for-extensions-to-mines","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T05:12:18Z","webTitle":"NSW to weaken water quality test for extensions to mines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/nsw-to-weaken-water-quality-test-for-extensions-to-mines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/nsw-to-weaken-water-quality-test-for-extensions-to-mines","fields":{"headline":"NSW to weaken water quality test for extensions to mines","bodyText":"The New South Wales government is rushing through changes to laws that protect Sydney’s drinking water, weakening them to allow extensions to mines, or any other development, that pollute the water catchment. The existing law, before the new amendments, requires that both new developments and extensions to existing developments, either have a neutral or beneficial effect on Sydney’s drinking water. But that requirement came under the spotlight in August when a court ruled that the Springvale coalmine’s expansion approval, which it was currently operating under, did not pass the test, and it was therefore operating without a valid licence. The Springvale mine is the sole source of coal for Energy Australia’s Mount Piper power station, which supplies about 10% of NSW’s energy needs. Yesterday, the NSW energy minister, Don Harwin, said: “My top priority as energy minister is to ensure NSW households and business have an affordable, secure and reliable energy supply – this decision supports that.” The Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment (Sydney Drinking Water Catchment) bill 2017, seen by the Guardian, has two parts. Firstly, it validates the approval of Springvale’s development consent, meaning the mine will be allowed to continue operating. But it goes further, and “clarifies” the water quality test that is applied to extensions of existing developments. Rather than ensuring extensions don’t have a negative impact on Sydney’s drinking water, the change would merely require that the extension doesn’t pollute the drinking water any more than the original development did prior to the extension. Andrew Cox, president of 4Nature, which brought the successful case against Springvale mine, said the changes will lock in the weaker pollution regulations of decades-ago, by allowing existing mines to keep expanding without meeting today’s pollution standards. “It provides an infinite pollution holiday,” Cox said. “Existing pollution levels will be grandfathered.” Cox said the change undermined a fundamental principle of planning, in which environmental conditions are ratcheted-up over time to meet new community standards and cope with increased pressures. NSW Labor spokesman for industry, resources and energy, Adam Searle, told the Guardian Labor would oppose that part of the bill, and would move an amendment to it. “It’s not desirable and we oppose it because we think there should be a higher standard of protection,” Searle said. Searle said Labor supported the approval of the Springvale mine to secure supply of coal for Mount Piper power station. But he said the other half of the bill was “unnecessary and potentially dangerous”. The Greens energy spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, said the legislation will, in effect, penalise newer, cleaner development in favour of extensions to older, dirtier developments. He said the Greens would also be moving amendments. “A perverse outcome of the legislation is that it will penalise new environmentally sensitive development over older, more polluting developments. New developments will be held to a much higher standard than the extension of existing developments,” Buckingham said. The government says the change just formally validates how the NSW Planning Assessment Commission (Pac) and the land and environment court were interpreting the law already, and this change meant that interpretation could continue. A spokesman for the NSW minister for planning, Anthony Roberts, said the Pac and the land and environment court’s future decisions would now be consistent with their past ones. The spokesman said the rushed process was needed to alleviate uncertainty in the energy market, which he said was causing higher prices already. Buckingham said the energy supply problem was being used as a ruse to weaken environmental protections. “The Berejiklian government is using the confected crisis of Mt Piper’s coal supply to sneak through laws that gut protections for the quality of Sydney’s drinking water supply,” he said. “The legislation goes far beyond the Springvale coalmine and allows any extensions to existing developments in the whole Sydney Drinking Water Catchment to avoid the ‘neutral or beneficial’ test designed to improve the quality of Sydney’s drinking water,” Buckingham said. “It freezes in time poor levels of pollution control at the expense of Sydney’s drinking water quality,” Buckingham said. The bill is expected to go before the NSW lower house today and the NSW upper house on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/10/donald-trump-tough-iran-nuclear-deal-congress-not-to-act","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T13:19:31Z","webTitle":"Trump's tough talk on Iran could end in a big, blame-evading dodge | Joe McLean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/donald-trump-tough-iran-nuclear-deal-congress-not-to-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/donald-trump-tough-iran-nuclear-deal-congress-not-to-act","fields":{"headline":"Trump's tough talk on Iran could end in a big, blame-evading dodge","bodyText":"Trump’s recent threat to decertify the Iran nuclear deal is the latest and most dangerous Trumpian gambit yet, and it has emerged that the US is working to designate the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group. Just about the only person in his administration who believes abrogating the agreement isn’t dangerously foolish is Trump himself. But he promised his loyal base, Fox News and Steve Bannon, he would dump the accord. How can Trump keep his base happy, assuage his fragile ego and not blow up the world? Until yesterday, Trump seemed to be hemmed in and contained by the unofficial “Committee to Save America”. As the Senate foreign relations chairman, Bob Corker, said: “Secretary [Rex] Tillerson, Secretary [James] Mattis and Chief of Staff [John] Kelly are those people who help separate our country from chaos.” In congressional testimony last month, Mattis and General Joseph Dunford Jr, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, reaffirmed their qualified support for the Iran deal. Our entire national security apparatus, including Kelly, agree Iran is in basic compliance and the deal is working. The actual scientific, objective monitoring of the Iran deal is done by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency. Their inspectors constantly examine information transmitted around the clock by surveillance cameras, online monitors and fiber-optic seals on nuclear equipment. It’s the most intensive and technologically advanced inspection regime in history. Seven times, IAEA has certified that Iran is meeting its obligations. All the signatories to the pact, including China and Russia, are relatively satisfied with the progress that has been made. While the deal only slows Iran’s progress to becoming a nuclear power, none of our allies or any of the signatories are willing to re-open the agreement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said last month he would not renegotiate. Failure by the United States to keep our word would play directly into the hands of Iranian hardliners who have always hated any cooperation with the west, and would love to be able to brandish a nuclear bomb. Almost everyone agrees that Trump’s radical thinking is simply unthinkable. Trump has loudly and repeatedly condemned the deal as an embarrassment to America and has sworn to kill it. “Believe me.” He has Bannon and Breitbart howling on his heels, along with most of the rabid rightwing noise machine. To make matters worse, he’s still facing a backlash from his base on “repeal and replace”, the Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) deal with Democrats, and his “wealthfare” tax plan. Just as important to Trump, the Iran deal was one of Obama’s crowning achievements, and Trump just despises Obama. Because the former president made sport of him in public, Trump’s narcissism demands he take every opportunity to revenge himself by obliterating every possible Obama accomplishment. What to do? A peculiar pattern of Trumpian behavior is emerging. First, his fragile ego forbids him to ever take responsibility for anything. Ever. Second, because he craves the adulation of his base, he will to shift blame or throw any and all supporters and allies under the bus. So, just like the Obamacare “repeal and replace” fiasco, or the DACA deal, or his tax reform plan, Trump dodges the ball. He throws the hot potato to Congress, throws up his hands, walks away and points fingers. When he decertifies the deal, Congress will have 90 days to consider his action and decide whether to re-impose sanctions. They must introduce, debate and pass legislation on the sanctions or his decertification means exactly nothing. Right now, there seems to be no appetite in Congress to touch the Iran deal. Still, there will be pressure on Congress to make a few cosmetic changes, just to save face. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas has proposed new stipulations for US participation, including eliminating “sunset clauses”, which allow some Iranian nuclear activities to resume after several years, as well as tougher inspections and additional restrictions on Iran’s missile programs. None of which are acceptable to Iran, and would probably destroy whatever limited diplomatic and economic re-engagement has been achieved. But neither Corker nor majority leader Mitch McConnell say they are ready to move any sanctions bills, and neither are Democratic leaders in either body. Facing a legislative calendar already crowded with must-pass bills, and mid-term elections on the horizon, it’s hard to see how Congress could act on sanctions even if they wanted to. So for Trump, it’s like having your cake and eating it too. He gets to tell his base he’s trying to kill the plan, but the “deep state” and Congress are standing in the way. It’s brilliant. Voila! The Iran deal holds. The world avoids armageddon and Trump can blame Congress. His base stays happy with him and angry at the “deep state”. Dissatisfaction with the institutions of government continues to fester. And Trump skips merrily along. This feels a lot more like dodgeball than leadership.

The bombshell argument, buried in one paragraph of the senator’s written submissions to the court of disputed returns in Canberra, became the focus of Tuesday afternoon’s hearing after his counsel used an expert report to contradict advice from the Italian consulate in Brisbane that he is registered as an Italian citizen. If accepted by the court the argument could see the former federal resources minister retain his Senate seat, even if the other six parliamentarians are ruled ineligible by a strict reading that all dual citizens are ineligible to sit in parliament. Earlier, the solicitor general Stephen Donaghue advanced the Turnbull government’s argument that the test for disqualification by section 44 is not dual citizenship alone but whether the person voluntarily obtained or retained foreign citizenship. That would require knowledge of their status as a foreign citizen or the real prospect that they may be. Donaghue told the court that Canavan, Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash, Nick Xenophon and Larissa Waters did not possess the knowledge required to have allegiance to a foreign power although they held dual citizenship under foreign laws. In the morning, Donaghue said Canavan appeared to have acquired Italian citizenship due to a “quirk of history” after the Italian constitutional court decided in 1983 that citizenship could be acquired by descent from one’s mother. Canavan was born in Queensland in 1980 and at that time his mother did not hold Italian citizenship but may have gained it by virtue of the 1983 decision. In the afternoon Canavan’s counsel, David Bennett, read extensively from the expert opinion of Maurizio Delfino and Professor Beniamino Caravita di Torrito that Italian lawyers were divided on whether that decision conferred Italian citizenship automatically on those born before the decision. “The better view is that it’s a conditional citizenship that doesn’t arise automatically,” Bennett said, suggesting a person would then need to elect to become a citizen. When the chief justice, Susan Kiefel, noted no application to cross-examine the experts had been made, Bennett replied that the only expert evidence before the court is that the better view of Italian law is that Canavan was never an Italian. Although Canavan’s mother registered herself and Canavan as Italian citizens resident overseas, Bennett said that was not an election to become citizens and could not make Canavan a citizen without a declaration from him. Although the Brisbane consulate said Canavan was registered as an Italian abroad, Bennett said it appeared that advice was based on a Canavan’s mother’s registration which the expert evidence said was “irrelevant” to his citizenship. Submissions from the amicus curiae intervening in Canavan’s case submitted that he was an Italian citizen on the date of his nomination (13 May 2016), but did not refer to independent expert evidence. “Senator Canavan’s Italian citizenship has been discoverable for over 30 years,” the submissions said. “To complain about the retroactive operation of the law is far too delicate a submission in those circumstances.” Earlier, Donaghue said that Waters, who was born in Canada to Australian parents but left when she was 11 months old, believed she was entitled to apply to become a Canadian citizen but “consciously decided not to become the citizen of a country she was [in fact already] a citizen of”. Donaghue said Joyce, whose father was a New Zealand citizen before renouncing it when Joyce was aged 10, was “not aware of the possibility he might be a New Zealand citizen under New Zealand law”. The solicitor general said Xenophon had been a dual Australian and British overseas citizen by descent because his father left Cyprus before it gained independence, which was “hardly obvious” because it required understanding of the “political situation” in Cyprus at the time. Section 44 of the commonwealth constitution states that people are incapable of being chosen as a senator or MP if they are the subject or citizen of a foreign power. Under the commonwealth’s test, parliamentarians would be eligible if they were unaware of their dual citizenship so long as they renounce it within a reasonable time when they became aware of it. A key issue explored in the morning’s hearing was whether the precedent case of Sykes v Cleary established that citizenship by descent is a disqualification even if the parliamentarian did not believe they were a citizen of the foreign power. Donaghue submitted the commonwealth was not asking the court to overturn the majority decision in Sykes v Cleary, which he said dealt with dual citizenship of people born overseas who were later naturalised to become Australians. He said the case had not resolved the question of how to treat natural-born Australian citizens who were also unwittingly dual citizens despite being born in Australia. The solicitor general argued that since the plurality in Sykes v Cleary accepted a person can remain in parliament if the foreign power refuses to allow them to renounce citizenship, the text of section 44 “cannot be read literally” that all foreign citizens are ineligible, a submission justice Michelle Gordon appeared to accept in later questioning. Various readings of the case were offered from the bench, including that it had been wrongly decided and that it had dealt with foreign citizenship only for the purpose of determining whether to fill a vacancy with a byelection. The commonwealth has submitted Ludlam and Roberts should be found ineligible because they did possess the requisite subjective knowledge of the possibility they were foreign citizens. Counsel for Joyce and Nash, Brett Walker, agreed with the commonwealth that the purpose of section 44 was to bar people with a split allegiance but there was “no mischief” to prevent when people were unaware of their foreign citizenship. Walker said the risk of a split allegiance was that a parliamentarian would “hear the call” of a foreign power and argued “one can’t heed a call one can’t hear”. He said the fact inquiries to foreign legal experts and genealogists could have established their foreign citizenship was “no reason” to treat them as having a split allegiance. The hearing will continue on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/planet-oz/2017/oct/11/tony-abbott-dares-us-to-reject-evidence-on-climate-but-reveals-a-coward","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T17:00:02Z","webTitle":"Tony Abbott dares us to reject evidence on climate, but reveals a coward | Graham Readfearn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/oct/11/tony-abbott-dares-us-to-reject-evidence-on-climate-but-reveals-a-coward","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/oct/11/tony-abbott-dares-us-to-reject-evidence-on-climate-but-reveals-a-coward","fields":{"headline":"Tony Abbott dares us to reject evidence on climate, but reveals a coward","bodyText":"Tony Abbott titled his London speech on climate change “Daring to Doubt” – a challenge, if you will, to reject mountains of evidence and instead lick your fingers and shove them into the plug socket of denial. Go on, I dare you. Throughout his speech, the former Australian prime minister urged listeners to think that dismissing decades of research backed by the world’s leading scientific institutions required bravery and fortitude, rather than other less celebrated human attributes. But what would constitute bravery for a conservative politician like Abbott? Changing your mind when the evidence tells you you’re dead wrong, or saying what you’ve always said, using the logical fallacies that you’ve always used? One step is brave, the other is cowardly. Abbott was giving the Global Warming Policy Foundation’s annual lecture – an “honour” previously bestowed on his spiritual and political mentors John Howard and Cardinal George Pell. Nobody should be surprised that what we got was an absolute crap speech from a man who confessed he still thinks climate science is “absolute crap”. Abbott went for the whole canon of tired climate science denial talking points – carbon dioxide is just food for plants, the climate has always changed, it’s the sun – in what constituted a warmed-up meal of misinformation with a side order of supercilious gravy. Several leading Australian climate scientists have hit back. How tired they must get of debunking this stuff. Abbott’s speech was also chock-full of internal contradictions. He suggested a conspiracy to tamper with temperature readings, but admitted the globe was warming. He described carbon dioxide as a “trace gas” and dismissed its role in warming, but elsewhere thought warming (which might not be happening) would be good. And the “trace gas” is insignificant, but not when it comes to its ability to “green the planet” and help plants grow. Professor Steve Sherwood, deputy director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, read the speech and said it was “the usual mix of misdirection, falsehoods and tirades against ‘brigades’ who supposedly say this and that but are never clearly identified”. Abbott told the thinktank – which had denied requests from seasoned climate reporters to attend – that past climate changes that occurred millions of years ago showed there was nothing to worry about now. “Abbott is trying to hide the fact that it is the scientists themselves – who know more about past climate changes than he does – who are sounding the alarm,” said Sherwood. The former prime minister confined his scientific missteps to seven or eight paragraphs in the middle of his speech. Professor Mark Howden, director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said Abbott’s claim that other factors, such as sunspots cycles or wobbles in the Earth’s orbit could be just as important as carbon dioxide, was simply false. “The evidence that our climate is changing due to human activity is overwhelming,” said Howden. “2016 was globally the hottest year on record, surpassing the 2015 record, surpassing the 2014 record. There is 99.999% certainty that humans are driving the observed temperature rises via greenhouse gas emissions.” Abbott’s claim that “no big change has accompanied the increase in carbon dioxide concentration” was “problematic”, said Howden, given “research shows that the world has already warmed by approximately 1C since pre-industrial times”. “We are already experiencing changed patterns of rainfall, more and more days with extreme temperatures, increasingly intense natural disasters and rising sea levels, impacting on almost all facets of life in Australia.” Professor Andrew Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, said while it was true that CO2 is essential to life, “life also requires many trace elements that at higher concentrations are toxic”. “It is a myth to imply that because CO2 is essential to life, more of it is good.” Abbott also deployed another favourite talking point from climate science misinformers – that warming (which, remember, he thinks might not be happening) will cut the number of people dying of cold. Pitman said this argument, too, was misleading, saying: “It is true that in rich countries which tend to be in the mid to higher latitudes, some warming might help reduce deaths from cold. In the lower latitude countries – the subtropics and tropics – people rarely die of cold. In contrast they die of heat and lack of clean water. “So, countries responsible for global warming might gain a minor benefit from warming while those least responsible will wear the consequences.” Dr Liz Hanna, an expert on the impacts of climate change on human health, said human-caused warming was already implicated in the deaths of many thousands. “In 2003, 70,000 people died in western Europe, and in 2010 a further 55,000 people died in Russia and eastern Europe. These figures far exceed deaths from cold snaps. The decade 2001-2010 saw a 2,300% increase in heat deaths above the previous decade. Mr Abbott’s assertions don’t tell the whole story, as they’re based on what has happened in the past rather than what is projected to happen in future. While more people die from cold than heat in Melbourne at the moment, this will reverse as more summer days reach the high 40s.” Away from his errors on the evidence, Abbott tried to characterise climate science and environmentalism as being hamstrung by a religious-type fervour that gets in the way of “common sense”. Abbott said: Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. Beware the pronouncement, ‘the science is settled’. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that ‘99% of scientists believe’ as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. As a Roman Catholic libertarian free market ideologue, Abbott is, presumably, immune to such group think. Climate scientist Ben Henley, of the University of Melbourne, also spots Abbott’s facile argument. In an email he told me: “By implication, Abbott superstitiously questions the foundations of science, and in doing so, he questions the same scientific method which discovered wifi and penicillin, and proved the Earth was not flat. “Abbott presents an absurdly and intentionally distorted viewpoint, reminiscent of a conspiracy theorist.” Abbott’s attitude to climate change seems to rest on a Boy’s Own “who dares wins” approach to policy that’s neither brave or daring. It’s stupid.

Mick Tisbury, a union executive and acting commander with the metropolitan fire brigade, believes the blood of the majority of firefighters across the country is contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of probable carcinogens used in firefighting foam from the 1980s. Tisbury was a central figure in an inquiry into Pfas contamination at Victoria’s Fiskville training facility last year, which found some within the state’s country fire authority had known of the site’s contamination, but failed to act. Tisbury describes the level of his own blood contamination as “through the roof”. “I’ve got 240 nanograms in my blood. That’s like a ticking time bomb. I’m sick to death of arguing whether it is going to go off, or when it is going to go off,” he told Guardian Australia. “I just want this stuff out of my body.” Tisbury said state and territory governments had a legal and moral obligation to provide blood testing to their firefighters. He said the blood tests would give firefighters certainty and help them obtain sound medical advice. “They’re legally obliged to provide safe systems of work,” he said. “If they want to expose me to this chemical, they’ve actually got to prove that it’s safe, and at what levels it’s safe.” Fiskville was one of at least 94 sites investigated for PFAS contamination across the country, including at defence bases, fire stations, and airports, according to a list compiled by Guardian Australia in July. Studies in the United States have shown the chemicals share a probable link with cancer. The federal opposition on Tuesday sought to pressure the Turnbull government over the contamination scandal, following an ABC Four Corners report which suggested the defence department knew of the foam’s potential dangers as early as 1987. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and the shadow assistant defence minister, Gai Brodtmann, issued a joint statement urging for the defence minister, Marise Payne, to outline the government’s response publicly. “Labor is deeply concerned about the revelations in last night’s Four Corners report, and once again calls on the Turnbull government to respond to the escalating PFAS contamination issue across Australia,” the statement said. The defence department issued a statement on Monday night, saying it was committed to being “open and transparent about its management, environmental investigations and remediation efforts at PFAS-affected Defence Bases and in communities”. The government is facing class actions from two towns where contamination has been significant: Williamtown in New South Wales, and Oakey in Queensland. The residents allege PFAS has hurt local agriculture and horticulture, damaged property prices, caused considerable anxiety and harmed human health. Significant contamination has also occurred in Katherine, where PFAS has made its way into drinking water. The mayor of the town, Fay Miller, and the territory’s health minister, Natasha Fyles, both called for residents to be given blood tests in August. Defence has taken urgent steps to provide Katherine residents with safe drinking water, and is paying for a water treatment plant to supply the town. “Defence acknowledges the stress and anxiety felt by the affected communities due to the uncertainty and complexity of this issue,” the department said on Monday. “This is why we are following a scientific approach using national standards to identify the nature and extent of PFAS contamination.” The department said it had provided $55m to Williamtown and Oakey residents to reduce exposure, investigate health impacts and manage environmental degradation. That included providing clean drinking water, mental health counselling, an epidemiological study and providing access to blood tests. PFAS has been used in a wide range of household and industrial products, other than firefighting foam. It is safe at low concentrations, but the chemicals are highly persistent and bioaccumulate, meaning they build up in living organisms with continued exposure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/10/tuesday-briefing-tackling-the-weight-of-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T05:34:48Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: tackling the weight of the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/tuesday-briefing-tackling-the-weight-of-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/10/tuesday-briefing-tackling-the-weight-of-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: tackling the weight of the world","bodyText":"Top story: act now to fight an epidemic Good morning, Graham Russell here to give you today’s headlines. Dealing with obesity-related problems is going to cost the world more than a trillion dollars a year from 2025, when a third of the globe’s population will be either overweight or obese, experts have warned. The UK’s annual bill is set to rise from $19bn now to $31bn in eight years’ time, something the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens, has already said could bankrupt the service. Health systems in low-income countries will simply not be able to cope with an epidemic of weight-related cancer and heart disease, the World Obesity Federation warned in its analysis. The Middle East and Latin America in particular have seen obesity rates soar in recent years and will face similar resource constraints. The federation for the first time included the cost of damage to joints which may result in hip and knee replacements and back pain. “That’s why the figures are pretty astonishingly high,” said Tim Lobstein, its policy director. “Some poor countries are already swamped.” Sugary-drink taxes and bariatric surgery (to reduce stomach size) were among measures praised as being effective and measurable. * * * ‘Abuse of power’ – British actor Ramola Garai has told how she felt “violated” when auditioning for Harvey Weinstein while the movie mogul was wearing only a dressing gown. “The point was that ... it was humiliating for me and that he had the power. It was an abuse of power,” she told the Guardian. As fellow actors including Meryl Streep and Judi Dench voiced their horror, the soul-searching began in earnest. Kate Winslet said she had heard rumours but hoped they were made-up. “Maybe we have all been naive,” she said. Potentially even more troubling is the silence from the men of Hollywood. Actually, potentially even more troubling than that is Donna Karan using the moment to say maybe those women were “asking for it”. She later apologised. * * * Working hard to secure no deal – A Britain without a Brexit deal will feature more red tape, border chaos and lots more Whitehall officials, a new white paper has warned, not exactly the vision touted by the Leave campaign. A separate trade paper courtesy of Liam Fox acknowledged that any deals struck outside the EU will be put on hold during any transitional period. Theresa May said the new proposals were necessary to “minimise disruption” in case talks collapsed. And let’s not talk about the European court of justice continuing to have jurisdiction over the UK. * * * Vegas killings revisited – Gunman Stephen Paddock shot a security guard and sprayed a hotel hallway with 200 rounds before beginning his mass shooting, police have revealed in a major change to previous accounts. Jesus Campos was hit and alerted fellow guards six minutes before the attack in which 58 were killed. Separately, a police officer who entered Paddock’s hotel room saw a note with numbers on it which he said appeared designed to help Paddock calibrate his firearm. * * * Far from race equality – A report on Britain’s social divides being released today reveals vastly different experiences for ethnic groups in Britain’s schools, workplaces, hospitals and justice system, as well as huge regional disparities. Labour MP David Lammy said: “We simply can’t let this racial disparity audit bring forth more talking shops. We’ve had a lot of talk, it’s now time for action.” * * * Frightening debate – Katie Hopkins has defended her now-deleted tweets that wrongly implied the crash at the Natural History Museum was a terror attack. Police said it was no such thing, but the columnist disagreed, saying: “I think people should be scared. I think they should be running. We are cowed. This city is afraid.” * * * The other corridors of power – Margaret Thatcher was told to “look after the Daily Mail” as she prepared for the bruising 1987 general election campaign. The advice was handed down by Sir Bernard Ingham, her press secretary and supposedly a neutral civil servant. The private papers also lift the lid on internal strife between Norman Tebbitt and Lord Young that Michael Dobbs said inspired him to write House of Cards. * * * Lunchtime read: voyage to the ruined Isis heartland of Raqqa The battle to retake Raqqa, the self-declared capital of the Islamic State caliphate, is almost over after months of fighting. Photographer Achilleas Zavallis and reporter Martin Chulov have travelled from the Iraqi border to the frontline in the ancient Syrian city where a few Isis fighters are making their last stand. This stunning picture essay features 25 images and short videos alongside snippets of information giving a sense of what it is like to travel through oil-rich wastelands, dusty outposts teeming with refugees and, finally, the ruined streets of the city. Sport Kick It Out, football’s anti-discrimination campaign, received 469 reports of racism, sexism or other forms of abuse in 2016-17, more than any previous season in which numbers have been collected. Chris Coleman has admitted his time as Wales manager might be coming to an end after the 1-0 win that put the Republic of Ireland into the World Cup play-offs. Gareth Southgate has committed England to playing three at the back during next summer’s finals, having identified the system as “a better option”. The Barbarians will today officially launch their first-ever women’s team with the rugby side set to make their debut in Ireland next month. Australia have named their squad and declared their confidence in retaining the women’s Ashes, despite missing captain Meg Lanning. And the Australian Open tournament director, Craig Tiley, has said Serena Williams “will be back” to defend her title in January, just four months after the seven-times winner in Melbourne gave birth. Business The health service regulator has warned the NHS faces a sharp decline around its 70th birthday due to staff shortages, rising demand and increasing numbers of patients with preventable illnesses. And Nils Pratley writes that the Royal Mail’s attempts to secure an injunction to prevent next week’s strike will do little to calm the mood. The pound is buying $1.316 and €1.118. Share prices were mixed in early trading in Asia, after the rally on Wall Street took a breather overnight. Investors are awaiting trade data from China this week and keeping an eye on geopolitical risks arising from North Korea. The papers It’s one of those days when the Mail and the Guardian have identical front pages (OK that’s a stretch, but they did both tackle health and Harvey Weinstein), while the rest focus on May revealing her no-deal plans. The Guardian has reported on the scale of the global obesity crisis alongside a picture-led story on Ramola Garai, who has spoken of her ordeal at the hands of Harvey Weinstein. The Mail carries a warning from the Care Quality Commission that the NHS is struggling because although we are living longer, “we are not living healthily longer”. It also give plenty of space to Dame Judi Dench and Meryl Streep voicing their horror at the movie mogul’s modus operandi. The Mirror also used the CQC report to urge someone to fix a health service in crisis. “Don’t let NHS die on its 70th birthday,” it says. The majority go with Theresa May unveiling her Brexit-but-no-deal plans, with varying views on hyphenation: FT: “May details no-deal trade plan as high-stakes Brexit tussle looms”. Telegraph: “May draws up plans for no deal on Brexit”, the i: “May plans for no deal with EU”, Metro: “Braced for a no deal Brexit”. The Sun has gone large with the story of Southwark Council unwittingly promoting to a senior position a woman who was jailed over the failed 21 July bomb plot. It says she had “potential access” to details of terror suspects being watched by police (a claim the council denies). The Times goes three ways, leading with calls for the title “junior doctor” to be scrapped because it’s “belittling” and patients confuse them with students. It also covers today’s release of the race disparity audit and asks whether Weinstein should be stripped of his CBE.

In 2007, the IMF ended up with its reputation severely tarnished after failing to notice that the global economy was about to suffer its biggest recession since the 1930s Great Depression. Like many other forecasters, the fund got carried away as the global economy posted its four strongest years of growth since the early 1970s. Only in retrospect did the IMF twig that the rapid expansion was the result of reckless financial speculation, and admit that it had been guilty of groupthink. This time, the message is clear. This is not a case of see the new IMF, same as the old IMF. The warning has gone out loud, clear and early: be careful, because the long-awaited upswing in the global economy may not be for real. The fund’s concern is that wage growth and inflation have remained weak, despite a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and the use of quantitative easing (QE), the money-creation process used by the world’s leading central banks in an attempt to stimulate activity. Asset prices have risen sharply as a result of this stimulus. But the IMF fears that amid the euphoria, financial markets are ignoring the risks, just as they did in the buildup to the crisis in 2007. What’s more, central banks and finance ministries have used up much of their ammunition in the past decade. There is little or no scope to cut interest rates, QE has long since been subject to the law of diminishing returns, and governments are running much bigger budget deficits. The IMF’s more measured approach also extends to Brexit, where it has abandoned the line repeated in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum that a vote to leave would result in instant economic armageddon. To be sure, since the last WEO in April, the IMF has cut its growth forecast for the UK from 2% to 1.7%, but still reckons the outlook is better than it thought a year ago. At that stage, the IMF was pencilling in growth of 1.1% for Britain this year. The fund’s public statements on Brexit reflect the change in the government’s own approach. Before the referendum, George Osborne was delighted when the IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, issued her dire warnings about imminent economic meltdown. Indeed, the stronger the language, the more the then chancellor liked it. The IMF’s current view is that the economic risks of Brexit will be minimised if the UK remains an open economy and has trading arrangements with the EU that largely mirror current ones. That also happens to be the view of Osborne’s successor, Philip Hammond, who could do without a blood-curdling assessment from the fund at this juncture."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/10/the-guardian-essential-report-10-october-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T22:55:52Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Essential Report, 10 October results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/10/the-guardian-essential-report-10-october-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/10/the-guardian-essential-report-10-october-results","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Essential Report, 10 October results","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/29/mexico-corruption-pri-santiago-nieto","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T11:18:10Z","webTitle":"Mexican anger over corruption deepens – but will politicians change their ways?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/29/mexico-corruption-pri-santiago-nieto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/29/mexico-corruption-pri-santiago-nieto","fields":{"headline":"Mexican anger over corruption deepens – but will politicians change their ways?","bodyText":"Over the past year, Mexico’s ruling party has been embroiled in a string of scandals, including accusations of wild overspending in regional election campaigns, systematic malfeasance by state governors and an attempt to gut a newly-created national mechanism to fight corruption. So the announcement that the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) had fired the country’s top electoral crimes prosecutor for discussing an investigation with the media has been greeted with skepticism and incredulity. Santiago Nieto – whose investigations had put the PRI on the defensive – was fired last week for unspecified “code of conduct” violations. Nieto’s office had been investigating allegations that the disgraced Brazilian construction company Odebrecht improperly pumped money into the PRI’s 2012 general election campaign. In an interview with the newspaper Reforma, Nieto said that the campaign’s point man for international relations, Emilio Lozoya, had asked the prosecutor to publicly pronounce his innocence in the affair. Lozoya also reminded Nieto that his father was a prominent former PRI cabinet member, the prosecutor said. Shortly after the article appeared, Nieto was forced out. His dismissal – less than a year before presidential elections – has sparked outrage in Mexico, where politicians have seemed unmoved by growing frustration with corruption. Throughout the administration of president Enrique Peña Nieto (no relation to the prosecutor), accusations of political corruption have hit the headlines with disturbing regularity. Yet prominent politicians appear keen to downplay the issue. Peña Nieto recently suggested that Mexicans blame corruption any time they have a problem, while the country’s comptroller Arely Gómez suggested that perceptions of corruption were exaggerated by social media. Ordinary people consistently cite corruption as a major problem in their lives, however. Mexico ranks 123rd on Transparency International’s most recent corruption perceptions index – tied with Sierra Leone and Moldova, and 12 spots worse than its rank the previous year. The Senate, where the PRI and its allies hold 62 of the 128 seats, has missed the deadline to name a specialised anti-corruption prosecutor, meaning that campaigns for the July 1, 2018, election will begin with an interim attorney and no anti-corruption or electoral crimes prosectors. Government loyalists have said that Nieto was fired for discussing an active investigation. Legal experts say that could technically be justified, but sensitive criminal investigations are commonly tried in the media, and bureaucratic incompetence and violations of “codes of conduct” are seldom punished. Last year, the country introduced a new National Anti-Corruption system after investigative journalists found Peña Nieto, his wife and his finance minister had purchased properties from crony contractors. Activists, however, say the system is hobbled by the lack the Senate’s refusal to name an anti-corruption prosector. Among the most high-profile corruption cases which have been held up is the investigation into Odebrecht, which has been accused of funding political corruption across Latin America. Cases against politicians caught in the Odebrecht web have produced convictions in across the region, but so far, none in Mexico. “Odebrecht reflects the impunity in Mexico,” said Luis Pérez de Acha, a lawyer and member of the citizen committee overseeing the National Anti-Corruption System. “It’s a no-go topic.” Lozoya has declared himself “absolutely innocent” of any wrongdoing and announced plans to sue Nieto. On Friday, Nieto announced he would not seek to be reinstated in order “to strengthen the institutions and quality of the electoral process.” Government supporters have also cast themselves as the upholders of due process in case. When the PRI tried to impose a secret vote on the Nieto affair on Wednesday, the party’s senate leader Emilio Gamboa said: “What are work looking for? We’re looking for legality.” Earlier this month Gamboa was revealed to have used a government helicopter to go and play golf. He faced no disciplinary action. Ilán Semo, historian at the Iberoamerican University said the PRI’s use of the language of legality demonstrates a “double discourse,” in which a show of formality was deployed as a proxy for serious investigations of corruption allegations. “The PRI is very formal, but it’s not serious,” said Ilán Semo, historian at the Iberoamerican University. “It’s one thing to be formal, with a discourse of a formal country where the law is obeyed,” he added. “But it’s another thing to be serious.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/10/donna-karan-defends-harvey-weinstein-women","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T04:14:44Z","webTitle":"Donna Karan defends Harvey Weinstein: 'Are women asking for it?'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/10/donna-karan-defends-harvey-weinstein-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/10/donna-karan-defends-harvey-weinstein-women","fields":{"headline":"Donna Karan defends Harvey Weinstein: 'Are women asking for it?'","bodyText":"Fashion designer Donna Karan has come to the defence of film producer Harvey Weinstein by praising the movie mogul and saying women who dress sensually are asking for trouble. Weinstein’s alleged conduct has been condemned by his friends Meryl Streep and Judi Dench, who called the claims “horrifying” and “inexcusable”. He was fired by the board of the Weinstein Company on Sunday after it learned of new information about his behaviour. The producer had been on a leave of absence after the New York Times published a report that detailed acts of alleged harassment towards multiple women, including actors Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd. But on Sunday, Karan, who is also a friend of Weinstein’s, told the Daily Mail that he was “wonderful”. Karan said women must consider if the way they dress suggests they are “asking for it”. “I think we have to look at ourselves,” she said on the red carpet at the CinéFashion film awards in Los Angeles. “Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified. Certainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it’s been a hard time for women. “I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?” Karan said women who dressed provocatively were asking for trouble. “You look at everything all over the world today and how women are dressing and what they are asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble.” Karan described Weinstein and his wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, as “wonderful people” and said he has done “amazing things”. “I don’t think we’re only looking at him. I think we’re looking at a world much deeper than that.” The DKNY founder, whose business is mainly built on making clothes for women, is one of the first people to publicly defend Weinstein since the allegations came to light. Karan’s comments were seized on by Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein’s accusers, who called the designer “scum in a fancy dress”. Other Hollywood actors, including Mia Farrow and Sarah Wynter, were also quick to condemn her remarks. The designer later sought to distance herself from her comments, saying in a statement that they were taken out of context. “While answering a question on the red carpet I made a statement that unfortunately is not representative of how I feel or what I believe.” “I have spent my life championing women. My life has been dedicated to dressing and addressing the needs of women, empowering them and promoting equal rights. “My statements were taken out of context and do not represent how I feel about the current situation concerning Harvey Weinstein.” Karan said sexual harassment was “not acceptable” and apologised to anyone she had offended and “everyone that has ever been a victim.” Weinstein has issued an apology and has said he is seeking therapy. His lawyers say the New York Times story is “saturated with false and defamatory statements” and relies “on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/11/bad-things-dont-vanish-when-you-look-away-dont-ignore-milo-yiannopoulos","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T17:00:02Z","webTitle":"Bad things don’t vanish when you look away.

Don't ignore Milo Yiannopoulos","bodyText":"You’ve probably seen the footage: Milo Yiannopoulos crooning an off key version of “America the beautiful”, while, in the background, white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and sundry other preppy goons smirk and give the Hitler salute. The material leaked to Buzzfeed for its long feature on Yiannopoulos last week raises all sorts of questions about Milo’s forthcoming Australian tour, the most important of which is, quite simply, how the left should react. For many liberals, the answer’s simple. Ignore him, they say. The man’s a provocateur, a publicity hound who thrives on the outrage he generates. If we respond – particularly, if we demonstrate or protest – we’ll be giving him what he wants. In general, bad things don’t disappear when we close our eyes. Historical experience shows that, if they’re not confronted, rightwing extremists flourish, using their meetings and marches to recruit and intimidate. That’s why the call to ignore them generally comes from people casually confident that they won’t personally cop a beating from boot boys rallying in the area. Yiannopoulos, though, poses a somewhat different problem. He’s not a traditional activist; he doesn’t use his events to recruit. On the contrary, he stages campus visits almost entirely to bump his online traffic. As Jesse Singal wrote for NY Mag about Yiannopoulos’ so-called “Dangerous Faggot” tour of 2016, Milo depends on “a rich reinforcing feedback loop of predictable outrage generated by young college students, outraged coverage of that outrage, and, in turn, ever more attention.” When he actually appears on a platform, the guy doesn’t have anything to say. After his recent Berkeley free speech stunt descended into farce (Yiannopoulos turned up for 20 minutes, signed autographs, posed for selfies, and left), Lucian Wintrich, one of the advertised attendees, agreed that the event was “a set up from the get go” and that Yiannopoulos had banked on his appearance being disrupted. All of that makes the “pay him no attention” call rather more persuasive than it otherwise would be. But it’s still wrong, for several reasons. First, we can expect Yiannopoulos to make himself impossible to ignore. He’s a self-described troll – and trolls specialise in forcing victims to respond. Before visiting Sweden, for instance, Yiannopoulos announced an intention to lead a gay pride rally through a Muslim area. Of course, that march never happened but the proposal illustrates the sensibility he’ll bring to Australia. If you’re determined to offend, everyone has buttons you can press. How much chill would conservatives show if, say, a leftwing provocateur announced a flag-burning ceremony on the steps of the war memorial? Whether we like it or not, Yiannopoulos will provoke someone, simply because that’s what Yiannopoulos does. Second, irrespective of demonstrations or protests, Yiannopoulos will get publicity. His tour is sponsored by the old school masturbatory aid Penthouse, and promoted by celebrity PR agent Max Markson. Already, he’s all over the Australian media like a nasty rash, with profiles in Fairfax, News and the Daily Mail, and a live appearance on Sunrise. Andrew Bolt – who’s featured Yiannopoulos on his show – is currently promoting a pro-Milo petition instigated by Mark Latham. In other words, if we don’t react, the meaning of the tour will be framed exclusively by a media remarkably susceptible to the Yiannopoulos snake oil. Buzzfeed published the Nazi salute clip only a few days ago, along with leaked emails proving, beyond doubt, Yiannopoulos’ connection with white nationalists and racists. In one email, Milo describes as “my best friend” someone called Devin Saucier from the white supremacist movement American Renaissance. We now know that Yiannopoulos worked with blogger Vox Day, who regards Anders Breivik as a hero, and the swastika-tattooed hacker Andrew “Weev” Auernheimer, a contributor to the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer. That’s the same Auernheimer who tried to send readers to harass the funeral of Heather Heyer, murdered at the racist rally in Charlottesville. These, and other associations, should, you would think, bar Milo from mainstream society. Yet, after discussing the revelations, News.com airily explains that “some of Yiannopoulos’s behaviour seems darker than he claims” – and then goes on to list his tour details. The supposedly liberal Fairfax doesn’t do much better. On 6 October, Buzzfeed ran the headline: “Here’s How Breitbart And Milo Smuggled Nazi and White Nationalist Ideas Into The Mainstream.” Now look at Fairfax’s banner, three days later: “Alt-right speaker Milo Yiannopoulos seeks to ‘reveal hypocrisy through ridicule’”. Well, that’s one way of describing what he’s doing. Protest against Milo will at least offer some push back against the media’s tendency to give the suave, Cambridge-accented Yiannopoulos the kind of free pass they’d never extend to a tattooed skinhead. A successful rally against him will need to highlight the obvious contradiction of his whole project: that, rather than being silenced, Yiannopoulos enjoys a far bigger platform than ordinary Australians, who have to take to the streets to make themselves heard simply because they’re not telling a wealthy demographic what it wants to hear. For while Milo might present himself as a brave iconoclast standing up against a censorious left, in reality he’s more like a corporate brand, a product designed to funnel alt right rage into a revenue stream. He shot to prominence by pandering to the aggrieved “Gamergate” men, though he’d previously sneered at gamers as “pungent beta male bollock-scratchers and twelve-year-olds”. Since then he’s received massive funding from the rightwing billionaires Robert and Rebekah Mercer, sufficient to establish the team of interns and aides who labour on Milo-branded articles and websites. That’s another reason why a large, vibrant and diverse protest might matter: not merely to oppose Yiannopoulos’ odious views but as an alternative to the Trumpish dystopia he exemplifies. In 2017, you can buy ersatz rebellion from all manner of places. Milo, Infowars, Donald Trump himself: the name varies but the product you’re consuming remains very similar. By contrast, ordinary people coming together to express an opinion offers a quite different – and much more optimistic – model of how politics might be done.

Zuckerberg, along with Facebook’s head of social virtual reality, Rachel Franklin, appeared as avatars within the broadcast from his profile as they “teleported” to different locations using Facebook’s “social VR” tool Spaces. In reality, the two were speaking from the comfort of their offices in the company’s campus in Menlo Park, California, wearing virtual reality headsets. “One of the things that’s really magical about VR is you can get the feeling you’re really in a place,” said Zuckerberg as his grinning avatar floated over scenes of flooding and destruction. “Rachel and I aren’t even in the same building in the physical world, but it feels like we’re in the same place and can make eye contact,” he added before he and Rachel high-fived within the virtual space with the sombre scenes of Puerto Rican devastation around them. Zuckerberg took the opportunity to talk about some of the ways Facebook was helping with disaster relief, including donating $1.5m and working with the Red Cross to build “population maps” so that relief organizations know where the most help is needed. “You can see that we can really feel like we’re here,” said Franklin. “This street is really flooded,” added Mark. After a moment of reflection, the pair decided to “teleport” back to California and switch gears to promote the company’s upcoming Oculus developer conference by showing a 360-degree video from the 2016 event. They then made a virtual journey to the moon, where Franklin marveled at the “absolutely lovely” view of the Milky Way. The live stream briefly dropped after suffering a technical glitch, before a second one started. In the interim, Zuckerberg introduced an animated version of his dog Beast to the virtual space and he and Franklin took a selfie. After taking some questions from the audience, the pair made their final trip to Zuckerberg’s living room, where their avatars were placed in a 360-video with a giant Beast. “It’s from the perspective where we’re tiny and Beast is huge,” said Zuckerberg, in between awkward laughs. “He’s a pretty small dog, he’s a 30lb dog, although more than 30lb of cute, and we’re kind of tiny.” “This is one of the most exciting spaces for the future of social interaction,” he added. After many people criticized the VR broadcast in the comments on his Facebook profile, Zuckerberg apologized. “One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what’s happening in different parts of the world,” he said, adding that he also wanted to publicize Facebook’s partnership with the Red Cross. “Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn’t clear, and I’m sorry to anyone this offended.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/10/the-vampire-breast-lift-just-another-grotesque-beauty-boob","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T02:43:36Z","webTitle":"The 'vampire breast lift': just another grotesque beauty boob | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/the-vampire-breast-lift-just-another-grotesque-beauty-boob","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/the-vampire-breast-lift-just-another-grotesque-beauty-boob","fields":{"headline":"The 'vampire breast lift': just another grotesque beauty boob","bodyText":"Through conquest, Alexander the Great established one of the most vast land empires of the classical age. It stretched from the Mediterranean, through North Africa and on to Asia. He was undefeated in battle, awash with the trophies of victories, self-anointed as a god. Yet a popular quote describes the young conquerer-king viewing the magnificence of his achievements with despair: “And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept – for there were no more worlds to conquer.” Most people know these words from when Alan Rickman says them in Die Hard. It’s a shame that Alexander’s lifespan pre-dated the modern beauty industry. Because if you desire territorial conquest opportunities that are limitless, you don’t need to bother with the satrapies of Asia Minor, the kings of Persia or a shoeless Bruce Willis anymore. Just grab the nearest female body and slash, slice, stab, burn and pillage away. No phalanxes of Macedonian foot-soldiers are necessary – merely gather an Instagram account, a willing celebrity endorsement and the kind of prevailing external culture of misogyny that won’t let any human female rest her own self-hatred for a single minute. Actually, you don’t even need the celebrity or the Instagram account. Just the last one – although it never hurts to shove a freebie into the Oscar’s showbag. My assessment is based on how last year’s Oscar treat is today’s latest abomination masquerading as self-improvement. It’s a “breast plumping” procedure adapted from the equally grotesque “vampire facial” innovation of some years back. You may remember Kim Kardashian’s blood-smeared face promoting it in 2014 as if summoned to do so by human sacrifice and Satanic ritual. This week News.com.au reports that the popularity of “vampire breast lifts” has doubled in the past year. Over the course of two 60-minute sessions, the plot of every body horror movie in existence is spun together for the procedure: blood is drawn from the patient/victim’s arm, then whorled through a centrifuge then “platelet-rich plasma” is sucked from the blood, which is pumped into human boobs, with needles. You don’t go up a cup size, regain lost years of youth or achieve dominion over the ancient subcontinent, but apparently it gives the cleavage “a fuller look”. Full disclosure: I watch a lot of genre movies and whenever a woman shares a context with “blood” and “centrifuges”, nothing good happens next. Human females are actually being encouraged to pay about $2000 for an experience that rationally one would hire a therapist – or many – to forget. Dr Herbert Hooi, the man owning the dubious honour of being the one of the world’s pioneer cleavage-enhancing breast-embloodeners, advocates the procedure for those seeking “shapelier breasts”, which is a thoroughly objective, scientific criteria for wilful bodily trauma if ever there was one. It seems an appropriate punishment for women who have dared to saggen their breasts with the self-indulgence of nursing children or growing older to oblige them into “redness, swelling and possible bruising” after getting their tits re-pumped with fresh blood. Dr Hooi says his vampire boob-needles are “not for everyone,” so, please, be assured that makes everything OK. Tattooing a penis on your face is “not for everyone” but people do that, too. Ramming your face full of nails to more resemble the bubbly side of a pancake can also be niche activity, kind of like more of a hobby than anything else, pfft, whatever, live and let live, people can do what they want, there are no broader social implications, Yolo. Yes, of course some women choose to do these things to themselves. But how rarified and elusive has the standard for the optics of female humanity become that mere “shapelierness” of boobs is now in competitive play? I’ve listed the “non-invasive” procedures advertised to women before. How is it now possible the radical arc of breast enhancements, liposuction, chemical peels, eyelifts, browlifts, backlifts, grin lifts, butt implants, jawline advancements, bellybutton inversions, eyelash transplants, areola reductions, vaginal canal tightening and hacking off one’s labia is still not enough? An industry-wide business model understands that as long as female beauty has greater cultural value than female achievement, it doesn’t matter how gruesome, barbaric, cruel or painful the new treatment to improve “beauty” may be. It doesn’t matter to which part of the body it’s targeted or what it does. You just need to convince a viable market share of women that they’ll be deficient without it, and as a sense of deficiency is admitted and shared among women, it will spread like aesthetic contagion. The size of your empire surely will double in a year. The quote about Alexander the Great that they use in Die Hard is actually bastardised from dramatist William Congreve. The context of it is relevant: “Having only that one hope, the accomplishment of it … must put an end to all my hopes; and what a wretch is he who must survive his hopes!” It doesn’t seem much blessing for women pursuing what society deems most to be beautiful that this particular wretchedness is one they’re unlikely, ever, to know.

Tony Abbott’s ongoing insurgency aside, the Labor party’s command in all the national polls has been the one constant of the political year 2017. This week’s Essential poll finds Labor maintaining a 54-46 two-party-preferred vote, fuelled by a Coalition primary vote that has lost one in seven of its voters since last year’s election. While the public has not quite given up on the prime minister personally, still rating him a lukewarm preferred PM, they have stopped believing in his divided and increasingly erratic government. The PM has spent the year constantly trying to change up the political debate, monstering Shorten personally, promoting public panics around power prices and energy security, even attempting to go to war with the banks. But domestically the Coalition has been locked in a cycle of self-flagellation, with too much of its agenda dictated by a conservative base that threatens Malcolm Turnbull both within his caucus and in the proliferation of minor parties on the right. Even where the government is poised to deliver on an issue such as marriage equality, it will come at the cost of further internal grief as a process designed to stymie change morphs into an inevitable battle to frame unacceptable legislation. And when this is dealt with there is the open wound that is the PM’s inability to get a viable energy policy through his caucus, positioning the government way behind a public that sees the future as renewable. Even if these challenges can be navigated, there is still the rod of the stillborn $60bn corporate tax cut that frames every decrease or underfunded program as proof of the Coalition’s blind faith in a theory of trickle-down economics that the public has also left behind. But the sole remaining consolation for the Coalition as it winds down the 2017 clock is that if there’s one lesson from politics, it is that nothing is inevitable. While it’s hard to see how the Coalition can consciously change up the political dynamic, there are external events that can reset a political agenda, and right now we have two big wildcards out there. The first is the face-off between two crazy-brave dudes with their fingers way too close to the button. As this week’s Essential Report shows, a majority of Australians now think war between the US and North Korean is more likely than not. While one prays there are sufficient checks and balances on the two leaders to avoid an all-out nuclear war, the chances of some sort of confrontation are growing, marking what will be humanity’s first Twitter conflagration. The Turnbull government has already signalled it will follow President Trump wherever he cares to go, which would likely mean Australian naval vessels playing an active role in the region. This opens up the real risk Australia gets caught up in a broader conflict between a weakened US and a rising China over access to regional trade routes. A real war on or off the Korean peninsula would suck all the life out of domestic politics, relieving the current internal pressure on the Coalition, with all groups unifying behind the US alliance. Bill Shorten, despite his investment in travelling to Seoul for high-level briefings, will be forced into lockstep with his opponent. While president Trump will inevitably fight a bellicose and likely ham-fisted war, the concept of an opposition successfully differentiating itself in the heat of an ongoing battle where Australian lives are on the line is hard to conceive. But the greater internal threat would be the unthinkable but increasingly possible prospect of a home-soil terrorist attack. As this week’s report shows, this still represents the greatest challenge to Australian’s sense of personal safety. It is here that the Coalition has been pursuing more proactive groundwork, establishing the homeland security super ministry and seeking more and more powers in the name of anti-terrorism. Last week’s deal with premiers to provide drivers’ licences to allow for real-time facial recognition is just the latest move to restrict personal privacy in the name of safety. The incrementalism in the government’s approach shows it is prepared to probe and push until it finds that point of difference. To date Shorten’s Labor has matched the government each step of the way, conscious that to create a contest on national security opens the attack of being “weak on terror”. Without a major terrorist incident, this is still more akin to shadow boxing, but should a large-scale, high-casualty attack occur, there would be no limits and no restraint. As Kim Beazly discovered to his ultimate demise in 2001 when the Howard government confected the Tampa stand-off, there will be a point where Labor will not be prepared to follow and that will become the point on which a winnable Coalition election campaign can be fought. War and terror – the worst possible developments in Australia’s national story – ironically are probably the last remaining hopes for a Coalition revival. For Shorten and Labor, prayers for peace and safety have never been more heartfelt.

Coleman’s contract runs out next summer and he has previously indicated this would be his last qualifying programme in charge of the team he led to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. “If you ask any manager after a defeat, you want to be as far away from it as you can,” Coleman said when reminded of that statement. “It’s six years I’ve been in charge, or coming up to it at Christmas, and I can’t say right now about my future because I’m not thinking about it. I’m thinking about the fact there’s a dressing room full of devastated players and staff. “The whole nation will be mourning and disappointed because, again, that elusive World Cup has passed us by. There’s a chance I can [stay] and a chance I won’t. I can’t give an answer right now. There will be a conversation in due course and there’s a friendly next month. My contract is until the summer but right now I’m thinking about the experience, I’ll go back to my family and take a bit of time. When the dust settles we’ll see where we go.” James McClean’s 57th-minute winner meant Ireland go into the draw for the play-offs on 17 October, leaving Martin O’Neill celebrating one of the more satisfying nights of his time as national team manager. “It didn’t seem that they troubled us that much,” O’Neill said. “When the ball was in the air we dealt with things reasonably well. When the ball was fizzed in a few times we had to defend but overall it was a great win against a Wales side who did so well at the Euros. “I’ve never doubted the character of the players and their courage was never in doubt. Sometimes we can do better with the ball, but trying to qualify for the World Cup is a monumental task. I knew we’d fight back. And I don’t think anyone would want to play us in the play-offs. “Do I fear teams in it? I don’t think we’d want to play Italy. I don’t think we’d want to play Portugal and there are six others I’d rather not, too. But I’m delighted to be there. I always fear them – and then we go out and beat them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/11/funny-cow-review-maxine-peake-adrian-shergold-standup-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T18:45:19Z","webTitle":"Funny Cow review – Maxine Peake blazes in the dark days of standup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/funny-cow-review-maxine-peake-adrian-shergold-standup-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/11/funny-cow-review-maxine-peake-adrian-shergold-standup-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Funny Cow review – Maxine Peake blazes in the dark days of standup","bodyText":"Maxine Peake dominates the screen as producer and star of this painful, angry film written by Tony Pitts and directed by Adrian Shergold, about a fictional female club comedian fighting her way to the top, or at least the middle, in 1970s Britain. Maybe without Peake this would have looked merely strident or chaotic; and to be frank, even with Peake, it does flirt with some age-old cliches. Comedians are traditionally given centre stage in a drama on condition that they reveal themselves to be unhappy or empty inside. But Peake gives it a fierce, blazing energy and holds everything together through the magnetic force of her performance. Jim Moir, John Bishop, Kevin Eldon and Diane Morgan provide cameos (perhaps to underline the project’s comedy credentials) and the excellent Christine Bottomley is perhaps a bit underused as Peake’s mum. This is a movie with bitter tang of Trevor Griffiths or Dennis Potter, or perhaps a darker and more nihilistic version of the 1979 television play Talent, about a housewife competing in a talent show, written by and starring Victoria Wood – someone who was a close friend and mentor to Peake. Her character occupies a world as gungy as a pub carpet or the inside of a brimming ashtray: a world of nastiness, misery, sexism and racism where comics might go on after an almost surreally grim stripper, and of course inevitably die: the sad porniness of the preceding act defeating the laughs. Interestingly, Peake’s comedian, stage-named Funny Cow and never known as anything else, finds success when she goes on after an emollient Peters-and-Lee-type singing turn (a tiny cameo for Corinne Bailey Rae and Richard Hawley) whose gentle music has cleaned the audience’s palate for comedy. But she has to accept the reality of doing racist and homophobic material in exchange for acceptance, though finding some relief in savaging a misogynist heckler in the crowd. The fuel of her own comedy is a mix of survivalist rage and reckless courage and a simple inability to imagine doing anything else. Interestingly, at the height of her success, if success it is, she is shown driving around in a ketchup-red sports car (a bloke’s car) and elsewhere going into a Judy Garland I-could-go-on-singing monologue in front of what could be television cameras – or it could just be happening inside her head – in which she just sounds depressed. Fame has not, as they say, brought her happiness; but, interestingly, Peake shows that she never particularly expected it to. As a child, she is played with eerie self-possession by Macy Shackleton, infuriating her abusive, brutal dad, played by Stephen Graham, and the dysfunctional relationship replicates itself later when she marries Bob (played by Tony Pitts), a violent, controlling man whom she has to challenge and placate in almost exactly the same way. Bizarrely, seeing seedy and depressive comedian Lenny (Alun Armstrong) on stage grinding through his dire material in front of the chattering drinkers, unlocks something in her, and she also finds herself falling for educated bookshop owner Angus, a slightly cartoony-aesthete role for Paddy Considine – although weirdly these scenes are filmed in what looks like a library. Pitts shuffles the narrative of Funny Cow’s life: it is not aspirationally shaped in any way, nor is there any overreaching crisis at the moment of showbiz triumph. This is not a Billy Elliot or an Educating Rita. We see her post-success, and then pre-success, and then post-success again, and she looks a bit older (or younger) and flashier dressed (or less flashy) but always cynical and disillusioned, and we never see her with an adoring public, receiving what comics are supposed to yearn for: love from strangers. Weirdly, the one time she really looks happy is during a rare happy moment with the hateful Bob in the pub: she swipes a tin beer tray and they sing Mule Train, gleefully annoying the lugubrious publican and a dour local with their anarchy. The scattershot array of scenes has a rangy energy, although it is a bit loosely configured. There is a longish scene in which Funny Cow wanders saucer-eyed through Angus’s posh house with the aria from Catalani’s La Wally belting out on the soundtrack: a scene that perhaps might have been better deployed in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Well, never mind: it’s all part of the freewheeling storytelling style Pitts has gone for. There is no moral, and in the mantra of Seinfeld, there is no hugging, no learning. There is just a hypnotically belligerent performance from Peake, whose anti-heroine explodes like a firework, burning herself to an ashy crisp."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/sydney-anglican-diocese-donates-1m-to-no-campaign-for-same-sex-marriage-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T23:18:13Z","webTitle":"Sydney Anglican diocese donates $1m to no campaign for same-sex marriage vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/sydney-anglican-diocese-donates-1m-to-no-campaign-for-same-sex-marriage-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/sydney-anglican-diocese-donates-1m-to-no-campaign-for-same-sex-marriage-vote","fields":{"headline":"Sydney Anglican diocese donates $1m to no campaign for same-sex marriage vote","bodyText":"The Sydney Anglican diocese has made a $1m donation to the no campaign in Australia’s postal survey on same-sex marriage. Archbishop Glenn Davies announced the donation on Monday in his address to the 51st synod of the diocese of Sydney, telling the church that “removing gender from the marriage construct” would have “irreparable consequences” for society. “Brothers and sisters, the stakes are high and the cost is high,” Davies said. “Yet the cause is just and it is a consequence of our discipleship to uphold the gift of marriage as God has designed it – a creation ordinance for all people.” He said he made “no apology” for encouraging Australians and Anglicans to vote no. “I believe that a change in the definition of marriage is unwarranted, not just because it is in opposition to the teaching of scripture ... but because I believe marriage, traditionally understood as a union of one man and one woman, is a positive good for our society, where marriage and the procreation of children are bound together as the foundational fabric of our society, notwithstanding the sad reality that not all married couples are able to conceive,” he said. “Moreover, I consider the consequences of removing gender from the marriage construct will have irreparable consequences for our society, for our freedom of speech, our freedom of conscience and freedom of religion.” The donation is the largest publicly declared by the no campaign. Neither the yes or no campaigns have publicly declared donations, but the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, personally donated $1m to the yes campaign last month. The no campaign has had two anonymous donors matching donations up to $200,000 and $400,000 respectively. Davies has been a vocal critic of the yes campaign, and accused it of “bullying” opponents. He made particular mention of the Coopers Brewing company, which he said had been the victim of an “uncivilised, unwarranted and malicious campaign” after it released a limited-edition light beer in association with the Bible Society. Davies’ views are not universally held across the Anglican church. In August, the new Archbishop of Perth, Kay Goldsworthy, told the Guardian she favoured the more “inclusive” side of the marriage debate. In his speech Davies took aim at those sections of the Anglican religion which support same-sex marriage, criticising them for being “moulded into the patterns of their surrounding culture”. “The Scottish Episcopal church has already decided to take this perilous path, and it is likely that Canada and the US will soon change their canons to follow suit,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/oct/10/citizenship-case-high-court-considers-mps-eligibility-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T05:23:50Z","webTitle":"Citizenship case: high court considers MPs' eligibility – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/oct/10/citizenship-case-high-court-considers-mps-eligibility-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/oct/10/citizenship-case-high-court-considers-mps-eligibility-live","fields":{"headline":"Citizenship case: high court considers MPs' eligibility – as it happened","bodyText":"And with that, we are done. The court will be back at 10.15 tomorrow morning to hear the rest of the arguments. Tomorrow, we should hear some of the dissenting arguments – so far, everyone has been on the same page. But the Greens are not. Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters have put in a submission which argues against much of what we have heard today – their case rests on ignorance, or carelessness, as they have termed it, should not be considered a defence. A very big thank you to everyone who has played along today. We’ll be back tomorrow to keep you updated and make sure you keep an eye out for Paul Karp’s report, which will be coming at your screens very soon. Bennett argues again that section 44 was inserted to cover divided loyalties, and if you don’t know you have a divided loyalty - ie: you’re unaware of it- then it doesn’t count. I’ve seen a few comments about Canavan’s original claims about his mother applying on his behalf for Italian citizenship, without his knowledge, in 2006. That’s the reason he stepped down from the ministry - after his mother contacted him following the very public resignations of Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam - along with many within the government ridiculing their situation - and said she may have placed him in an awkward position. His mother had told Canavan about his eligibility for citizenship in 2006, but he choose not to take it up. But she did - and when she did, she added him as one of her child, which was seen as a potential registration of Canavan. “It doesn’t purport to be an application on behalf of the children,” Bennett argues. But back in July (doesn’t that seem like a long time ago) Canavan and the government thought that might put him in breach. He stepped down from the ministry and the case was referred to the high court. Further investigations revealed the Italian law change, his legal team argues, and made any action his mother took (which they now say did not grant him citizenship) completely irrelevant. So tl;dr - Canavan’s mother kicked the process off by letting him know she had named him as one of her children on her own citizenship forms, but that didn’t grant him citizenship - it registered him The Italian law change when he was two, however, did give him citizenship by descent. Bennett has presented an expert report which says Canavan would still need to take an active step for that citizenship to apply. Bennett is following the path laid out by Donaghue and Walker, in terms of arguments. He is just expanding on it slightly, by talking about some of the extra layers Italian law has added to the case, given, he argues, it was a law change after Canavan’s birth - and his mother’s birth - which led to his dual citizenship. Basically - that citizenship was “foisted” upon Canavan and he had done nothing, actively, to obtain or retain it, and did not even know of its existence until very recently. The (free) judgements are starting to roll in. Having a quick look at the comments (yes, I lurk) and social media, there seems to be a consensus about ignorance not being an excuse. But there is every chance the high court will disagree – not necessarily falling on the side of ignorance, but examining whether being granted citizenship by descent, or through a foreign power’s law changes, is something section 44 was meant to cover, and whether it is reasonable that people know to check. We are all learning more than we ever needed to about various citizenship laws and how they came to be. “Unfortunately Senator Canavan at the age of two did not have an understanding of Italian constitutional law,” Bennett says with a drawl. It’s been a long day. Everyone is doing their best to find the lols where they can. Bennett points out that when Canavan’s mother, Maria, was born, her father had already naturalised as an Australian citizen, and had lost his Italian citizenship. Then the Italian law changed and Maria, as well as two-year-old Matthew, became Italian citizens by descent, which Bennett refers to as “an event”. That “event” being the Italian court decided it was discriminatory to limit citizenship by descent to the male line, and women could also pass it on. David Bennett thanks Bret Walker and says he has laid out a lot of the case, but focusses in on Matt Canavan who, with his Italian citizenship by descent, has an extra layer of complexity. The court is attempting to understand what Walker is arguing in regards to knowledge of foreign citizenship, or not turning your mind to the potential for foreign citizenship. He says the case draws the line at “wilful blindness”. Reasonable steps are “not your state of mind, it’s what you do,” Walker clarifies under questioning. “Once one knows then we submit the disqualification rules apply, unless you can point to having done everything you can do reasonably,” Walker says. Walker says the choice of what to do then, before entering parliament, only applies to one who knows they have it. Skyes v Cleary is up again, because that is the case which set out those reasonable steps to divest a candidate of any foreign citizenship political parties have relied on since 1992 when it comes to this stuff. But Walker is arguing that if you didn’t know you were a foreign citizen, then you couldn’t be expected to take reasonable steps, because you didn’t know they were necessary. That is essentially what the government has set out as well. Walker, on behalf of his clients, is arguing that section 44 was designed for those who knew of their foreign citizenship and did nothing to renounce it. “It is knowledge of foreign citizenship that is the key. That is the key,” he says, under questioning of the justices. Again, this may be the point that the whole seven cases rest on. Walker is essentially fleshing out his two main points. First, that citizenship by descent should be considered differently because “it is not like the place of one’s birth” and the different foreign laws which govern who is a citizen by descent and who is not. His main second point is if you didn’t know you were a foreign citizen, then you didn’t really have split loyalties and could not have been expected to take the steps to renounce it. So the argument is not so much ignorance of the law, or the constitution, but ignorance of your own citizenship circumstances. We are back on the history of section 44, with Walker saying the eventual final words used in the constitution were for those who knew of their foreign citizenship and did nothing to renounce it. Walker says there is “no split allegiance when you are not aware of one of them”. Walker does concede that Australians who, for some reason, have no ambition to enter parliament, may see dual citizenship as a “boon, not a burden”. Walker is now talking about citizenship by descent. He says he has not found anything in the citizenship by descent cases, mentioning Joyce and Nash, that there is not a lot to contradict Australia’s laws. The citizenship by descent worked for only one generation, he says, for Joyce and Nash, unlike Canavan which was citizenship by “indefinite” descent. That’s a quick summary of the differences in foreign law the court is dealing with – New Zealand and the UK grant citizenship by descent to to the children of a citizen, where Italy allows it for as long as the descendant citizenship line remains unbroken. So if Nonna or Nonno renounced their Italian citizenship, then their children and grandchildren et al would not have received citizenship by descent. The second part of the case Walker is contending is the “exorbitant” foreign citizenship laws. In plain English, that is a reference to how five of the seven, at least as far as the government is concerned, were impacted by a foreign power’s laws, having made no moves themselves to apply for that citizenship. Walker says it is clear Sykes v Cleary does not address people who were not aware of their foreign citizenship. “Why it is chiefly important in our case is because we say it is clear there was no knowledge” and thereby, they could not take the steps to renounce it, Walker says. I am paraphrasing here, but we are prohibited from recording high court proceedings. And with that, the solicitor-general Stephen Donaghue sits down. On to Bret Walker (who is considered a rock star in these circles). He brings up the emails, including “the enquiry am I still a British citizen” as the subject line, which Roberts sent before he nominated for parliament. He sent that email to .sydneyuk and when he didn’t get a reply, he sent another email saying he renounced his citizenship. Sending an email is not enough, Donaghue agrees – given there is a form and fee to return to the UK Home Office. Donaghue says the government submits that, unless the high court decides to move away from Sykes v Cleary, it contends Roberts did not take reasonable steps to renounce his citizenship and should be disqualified. Donaghue is back on Malcolm Roberts (page 1,279 of the submission he has put forward to the justices). He brings up how in May 1974, when he was 19, Roberts became an Australian citizen. “He was a British citizen and the suggestion that he was aware that he was a British citizen was confirmed by the terms ... that is a critical fact in circumstances that will apply [in whether or not someone should have taken reasonable steps],” Donaghue argues. The high court, sitting as the court of disputed returns, has returned from break. Bret Walker, who is representing the three government MPs has ceded some time to Donaghue, so we have a little more from the government’s point of view to go. The court has adjourned until 2.15pm. I’m going to recharge the devices (there are no power points for us to use here) and see you back later this afternoon. If you just can’t get enough of section 44, my colleague Paul Karp will have a comprehensive story on the day’s events for your consumption soon. One of the justices just brought up that Sykes v Cleary may have already addressed the issue of natural-born Australian v naturalised citizen – and that it shouldn’t be treated differently. It’s just a question, at this stage, but Donaghue didn’t directly address it, other than to say the government’s submission wasn’t directly relying on that. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is still backing Malcolm Roberts. Hanson declared “hand on heart” that she had seen Roberts’s paperwork which proved he had renounced his British citizenship before he nominated. That paperwork turned out to be emails he sent to defunct addresses in the days leading up to his Senate nomination, with the high court finding last month he was still a dual citizen when he was elected, and only filled out the official paperwork and paid the nominated fee after the 2016 election. Hanson had accused the media of a “witch hunt” over Roberts’s citizenship concerns. She has not addressed her declaration of having seen the paperwork, but she is still behind her party colleague and appears to have taken issue with George Brandis’s submission to the high court regarding Roberts. Here is what she told the ABC: Well, I hope that out of the citizenship hearing that everyone gets treated exactly the same. If one goes, they must all go. Because they have allegiance to its citizenship. Senator Brandis has targeted One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts right from the start. That is not fair and he should keep his nose out of it. It’s got nothing to do with him. And he said when Rod Culleton was up there, it’s nothing to do with the Senate, it’s to do with the high court. The same thing goes now. He actually has to stand back from this and let the high court or the court of disputed returns deal with this issue. Now, they have all been shown to have, in some way or another, an allegiance to another country, or the possible allegiance to another country, and under the constitution … you can’t have that allegiance to another country. The difference with Senator Roberts is, and I can state this honestly, he had no idea that he could have possibly been a British citizen, but he took steps prior to his nomination was put into actually renounce his citizenship. He may be criticised for actually maybe sending it to the wrong address, but the whole fact is he followed that up again. Now, at least he took steps. What did the other political parties do, or the other candidates do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. So, what I’m saying is that if one has to go, they should all go.” Donaghue says the government does not want to suggest a misguided belief or wrong belief is reasonable. He says that being born in a foreign country, or travelling on another country’s passport or documentation, should be enough to ensure there are checks. Larissa Waters is a complication to this argument, but the government has argued that she did have reason to believe that she did not receive Canadian citizenship, despite being born there. We are back to Sykes v Cleary – but how it applies to Ludlam and Roberts. Donaghue argues that having a reasonable consideration there could be potential for foreign citizenship and not doing anything, or taking the necessary steps, could be interpreted as taking a voluntary or active step – to do nothing. Ludlam became an Australian citizen as a teenager and believed that automatically cancelled out his New Zealand citizenship. Roberts arrived in Australia from India as a seven-year-old, with a Welsh-born father, and became an Australian citizen as a teenager. That is why the government is arguing they had reason to check. Donaghue’s argument has the justices engaged over what it would mean for Sykes v Cleary. The government doesn’t want to go as far to say the court got it wrong in 1992 – indeed, part of their argument against Ludlam and Roberts relies on the Sykes judgement. But it does pose some questions over where this argument sits. The solicitor general wants the court to focus on the intention of section 44 when it was being written, which he admits does not have a “perfect alignment” with his submission. He doesn’t say it’s the vibe, but we’re all thinking it. Solicitor general Stephen Donaghue is still working his way through his history lesson on the drafting of the constitution, so we’ll take the opportunity to sum up what we have learnt so far: The government maintains that Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash, Matt Canavan, Larissa Waters and Nick Xenophon have similar cases. Donaghue argues none of them had reason to suspect they may hold foreign citizenship, and therefore did not have reason to check before they nominated. The government submits that section 44 was never intended to catch parliamentarians like those five MPs, as none had actively attempted to obtain or retain their citizenship. Scott Ludlam and Malcolm Roberts did have reason to suspect they could have foreign citizenship ties according to the government and therefore had a responsibility to thoroughly check before their nomination. Their failure to do so is why they should be found ineligible to have been elected. Donaghue wants the court to interpret section 44 through its “operational purpose” which he says, required some sort of action to obtain or retain citizenship, not the literal wording. That would narrow the view of Sykes v Cleary, the 1992 case which has set out much of how the court interprets section 44. We are now taking a trip down memory lane to the Queen’s jubilee in 1897, when a colonial conference was held. A draft of the Australian constitution was presented at this conference and the British authorities got a look at it. There were some questions, Donaghue says, about the draft, and some “friendly” suggestions about how to improve the draft, including in regards to citizenship. John Bradley Hirst wrote about some of it in his book, Looking for Australia: Historical Essays. But Donaghue is interrupted. Justice James Edelman wants to know why Donaghue is bringing up these drafts, given the constitution wasn’t, for all intents and purposes, a public document at the time. Donaghue says he is bringing it up as the historical context provides some reasons for the change, but that there is nothing to suggest there was an intention to bring about the situation we see today. Donaghue says that looking at the history of section 44, it was focused on “voluntarily acquisition” of foreign citizenship. “It is relevant to keep in mind the target [of the provision] as it was framed and operated”. Going back 30 years before the constitution commenced, Donaghue says the law made distinctions between those who actively applied/obtained foreign citizenship and those who did not. He says if you were naturalised and became a British subject, you became entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen, which is the language used in section 44. He argues that it took being actively naturalised to get those rights – they weren’t automatically applied through citizenship. The solicitor general has just taken us through a thrilling history of section 44. I don’t want you to get too excited so I’ll save you the nitty-gritty (it is still early, after all) but basically Donaghue was arguing the section was not created for the situation we find ourselves in today. That comes back to the core of the government’s argument – that if you don’t actively seek out foreign citizenship or do anything active to retain it, and don’t have reasonable suspicions you could be a foreign citizen, then you can’t be in breach of section 44. Donaghue brings up that the British parliament allows dual citizens – as long as they were natural born subjects. “The target is not being a dual citizen, it is actively seeking out foreign citizenship” which was identified as being inconsistent with sitting in parliament, he argues. Donaghue is now summarising citizenship laws – for both Australia and some of the foreign powers in question. We’re currently in 18th century British law. Just for context, the overflow court is one of the high court hearing rooms – but we are all looking at a split screen broadcast of the proceedings. We are not allowed to take devices into the room where the case is being held, so in order to transmit was is happening, we have to sit down the hall. The court has just brought up the fact that “natural-born Australians” are usually “on notice” of potential foreign citizenship, given the nation’s history. But Donaghue said in the government’s submission, if someone is not aware, or couldn’t be aware, then they shouldn’t be disqualified. This is going to be one of the main points we see argued. Given the multicultural nature of Australia, and that a lot of people are aware of potential citizenship conflicts, and renounce before they enter parliament, is it reasonable that these MPs did not check before nominating? And we have got to the crux of the government’s case – it says section 44 should be read as “voluntarily obtaining or retaining” foreign citizenship. The chief justice, Susan Kiefel, is questioning Donaghue over “the subjective component over what would be a positive step” towards obtaining/retaining a foreign citizen. Donaghue says if someone became a citizen because someone filled out paperwork for them and lodged it without their knowledge, that would not be a positive step, or voluntarily becoming a citizen, despite the laws of the foreign power, at least under the test the government is arguing. “Knowledge of a sufficiently high prospect” that they could have foreign citizenship is another crucial aspect of the government’s case. Donaghue is arguing that if there was that knowledge “and they shut their eyes to it”, then they should be found in breach – that’s the government’s argument for why Scott Ludlam and Malcolm Roberts should be found in breach. But it argues the others didn’t have the knowledge of “a sufficiently high prospect” and, therefore, couldn’t have known they were in conflict with section 44. Slight interruption as we are all booted from the overflow court (where we are allowed devices) because it is suddenly needed “for another purpose” and sent to a second overflow court. Just another quirk of the high court. But it seems like the court has moved on to clarifying whether the government believes there are any “non-literal” meanings of Australian citizen and section 44. Fiona Nash’s case is now being outlined. She was born in Sydney, but her father was born in Scotland. They were estranged and she didn’t know the exact date of her father’s birth, or details about her grandparents. Donaghue believes that is an important point, given that family background is important when it comes to citizenship. Nash did not know, he argues, that you could receive citizenship by descent from Scotland. The last of the five the government claims should not be found in breach is Nick Xenophon. Xenophon has announced he intends to resign no matter what the high court decides – he has his eye on the South Australian state parliament. But he does believe he can win this, and so does Donaghue. Xenophon made moves to renounce any Greek or Cypriot citizenship before he entered the Senate but, as Donaghue argues, recently learnt he was a British overseas citizen because Cyprus was a UK territory until 1960. “At no time prior to the elections did it even cross his mind he might have British citizenship,” Donaghue says. But he does – because his father left Cyprus before the date of independence. “So, the relevant facts … are shown to depend not just on when the father is born … but related to the political fact” of when a country becomes independent. Donaghue is whipping through these cases. He has moved on to Barnaby Joyce and is laying out his family history. Joyce’s father, James, left New Zealand before New Zealand citizenship existed. But when New Zealand citizenship was created, it was granted to Joyce Sr as a matter of course. Joyce the elder discovered he was a New Zealand citizen in 1978, when our Joyce was 10, when he went to become a justice of the peace and learnt he still carried New Zealand citizenship, and renounced it. This came as a surprise to Barnaby Joyce – he said he never had any reason to believe he was a New Zealand citizen, having been born in Australia. Donaghue has moved on to Larissa Waters. Born to Australian parents in Canada, while they were working there, she left when she was 11 months old and believed that she was entitled to Canadian citizenship but needed to apply before she was 21. The government submits that she, like Canavan, conscientiously decided not to apply for citizenship. “She thought she had a choice to apply for Canadian citizenship,” Donaghue argues, and she did not. Therefore she had no reason to believe she was Canadian. Donaghue says Canavan was told by his mother in 2006 that he was eligible to become an Italian citizen but needed to fill out some forms. He chose not to, and said that was why he it never crossed his mind to check his citizenship before nominating. Donaghue says the argument that it was “carelessness”, which is what Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam contend, doesn’t hold up for Canavan, because of those circumstances. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, has described the situation Canavan has found himself as the fault of a “quirk” of Italian law. His grandparents became Australian citizens, and his mother was an Australian citizen, but in 1983, the Italian courts passed a law that gave citizenship to Canavan’s mother, which automatically passed on to a two-year-old Canavan. The court already has an idea of the arguments – the submissions each MP’s counsel was obliged to provide lay out the defence. The government MPs have grouped their cases together with Larissa Waters and Nick Xenophon as not being in breach. Waters is a complication for the government – not only is she disputing the government’s defence and maintaining she, and the others, were in breach of the constitution, she was also born overseas. So far, that has been the first question in Canavan’s case, which is being laid out by the solicitor general – how does Waters fit in, given she was born in Canada? He agrees it is a “complication” but plans to explain that more fully as they go on. The justices are in the building – the court is in session. The government is relying on a dissenting judgment from Justice Deane in 1992, which opened the door for the defence George Brandis is relying on. While the rest of the court took section 44 literally when it came to citizenship, Deane took the line that it should really only apply to cases “where the relevant status, rights or privileges have been sought, accepted, asserted or acquiesced in by the person concerned” Section 44(i) of the constitution states that any person who: “is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power … shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives”. There was quite the crowd for court room one. The high court has new security measures in place, so it was a slow start, but we are in place and waiting for the hearing to start at 10.15. It doesn’t look like any of the MPs will be attending, but there probably wouldn’t be room for them, given the number of briefcases and files in the room. We understand that Matt Canavan’s case will be the first discussed. The women and men of the high court have gathered in Canberra to hear the first of the citizenship cases in front of it. Government MPs Barnaby Joyce, Matt Canavan, Fiona Nash, One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts, Nick Xenophon and the Greens senators who resigned upon discovering their conflict, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam, will all have their cases examined over the next three days. Waters and Ludlam argue they were in the wrong and so is everyone else in front of the court, and should be found ineligible to have been elected. Their submission to the high court was pretty open and shut – essentially: we should have checked, we didn’t check and ignorance is no excuse. But the government argues differently. Attorney general George Brandis submitted that Joyce, Nash, Canavan, Xenophon and Waters should be found not to be in breach of the constitution, because they didn’t know they were dual citizens and did not do anything to voluntarily receive or retain that citizenship. But Roberts and Ludlam, Brandis argued, had reasonable suspicion to check. If you need a refresher on why he thinks that, head here, but basically it’s because Ludlam and Roberts were born overseas and came to Australia, in Ludlam’s case as a teenager and for Roberts when he was seven years old. Roberts believes he has the strongest case, having sent emails to defunct addresses to renounce any UK citizenship, despite not truly believing he was ever British. That’s the “reasonable steps” defence – but it will be up to the court to decide if those steps, were indeed reasonable, given the UK has a set process of official forms and a fee. Then there is Nick Xenophon, who has announced he is leaving the Senate anyway, to take a shot at the South Australian parliament. He said he took steps to renounce any Greek or Cypriot citizenship, given his parents’ ancestry, but was tripped up by the fact Cyprus was a British territory until 1960. He was born in 1959. And through his father, became a British overseas citizen at birth. It’s going to take three days to get through these cases – and a lot of coffee. Let’s get started."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/10/pressure-peaks-on-ange-postecoglous-socceroos-in-era-defining-syria-clash","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T21:33:31Z","webTitle":"Pressure peaks on Ange Postecoglou's Socceroos in era-defining Syria clash | Kieran Pender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/pressure-peaks-on-ange-postecoglous-socceroos-in-era-defining-syria-clash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/10/pressure-peaks-on-ange-postecoglous-socceroos-in-era-defining-syria-clash","fields":{"headline":"Pressure peaks on Ange Postecoglou's Socceroos in era-defining Syria clash","bodyText":"It is remarkable, given the Socceroos’ long history of not qualifying for the World Cup, that the prospect of defeat to Syria on Tuesday evening seems so unfathomable. Australia have participated in only four of the 20 World Cups held since the tournament’s inception; until 2006, the Socceroos had qualified just once. Yet since joining the Asian Football Confederation, qualification has swiftly become the expected norm. The Socceroos were a class above distant Tajikistan and tiny Bhutan, so it was thought, and a ticket to Fifa’s biggest quadrennial event was now a formality. Even regional heavyweights, like Japan and Saudi Arabia, could be no match for Tim Cahill and company. These illusions risk being shattered at the ANZ Stadium on Tuesday, should Australia fail to beat Syria. A two-year campaign stretching from Thailand to Kyrgyzstan culminated last month with the Socceroos three goals short of automatic qualification, necessitating a treacherous detour on the road to Russia. A 1-1 draw against Syria last Thursday left the two-legged play-off finely poised, an away goal handing the Socceroos a slender advantage but the Qasioun Eagles buoyed by their late equaliser. With progression uncertain, the Socceroos face their most important game in a generation. Defeat would reverberate around the domestic footballing landscape – Football Federation Australia would suffer a substantial financial setback, there would be no common ground to contain the currently-raging internecine governance battle, and the nation’s next generation won’t have local heroes to idolise at Russia 2018. A dozen years since that John Aloisi penalty sent the Socceroos to their first World Cup in three decades, the momentum that has sustained the round ball game in Australia ever since is at risk of dissipating. The pressure surrounding this potentially era-defining clash is therefore enormous, and it largely rests on the shoulders of one man: Ange Postecoglou. A brusque character at the best of times, the 52-year-old’s once quietly-confident demeanour is fading. In response, his detractors have only become louder. Where it was once “in Ange we trust”, the coach’s every decision is now scrutinised. Postecoglou’s decision to retain a three-player defensive formation first deployed against Iraq 13 months ago has become focal point for dissent. All eyes will be on the team-sheet released an hour before Tuesday’s 8pm AEDT kick-off. Australia’s most technically-gifted player Tom Rogic was a notable omission from the starting 11 for the first-leg, providing Postecoglou critics with yet more ammunition. But Rogic has struggled to combine effectively with Aaron Mooy, the Australian midfield general, in a coaching dilemma eerily reminiscent of Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard’s famous incompatibility in England’s ranks. On Monday, Postecoglou foreshadowed 37-year-old Cahill might start. With over a century of Socceroos caps to his name, the Melbourne City marquee has made a habit of rescuing his national side from precarious situations. Can the forward, who was briefly ineligible after representing Samoa at a junior level, save his country once more? Opponents Syria, meanwhile, are a team of two narratives. To some, they are a footballing fairytale, the next incarnation of the Iraq side that fleetingly united a nation by winning the 2007 Asian Cup. To the more cynical, they are a propaganda tool of the Assad regime – distracting compatriots with sporting success while their country burns. This dual identity is best encapsulated by veteran Syrian striker Firas Al Khatib. A late substitute on Thursday, the 34-year-old made an instant impact with his silky playmaking and short shorts. But Al Khatib only returned to the national team recently following a five-year boycott, his protest against a president that has caused untold human misery during a six-year civil war. Al Khatib’s decision to don the Syrian jersey once more has pained him – he told ESPN: “Twelve million Syrians will love me. [The] other 12 million will want to kill me.” 14,000 kilometres from Damascus, Tuesday’s clash in Sydney offers significant downsides yet only a sliver of upside for Postecoglou. Defeat would consign his tenure to history, irrevocably tarnishing a reputation otherwise bolstered by a creditable 2014 World Cup and Australia’s 2015 Asian Cup triumph. Victory will be rewarded only by another nerve-wracking two-legged encounter, likely against either Panama or Honduras, with a World Cup spot for the victor. But the Socceroos are no strangers to daunting play-offs. Iran 1997, Uruguay 2001, Uruguay 2005 – these moments have come to define Australian football, for better and for worse. Whatever the result, Syria 2017 will be added to that list. And so, through the qualification gauntlet the Socceroos go once more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/oct/10/scott-morrisons-next-trick-selling-a-gst-revenue-cut-to-every-state-bar-one","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T17:00:25Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison's next trick – selling a GST revenue cut to every state bar one | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/10/scott-morrisons-next-trick-selling-a-gst-revenue-cut-to-every-state-bar-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/10/scott-morrisons-next-trick-selling-a-gst-revenue-cut-to-every-state-bar-one","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison's next trick – selling a GST revenue cut to every state bar one","bodyText":"The distribution of the GST is among the hottest of political potatoes, and so it was little wonder that after Monday’s release of the Productivity Commission’s draft report on horizontal fiscal equalisation, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, steered well clear of any specific recommendations and kept to talk of a “fair go”. While Morrison did speak of a general need to fix the system, he did nothing to indicate his preference for any of the specific recommendations in the report. This is no surprise given the zero-sum game of goods and services tax distribution, the commission’s recommendations would result in Morrison having to convince every government except Western Australia to be losers. Perhaps the most accurate statement in the Productivity Commission draft report on horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) is when it notes that “there is a dearth of public understanding of how HFE works, and this is compounded by the lack of a strong neutral voice in public discussion”. HFE is essentially about attempting to provide each state and territory government with the same capacity to provide services and infrastructure. That sounds straight forward, but because HFE mostly occurs through distributing GST revenue across the states, if you suggest one state should get more GST revenue to ensure it is fiscally equal, that means other states must get less. It’s very tough to find a “strong neutral voice” in a zero-sum game. Because different states have both different spending needs and differing abilities to raise revenue, all states get either more or less than they would were we to assume that everything was equal and the GST should be carved up on a per capita basis. In 2017-18 New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia received less GST revenue than their share Australia’s population would warrant. If the GST was carved up purely along population lines, WA this year would have received $4.4bn more: The reasons for the difference is due to both revenue and expenditure. The massive amount of revenue that WA is able to raise via mining royalties reduces its share of GST by $5.5bn, whereas the housing boom that brings with it stamp duty means NSW receives $1.8bn less than it otherwise would – because those states in effect have an unequal ability to raise revenue: But each state also has different issues that affect its spending requirements – such as the age of the population and the share of Indigenous people. Some states also have higher public sector wage costs (which might be due to remoteness and the distance required to service – as is the case with WA): Easily the biggest impact on GST is mining revenue, and this is the main driver behind the decision to review HFE. From the Western Australian point of view, the current system is unfair because its massive mining royalties means it receives less GST per capita by far than any other state. Its current relativity per capita share is 60% lower than the NSW, which has the next lowest share: But we need some context. Until the arrival of the boom in mining royalties, WA was the biggest winner from HFE. Starting from federation, WA until around 2010 had been a much greater beneficiary of commonwealth money than any other state. NSW and Victoria, as the biggest states, are easily the ones who have “lost” the most money to other states in the interests of HFE: And while WA is not doing all that well out of the GST carve-up now, the Productivity Commission notes that because the GST distribution is worked out using a three-year average of revenue such as mining royalties, the state actually received more GST than it would have had its share been worked out using the actual mining royalties. The report notes that the Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC) has estimated that the growth in iron ore royalties saw WA retain an extra $7bn in GST over the six years to 2015-16: And no one should pretend they did not see the fall coming. The Western Australian government in its 2011-12 budget even noted that it estimated in 2014-15 it would receive only a 33% share of its GST (an amount that was actually slightly conservative). However rather than budget for this fall, in perhaps one of the most disgraceful public finance decisions in Australian government history, the then WA treasurer Christian Porter instead assumed that the GST rules would be changed. In his budget speech, he told the WA parliament that “what we reasonably anticipate is that in 2013-14 the CGC will have brought in a new GST system. We expect it will produce a floor of about 75% of our population share of the GST. Therefore we expect extra revenue of $1.8bn in 2013-14 and $2.5bn in 2014-15.” He might as well have assumed that fairies at the bottom of the garden were about to invent a money tree. We should note that the author of this manifestly wrong assumption is now the federal minister for social services. Never let it be said that gross budgetary incompetence is any hindrance to promotion in government. But the Productivity Commission does note that there are problems with the current system. At the moment, the system works to get each state equal to the best performing state. The commission notes that this has worked well in the past, but is less effective now because Western Australia’s revenue capacity is abnormally large and somewhat erratic. It means that “the redistribution task is considerable and the standard being equalised to is potentially volatile.” The commission therefore recommends that “equalisation should no longer be to the highest state, but instead the average or the second highest state”. Such a move would be – to put it mildly – political difficult. Every state would be worse off except Western Australia: Good luck getting Queensland and South Australian governments – who are both worried about losing seats at the upcoming state elections to One Nation or the Nick Xenophon party – to agree to a system that would cost them, in Queensland’s case, to $1.5bn. The commission also used the report to bang its drum for economic reforms it has long favoured – including a congestion tax and a shift from stamp duty to a land tax. It argues that the current system is a disincentive for tax reform because were a state to introduce a new tax it would likely lose GST revenue. Although, rather crucially, it notes that “there is no direct evidence that such incentives have changed specific policy decisions”. It excuses this lack of evidence with the rather philosophical view that “an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”. However it rather strains credibility to suggest the reason states have not pursued a congestion tax is a worry over a decline in their share of GST rather than the actual worry over the massive political unpopularity of the policy. But there is no need to question the difficulty of the proposed changes for distributing GST. Six years ago, Porter thought it reasonable to assume that a change to the GST distribution would have occurred four years ago – such a change never came close to occurring. On the back of this draft report however we are at least closer to knowing what a change to the system would look like, but we are no closer to altering the political challenges such a change would face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/09/matt-canavan-suggests-he-could-quit-politics-if-high-court-rules-him-ineligible","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T06:15:18Z","webTitle":"Matt Canavan suggests he could quit politics if high court rules him ineligible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/09/matt-canavan-suggests-he-could-quit-politics-if-high-court-rules-him-ineligible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/09/matt-canavan-suggests-he-could-quit-politics-if-high-court-rules-him-ineligible","fields":{"headline":"Matt Canavan suggests he could quit politics if high court rules him ineligible","bodyText":"Matt Canavan has suggested he may quit politics if the high court rules him ineligible to sit in the Senate, saying it will be up to his wife to decide if he continues. Ahead of three days of high court hearings into his and six other parliamentarians’ eligibility over dual citizenship, the Nationals senator raised the prospect he could quit if he loses the case. “I’ve told the boss, my wife, if the worst outcome happens she is the boss and we’ll work out what we do when and if that happened,” Canavan told Nine News. “I’d love to continue doing it but I’ve always said that my job as a father is much more important than my job as a senator, I’ve got five kids, so we’ll just see what happens next for me, if that happened.” Canavan resigned as resources minister in June, quitting cabinet over his dual Italian citizenship. He renounced Italian citizenship and stayed in the Senate pending the high court case on his eligibility. Although Canavan was not born an Italian, in 1983 the Italian constitutional court held that citizenship can pass by descent through the maternal line, retrospectively rendering his mother and himself citizens from their birth in 1955 and 1980. The attorney general, George Brandis, has submitted that parliamentarians should not be disqualified over dual citizenship they did not know they held, and only those who “voluntarily obtained or retained” foreign citizenship should be barred. Canavan supported that submission, arguing he had “no relationship of allegiance with Italy” of the kind banned by section 44 of the constitution. The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, has suggested Canavan’s case is “materially indistinguishable” from the cases of the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, the Nationals senator Fiona Nash and Nick Xenophon because they were all born in Australia and say they had no knowledge they acquired foreign citizenship by descent. Xenophon has announced his plans to resign, regardless of the outcome of the high court case, while Joyce and Nash are intent on staying in parliament. Greens Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters have both already resigned from the Senate, although Waters has suggested she may seek to return. Ludlam, Waters and the contradictor in Joyce’s case, the former independent MP Tony Windsor, have submitted that section 44 bans parliamentarians who are dual nationals regardless of whether they know it or not. If that strict understanding of section 44 is applied, which has been the majority reasoning in earlier high court precedents, constitutional lawyer George Williams has said that all seven parliamentarians would likely be ineligible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-parents-want-schools-to-teach-more-social-skills-survey-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T17:00:25Z","webTitle":"Australian parents want schools to teach more social skills, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-parents-want-schools-to-teach-more-social-skills-survey-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-parents-want-schools-to-teach-more-social-skills-survey-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australian parents want schools to teach more social skills, survey finds","bodyText":"The line between what children learn at home and in the classroom is being blurred as Australian parents increasingly ask schools to help socialise their children, new research has found. A joint study between researchers at Monash University and the Australian Scholarships Group released on Tuesday found 69% of parents across the public and independent sector believe schools should be teaching more social skills, while almost half want their children to be taught how to “behave in public”. Part of ASG’s “parents report card”, the study surveyed 1,800 parents across Australia. It’s the third year ASG has produced the study, and the group’s chief executive, John Velegrinis, said he had seen “a marked increase” in parents wanting what he called a “more holistic education” for their children. Velegrinis said parents were thinking about education as more than just “curriculum and outcomes” and were thinking more about “socialisation” as children spent more time engaging with digital learning tools. “We think socialisation is becoming amore prevalent focus because of the nature of the activities children are undertaking,” he said. “They’re spending more individual time looking at screens, so therefore perhaps parents are worried that they’re missing out on social interaction”. But while Velegrinis said that other research showed teachers felt they were being asked to do more in the classroom, he said what the study showed was the need for greater discussion about what both teachers and parents expected schools to provide. “I think there’s a little bit of uncertainty between parents and schools about where responsibilities start and stop,” he said. “The very simple answer is that life was once much simpler than it is now and so those roles maybe need to be better defined. “We’ve got to make that conversation a far more powerful one … it’s incredibly important that parents work with teachers to strike right balance between what’s taught in the home and at school.” The study also found that parents’ attitudes about what they want their children to learn varied dramatically across cultural lines. For example it found that only 25% of parents who described themselves as being of Australian background believe sexual education is best learnt at school, versus 62% of Indian and other Asian parents. Similarly, while 74% of parents who described themselves as from an Australian background agreed that they could openly talk about sex at home, it fell to 60% for Indian and other Asian parents. Velegrinis said the data showed schools should be more sensitive to the cultural makeup of their schools, rather than seeing each student population as “generic”. “It shows we shouldn’t be thinking of parents as a general cohort,” he said. “If a school has a predominant culture or value set than that will be reflected in parent expectations.” While the study did not look at how those opinions differed between independent and public school parents, it did find that more parents with children in the private schools sector believed their children had adequate access to resources. The study found that 90% of parents with children in private schools agreed that their child “has all the resources they need for academic success, compared with 80% in the Catholic sector and 78% in public schools. The report also revealed location and income shaped the views of parents and their perception of the importance of academic success. While 75% of parents who live in metropolitan cities set high standards for their child’s academic achievement, that dropped to 63% in regional areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/sydney-catchment-water-contamination-deadline-nears-for-mine-owner","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T17:00:25Z","webTitle":"Mine owner urged to halt heavy metals leaching into Sydney water catchment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/sydney-catchment-water-contamination-deadline-nears-for-mine-owner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/sydney-catchment-water-contamination-deadline-nears-for-mine-owner","fields":{"headline":"Mine owner urged to halt heavy metals leaching into Sydney water catchment","bodyText":"Multinational company Boral has been told to take urgent action to stop pollution flowing from a disused mine site into the Wingecarribee river in the New South Wales southern highlands. Boral now has three days left to tell the state’s environmental watchdog, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), what it will do to stop zinc, nickel and manganese leaching into the river, which is part of Sydney’s drinking water catchment. The pollution was discovered by an academic, University of Western Sydney water scientist Ian Wright, earlier this year. Wright described the zinc contamination as the worst he had seen, and criticised the “soft, almost meaningless” environmental regulations applied to the mine, which include no limits on the leaching of heavy metals into the river. He fears contamination at disused mine sites will be seen across the country in coming years. “Whether we like it or not, a lot of coalmines are closing down; I think this is a harbinger of things to come,” Wright told Guardian Australia. “We can’t just keep dumping untreated or poorly treated mine waste into a river – the community is demanding better than that.” The coalmine operated from the late 1800s until 2013, perched above the river near the small villages of Medway and Berrima. It is close by to another proposed underground coalmine, Hume Coal, which Wright has similar concerns about. Boral is still in the process of closing the site, which requires negotiations with the state government. Wright tested water nearby earlier this year, and discovered the contamination had worsened considerably since the mine shut down. The mine is still releasing about 30 litres of drainage a second, Wright said, the equivalent of about an Olympic swimming pool a day. He said the discharge, given the current dry spell, was accounting for 20% to 25% of the river’s flow. Wright’s report, handed to NSW authorities and the company in August, found zinc was being discharged, on average, at 27 times above the safe level. “That’s the highest I’ve ever recorded coming out of a mine, and I’m studying eight of them at the moment. So I know the topic fairly well,” Wright said. “I’ve had to go to international literature to find something like this.” Manganese was “off the chart” and higher than anything Wright had seen in Australia or abroad. Nickel concentrations in the river had doubled since the mine’s closure, and were well above safe levels. After receiving Wright’s report, the EPA varied the mine’s licence in late September to force Boral to provide a written action plan for addressing the contamination by 13 October. “There has been a degradation in water quality discharging from the Berrima mine since mid-2016 after old mine workings were flooded,” an EPA spokeswoman said. “This degradation is due to naturally occurring minerals found in the geology of the area, including zinc, nickel, manganese and salt, rather than from active coalmining. “The EPA is committed to determining the best course of action to address this mine discharge.” Wright commended the EPA’s decision to intervene, saying it ought to be congratulated for taking action on a non-operational mine site. He also praised Boral, who he said had provided him with data to help compose his report, and appeared intent on dealing with the pollution, unlike many other companies. But he said it should not have been discovered by a researcher like himself: “I’d rather not do this, I think it should be done independently by an independent body. “I think it’s appropriate to have completely independent assessments, completely independent of government, like an Icac for pollution. “I’m open in criticising the EPA because they have no limits on the most hazardous elements from this mine. Nothing.” In a statement, Boral said it would work closely with the EPA and the state authorities on the closure. “The mine, which had been operating for more than 50 years before Boral acquired it, ceased all mining operations in 2013,” the company said. “Since then, it has been on care and maintenance, while we work with state authorities – including the EPA – on developing a mine closure plan.” Boral said it would keep the local community informed about the site, including on water quality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-politicians-citizenship-crisis-a-brief-history","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T22:31:10Z","webTitle":"Australian politicians' citizenship crisis – a brief history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-politicians-citizenship-crisis-a-brief-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-politicians-citizenship-crisis-a-brief-history","fields":{"headline":"Australian politicians' citizenship crisis – a brief history","bodyText":"14 July: Scott Ludlam, a Western Australian Greens senator, resigns from parliament after an investigation by a Perth barrister reveals Ludlam is still a citizen of New Zealand. Ludlam says he believed that citizenship had been revoked when he became an Australian citizen as a teenager but has since been proven wrong. 18 July: After Ludlam’s case, the Queensland Greens senator, Larissa Waters, looks into her own background, having been born in Canada to Australian parents. It is revealed that a law change just days after her birth granted her Canadian citizenship, which, not knowing about it, she had never renounced. Waters resigns, sparking political attacks from the government over the Greens candidate vetting processes, which the prime minister says shows “incredible sloppiness”. 21 July: The One Nation Queensland senator Malcolm Roberts signs and publicises a statutory declaration after questions over his citizenship. “I can confirm I am not a citizen of the United Kingdom, nor am I a citizen of India. I am a citizen of Australia only.” 25 July: Matt Canavan, the Nationals senator from Queensland and resources minister, announces his mother applied for Italian citizenship on his behalf, without his knowledge, when he was 25. He resigns from the cabinet but not the Senate. Barnaby Joyce absorbs his ministries. 26 July: A spokesman for Roberts says “any renunciation” occurred on 6 June 2016 but his office continues to refuse to release the paperwork its says proves it. Pauline Hanson announces she has seen the documents and declares “hand on heart” Roberts renounced his UK citizenship before he nominated for Pparliament. The following day, a spokesman for Roberts tells Fairfax Media the senator was “choosing to believe he was never British”. 27 July: Roberts appears on Sky News with Paul Murray to prove his renunciation documents are in order. Murray says he has seen and read the documents “that are a million per cent correct”. The documents are not shown on screen. 9 August: Roberts’s case is referred to the high court. 14 August: Barnaby Joyce becomes the first lower house MP to become embroiled in the section 44 crisis when he confirms he is a citizen of descent of New Zealand through his father. He refers himself to the high court but remains in cabinet. 15 August: A diplomatic brawl is sparked over claims from the Turnbull government that Australian Labor conspired with New Zealand Labour to bring Joyce’s dual citizenship to light. 17 August: The deputy leader of the National party, Fiona Nash, announces she has investigated her citizenship status after Joyce’s case and has discovered she holds UK citizenship by descent through her Scottish-born father. She refers herself to the high court but does not step down from her ministries. 18 August: The Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon said he will refer himself to the high court after discovering he is a British overseas citizen. He says he renounced any citizenship of Greece or Cyprus but did not know he could also hold British citizenship. 21 September: Roberts is cross examined by the high court. It is revealed he sent emails enquiring into his UK citizenship status in the days before his nomination to defunct email addresses but had not filled out the official forms or paid a fee. Roberts maintains he believes he was never British and cites his Welsh-born father as never having “ribbed” him about being so as part of his proof. 22 September: The high court finds Roberts was a dual citizen when he nominated for parliament. 26 September: In submissions to the high court, the attorney general, George Brandis, says senators Waters, Nash, Canavan and Xenophon, and the lower house MP Joyce, have similar cases as none knew of their citizenship by descent and therefore could not renounce it. Brandis argues they should be found not to have breached section 44 because of that ignorance. He says the cases of Ludlam and Roberts are separate and should not be included in that defence. 28 September: In a joint submission to the high court, Waters and Ludlam argue ignorance of dual citizenship should not be considered an excuse, in stark contrast to the attorney general’s submission. Government MPs also put forward submissions where they argue citizenship by descent (which Canavan says he received when he was two years old, making his mother’s actions irrelevant) which is not known should not be considered a breach of the constitution. 29 September: Roberts submits to the high court that he believes he did everything he could to renounce any claims to British citizenship, despite not believing he held it. 3 October: Joyce’s political rival for the seat of New England, Tony Windsor, submits to the high court Joyce was ineligible for election and a byelection should be held. 6 October: Xenophon announces he will resign from the Senate no matter what the outcome of his section 44 case is to run for the South Australian parliament. The cases will be heard on 10, 11 and 12 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/09/will-our-nobel-peace-prize-convince-australia-to-give-up-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T00:01:01Z","webTitle":"Will our Nobel peace prize convince Australia to give up nuclear weapons? | Tim Wright","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/09/will-our-nobel-peace-prize-convince-australia-to-give-up-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/09/will-our-nobel-peace-prize-convince-australia-to-give-up-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Will our Nobel peace prize convince Australia to give up nuclear weapons?","bodyText":"America’s vast nuclear arsenal has for decades protected Australia against attack and guaranteed our prosperity. This dangerous, misguided belief forms the basis of Australian government policy on nuclear weaponry. It incites proliferation and undermines disarmament. And it denies us any credibility or moral authority in demanding that North Korea abandons its nuclear ambitions. If a nation as geographically secure as our own requires nuclear protection, why not one in a much more volatile part of the world? To promote disarmament effectively, Australia must first reject any role for the ultimate weapons of mass destruction in its own defence arrangements, just as it has done for chemical and biological weapons, anti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs. Proclaiming the virtues of nuclear weapons while voicing support for their total elimination does not make sound and convincing foreign policy. With Kim Jong-un advancing his nation’s nuclear program apace and Donald Trump threatening to unleash “fire and fury” the likes of which the world has never seen before, a new, more enlightened Australian policy to avert nuclear war is urgently needed. But wise leadership has thus far been elusive. Last month, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, skipped one of the main events at the annual opening of the UN general assembly in New York: a high-level signing ceremony for the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. This historic accord, adopted in July with the support of 122 states, categorically outlaws nuclear weapons and establishes a legal framework for their verified dismantlement. It is a first step towards a saner, safer world – a response to the ever-deepening concern of the international community at the grave threat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity. Atomic bombs do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. They incinerate and irradiate human beings indiscriminately and on a massive scale. And now, like other inherently indiscriminate, inhumane weapons of war, they have at last been deemed illegal. Our Melbourne-born campaign, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, was awarded this year’s Nobel peace prize in recognition of our role in achieving the treaty and efforts to draw attention to the “catastrophic humanitarian consequences” of nuclear weapons. The Australian government, at the behest of the United States, boycotted the UN-mandated negotiations that led to the treaty’s adoption. Never before had we failed to join a multilateral disarmament process. The present security environment is not conducive to progress in disarmament, the foreign ministry said. But if ever there were a moment for nations to declare their unequivocal opposition to nuclear weapons, surely that moment is now? Rather than siding with the nuclear powers as they hold the world to ransom, Australia should stand with the great majority of nations in insisting that there are no right hands for wrong weapons. It should help establish a powerful global norm against the bomb. The new treaty sets the same standard for all. It recognises that, if we are to succeed in curbing the spread of nuclear weapons to countries like North Korea, we must also do something to address the 15,000 warheads that already exist across the globe. Among the first signatories to the treaty are several of our nearest neighbours in Asia and the Pacific, including three US allies: New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand. Like Australia, they were under pressure not to join. But, unlike Australia, they determined that advancing disarmament was more important than avoiding US scorn. By opposing the most promising UN disarmament initiative in decades, and by promoting nuclear weapons as legitimate and essential instruments for defence, the Australian government is recklessly undermining our collective security. We look to our leaders to reduce risks and defuse tensions. Yet, as the world spirals towards unspeakable horror, cold warriors in our parliament and at the ministries of foreign affairs and defence maintain that “deterrence” will forever keep us safe. They irresponsibly dismiss meaningful disarmament steps for the sake of preserving the precarious status quo. But our luck, sooner or later, will certainly run out. Disarmament is not a pipe dream; it is an urgent humanitarian necessity. It would be fanciful to believe that we can retain nuclear weapons in perpetuity without their ever being used again. We hope that our Nobel peace prize will help compel the Australian government to rethink its stance and join the great majority of nations in rejecting these weapons.

A trade organisation representing 170,000 businesses has advised its members to continue taking the coins, because the changeover period with the new coins has been so short. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses , said companies had embraced the new £1 as an invaluable way to reduce counterfeiting. Many had modified coin-operated equipment, while others separated out millions of old coins to be melted down. “But the changeover period has been fairly short,” he said. “While no business is obliged to accept the old coins beyond the deadline, it would help if small firms knew they were allowed a short transition period to collect the old coins if they wish to, and are willing to bank them, but not give out to customers. “This would provide a useful community service, allowing customers a few weeks to get rid of the final few pound coins in circulation.” From midnight on Sunday 15 October, the coins will lose their legal tender status. After this date, shops and restaurants should no longer accept them. With a week to go, about 500m are still in circulation. Poundland said more than 850 of its UK stores would continue accepting the coins until 31 October. Barry Williams, the discount store chain’s trading director, told the Telegraph it was a “no brainer” to continue to accept the old coins. “Providing an extra convenience for shoppers to lighten their pockets while doing the weekly shop, rather than making a separate trip to the bank or post office, will come as good news,” he said. Advice for retailers on the Royal Mint website says: “You are under no obligation to accept the round £1 coin from your customers and you should not distribute the round £1 coin. Please update your staff on what they need to do.” A Treasury spokesman said: “We will have received more than 1.2bn round pound coins by the time they cease being legal tender. We have worked with industry for over three years to ensure a smooth transition to the new more secure £1 coin.” While major banks are encouraging customers to allow enough time to hand in their old coins, they have said they will continue to accept deposits of round £1 coins after 15 October. The new coin, which resembles the old threepenny bit, entered circulation in March and has security features to thwart criminals. The production of the new coins followed concern about round pounds being vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters. About one in every 30 £1 coins in recent years has been fake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/09/gst-distribution-wa-could-gain-billions-in-revenue-at-expense-of-eastern-states","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T04:49:20Z","webTitle":"GST distribution: WA could gain billions in revenue at expense of eastern states","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/09/gst-distribution-wa-could-gain-billions-in-revenue-at-expense-of-eastern-states","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/09/gst-distribution-wa-could-gain-billions-in-revenue-at-expense-of-eastern-states","fields":{"headline":"GST distribution: WA could gain billions in revenue at expense of eastern states","bodyText":"Australia’s eastern states would lose billions of dollars in GST revenue and Western Australia would receive a multibillion-dollar windfall if a radical overhaul of the GST distribution was adopted by the Turnbull government. In a landmark review of the GST, released on Monday, the Productivity Commission dropped the policy equivalent of a bomb, suggesting the government could improve Western Australia’s share of the GST by adopting methods of distribution that see its GST take rise by either $3.2bn or $3.6bn, at the expense of every other state and territory. The treasurer Scott Morrison, who initiated the review in April this year following repeated complaints from WA’s government that the system was treating the state unfairly, has welcomed the report and suggested the government is prepared to ditch its policy of a GST floor when the final report is released. Under the proposed overhaul, New South Wales would lose either $1.2bn or $110m in GST this year, depending on the method, and Queensland would lose $729m or $1.6bn. Victoria would lose $920m or $972m, followed by South Australia (-$256m or -$557m), Tasmania (-$77m or -$168m), the ACT (-$60m or -$130m) and the Northern Territory (-$36m or -$79m). Western Australia would be the only state to gain GST payments. It would see the state receive more than $1,200 per person. Morrison said the Turnbull government still supported the principle that GST revenue ought to be redistributed to the states that need it, but the report had identified “significant weaknesses” in the system. “It’s in the national interest to fix the way that the GST has been shared between the states and territories,” Morrison said. “It’s holding our national economy back. That should be of concern to all Australians, not just those in Western Australia who have been most adversely impacted by the way this has played out.” In August last year, Malcolm Turnbull committed the commonwealth to introducing a floor in the GST distribution to prevent WA’s GST revenue falling too low in the future. But the report rejects calls for a minimum per capita share of the GST, warning that relativity floors do not resolve underlying deficiencies in distribution and would “prove arbitrary, and likely to have unintended consequences”. In a later interview on Sky News, the treasurer said the government’s policy of a floor under states’ GST share was “subject to what the Productivity Commission may recommend”. Morrison said the government would wait for the final report and announce a “total response” but it was “correct” to say the government had dropped the idea of a floor and “fair” to say its policy was in transition. The Commonwealth Grants Commission is the institution responsible for redistributing the GST among Australia’s states and territories. It tries to redistribute the GST to ensure “horizontal fiscal equalisation” (HFE) so each state ends up with a comparable level of government services. Horizontal fiscal equalisation is designed to redress the fact that some states – currently NSW, Victoria and WA – would be able to provide better services than other states purely because of their economic advantages, stemming from population size, geography, demographic makeup and other economic factors. The Productivity Commission said the Commonwealth Grants Commission was doing a good job but its methods were “beyond comprehension by the public, and poorly understood by most within government”. It said the Commonwealth Grants Commission should adopt a prominent public role and start informing Australians about its processes so there’s less confusion. It conceded the system has been placed under serious political strain by the recent experience of Western Australia, where the mining boom has generated billions of dollars in extra revenue for the WA government while simultaneously reducing the state’s GST share dramatically. WA’s GST share fell sharply to an unusually low 30-odd cents back for every dollar it generates in recent years because of lags in the complicated formula based on how well it was doing during the mining boom. The former Liberal government in Western Australia campaigned heavily about the fall in its GST share. It blamed the poor state of its budget on the “unfair” federal GST carve-up in the lead-up to this year’s WA election (which it lost). For a period before the mid 2000s, WA was receiving more than $1 for every dollar it generated. The Productivity Commission has criticised the former WA government for contributing to the state’s deteriorated fiscal position. It says the state had projected a fall in its GST relativity from 0.72 to 0.33 by 2014-15 but the government based its spending decisions on the assumption that a 0.75 GST relativity floor would be introduced. The Productivity Commission recommended overhauling the objective of horizontal fiscal equalisation, saying the attempt to raise every state and territory up to the fiscal capacity of the fiscally strongest state has become an “undeliverable ideal”. “While equity should remain at the heart of HFE, it should aim to provide states with the fiscal capacity to provide a reasonable level of services,” the report said. “Equalisation should no longer be to the highest state, but instead the average or the second highest state – still providing states a high level of fiscal capacity, but not distorted by the extreme swings of one state.” Its favoured alternative methods of redistribution would reduce GST payments to every state and territory but Western Australia this year. The results may differ in subsequent years depending on economic events. In February, Turnbull said any changes to the GST distribution would be “a few years away”. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, told a Perth radio station earlier this year that she would be willing to see Queensland’s GST share reduced so WA could get more, but when her comments received national attention she backtracked. Submissions to the GST report will be accepted up until 10 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/09/nsw-to-approve-coalmine-blocked-by-courts-for-polluting-sydneys-drinking-water","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T23:33:22Z","webTitle":"NSW to approve coalmine blocked by courts for polluting Sydney's drinking water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/09/nsw-to-approve-coalmine-blocked-by-courts-for-polluting-sydneys-drinking-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/09/nsw-to-approve-coalmine-blocked-by-courts-for-polluting-sydneys-drinking-water","fields":{"headline":"NSW to approve coalmine blocked by courts for polluting Sydney's drinking water","bodyText":"The New South Wales government will introduce legislation to approve an underground coalmine that was blocked by the courts because it was polluting Sydney’s drinking water. On Monday the state’s energy minister, Don Harwin, announced the government would overturn a decision by the NSW court of appeal to block the extension of the Springvale colliery. The mine, owned by Centennial Coal, is the sole supplier to Lithgow’s Mount Piper power station, which provides about 10% of NSW’s electricity. On Monday Harwin said the mine was “vital for energy security and affordability”. “My top priority as energy minister is to ensure NSW households and business have an affordable, secure and reliable energy supply – this decision supports that,” he said. The legislation, which is expected to be introduced to the parliament this week, will change the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act to “clarify” that “projects in the Sydney water catchment seeking to expand must maintain or improve water quality compared to their existing consent”. It will also specifically validate the Springvale mine’s state significant development consent. The government’s planning minister, Anthony Roberts, said the legislation would “support the construction of a water treatment plant” which he said would eliminate saline discharges. “This new treatment plant will see zero mine water discharge into the Coxs river, is supported by the EPA and WaterNSW and has separately been approved by the independent Planning Assessment Commission,” he said. In August the court of appeal determined that the mine was polluting Sydney’s drinking water and therefore operating on an invalid licence. After a challenge by environment group 4nature, the court found the commission had erred in approving the licence because it involved discharging polluted water into Sydney’s drinking catchment. The approval involved saline mine water being discharged into the Coxs river, which flows into Lake Burragorang, Sydney’s major drinking-water reservoir. The NSW Greens energy spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, criticised the decision, calling it a “shonky way to govern”. “The proposed changes to the act means that an existing mine can be extended or modified just as long as it pollutes the water catchment just a little less that it currently does,” he said. “This is a significant weakening of protections for our drinking water quality and has significant implications for other areas, such as mining under the Illawarra escarpment.” Georgina Woods from Lock the Gate said introducing new legisalation to overturn the decsion was “reckless and unnecessary”. “There’s plenty of coal being mined in this state; we’re mining more coal than ever before,” she said. “The idea that a power station cannot secure alternative supplies if a polluting coalmine must be closed to protect the water that supplies Sydney is absurd.” Centennial Coal has previously denied claims of water contamination and said it faced a “rigorous” and “exhaustive” assessment process that lasted five years. State planning law requires that developments in the catchment must have a “neutral or beneficial” effect on water quality but the court found the mine’s discharge was having a negative effect. Energy Australia has argued that the Springvale mine is the only source of coal Mount Piper can use, and without it the power station will not be able to run to the end of its 50-year life in 2042.

The Scots, needing victory to secure a play-off spot, led 1-0 at half-time before conceding two goals to Slovenia with Robert Snodgrass’s late equaliser ultimately immaterial. Strachan’s contract with the Scottish FA expires at the conclusion of the qualifying campaign, leading to the widespread assumption that the 60-year-old would leave his position as international manager of his own volition. That sense has been clouded somewhat by Scotland forcing themselves into play-off contention after a dismal start in Group F, with some members of Strachan’s squad stating publicly they want him to stay. “You have to ask that question but you know fine well that I’m going to say I’m the last person I’m thinking about now,” said Strachan. “Players, staff and family – I want to make sure they’re all right. The players’ families have backed them up and everything else. So we are looking after them at the moment. Me? It’s not a problem. I am proud, really proud, to be their manager. “I’ve been fortunate to have been successful in my own career and get to places. But with all due respect to the lads I played with – some who are my mates now – this group are as good as anything I’ve worked with. “This group do it for nothing. They do it for their country, their families and the fans. So it’s an honour to work with them and they’re hurting badly. When I look back I think, ‘You have given it a right good shot,’ and they left nothing in the dressing room. Over the last two games especially they gave it everything they had.” Strachan pointed to the lack of height in the Scottish population as a problem, a matter which will raise eyebrows given the basic level of goals conceded to Slovenia. Organisation, rather than physicality, appeared the key issue. “Technically we’re fine,” Strachan added. “But our guys have to work harder to get on the ball than bigger lads at six foot three. “What I do know is that genetically we are behind. In the last campaign we were the second smallest squad behind Spain. That means that I had to pick a team tonight to try and combat their height and strength. Even at that we couldn’t combat their height and strength at set plays. Genetically we have to work at things. It is a problem for us. “We have to fight harder for every ball and jump higher because it is easier for these type of guys. Physically we have a problem against the teams we have faced in the last couple of years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/08/slovenia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T18:13:20Z","webTitle":"Scotland’s World Cup hopes shattered with battling draw in Slovenia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/08/slovenia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/08/slovenia-scotland-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Scotland’s World Cup hopes shattered with battling draw in Slovenia","bodyText":"There was nothing glorious about this latest Scottish failure and, though everyone should be spared the tired cliches and sob stories after the sharing of four goals to close another fruitless campaign, they will keep on coming, of course. Scotland’s progression to the point where a World Cup play-off berth would have been secured with victory in Slovenia was admirable. Nonetheless the key failings that led to such a stirring recovery being necessary were glossed over. There can be no sugar‑coating a second-half horror show in Ljubljana which means Scottish absence from major tournaments stretches to 22 years. Even worse for Gordon Strachan and those who inevitably will attempt to justify a new contract for the Scotland manager over the coming days is that capitulation arrived from the point where his team were ahead. Slovenia were beaten to a play-off spot by Slovakia by the time the dust settled on a keenly contested Group F but still had the nous to pick off Strachan’s men with relative ease. The blunt reply to any suggestion of Scottish progress lies in the final group standings. Typically this game closed with a Scottish bombardment of the opposition goal. Typically the final whistle arrived before Scotland players applauded what remains an outstanding support. But the outcome, the net result, was one that few can legitimately argue was not deserved. Perhaps acceptance of that failure for too long has been part of the problem. The long-shot nature of Slovenia’s play‑off hopes was demonstrated by a sparse home crowd on the outskirts of Ljubljana. The home side nonetheless enjoyed the better of the opening 45 minutes despite being a goal behind at the interval. With Josip Ilicic at the heart of their attacking promptings, Slovenia placed considerable pressure on what remains a makeshift Scotland defence. What the hosts lacked was a player with the recurring potency of Leigh Griffiths. The sum of Slovenia’s first-half pressure was a tame Tim Matavz shot, easily held by Craig Gordon, and an Ilicic effort into the side netting after Griffiths had opened the scoring. That goal owed much to generous defending but Griffiths still supplied the kind of composed finish which should set him apart as one of the most gifted Scottish strikers in history. That is no exaggeration, even if recent competition is not exactly ferocious. The Celtic player strode on to a James McArthur header after Slovenia only partly cleared a Darren Fletcher cross, Griffiths angling the ball home from what was hardly a straightforward angle. Curtailing of Griffiths’s celebrations was visible in front of the travelling support; a yellow card would have ruled him out of any play-off. If the assumption from that 32nd-minute juncture was that Slovenia would lack the heart to claw their way back, how wrong that sense was to prove. The half-time withdrawal of Aljaz Struna, who was clearly culpable in allowing Griffiths scoring space, was the first indicator of this. More damaging for the Scots was Slovenia’s fresh sense of purpose. This endeavour was quickly rewarded. Debate will rage as to whether Gordon should have collected an Ilicic free-kick, looped deep to his back post, or one of the Scottish defenders should have hammered the ball clear. What transpired would be castigated at amateur league level. The substitute Roman Bezjak was not hanging around for any inquest; he supplied a downward – and free – header which dribbled into the Scottish net with such slow motion that it surely intensified Strachan’s pain. Things could have been worse for the 60-year-old within three minutes, Gordon instead producing a spectacular and one-handed save from a deflected Bezjak shot. Before the match Strachan had stressed the difficulties attached to altering tactical systems for the second game of a double header. He then did precisely that, deploying Chris Martin alongside Griffiths at the head of a 4-4-2 set-up. The policy was abandoned straight after Slovenia’s equaliser. There was to be no Scottish renaissance. In what yet another defensive comedy show, an Ilicic corner was laid back to the path of the advancing Bezjak. For the second time in 20 minutes the 28-year-old could probably not believe his luck. This time he passed the ball beyond the stranded Gordon from 12 yards. Owing to Slovakia’s anticipated canter at home to Malta, Scotland now required two goals against a team who had not conceded any here in this qualifying campaign before Griffiths’ in the first half. Fletcher should have supplied one, the Stoke City midfielder instead scooping over the crossbar after Matt Phillips created the chance. Robert Snodgrass, on for McArthur, provided hope when flicking over the advancing Jan Oblak. The most wounding Scottish moment came as Slovenia’s goalkeeper somehow clawed away a deflected Phillips cross. Amid a frantic closing stretch Slovenia’s captain, Bostjan Cesar, was sent off after a clash with Christophe Berra in midfield. The defender’s anger was misplaced. It is the Scots who were entitled to that emotion – again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/kim-yo-jong-sister-brains-behind-kim-jong-uns-image","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T06:04:08Z","webTitle":"Meet Kim Yo-jong, the sister who is the brains behind Kim Jong-un's image","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/kim-yo-jong-sister-brains-behind-kim-jong-uns-image","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/kim-yo-jong-sister-brains-behind-kim-jong-uns-image","fields":{"headline":"Meet Kim Yo-jong, the sister who is the brains behind Kim Jong-un's image","bodyText":"Kim Yo-jong’s promotion to the politburo of North Korea’s workers’ party is a sign that Kim Jong-un has absolute trust in his younger sister – rumoured to be the brains behind his carefully constructed public image – as he seeks to tighten his grip on power. Yo-jong, who is four years younger than her brother, was rarely seen in public until 2010, when she was photographed attending a Korean Workers’ party conference. By the following year, she was a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il’s entourage, and was seen mourning alongside her brother after their father’s death in December 2011. She did not receive an official mention in North Korean state media until March 2014, when she accompanied Kim Jong-un during elections for the supreme people’s assembly. There were even rumours that she was briefly responsible for state affairs during Kim’s prolonged absence from public life – attributed to an undisclosed health problem – in the autumn of that year. Since Kim Jong-un’s anointment as the third leader of the Kim dynasty, his sister has frequently been seen accompanying him during “field guidance trips” and at other public events. Her promotion on Saturday means that she enjoys her brother’s absolute trust, and cements her position as one of the two most visible women in North Korean public life, alongside the leader’s wife, Ri Sol-ju. Kim Yo-jong was appointed vice-director of the party’s propaganda and agitation department in late 2014, and used the role to create a cult of personality around her brother that included presenting him as a benevolent, accessible leader modelled on his grandfather, and North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung. She, not Kim, is said to be the inspiration behind his visits to theme parks, schools and the homes of ordinary people, and his unlikely friendship with the former NBA star Dennis Rodman. Family ties to Kim Jong-un are no guarantee of favourable treatment, or even of survival, as the young leader seeks to consolidate power through a series of purges estimated to have affected 140 senior military and government officials. He ordered the execution of his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013, and is suspected of involvement in the assassination of his half brother, Kim Jong-nam, at Kuala Lumpur airport in February. Kim and Yo-jong, however, have the same mother: Ko Yong-hui, a Japanese-born former dancer who is thought to have been Kim Jong-il’s third partner. Experts say Yo-jong’s ascension to alternate member of the politburo – the country’s top decision-making body – indicates she is Kim Jong-un’s replacement for his aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, a member of his father’s inner circle who does not have an active role in the new regime. Her promotion points towards a generational shift, as Kim seeks to make a clean break with the personnel who surrounded his father, according to some experts. “Through the personnel reshuffle, the Kim Jong-un regime has ended its co-existence with the remnants of the previous Kim Jong-il regime by carrying out a generational replacement in the party’s key elite posts,” Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, told Yonhap news agency. Like other members of the regime, verifiable information about Kim Yo-jong’s life is hard to come by. She is believed to be in her late 20s, although some reports put her age at 30. Several accounts say she attended primary school in Berne, Switzerland, in the late 1990s – the same time as Kim Jong-un – before studying computer science at the prestigious Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang. An employee at the boarding school has said that the siblings lived in a private residence, surrounded by staff and bodyguards, according to the North Korea Leadership Watch website. Her father attempted to ease her isolation by sending North Korean musicians to Switzerland to keep her company, the site says. Nothing is known about Kim Yo-jong’s life during the years following her university education and 2007, when she began to play a junior role in the ruling party. In the late 2000s she was involved in arranging her brother’s succession to supreme leader – a more pressing issue after their father suffered two strokes in 2008. She reportedly married Choe Song, the son of the Workers’ party vice chairman Choe Ryong-hae, in early 2015, and had a child in May that year. Significantly, the senior Choe was promoted to the party’s powerful military commission last weekend, according to the official KCNA news agency. Yo-jong has not escaped the attention of US officials, who in January placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for “severe human rights abuses”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/10/usa-trinidad-and-tobago-world-cup-2018-qualifier-soccer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T02:13:07Z","webTitle":"Woeful USA fail to make 2018 World Cup after loss to Trinidad & Tobago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/usa-trinidad-and-tobago-world-cup-2018-qualifier-soccer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/10/usa-trinidad-and-tobago-world-cup-2018-qualifier-soccer","fields":{"headline":"Woeful USA fail to make 2018 World Cup after loss to Trinidad & Tobago","bodyText":"After one of the most devastating nights in the history of American soccer, the US will not be going to Russia next summer after a shock 2-1 defeat to lowly Trinidad &amp; Tobago saw them finish fifth in Concacaf World Cup qualifying. It was going to take an unlikely combination of results for the US to miss out on the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986, and that is exactly what happened, though the Americans only have themselves to blame for squandering a strong position with this catastrophic performance. “We didn’t qualify for the World Cup,” coach Bruce Arena said after the game. “That was my job. To get the team qualified for the World Cup. This game in my view was perfectly positioned for the US team and we failed on the day. We have no excuses. We failed today. We should have walked off this field with at least a point.” When the Americans went behind to the Hexagonal group’s bottom team and were unable to find an equaliser, they needed help from others. That made for a bitter twist: where four years ago Mexico were grateful to their arch-rivals for a result that saved them from disaster, here the US were hoping for a favour from Mexico. They did not get it, as Mexico lost 3-2 to Honduras, while a late goal from Panama to beat Costa Rica 2-1 pushed the US out of fourth place, which would have sent them into a two-legged playoff with Australia next month (replays later showed that Panama’s first goal didn’t appear to cross the line). So, for the want of an equaliser against T&amp;T, there will be no eighth successive World Cup finals appearance for the US, dealing a significant setback to the sport’s progress in the country. The failure is surely the end for Arena and some of the senior players. This was a dismal end to an uneven qualifying campaign that began last November with defeats by Mexico and Costa Rica which prompted the termination of Jurgen Klinsmann’s five-year tenure as head coach and the appointment of Arena. If that decision seemed understandable and logical at the time, it is now certain to be second-guessed. The future of Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, must also be in serious doubt. Had the US reached Russia by finishing third in a six-team group with only three wins and 12 points from 10 games it would have been an indication of how forgiving the qualifying format is rather than indicating anything positive about a team that was, in truth, largely being kept in contention by the brilliance of the attacking tyro, Christian Pulisic. What a shame that he will be absent next summer. Mexico and Costa Rica had already qualified – Mexico as group winners – while Panama take the third automatic spot courtesy of their 87th-minute winner. In the playoff for the right to join them in Russia, Honduras will face Australia, whose coach, Ange Postecoglou, will reportedly step down after the playoff games. Arena will surely depart, too, given this sorrowful outcome to his second spell in charge. He picked the same XI that beat Panama 4-0 last Friday, dispelling speculation that he would omit Pulisic, who has graduated during this campaign from promising to indispensable but came off in Orlando with a calf injury. Opting not to refresh the line-up proved a misjudgment. Prior to Tuesday, T&amp;T had scored only five times in their previous nine Hex fixtures. But they were 2-0 up before the break as the US started like a team who believed the job was done last Friday, when the win over Panama seemingly relaxed Arena’s men into a state of stupefaction in Trinidad. Sluggish and subdued, the conventional wisdom that playing for a draw is dangerous was born out by the US’s dismal first-half performance. The match was held at Ato Boldon Stadium in the small town of Couva, where the running track ringing the field was so inundated with water on Monday that had the heavy rain continued it might have been necessary to issue the substitutes with snorkels. But the lake had cleared by kick off, and any moat analogies were best resisted, despite the final score: here was no fortress but a largely quiet and empty 10,000-capacity arena, with the hosts picking an inexperienced line-up. And this a nation that before Tuesday had delivered one win and eight losses in the Hexagonal qualifying round, good for last place. That said, T&amp;T briefly led Mexico, on the road on 6 October before succumbing, 3-1. And back in June it was goalless between the US and Dennis Lawrence’s surprisingly spirited and organised side at half-time in Colorado before Pulisic scored twice to claim the points. The biggest problem with the pitch was not the sodden grass but the fecklessness of the men in white shirts jogging, and occasionally running, on it. The US went behind thanks to two memorable goals – albeit only one was intentional. After 17 minutes an Alvin Jones cross from the right prompted a sensational finish from Omar Gonzalez into his own net, as the US defender stuck out a shin and looped the ball over goalkeeper Tim Howard. Jones needed no help from the visitors 20 minutes later, the 23-year-old defender lashing a wonderful swerving strike beyond Howard from outside the area. Time to start anxiously tracking events elsewhere, which initially were encouraging for the Americans, as for a while both Mexico and Costa Rica held leads. Two minutes before the break, Jones was inspired to try again from a preposterous distance. It summed up the American display that the bouncing ball almost embarrassed Howard, who misjudged and fumbled it, ultimately conceding a corner. Arena brought on Clint Dempsey for Paul Arriola at half time. With less than 90 seconds gone in the second half, Pulisic scored from the edge of the area with a deflected shot. Who else but the 19-year-old? No, seriously, who else? It was his fifth goal of the phase, and he also contributed four assists. Then Honduras took the lead over Mexico, pushing the US down into fourth, and meaning that unless the US scored again, one Panama goal spelt doom. Finally, the US found some urgency and constant threat, and scoring so early in the second period it seemed like they had plenty of time to find the all-important second goal. But with 68 minutes gone, T&amp;T goalkeeper Adrian Foncette saved from Dempsey. Eight minutes later he denied the forward again, tipping a shot on to the post. With three minutes left, he made a fine stop from a Bobby Wood header. There were chances, sure, but no onslaught. No desperate assault on T&amp;T’s goal, no overwhelming pressure, no saving moment of individual genius. Still, the US were about to reach the play-off, even with a defeat. There was still hope. Then came the news from Panama City."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/09/harvey-weinstein-sacked-in-wake-of-sexual-harassment-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T01:01:08Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein sacked in wake of sexual harassment scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/harvey-weinstein-sacked-in-wake-of-sexual-harassment-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/09/harvey-weinstein-sacked-in-wake-of-sexual-harassment-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein sacked in wake of sexual harassment scandal","bodyText":"Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the Weinstein Company after new information emerged regarding his conduct, the company’s board of directors has said. Weinstein – the Hollywood mogul who produced films including Pulp Fiction and Gangs of New York – was on a voluntarily leave of absence after a slew of sexual harassment allegations emerged last week in a New York Times exposé. The board on Friday endorsed that decision at the time but went further on Sunday, removing Weinstein from the company he co-founded. The board’s statement read in full: “In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of the Weinstein Company – Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar – have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with the Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately,” An attorney for Weinstein didn’t immediately comment. Last week, it was alleged that Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women he had sexually harassed, and that he would invite women to his hotel room under the guise of work and then greet them naked or ask them to massage him or watch him shower. Among Weinstein’s accusers are the actors Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, with the latter allegedly reaching a $100,000 settlement over an incident of misconduct that happened when she was starring in Scream. Weinstein’s allegedly inappropriate behaviour towards women he worked with and those who starred in his films has been referred to as an open secret in Hollywood. President Donald Trump, whose presidential campaign was rocked a year ago by the release of a recording in which he boasted about groping women, has said he was not surprised by sexual harassment allegations against the media mogul. “I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time. I’m not at all surprised to see it,” Trump told White House reporters on Saturday. Dozens of Democrats have since moved quickly to sever ties with Weinstein, with many donating his past campaign contributions to women’s charities. Weinstein has given more than $1.4m in political contributions since 1992, virtually all to Democrats. Weinstein has expressed regret for his inappropriate behaviour towards women stretching back decades, saying “I own my mistakes”, but his lawyers say he also denies many of the allegations made against him. In a recent interview with Page Six, Weinstein said, “I am going to fix myself, I am going to fix how I deal with women and how I deal with my temper and power … I came of age in the 60s and 70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.” Attorney Lisa Bloom, who had been advising Weinstein, announced on Saturday she was resigning and did not comment further. The high-profile women’s rights attorney faced significant backlash for her decision to represent the movie producer. She had initially called him an “old dinosaur learning new ways”, adding, “I have been blunt with Harvey and he has listened to me.” Charles Harder, another attorney representing Weinstein, released a statement after the Times investigation was published saying he planned to file suit against the paper, alleging that the story was “saturated with false and defamatory statements” and relied “on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report”. The Times has stood by its reporting. In recent days, new allegations have emerged and a growing number of celebrities have spoken out in support of Weinstein’s accusers. New claims have come from a US television journalist, a British artist and writer and a woman who had worked at a restaurant at the company’s office. The board’s statement on Sunday did not elaborate on the “new information about misconduct” that prompted the termination. Entertainment journalists have also spoken about the ways in which the media might have enabled him over the years, declining to publish stories about the allegations due to Weinstein’s immense power. A number of actors immediately expressed support for the alleged victims speaking up, including Patricia Arquette, Amber Tamblyn, Olivia Munn and Lena Dunham. Pressure has since mounted on the board to take action. MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski tweeted that she would pull out of her three-book deal with Weinstein’s publishing company unless he resigned, adding, “Authors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.” Actors Mark Ruffalo and Seth Rogen also released statements over the weekend criticizing Weinstein and supporting his alleged victims. Many other prominent industry figures, however, have not spoken up about the Weinstein story, and McGowan tweeted on Friday, “Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/monday-briefing-hammond-gets-the-p45-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T05:30:18Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Hammond gets the P45 treatment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/monday-briefing-hammond-gets-the-p45-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/monday-briefing-hammond-gets-the-p45-treatment","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Hammond gets the P45 treatment","bodyText":"Top story: May seeks to shift focus to Brexit Good Monday morning to you, Graham Russell here with the latest news. The chancellor has become the latest target of Tory infighting, facing calls for his head over his handling of Brexit, and accusations his department is helping the EU scupper any deal. Philip Hammond’s Treasury “seems blind to the facts, preoccupied with preserving ‘access’ to the EU market seemingly at any cost”, MP Bernard Jenkins, who was director of the Vote Leave campaign, writes in the Guardian. The fresh proxy war broke out as those on the right of the party flexed their muscles following days of criticism of Boris Johnson and suggestions May might demote him. Despite the squabbling behind her, Theresa May will attempt to get on the front foot in parliament today by warning that Britain has made sufficient Brexit concessions to the EU. “The ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response,” she will tell MPs. * * * Harvey Weinstein sacked – The Hollywood mogul’s tenure at the company he co-founded has ended after its board of directors decided to act on “new information”. He had been on voluntary leave after a slew of sexual harassment allegations emerged last week. Weinstein has expressed regret for his inappropriate behaviour towards women stretching back decades, saying “I own my mistakes”. * * * Tender feelings ignored – Thousands of small businesses look set to ignore the Royal Mint’s deadline to stop accepting the old, round pound coins. The Federation of Small Businesses said the changeover period had been “fairly short” and that shops would provide a “useful community service” in giving customers an extra few weeks. The Treasury said it had been working with the industry for three years on the project. The coins will lose their legal tender status this Sunday, making way for the 12-sided version. * * * Bob Corker – Donald Trump’s approach to foreign diplomacy risks putting the nation “on the path to world war three”, a senior Republican who heads the Senate foreign relations committee has said. Bob Corker said Trump acts “like he’s doing The Apprentice or something” and criticised his provocative tweets issued during sensitive talks on North Korea. The US president earlier blamed his former political ally for the Iran nuclear deal, leading Corker to tweet back: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” * * * ‘Silent too long’ – The Catalan government’s push for independence has roused the voice of a so-called silent majority who want to remain part of Spain. Anywhere between 350,000 and a million people (depending on who you believe) turned out in Barcelona to call for unity. Demonstrator Alejandro Marcos said: “It seems that the one who yells the most wins the argument. So we have to raise our voices and say loud and clear that we do not want independence.” * * * Dove, do better – The skincare brand has been forced to apologise (again) for an ad that featured a black woman turning into a white woman after applying body lotion. It pulled the ad which it said had “missed the mark”, a response that did little to assuage anger that manifested in thousands of comments below its apology tweet. Ava DuVernay, director of the film Selma, said: “You can do better than ‘missed the mark’. Flip + diminishing. Deepens your offence. You do good work. Have been for years. Do better here.” * * * Lunchtime read: Inside the CIA’s black site The torture of detainees at a CIA “black site” in Afghanistan is revealed in astonishing detail, with 274 declassified documents revealing the regime designed by contract psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen. Prisoner Gul Rahman, naked from the waist down and shackled to a cold concrete floor, was subjected to sleep, food and water deprivation and interrogated for 18 hours a day. “The atmosphere was very good,” Jessen told an investigator. “Nasty, but safe.” Five days after Jessen had interrogated him, Rahman was dead.

Gordon Strachan has refused to discuss his future and offered effusive praise of his players after Scotland’s World Cup hopes were dashed by their failure to beat Slovenia in Ljubljana. Meanwhile, England manager Gareth Southgate expressed delight at the way Harry Kane captained the side in the final two World Cup qualifying wins, against Slovenia and Lithuania, but admitted he is yet to decide who will be the permanent leader. Business Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the housing market is so dysfunctional that the only thing standing between Britain and a housing crash is the Bank of England’s willingness to spare borrowers a rise in interest rates. He suggests five steps to prevent a crisis, including increasing supply and reform of the tax system. On the markets, Chinese stocks reached a 21-month high before next week’s Communist party congress in Beijing, while the pound was up slightly at $1.31 and €1.116. The FTSE100 is expected to open flat. The papers After days of political tennis twixt the May and Johnson camps, the PM has delivered a deft slice to try to divert the ball into the, er, EU’s court (this tortured metaphor works fine – Ed). The Times and Express went for it, focusing on Theresa May’s assertion that Britain had made enough Brexit concessions (Times: The ball’s in your court, May tells EU leaders”). The Telegraph volleys back (too much?) with the front page line that Johnson would resist any attempts to demote him and that the chancellor should go instead for being “miserable”. It gives more room to the story of shops refusing to adhere to the deadline to phase out the old pound coin. The i goes somewhere in the middle, with May fighting to gain control of the party as well as Europe, while the Sun has a non-committal postage stamp mentioning May has been told to sack either Johnson or Hammond. The Guardian leads with Brexit Tories taking aim at the Treasury, accusing it of seeking to scupper Brexit, with side stories on Catalonia’s pro-unity marches and GPs worrying that overwork is putting their patients at risk. The Mail gets its teeth into the concept of the gender question in the next census being optional, saying there are fears civil servants might not know how many men and women there are in the country. The Mirror reports on most households losing the “basic right” of weekly rubbish collections and having to pay for private contractors, while the Sun focused on what Louise Redknapp looks like and – under the headline “Ryanscare” – fears for the airline’s safety after images emerged of maintenance staff apparently playing pranks. The FT makes us all feel suitably juvenile in our worldviews by giving its front page over to Germany’s outgoing finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, who has warned spiralling levels of debt and liquidity pose a threat to the global economy.

In comments to an energy summit on Monday, Frydenberg pointed to the falling costs of renewable energy as one of the calculations in the government’s consideration of the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. Asking whether the falling costs of renewables meant Australia no longer need a clean energy target, which subsidises renewables, Frydenberg said: “Industry is looking for stability, they’re not necessarily looking for a handout. “What they’re looking for is a settled bipartisan investment climate whether there are subsidies or not.” The Turnbull government is finalising its new investment framework for energy policy, which it wants to settle during the remaining parliamentary sitting weeks before the summer recess. Given it faces considerable internal opposition, it has been clear for some time the government would not adopt the clean energy target modelled in the Finkel review, and would look to rule changes in the national electricity market as one of the foundations of the overhaul. Frydenberg’s comments to the Australian Financial Review summit on Monday suggest the government is not convinced renewable energy requires ongoing subsidies once the current renewable energy target winds down after 2020. But asked by reporters in Sydney whether the government had abandoned the Finkel recommendation, Malcolm Turnbull hedged. “What we are determined to do is to ensure that energy is reliable, affordable and that we meet our emissions reduction commitments that we have made through the Paris agreement,” the prime minister said. Speaking to the AFR summit, the chief scientist dismissed the point that the falling cost for renewables meant a clean energy target was no longer required. Finkel told the gathering a clean energy target was a framework allowing an orderly transition away from carbon-intensive power sources to low-emissions power sources. “It remains a useful tool even if there is an extreme rate of reduction in the price of the new technologies,” Finkel said. “You need a managed transition.” Speaking immediately after Finkel, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, called for a truce in the decade-long climate wars, and urged Turnbull to hold the line. Shorten said it was “troubling” to see signals from the government that they intended to dump the clean energy target. The Labor leader said Turnbull had previously argued the Finkel recommendation had a lot of merit. “Walking away is the worst possible option. It would leave investors in the lurch, sentence business to more uncertainty, more chopping and changing,” Shorten told the summit. “It would make Australia’s job harder to reduce emissions. “If Turnbull caves in to Tony Abbott and a ... rump of conservative backbenchers and walks away from a clean energy target, it will mean continued higher prices for Australian families and Australian industry. “It is a simple choice that Mr Turnbull faces – work with Labor to deliver a clean energy target that is meaningful, or lock in higher power bills for businesses and families.” The South Australian Labor premier, Jay Weatherill, said Frydenberg’s comments showed there was “no political will” to fix the energy market from Canberra, and said the states should bypass the commonwealth to correct the “paralysis” in federal politics. He said the federal government should “simply get out of the way”, and called for the states to work together to negotiate their own national market with one independent oversight body which he said could operate at arm’s-length from government. “There is no barrier to the states simply taking the Finkel recommendations and implementing them themselves,” Weatherill told the AFR summit. “Obviously after today we now know that there is no political will to pursue that and we all know why that is; there’s a civil war going on inside the Coalition. Weatherill said he’d spoken to each other state premier and territory chief minister and said they were “supportive or open” to the states taking the lead on introducing some kind of energy target. “I think with the new information we got this morning we should take further steps in that direction,” he said. “First we need to see if it is indeed the end of the clean energy target and if indeed it is, we should just get cracking.” Speaking after Weatherill the New South Wales energy minister, Don Harwin, called Weatherill’s solution “very much a second-best option”. He said the NSW government had deliberately “not boxed the commonwealth in”. “NSW has consistently stated that all options should be on the table and we shouldn’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” he said. “We’ve deliberately not boxed in the federal government and will consider whatever they come back to us with. He said renewable energy didn’t need subsidies, but did need “certainty”, arguing for the removal of “sporadic and haphazard government intervention” which “does nothing to boost confidence and does everything to increase doubt”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/08/test-for-breast-cancer-risk-could-reduce-pre-emptive-mastectomies","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T22:29:17Z","webTitle":"Test for breast cancer risk could reduce pre-emptive mastectomies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/08/test-for-breast-cancer-risk-could-reduce-pre-emptive-mastectomies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/08/test-for-breast-cancer-risk-could-reduce-pre-emptive-mastectomies","fields":{"headline":"Test for breast cancer risk could reduce pre-emptive mastectomies","bodyText":"A genetic test that accurately predicts the risk of developing breast cancer could soon be used on high-risk groups. Researchers behind the test say it could reduce the number of women choosing pre-emptive mastectomy surgery as they will be able to make more informed decisions about their care. The blood test looks at 18 genetic variations, or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), known to affect the chances of getting breast cancer. It will initially only be available at St Mary’s hospital and Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester to women having tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. A study carried out by researchers at the hospitals and the University of Manchester analysed the DNA of 451 women with a family history of breast cancer who had developed the disease, using the information alongside other factors to predict an overall risk estimate. Many of the women who were originally in the high-risk category were reclassified to a lower risk category, where risk-reducing breast removal surgery is not recommended. The study suggested the number of women with BRCA1 and 2 mutations who choose to have a mastectomy could be reduced from 50% to about 36%. Becky Measures, who had a mastectomy at Wythenshawe hospital 11 years ago after learning she carried the BRCA1 gene mutation, said: “When they find that they have the BRCA1/2 gene, many women fear that they have to take action immediately. The new test will give women more options and help them to make a more informed decision.” Probably the most famous person to have undergone the surgery is actor Angelina Jolie, who made the decision after learning she had an up to 87% chance of developing breast cancer. Following the revelation, referrals for the gene mutation tests more than doubled in the UK, which doctors described as the “Angelina effect”. While all women with a BRCA gene mutation are given this same risk figure of 87%, it is actually much more complex and different for every person. A breast cancer charity described the more tailored approach as an exciting development. Lester Barr, the chairman of Prevent Breast Cancer, which partly funded the research, said: “With more accurate genetic testing, we can better predict a woman’s risk of developing the disease and therefore offer the appropriate advice and support, rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach. “It’s so exciting to see this additional test go into clinical practice, as it’s this more tailored method that will help us on our mission to protect future generations from breast cancer.” The research was led by Prof Gareth Evans, a medical genetics expert at the University of Manchester and Saint Mary’s hospital. “This new test will help women at risk of familial breast cancer to make more informed decisions about their care,” Evans said. “BRCA1 and BRCA2 are just part of what we should be looking for when assessing risk and in Manchester we plan to incorporate screening for these new genetic markers in clinical practice within the next six months.” This article was amended on 14 October 2017. The original incorrectly stated that Angelina Jolie’s mother died of breast cancer. She actually died of ovarian cancer. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/09/harry-maguire-harry-winks-england-hopefuls-world-cup-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T09:00:15Z","webTitle":"Maguire to Winks: which England hopefuls might make the plane to Russia? | Jamie Jackson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/09/harry-maguire-harry-winks-england-hopefuls-world-cup-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/09/harry-maguire-harry-winks-england-hopefuls-world-cup-russia","fields":{"headline":"From Maguire to Winks: which England hopefuls might make the plane to Russia?","bodyText":"1) Butland hardly tested but should stay second choice Despite having made his England debut in August 2012, Jack Butland had to wait three years for his competitive bow and another two to double the tally when lining up here. England qualified for Russia 2018 on Thursday so here was invaluable game-time for the 24-year-old Stoke City goalkeeper. Yet the contest gave Butland scant chance to show he can be relied upon. The man most likely to dislodge Joe Hart watched an early Fiodor Cernych shot carefully, then gathered a later one with ease. This was all that was required until just after the half-hour. Then, he dealt with a Kieran Trippier backpass by booting it towards halfway. On 54 minutes Butland did make a crucial save, though, by stopping Michael Keane scoring an own goal. Butland is next in line after Hart, ahead of Fraser Forster, Jordan Pickford and the injured Tom Heaton, and competitive action will have done his confidence no harm. Make the plane? Yes 2) West Ham’s Cresswell can deliver a set piece Inside five minutes Aaron Cresswell made an impact by hitting a cross in from the left that landed plum on Harry Maguire’s head and which should have led to the opener. A later free-kick from the right again showcased Cresswell’s ability to strike a ball as the defender spun in a cross that posed the Lithuania defence a question. The West Ham United defender had been handed a third cap and chance to further his claim for a World Cup berth in a defence that featured three centre-backs. In this the 27-year-old operated at left wing-back, a demand familiar to him as his club manager, Slaven Bilic, uses the system. Cresswell was near faultless and when pushing ahead suggested he can be a factor: a second-half header forced Ernestas Setkus into a sharp save. Ryan Bertrand and Danny Rose – who is injured – are ahead of him, while Luke Shaw and Ashley Young may also change Gareth Southgate’s mind. Make the plane? Outside chance 3) Winks tidy but may be too late to join the party Harry Winks could be proud of a first taste of senior international football as the 21-year-old offered a tidy all‑round midfield display. The Tottenham man often roved forward to link though on occasion his control let him down. Winks’s first contribution in an England shirt was to beat Vykintas Slivka with some slick footwork. Later he combined with Marcus Rashford but the latter ball watched. Next came an illustration of Winks’s energy as he raced back to break up a Lithuania attack. While he came close to a first England goal early in the second half, the challenge he faces comes from those players ahead of him in Gareth Southgate’s thinking. Winks was only drafted into the squad after Fabian Delph dropped out. The Manchester City midfielder, Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier, Adam Lallana, Jake Livermore, and even a consistently fit Jack Wilshere are those whose claim is stronger. Make the plane? No 4) Maguire’s dream could take him all way to Russia Harry Maguire’s debut came close to a dream start five minutes in as the central defender lurked near Setkus’s goal. Yet when Cresswell delivered the ball where the Leicester City man – an ever-present this season – wanted it, Maguire spurned the header. But accomplished defending is his prime concern, and at this the 24-year-old was largely reliable on the left of Southgate’s trio of centre-halves. Yet it was his error that allowed Lithuania to turn defence into attack and which led to Keane nearly scoring an own goal after the interval. Earlier he made amends for the missed header by initiating the attack from which Harry Kane opened the scoring. It was Maguire’s clever dinked ball to Henderson from which Dele Alli won the penalty, converted by Kane. Again, though, competition is fierce. Gary Cahill, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, John Stones, and Keane are those who are ahead in the reckoning. Make the plane? Outside chance 5) Trippier gives it his all in quest to be on the plane One of four Tottenham players in the XI, Kieran Trippier made an uneven start but he improved as the contest developed. After winning their first corner the 27-year-old allowed Vytautas Andriuskevicius to find a cross from which Darvydas Sernas flashed wide of Butland. This was followed with a diagonal ball that was intercepted and he later failed to get close enough to Sernas. From here, though, Trippier began hustling better and was a constant outlet along the right, though he was not always noticed by team-mates. When he was – by Kane, just after the latter’s penalty – Trippier used the ball aptly by moving it inside quickly to Winks. This second England appearance ended as a note to Southgate that he is worth consideration. With Kyle Walker first choice, Trippier’s competition appears to be only Nathaniel Clyne, who is injured, and perhaps a left-field option, like Manchester United’s Ashley Young. Make the plane?

They are legitimising EU threats of economic disruption. We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time. A clean break in 2019 would be preferable to the mess they want to draw us into. To be prepared for no trade deal with the EU, Whitehall must focus on planning and readiness without further prevarication. The Florence speech sets out a credible and conciliatory framework for the negotiations, but more concessions would be damaging, expensive and unnecessary, and would prolong economic uncertainty, damage confidence and enrage leave voters, threatening the stability of the government. Many hardcore leave voters, some 30% of electors, were drawn back to the mainstream parties at the last election, because both parties were clear the UK is leaving the EU. Those voters would feel betrayed, and the broad majority of Conservative MPs would feel that the establishment had imposed its will on the government, despite what the prime minister really wants. No government could sustain a policy of Brexit in name only, which is what some seem determined to pursue, flying in the face of the clear referendum result. An interim period would allow time for processes and institutions to be adapted or established so that by the end of two years or so, a comprehensive trade agreement can be implemented. As the prime minister has made clear, it must be clear what is being implemented. The EU should stop obstructing these discussions about an agreement, which should be relatively easy to agree in principle, since the UK and the EU will have identical regulatory systems on the day of Brexit, so both sides can aim at maximum mutual recognition of different sectors. A soft customs frontier should be established from the day the UK leaves the EU. There is no need for zealous enforcement by the UK or by the EU of the “rules of origin” that govern the international trade in goods. There is no need for tariffs if the EU and the UK have jointly notified the World Trade Organisation of our intention to implement a zero-tariff comprehensive trade deal, and of our special customs agreement for the interim. If everyone was intent on being reasonable, the practical or legal problems would be surmountable. However, the EU is determined to be anything but. It refused to enter any discussions at all until the UK had invoked article 50. We did so, and still the EU refused to discuss the future trade relationship, insisting first on “sufficient progress” on citizenship, money and the Northern Ireland border. Following the Florence speech, where the prime minister conceded, among other things, that money would be on the table for the interim period, the EU is still blocking trade talks. Treasury officials are briefing that we must stay in the customs union for the interim period. They insist we must continue to pay billions of pounds to subsidise other EU states, while we must accept “full regulatory and judicial oversight”, which means we would have to submit to any new European court rulings and new directives and regulations without any say over those new laws. Worst of all, matters are already being decided between the UK and the EU, such as on the dividing of tariff-rate quotas for imports from non-EU countries (for instance, on New Zealand lamb) the joint presentation of which could hobble the UK’s ability to make meaningful trade deals with non-EU countries into the future. That is why the US and other nations have challenged the UK and the EU on this, saying they “cannot accept” this unilateral splitting of tariff-rate quotas without the EU and the UK negotiating separately with all the countries concerned. The Treasury seems unable to hear any voices except those that reinforce their preconceptions. It seems blind to the facts, preoccupied with preserving “access” to the EU market seemingly at any cost. People such as James Dyson or Anthony Bamford of JCB are ignored. Only a fraction of the UK economy is dependent on membership of the EU. The majority of the economy is either domestic or non-EU export. It will be a benefit to the public finances and to our trade balance when the exchequer is relieved of contributing to the EU budget (a net £10bn a year and growing, and a total of £390bn since we joined, at current prices). A small fraction of the billions demanded by the EU would be far better spent on being ready to leave without a trade deal if no sensible agreement can be reached. • Bernard Jenkin MP is chair of the steering committee of the European Research Group of MPs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/08/syd-hoare-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T17:10:44Z","webTitle":"Syd Hoare obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/syd-hoare-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/08/syd-hoare-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Syd Hoare obituary","bodyText":"My father, Syd Hoare, who has died aged 78, was an Olympic judo competitor, author and commentator. The son of Alfred Hoare, an executive officer at the Ministry of Defence, and Petrone (nee Gerveliute), a waitress, Syd enjoyed a wild childhood in postwar London: scrumping, climbing trees, jumping out of bombed-out houses on to piles of sand and being chased by park keepers. At 14, while a pupil at Alperton secondary modern school, Wembley, he wandered into WH Smith and found a book on jujitsu, which led to judo lessons at the Budokwai club in Kensington and sparked a lifelong passion for the sport. Syd quickly became obsessed with judo and underwent intense training, often running the seven miles back to his home in Wembley to lift weights after a two-hour session at the Budokwai. In 1955, at 16 he was the youngest Briton to obtain a black belt and two years later won a place in the British judo team. He respected not only judo’s physical and mental aspects but its link to eastern philosophy. After a frustrating stint doing national service in the army, he lived for four years in Japan, training at the Kodokan dojo in Tokyo and immersing himself in the country’s culture. He became fluent in Japanese and later gained an honours degree in Japanese language, literature and history at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Syd was a member of the first British judo team to compete in the Olympics in 1964 and was a silver medallist in the European Championships in 1965. On retiring from competition he was appointed chief instructor at the Budokwai and later became national coach and chairman of the British Judo Association. He was awarded 8th dan in judo and 5th dan in sumo. Raising awareness of the sport of sumo in the UK, he founded the British Sumo Association and created the first British sumo team, who competed in the World Championships in 1992. This led to appearances on TV shows including the Jonathan Ross Show and Matthew Kelly’s You Bet, usually tying a mawashi – sumo belt – on to the presenter. Trading on his “tough guy” looks, he played small film roles in films including Guy Ritchie’s comedy crime caper Snatch, the sumo wrestling movie Secret Society (both 2000) and Kenneth Branagh’s As You Like It (2006). Syd wrote many articles and books on judo, other martial arts and keep fit, including the bestselling A-Z of Judo (1993). He self-published A History of Judo (2009) and A Slow Boat to Yokohama: A Judo Odyssey (2010), about this judo career. He also commentated on judo, sumo, Taekwondo and wrestling, for Eurosport. A judo traditionalist who cared deeply about the roots of the sport and how it was maintained and developed, Syd was brusque and unconventional but patient and fair with a mischievous sense of humour. He is survived by his wife Oksana Khoutornaja, whom he married in 2002, and their children, Viviana and Rafferty, and by Jocelyn, Zoe, Max and me, the children of his marriage in 1973 to Sophy Fox, which ended in divorce."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/jones-act-puerto-rico-expired","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T20:40:46Z","webTitle":"Waiver encouraging foreign supply ships to reach Puerto Rico has expired","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/jones-act-puerto-rico-expired","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/jones-act-puerto-rico-expired","fields":{"headline":"Waiver encouraging foreign supply ships to reach Puerto Rico has expired","bodyText":"A waiver enabling foreign ships to deliver supplies to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico has expired and will not be renewed, it was confirmed on Monday, dealing a fresh blow to the US territory as it struggles to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. In the wake of the hurricane, millions of Americans have been without access to clean water, electricity, fuel and medicines. Donald Trump, who initially came under fire for being slow in his response to the crisis in Puerto Rico, temporarily waived the Jones Act – a 1920 law stating that all goods sent between US ports be carried on ships built, owned and operated by the US – on 28 September. But the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the waiver expired on Sunday and would not be extended “at this time”, meaning Puerto Rico will once more be subject to restrictions under the act. Experts have said the Jones Act has resulted in high tariffs on foreign ships delivering goods to Puerto Rico, doubling the price of consumer goods when compared with neighboring islands that are not subject to the law. Trump’s decision to temporarily waive the law, which came amid mounting pressure from local officials in Puerto Rico and the Arizona senator John McCain, had eased the way for foreign ships to deliver crucial supplies, such as food and gasoline, more expeditiously and at a lower cost. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment when asked about the waiver’s expiration. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, said on Monday that much of the island remained without basic utilities. Water supplies have been restored to just 60% of Puerto Rico’s residents, while only 15% of people on the island had electricity, three weeks after the hurricane hit. The storm’s death toll rose in recent days to 36, with officials cautioning that dozens of bodies had yet to be included in the government’s count. In a letter to congressional leaders on Monday, Rosselló requested US lawmakers approve roughly $1.4bn in funding to aid recovery efforts. The governor also ordered an investigation into the mishandling of food and water delivery to municipalities amid complaints from some areas that supplies were not being received. Trump paid a visit to Puerto Rico last week, where he was criticized for throwing paper towels to survivors and claiming the island should be “proud” of having far fewer deaths than Hurricane Katrina. The president defended his tone in an interview with Trinity Broadcasting Network on Saturday, telling the host and former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee: “I was having fun, they were having fun, they said: ‘Throw them to me, throw them to me, Mr President.’ “So the next day they said, ‘Oh, it was so disrespectful to the people.’ It was just a made-up thing and also … when I walked in the cheering was incredible.” Last week, the Trump administration sought a $29bn funding package from Congress that would be allocated toward areas affected by recent hurricanes, including Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The money would also go toward fighting devastation caused by wildfires tearing through California. The House is poised to vote on legislation this week that would meet the request. Some lawmakers, including McCain, have also called on Congress to permanently retire Jones Act restrictions on Puerto Rico. McCain, who has co-sponsored a bill to do so, said Monday the expiration of the waiver made his bill all the more urgent. “Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,” McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. “Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/10/invincible-nicola-sturgeon-brexit-snp","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Invincible no more, Nicola Sturgeon will have to go back to basics | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/invincible-nicola-sturgeon-brexit-snp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/invincible-nicola-sturgeon-brexit-snp","fields":{"headline":"Invincible no more, Nicola Sturgeon will have to go back to basics","bodyText":"Just two years ago Nicola Sturgeon seemed invincible. As she took over from Alex Salmond as leader of the SNP following the 2014 independence referendum, thousands of new recruits flocked to the Scottish nationalist cause, turning defeat into victory. In November 2014 she sold out the 12,000-seat Glasgow SSE Hydro, a week after Lady Gaga had done the same. The Sturgeon tsunami kept on rolling through 2015. In that year’s general election, she was the face of the SNP landslide that captured 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, all but obliterating Labour as well as the Tories and Liberal Democrats north of the border. “If only we could vote for her too,” was a common refrain in radical parts of England. But what goes up can also come down, and political popularity is a volatile business. Today, as Sturgeon prepares to address the SNP conference in the Clydeside conference centre across the road from the Hydro, some of the shine has come off. At the weekend a hostile commentator even wrote that Sturgeon might face a prankster thrusting a P45 into her hand, as happened to Theresa May last week. That comparison is absurd. May’s reputation has gone head over heels downwards. Sturgeon’s, by contrast, has suffered nothing worse than an embarrassing slide. Her job approval ratings in Scotland, once so high, are now exactly even: 46% think she is doing a good job, 46% disagree. But the slide is significant all the same. It leaves Sturgeon’s ratings well adrift of this year’s cult politicians, Jeremy Corbyn on the left and Ruth Davidson on the right. So Sturgeon has much hard work to do, starting today, if her eventual political fate is not to be as the manager of another chapter in the SNP’s gradual decline from the heady heights of 2011-15. This week’s conference has seemed to understand that. Though SNP gatherings are never less than enthusiastic, the rhetoric in Glasgow has been the most markedly toned down for several years. Last year, Sturgeon spoke from a rostrum whose slogan – in place throughout her speech – was a chest-thumping “Stronger for Scotland”. This year, the slogan consists of a single word: “Progress”. That’s a spectacular shift in nationalist tone. “Progress” is the sort of claim centrist reformist parties make, but most SNP members would as readily support England in a football match as agree to call themselves middle of the road. The language is part of a deliberate attempt by the SNP hierarchy around Sturgeon to focus this year on the realities of governing, not on the buzz of insurgency. The conference agenda lists dozens of policy achievements – some of them spurious, others no more than aspirations – on its cover in a manner that would have made New Labour blush. It’s almost as if the SNP has decided to perform against type and have a go at being boring. If that’s so, there are probably three reasons why. The first is that Sturgeon and her party hopelessly overplayed the campaign for a second independence vote. Sturgeon misread the Scottish mood by assuming that Scotland’s 2:1 remain vote in the EU poll could be leveraged into a demand for a second referendum on breaking with the UK. June’s general election, when the SNP lost a quarter of its votes and 21 of its 56 seats, put an end to that. Scottish opinion is currently 58% to 42% against a second referendum at any time in the next five years (that is, well past the 2021 Holyrood election) and 56% to 44% against independence. So the SNP is sensibly heeding Davidson’s call to get back to the day job of governing. The second is that Sturgeon has also mishandled the Brexit process. Under pressure from Salmond and those who prioritise a second independence vote, Sturgeon constantly upped her demands on Brexit, demanding a seat at the negotiating table, pitching for differential deals for Scotland, claiming a right to veto the final Brexit deal. The result has been a succession of failures, as May has dug in against SNP demands. Now Sturgeon and her party are switching to the more old-fashioned approach of trying to do deals with the Scottish Tories in the hope of brokering some changes to the EU withdrawal bill. On the conference fringe, the talk at Brexit discussions has been about making alliances with other parties at Holyrood and Westminster. But the biggest reason for Sturgeon’s change of tone this week is that she has domestic policy headaches to solve. The SNP has made promises that it is struggling or has simply failed to keep. Education is at the heart of this, and Sturgeon is expected to confirm another promise today, doubling the amount of free early education and childcare. Yet she also has a huge spending issue to deal with, not least as a result of her wish to lift the public sector pay cap in Scotland. A report last month by Strathclyde university’s Fraser of Allander Institute estimated that spending on non-health programmes is already being squeezed by up to 20%. That’s why – depending in part on Philip Hammond’s budget next month – the SNP may take the long-promised step of raising income tax to pay for public services such as schools, early years provision and the NHS. Don’t write the SNP or Sturgeon off. It is still the main political party in Scotland. She is still her country’s dominant political figure. Today’s speech will be full of the customary fire. But Sturgeon is the chastened leader of a party with a problem, and the wheel of Scottish politics is turning in new ways. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/colombia-suspends-four-police-officers-deaths-coca-farmers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T18:49:25Z","webTitle":"Colombia suspends police officers who fired into crowd, leaving six dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/colombia-suspends-four-police-officers-deaths-coca-farmers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/colombia-suspends-four-police-officers-deaths-coca-farmers","fields":{"headline":"Colombia suspends police officers who fired into crowd, leaving six dead","bodyText":"Colombia’s police force has suspended four officers who fired into a crowd of protesters in a confused incident that left at least six farmers dead and 20 others wounded in the south-western region of Tumaco. The move comes a day after police in the area fired into the air and launched stun grenades against a humanitarian commission made up of human rights activists and local journalists as they attempted to reach the remote site of the killings. President Juan Manuel Santos on Monday called the episode “regrettable” and promised a thorough investigation of both incidents, which have highlighted the continued threat of violence in the country even after a peace deal with Farc rebels. The six farmers were killed on 5 October during a protest by growers of coca leaf, used in making cocaine, against forced eradication efforts. Security forces first blamed a dissident faction of the Farc for the deaths but local activists said the police had opened fire on the protesters. Preliminary forensic testing showed the six farmers were killed by high-velocity long-range bullets. By Monday the government acknowledged that witnesses overwhelmingly blame police. “The immense majority of the testimony signals the police as responsible,” said Vice-President Óscar Naranjo, a former chief of national police who traveled to Tumaco after Thursday’s killings. Although government officials have promise a full investigation, Naranjo did not rule out the possibility that the scene of the killings might have been tampered with. “It was unprotected for 12 hours,” he said. “We have to be realistic.” Speaking to RCN Radio, Naranjo repeated the claim that the protesters had been ordered by the dissident guerrillas to confront security forces escorting a group of civilians carrying out coca eradication efforts. Tumaco, a sprawling municipality on Colombia’s Pacific coast, has the highest concentration of coca crops in the country, highly productive drug labs and well-traveled routes to export cocaine, attracting organized crime groups and dissident rebels from the former Daniel Aldana front of the Farc. The Farc, which signed a peace deal last year to end its more than 50-year war against the state, long promoted the growing of coca in the region and used the drug trade as a means to finance its fight. In Tumaco the group attracted farmers from other parts of the country to occupy land held communally by Afro-Colombian communities. The presence of the “colonists” sparked bitter feuds between the local and migrant communities. Speaking by telephone from Tumaco, a member of the Afro-Colombian Community Council of Alto Mira and Frontera – who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons – said council leaders were under “death threat from drug traffickers for participating in crop substitution” and for resisting pressure to participate in the anti-eradication protests. But even those who have signed up to voluntarily substitute coca for legal crops, as part of the peace deal with the Farc, complain that they have seen their coca fields destroyed without any accompanying government compensation or support. “They don’t have the money to support us and the pressure to continue is fierce,” the community leader said. Colombia is producing more cocaine than ever before, according to United Nations data. A government program to manually eradicate the 188,000 hectares of coca crops calls for voluntary eradication through pacts with communities and, where that fails, forcibly pulling up the plants. Anti-narcotics police were preparing to forcibly eradicate crops in Tumaco when the clashes began. The UN mission in Colombia, which is overseeing the implementation of the peace deal with the Farc, said the incident underscored the need for swift action. “The events reinforce our conviction at the United Nations of the necessity of giving coca farmers in affected regions all the means to escape the terrible choice between extreme poverty and illegality,” Jean Arnault, the UN mission chief, said. Amnesty International said the events in Tumaco show the need for full implementation of the peace accord with the Farc. “Nothing will change in Colombia until everyone in the country can protest peacefully without fearing for their lives,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty’s director for the Americas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/10/race-inequality-disparity-audit-bme-women-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T11:45:00Z","webTitle":"Race inequality is out in the open: time to stop talking and act | Kimberly McIntosh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/race-inequality-disparity-audit-bme-women-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/race-inequality-disparity-audit-bme-women-britain","fields":{"headline":"Race inequality is out in the open: time to stop talking and act","bodyText":"When my gran moved to Reading in 1960, finding a room to rent wasn’t easy. The worst quality rooms at sky-high prices were available for black people then; the signs in the windows infamously scrawled “No blacks, no Irish, no dogs”. This was a common experience of the Windrush generation. Fast-forward 15 years to a classroom in west Reading and the teacher has made a black student dance like a monkey on the table – as entertainment. My mother – looking on – is not laughing. It isn’t funny when you’re the butt of the joke. The same schoolyard crime would have very different consequences for the minority-ethnic kids than it did for the white ones. My mum left school at 16 and went to work. Most of the ethnic minority children got out as soon as they could to escape the mockery and unfair racist treatment from the teachers who were meant to fill them with the confidence to reach their full potential. These overt and extreme experiences of racism are consigned to the past, but their impact lives on. They have everything to do with the socioeconomic position I was born into. Disadvantage, when not tackled, is inherited generation to generation. Today more subtle and hidden forms of racism and discrimination continue to blight our society. And this leaves black and minority-ethnic people – women in particular – on an unequal playing field before they even get going. Today the Race Disparity Audit publishes its Ethnicity Facts and Figures website, which shines a light on stark injustices suffered by BME people across the country. While two in three white British households own their home, the audit found only two in five households from any other ethnic group own their house. If your grandparents couldn’t even rent a room, you’re less likely to inherit a deposit one or two generations down the line. But what if the government’s current policies were making things worse for BME women – even inadvertently? A report published today by the Runnymede Trust and the Women’s Budget Group shows that BME women – already worse off in the job market and housing – are hardest hit by austerity policies. Single mothers across all income levels, and working families with children have lost out the most, as rents and living costs rise, children’s centres close and public services are cut – but working-age benefits such as tax credits and housing benefit stay frozen. The poorest black and Asian families will suffer a massive 20% drop in living standards by 2020. Single parents, of whom 92% are women, will experience an average drop in living standards of 18% until 2020. Women are losing more than men, and BME households are losing more than white households. The intersection of poverty, race and gender means that these cuts are leading to a dramatic fall in the standard of living of many BME women. This is not the equal opportunity meritocracy we were promised. This is why assessing and publishing how policies affect women and ethnic minorities differently is so important. When all policies are being formed, debated and considered, vulnerable groups must be taken into account. Throughout sixth form I received education maintenance allowance. And when I went to university in 2010, being from a single-parent family was considered as part of my student loan application. I was given a maintenance grant and a generous scholarship for high achievement on a low income. I studied abroad and interned every summer. Now students face fees three times higher than mine – averaging £9,000 a year – and maintenance grants have been replaced with more loans. Reclaim, a charity working with working class young people, spoke to black and minority-ethnic women in Manchester about how their lived experience has changed since 2010. They heard stories of people struggling to make ends meet: young women working multiple jobs to get through college and university as fees were increased and grants scrapped, unable to do essential internships or concentrate on their studies. One woman had four jobs while in college “just so [she] could pay for things”. Cuts to education have far-reaching effects, making it more difficult to get top grades and work experience, which can lead to employment. With the Race Disparity Audit bringing injustice and inequality out of obscurity and into the mainstream – raw and exposed – it’s time to act. We must make sure government policies aren’t making life harder for BME women. We are calling for urgent action – a review of universal credit, an end to the benefit freeze, and a full reinstatement of maintenance grants. Only then will BME women get the fair deal we deserve. • Kimberly McIntosh is policy officer at the Runnymede Trust"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-next-census-counting-what-counts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T18:12:56Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the UK’s next census: counting what counts | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-next-census-counting-what-counts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-next-census-counting-what-counts","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the UK’s next census: counting what counts","bodyText":"Britons have been describing themselves more or less honestly to government at 10-year intervals since 1801, producing each decade a mirror that reflects back the changing world: more populous, healthier, more diverse and (nowadays) getting older. Each time, a few people declare themselves conscientious objectors, and some describe their religion as Jedi; but generally the result is a heartening demonstration that trust still exists between people and state – trust that rests on a general confidence that census data is collected by serious-minded people who want to gather facts expressly in order to use them to develop policy and improve administrative efficiency. Yet what the state wants to know about its citizens, and how it asks the questions to elicit their information, is rightly a matter for jealous scrutiny and complex calculation. Anyone who doubts the importance in this process of trust need only look at the experience in authoritarian or despotic countries. Numbers are about power. There has been no universal census in Germany since the Nazis used population records to identify Jews. China uses its census to identify characteristics and behaviours that in a democracy would be regarded as strictly private. Stalin shot the census officials whose findings revealed a population that terror and famine had shrunk by 10 million. And what gets counted counts. Numbers are about shaping policies, and they are about spending. They are the basis for the allocation of ever scarcer resources. That makes the accuracy of the census a matter of more than academic concern. And it is not just the headline numbers, but the needs – revealed by age, ethnicity and, yes, gender orientation – that shape policy and spending. The Office for National Statistics, which is responsible for the census, finds itself in trouble in predictable quarters over whether and how it asks about sex and gender (though for veterans of earlier battles over the interpretation of ethnic identity, it is so far only a skirmish). Work is coming to an end on the design of the 2021 census and, having ducked the issue in 2011, serious thought is being given to trying to write a question or a series of questions that would reveal how many Britons identify their gender as trans – defined as a gender different to that assigned at birth. But careful qualitative analysis has failed to come up with a question or questions that ask clearly for particular information, produce useful and reliable data, and don’t leave the respondent feeling either perplexed or excluded. This is the stuff of all serious research, it is hard to do and it is quite easy to poke fun at. But it matters, both because of the trust on which the census relies, and because finding a way to measure an identity that has a long history of being denied, ridiculed and abused is unavoidably tricky. No decisions have been taken yet, except that they are still to come up with the right questions. There is no clear line from campaigners like Stonewall, although in general terms they approve of data collection about sexual orientation. Ethical and legislative issues pit the path to a decision. The census itself may soon be replaced by more frequent, smaller-scale social surveys that are better than the decennial household census at producing a detailed picture of the way we live now. But the ONS has got the big thing right: sexual orientation counts, and a way must be found to count it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/morning-mail-tony-abbott-suggests-climate-change-doing-good","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T20:11:41Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Abbott says climate change action is like 'killing goats'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/morning-mail-tony-abbott-suggests-climate-change-doing-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/morning-mail-tony-abbott-suggests-climate-change-doing-good","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Abbott says climate change action is like 'killing goats'","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 10 October. Top stories Former prime minister Tony Abbott has suggested climate change is “probably doing good” in a speech in London in which he likened policies to combat it to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. Abbott delivered the annual lecture to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate-sceptic thinktank on Monday evening. The Guardian was blocked from attending the event but a copy of the speech was later circulated. Abbott told the group the ostracisation of those who do not accept climate science was “the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”. Hollywood heavyweights Dame Judi Dench and Meryl Streep have condemned disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein over decades of sexual harassment allegations. The two actors called the complaints against Weistein, who was sacked by his own company yesterday, horrifying and inexcusable, and said those who had spoken out against him were heroes. Streep, who famously referred to the producer as “God” at the 2012 Golden Globe awards, denied any knowledge of the allegations or that his behaviour was an open-secret in Hollywood. “Not everybody knew,” Streep told the Huffington Post. “Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally.” Australians are concerned the current standoff between the United States and North Korea will lead to all-out military confrontation, with 55% fearing that outcome, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Women are more pessimistic about the brinkmanship leading to war than men – 61% compared with 49%. Voters surveyed also ranked terrorism top of their current concerns about their personal safety, followed by a car accident and nuclear warfare. Next on the list was catastrophic climate change, natural disasters and gang violence, with family violence the last point on the list. This week’s Guardian Essential poll has Labor retaining its election-winning lead over Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition government, with the ALP ahead on the two-party preferred measure 54% to 46%. The line between what children learn at home and in the classroom is being “blurred”, as parents increasingly ask schools to help socialise their children, new research has found. A joint study between researchers at Monash University and the Australian Scholarships Group released on Tuesday found almost 70% of parents across the public and independent sector believe schools should be teaching more social skills, while almost half want their children to be taught how to “behave in public”. Experts say socialisation is becoming more of a focus because of the changing nature of children’s activities, including more screen time. Boral has been told to take urgent action to stop pollution flowing from a disused mine site into the Wingecarribee river in the New South Wales southern highlands. The multinational company now has three days left to tell the state’s environmental watchdog, the environmental protection agency (EPA), what it will do to stop zinc, nickel and manganese leaching into the river, which is part of Sydney’s drinking water catchment. The pollution was discovered by an academic, University of Western Sydney water scientist Ian Wright, earlier this year. Wright described the zinc contamination as the worst he had seen and said levels of manganese was “off the chart”. Sport The Miami Dolphins offensive line coach Chris Foerster has resigned after a social media video surfaced appearing to show him snorting three lines of a white powdery substance at a desk.

Thinking time On Saturday night, in the midst of Australia’s divisive same-sex marriage survey, Melbourne hosted its inaugural Coming Back Out Ball – a night to celebrate those who had come of age when “in the closet” was all but compulsory. Here were people who remembered when homosexuality was illegal, when transgender people were shunned, who had nursed the dying through the scourge of Aids. Melbourne editor Gay Alcorn went along for the sequin-filled and often poignant ride, and spoke to some of the LGBTI elders who come back out for the ball. The dual citizenship dramas that have hijacked the government’s agenda for months will be laid out in the high court from today. Amy Remeikis and Paul Karp explain the ins and outs of the section 44 case, which will be heard over the next three days. Four of the seven who have been referred have their (short-term) political futures at stake. And the government faces the prospect of a byelection in the narrowly-held lower house if the court rules Barnaby Joyce was ineligible to stand for election in 2016. Greg Jericho dives into the complex calculations behind Australia’s HFE – horizontal fiscal equalisation – and if you have no idea what that is, you are not alone. The Productivity Commission released a report yesterday on strategy for splitting GST between the states, known as HFE, and even that acknowledges “there is a dearth of public understanding of how HFE works”. Even more problematic, for the federal government, any changes to the formula – such as the ones the commission recommends – risk triggering a war with state governments. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has defended vice-president Mike Pence’s brief and grossly expensive trip to an NFL game in Indianapolis, from which he abruptly walked out in protest after several black players knelt during the national anthem. Pence’s departure has been slammed as a PR stunt, with CNN estimating the trip cost tax-payers around US$250,000. “The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!” Trump tweeted overnight.

A lot is riding on the court’s decision – for both sides. In the case of Moya Greene, the chief executive of Royal Mail, her credibility is on the line. She negotiated an “agenda for growth” agreement with the union just before privatisation in 2013 and it is a clause in that document that the company is now trying to enforce. In essence, Royal Mail committed not to move jobs offshore, not to outsource roles and to limit the use zero-hours contracts. In return, it argues, the CWU agreed that five weeks of arbitration must take place before a strike can go ahead. Given how much weight Royal Mail attached to the agreement – at privatisation and subsequently – Greene needs to be able to show the wording was legally watertight. The CWU’s stance is that mediation has already happened and that Royal Mail is deliberately misinterpreting the 2013 agreement. There was a mediator present during the 18 months of talks that failed to reach a deal on pay and pensions, it argues. Union leaders, too, will look foolish if their legal arguments fail and next week’s strike has to be abandoned. The CWU signed the “agenda for growth” document; it is not a general piece of trades union legislation. A battle in the high court probably won’t calm the mood on either side, whatever is decided, but the loser will start on the back foot. IoD governance report could spur wrong kind of debate Is GlaxoSmithKline the worst-governed company in the FTSE 100 index? Can Barclays really be the fourth best? The Institute of Directors thinks so – or, rather, its Good Governance Report has produced these rankings for 2017 based on 47 “indicators” of good governance weighted according to significance. It all sounds terribly objective and mathematical until you examine the breakdown of the scores and realise nobody applied a filter for common sense. Why is Glaxo ranked a long way below Rolls-Royce and BT for “audit risk and external accountability”? The engine-maker in January agreed to pay £671m in penalties to settle allegations of bribery and corruption brought by the Serious Fraud Office. In the same month, BT confessed to a £530m black hole in its subsidiary in Italy. Glaxo’s big Chinese bribery scandal was three years ago and it has suffered no similar indignity since. How can the pharmaceuticals firm still be bottom of the pile? Other weird findings include a near-perfect score for Imperial Brands on “shareholder relations” even though shareholders in the tobacco group revolted over a plan to give the chief executive a big pay rise. Meanwhile, Provident Financial has illustrated how these reports can be a hostage to events. The doorstep lender received its near-perfect score for “remuneration and reward” just before its share price collapsed and the chief executive, Peter Crook, who had been paid £30m over five years, was ousted. As for Barclays, fourth place is clearly better than the last place it received a couple of years ago. Yet the high ranking ignores the fact that its chief executive, Jes Staley, is under investigation by the financial regulator for the serious governance breach of attempting to unmask a whistleblower. Perhaps one shouldn’t be too hard on the IoD, which promotes good governance more actively than the CBI and has been strong in denouncing lax standards at Sports Direct and BHS. But this report may fail in its attempt “to stimulate an ongoing debate about the importance of good corporate governance”. These rankings are more likely to provoke baffled cries of “Do you actually follow the news?” Deutsche Börse move highlights risk of lacking transition deal It is possible that Deutsche Börse’s attempt to lure part of the euro clearing market to Frankfurt has nothing to do with Brexit. The strategy could be influenced by financial market regulations that are changing anyway. But Brexit seems the most likely spur. Amid the non-agreement over transitional arrangements, Frankfurt sees an opportunity to grab a slice of a lucrative market from the London Stock Exchange, which currently dominates the clearing game. You’d still bet on the LSE to defend itself robustly since Deutsche’s approach seems to be copycat profit-sharing offer to the investment banks. Yet this saga should serve as another reminder about the risks to the City of entering 2018 without a transitional deal. Banks don’t want to trigger their contingency plans, but they are also obliged to cover the danger of the EU writing rules that force some financial activities to shift location. The longer this goes on, the greater the risk to City jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/15/wretch-32-fr-32-f-r-32-review-suggish-and-solemn","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Wretch 32: FR32 review – sluggish and solemn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/15/wretch-32-fr-32-f-r-32-review-suggish-and-solemn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/15/wretch-32-fr-32-f-r-32-review-suggish-and-solemn","fields":{"headline":"Wretch 32: FR32 review – sluggish and solemn","bodyText":"Wretch has always been one of our most thoughtful, emotional MCs, but his fourth major label album is too comfortable in its introspection.

Few today, he argues, “would go to war for the fields, woods and brooks of Britain”. But the generation of 1914‑18 did precisely this. Asked why he volunteered to serve, Edward Thomas scooped up a handful of English soil: “Literally, for this.” The British took their love and knowledge of nature with them to the front. They wrote letters and poetry filled with descriptions of the countryside, avidly bird spotting (“If it weren’t for the birds, what a hell it would be,” wrote a former miner) and keeping pets and even livestock (the 23rd Infantry had a cow at the front to supply them with Devonshire cream). They also planted colourful trench gardens with seeds posted from Blighty: pansies, forget-me-nots and nasturtiums. Apparently, celery grew well in the bottom of trenches. These were poignant attempts to humanise this most inhuman of wars, one whose symbol is now a flower: the blood-red poppy that colonised the cratered fields where so many fell.

About 20,000 people have been evacuated, including hundreds of senior citizens from nursing homes, and public schools in Napa and Sonoma counties were closed on Tuesday. Major fires in those regions remain completely uncontained, threatening thousands of homes and vineyards in the wine country north of San Francisco. Still, calmer conditions on Monday night helped fire crews get a handle on the situation, said another Cal Fire spokeswoman, Heather Williams. “The acreage isn’t going up drastically, and hopefully over the next few days we’re going to start to see those containment numbers go up.” California’s governor, Jerry Brown, has declared a state of emergency in eight mostly northern counties – Butte, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sonoma and Yuba counties. On Monday, during a visit to the state, Vice-President Mike Pence said he had spoken with Brown. “The dryness of the climate, the strength of the winds – you all in California know much better than this midwesterner does,” Pence said. “But I can assure you, as I did the governor, that the federal government stands ready to provide any and all assistance to the state of California.” Eleven of the deaths occurred in Napa and Sonoma counties, according to Cal Fire. Three were further north, in Mendocino county, and the last in the eastern Yuba county, officials said. Entire neighborhoods and a trailer park in the town of Santa Rosa, 55 miles from San Francisco, have already been razed, along with a Hilton hotel, according to local reports. Years of drought in California, followed by an extremely wet winter, have meant that vegetation is thicker and more susceptible to the fires that tend to be at their worst in the autumn. Officials say the high winds are hampering firefighting efforts in the region about 140 miles (225km) north of San Francisco. To assist with the efforts the country’s largest firefighting aircraft – a converted 747 – has been deployed. “It was an inferno like you’ve never seen before,” said Marian Williams, who caravanned with neighbors through flames before dawn as one of the wildfires reached the vineyards and ridges at her small Sonoma County town of Kenwood. Williams could feel the heat of her fire through the car as she fled. “Trees were on fire like torches,” she said. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in counties north of San Francisco Bay and elsewhere after blazes broke out late on Sunday. Williams, said that 17 major fires had started in the past 36 hours in the California, burning about 115,000 acres, mostly in the northern part of the state. She added that unusually high winds had made the fires spread so quickly. “Night-time is when humidity is the highest and temperatures are cooler, but that wind, fueled by denser vegetation, really pushed these fires so quickly.” The high number of deaths in one series of connected fires is unusual. There have been, on average, 13 wildfire deaths a year in the whole of the US since 2014, according to figures collated by the National Interagency Fire Center. Head, the Cal Fire captain, said the fires were probably linked to a warming climate. “It has been hotter, it has been drier, our fire seasons have been longer, fires are burning more intensely, which is a direct correlation to the climate changing,” she said. With so many fires, residents of Sonoma County struggled to figure out which roads to take, finding downed trees or flames blocking some routes. Fires also burned just to the east in the Napa County wine country as well as in Yuba, Butte and Nevada counties, all north of the state capital. Cal Fire tweeted that as many as 8,000 homes were threatened in Nevada County, which lies on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. Smoke was thick in San Francisco, 60 miles (96km) south of the Sonoma County fire. Pillars of heavy smoke rose from the hills surrounding the town of Napa as the sun set on one of the deadliest days of wildfires in California’s history. As darkness took over, the hills around wine country glowed red. “We’ve never had a fire like this before,” said Mike Willmarth, a Napa middle school teacher who has lived in the area for 30 years. “We’ve never had devastation like this.” Margaret Beardsley, 92, sat in a wheelchair next to her husband, Robert, and daughter, Nora. Beardsley used an oxygen tank and wore a surgical mask – the smoke in the air had irritated her lungs. “It’s terrible,” said Beardsley, who has lived in Napa for 46 years and never been evacuated before. “When we left we had no idea if we would have anything to come back to. I want to go home and sleep in my own bed.” The lack of information was frustrating George Bradley, 74, a retired cement mason who has lived in the Napa area for his entire life. He hadn’t been able to contact his mother, and was worried about the house he had evacuated at about 1.30pm. “We just paid it off. We just got the deed,” he said. “We don’t know if it’s still standing or not.” The fire’s economic impact is not yet known – the hundreds of wineries in Napa and Sonoma valleys are their lifeblood. Reports indicate that two wineries – Signorello Estate Winery and Paradise Ridge Winery – were destroyed and that portions of another, Stags’ Leap, were also burned. Although most of this year’s grapes have been harvested, the remaining 20% are some of the most valuable, said Jennifer Putnam, executive director of Napa Valley Grapegrowers, the Napa Valley vineyard trade association. “It’s some of the best fruit that Napa produces, all of the cabernet sauvignon, so it will have a major economic impact if this last 20% can’t be picked,” she said. “We will have to see where we are tomorrow and next week to see how the grapes are metabolizing all this smoke.” Agencies contributed reporting This article was amended on 10 October 2017 to correct the locations where deaths occurred, after Cal Fire initially reported them incorrectly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/09/interest-rate-rise-ons-labour-cost-bank-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T18:38:46Z","webTitle":"Bank of England under pressure for interest rate rise after ONS error","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/09/interest-rate-rise-ons-labour-cost-bank-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/09/interest-rate-rise-ons-labour-cost-bank-of-england","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England under pressure for interest rate rise after ONS error","bodyText":"The UK’s official statistics agency has added to the pressure on the Bank of England over whether to raise interest rates as soon as next month after admitting it underestimated the pace of rising labour costs. The Office for National Statistics said on Monday it made a mistake in its original calculations for the growth in unit labour costs, which is the price paid by employers to produce a given amount of economic output. The measure stood at an annual 2.4% in the three months to June, as opposed to the 1.6% initially published by the country’s official statistics body on Friday. The revision could indicate momentum for wages in the UK, which is a factor under close observation from Threadneedle Street, as it looks to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. Rising labour costs could indicate economic strength and justify a rate hike. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the change “may facilitate” a November rate hike by the Bank. The cost of borrowing could increase from 0.25% to 0.5% should the monetary policy committee decide the economy is able to withstand the increase. Despite the positive signal for the economy, there have been numerous readings to paint a much weaker picture. The construction sector is reporting signs of a slump, while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – a thinktank for developed economies – has warned that UK growth will slow next year. Analysts at the Swiss bank UBS said on Monday a rate hike could also “exacerbate” potential headwinds for the UK economy generated by the Brexit process. “We think there is a strong case for erring on the side of caution,” they wrote. Despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s, wages for British workers have failed to rise above the rate of inflation. Pay growth is rising nonetheless, although it lags behind a spike in the cost of living from the increasing cost of imports linked to the weak pound. While the increase in unit labour costs potentially indicate an increase in wages for British workers, the increase could have been driven by non-wage elements such as taxes and pensions contributions paid by employers. This would weaken the ground for increasing rates, according to economists at Barclays. However Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has previously said that rising labour costs could pave the way for a rate rise. Speaking over the summer, he justified the reluctance of the monetary policy committee to increase rates due to “subdued” wages and labour costs. The ONS apologised for the error, saying it was a consequence of income data from the second estimate of GDP being using instead of data from the quarterly national accounts. “We have corrected this error,” the organisation said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/15/franz-xaver-richter-sinfonias-sonatas-oboe-concerto-capricornus-consort-basel","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:20:23Z","webTitle":"FX Richter: Sinfonias, Sonatas and Oboe Concerto CD review – quite a find","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/15/franz-xaver-richter-sinfonias-sonatas-oboe-concerto-capricornus-consort-basel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/15/franz-xaver-richter-sinfonias-sonatas-oboe-concerto-capricornus-consort-basel","fields":{"headline":"FX Richter: Sinfonias, Sonatas and Oboe Concerto CD review – quite a find","bodyText":"No, not Sviatoslav the renowned pianist, but Franz Xaver, the little-known 18th-century composer.

The Nazi anthem known as the Horst Wessel Song, still banned in postwar Germany, has a tune that, if not derived from How Great Thou Art, closely resembles it. One wonders whether the choice of this particular hymn to play to a listening world was a simple error of judgment or something rather more unwholesome.

It meant that I always had a picture of him with me. Some of the photos are more recent – the two of us together in his garden, laughing around his dinner table, on a walk with his dog, Chloe. Some of the pictures are from my childhood. This photograph was taken at the lido of New England caravan park near Carnforth in Lancashire. It has always been a special place for me, and somewhere that my dad loved as well. The year will be about 1976. My dad is young and handsome, macho against the side of the pool, and I lean towards him in my Sunday clothes with pulled-up socks and sandals like a chubby Little Lord Fauntleroy. No, I’m not going in the water, Dad; not in this outfit. My grandparents had a static caravan at this site from before I was born. When they died, it was passed on to my parents, so it stayed in the family as a summer retreat. I met my wife at university in the 90s. Sometimes, in search of solace, away from our shared student accommodation, we would get the keys to the caravan and stay for a couple of days. We weren’t really outdoors people back then – the farthest we would venture would be Morecambe or Bowness, but now we love the mountains. When my brothers and I had all grown up and left university, my parents decided to sell the caravan. I was sorry to see it go. But then, a few years later, my wife’s mum and dad bought a caravan on the same site. So, I have been visiting this area of the South Lakes my whole life. This year, my wife was offered a great job in Cumbria, and we had the opportunity to move our family to the South Lakes area that I have always loved. We have moved to Arnside – a beautiful seaside town 10 miles from the caravan site where my in-laws still live. Although it was a difficult decision to uproot our family, we are blissfully happy in our new home. I often consider what my dad would have thought about our move, and I wish that he had been alive to see me settled here. It was a special place for both of us, and I can imagine him here; helping me with the house, walking his dog, laughing at me. Christian Stretton Playlist: Memories of my daughter as a baby Rule the World by Take That “You light the skies, up above me / A star, so bright, you blind me, yeah / Don’t close your eyes / Don’t fade away, don’t fade away, oh” I never expected to have a child, but that changed when I was 39 and my partner and I came close to parting company because he wanted a family. I reassessed what I wanted from life, and became pregnant in May 2008. The change in me was incredible and happened overnight; I had a new life growing inside me and I was excited and awed by it. Throughout my pregnancy, I came up against a never-ending slew of doom-and-gloom stories about “elderly gravidae” – mothers over the age of 35 – and the potential problems that I might face. Health professionals and acquaintances warned of back problems, emergency caesarean sections, complications with the birth and for the baby’s health – everyone seemed to know someone who had a nightmare scenario to recount. In the end, I was lucky to have a straightforward delivery, and we took our daughter home the day after she was born, in February 2009. When she was four days old, my partner was away overnight on a training course. I found myself sitting on the sofa with my tiny daughter asleep in my arms; she hated to be put down to sleep in a cold moses basket. Take That’s Rule the World had been playing on the radio for a couple of months before her birth, but that day was the first time I had heard it since she arrived. As the song played, the lyrics struck a powerful chord, and I wept, a combination of hormones and being overwhelmed by the sight of the beautiful creature I held in my arms. I remembered the words a friend had texted to me the morning after the birth: “Nothing else matters now she’s here.” Ginnie O’Farrell We love to eat: George’s jam fritters Ingredients 1 egg 135ml milk 55g plain flour Margarine 2 slices of sliced white bread Raspberry jam 25g lard Sugar Beat the egg, milk and flour in a bowl to make a thick batter. Spread margarine on two slices of white bread, sandwich them together with raspberry jam, then cut into four squares. Heat the lard in a big frying pan. Dip each square in the batter to cover. Wait until the lard is sizzling hot, then place the battered jam sandwich squares into the pan of fat. Fry until crispy golden brown on both sides. Lift the squares out with a fish slice on to a piece of kitchen roll to soak up any excess fat. Sprinkle with sugar and serve. My sweetest childhood food memory is eating my dad’s jam fritters, as an evening treat. The recipe originally came from his uncle George, who made them when he was a chef in the army in the 40s, and then later, back in Liverpool, for his own offspring and my nan and her six children who lived next door, probably as a cheap, postwar dessert. My grandad had died in the second world war when my dad was just a baby, so as a youngster he went everywhere with Uncle George. A good impression was obviously made because Dad, also called George, became an army chef during his national service, later becoming a full-time butcher. During the 70s and 80s, my mum and dad worked full-time and had four kids to feed, so jam fritters became a staple of our household menu as a quick, fun way to satisfy four constantly hungry mouths. Dad made them for us after Sunday dinner, and often as a midweek evening snack. Smoke would billow from the back kitchen, through the serving hatch, to every room in the house. We kids would fly into the kitchen like vultures, grappling for that very first, golden fritter. Despite the fact that they were essentially fatty, sugary, stodge, I still hold a special place for jam fritters in my arteries, and my teeth will never forget them.

Whitehall is well used to getting it from both sides (though shadow chancellor John MacDonnell’s proximity to power seems recently to have tempered left-wing criticism). But when the assailant is Bernard Jenkin, the harsh words reverberate. Jenkin has been chair of the Commons public administration committee for seven years and has been a temperate but persistent inquirer into the operations and principles of our permanent government – different from, but a worthy successor to Tony Wright, who established the committee under the Labour government. On most issues, Jenkin has been able to leave party and partisanship behind, in the best traditions of Commons select committees. But now his hatred of Europe has got the better of them and he has piled into that old favourite, the “Whitehall mind”. Specifically he has attacked the alleged refusal of Treasury officials to listen; which means, it turns out, the refusal of Tom Scholar, the most senior civil servant in the Treasury, and his colleagues to suborn their intellectual judgement to the Brexiteers’ insistence that everything in the garden is lovely and will remain in radiant bloom no matter what the data, analysis and objective evidence say. Jenkin has said he is not attacking chancellor Philip Hammond, but the Treasury staff around him. This won’t do – for three reasons. Jenkin’s attack is lily-livered. He knows full well that Scholar and his colleagues cannot answer back or defend themselves. On behalf of the civil service at large, cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood keeps schtumm, as he has throughout his tenure. All we’re likely to get is a press release from the FDA, which represents senior civil servants and contemptuous tweets from Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary at the Treasury. Second, Jenkin contradicts himself. He has conducted several hearings and evidence gathering sessions over the years that have concluded that there is no dominant Whitehall mentality. In fact he has often (rightly) bemoaned the weakness of the centre of Whitehall and the faltering way in which civil servants are trained up. Third, Jenkin has ruined the inquiry that his very own committee has just begun. How can he investigate civil service effectiveness objectively when he has already concluded that civil servants don’t want evidence and won’t seek challenge? His inquiry might have called Scholar and Heywood before it to ask them about pluralism; instead they have been prejudged. Of course there are questions to be asked about Whitehall and Brexit, starting with departmental capacity, the hollowing out of expertise and the effects of pay caps – policies that Jenkin’s own party have put in place. There are questions, too, about how much further the model of Whitehall neutrality can go as the devolution dynamic plays out in Scotland and Wales and the unified civil service become sectionalised. But Jenkin’s real question is about his own party colleagues and the weakness of Theresa May’s government. Civil servants do what ministers ask them. There is absolutely no evidence that central tenet has weakened. But when ministers don’t know their own minds or can’t decide what to do – in other words where the Tory party is at over Brexit – what are civil servants supposed to do? What they must not do, which is what Jenkin seems to want, is to make ungrounded judgements about where public or political opinion is at or take their lead from raucous factions claiming to have found the holy grail.

The former prime minister will work two or three days a month for the US company, which handles credit and debit card transactions and cash machines around the world. The company made revenues of $11.6bn last year, processing 2,800 transfers a second across more than 6m merchant locations. In a press release, First Data described Cameron as one of the “most prominent global influencers of the early 21st century” and said he would help “expand the company’s footprint in new and existing markets”. Cameron said: “I am incredibly proud that during my time as prime minister the United Kingdom became a global force in fin-tech [financial technology]. I remain passionate about the opportunities that exist for British and international companies that are developing exciting technologies both for businesses and consumers – technologies that have the potential to revolutionise the way we all live our lives.” His job was signed off by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which makes recommendations on new positions for ministers after they leave office. Because he stepped down as an MP in September last year, Cameron will not have to declare how much he is paid. Cameron is understood to have signed a deal worth a reported £800,000 for his memoirs, which are due to be published next year. The deal was substantially less than the £4.6m advance received by Tony Blair for his memoirs after leaving office. Since leaving Downing Street, Cameron’s wife, Samantha, has set up a clothing design company, Cefinn. Cameron will sit on First Data’s advisory board, helping the chief executive and other senior figures with “international, contextual and geopolitical advice and analysis”. The former prime minister will also speak “at private and public events for and on behalf of First Data.” According to the Acoba advice, he must not lobby the government on behalf of First Data for two years from July 2016, when he stepped down as prime minister. In a letter to Cameron, Acoba notes: “You stated the role is not likely to include contact with government, you have no commercially sensitive information about First Data or its competitors and you did not have previous official dealings with First Data.” Given Cameron’s former position, Acoba asked the Cabinet Office permanent secretary, John Manzoni, about the role. Manzoni confirmed that the government had no links with First Data, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia. First Data was taken over by the private equity firm KKR in 2007, one of the biggest private equity deals undertaken. The company was hit hard by the financial crisis but has since bounced back under the chief executive, Frank Bisignano, and was taken public again in 2015. In 2015 First Data supported the UK launch of Apple Pay, which allows consumers to “tap and pay” with their mobile phones. Last year First Data processed more than 79bn electronic transactions worth a total of $2.2tn. KKR was co-founded by the influential businessman Henry Kravis, who has an estimated worth of $4.2bn, according to Forbes magazine. Kravis, who was rumoured to be the inspiration for the Gordon Gecko character in Wall Street, remains on the board of First Data. Kravis and Cameron have attended some of the same major financial conferences, including Davos in 2011 and the Bilderburg meeting in 2013. Since stepping down from parliament, Cameron has become a member of the global board of advisers for the Council on Foreign Relations and taken on various speaking roles. The former chancellor George Osborne has taken on a wider range of jobs, including becoming the editor of the Evening Standard and an adviser to BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager. Osborne is paid £650,000 a year by BlackRock for one day’s work a week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/oct/11/housing-crisis-england-scrap-right-to-buy-help-to-buy","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T06:33:04Z","webTitle":"The housing crisis will only get worse until England scraps right to buy | Jonathan Manns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/oct/11/housing-crisis-england-scrap-right-to-buy-help-to-buy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/oct/11/housing-crisis-england-scrap-right-to-buy-help-to-buy","fields":{"headline":"The housing crisis will only get worse until England scraps right to buy","bodyText":"Scotland has already scrapped so-called right-to-buy schemes and Wales is pushing through reforms to do the same.

Cash windfalls for a few lucky buyers might win their vote, but the majority must surely recognise that both the right to buy and help to buy schemes are economically and morally reprehensible. The disaster in housing supply is increasing social and intergenerational inequality. In London, where housing problems are acute, 27% of residents (2.3 million people) live in poverty, and more than half are in a working family. The capital’s recorded homeless population of 170,000 is now more than double that five years ago. Since right to buy was introduced in 1980, 2m properties have moved into the private sector and most are simply not being replaced. That’s 2m fewer homes local authorities can use to house those most in need. It’s ludicrous to suggest that in a time of crisis, we should be selling state-owned homes to those who live in them. It’s even more ridiculous to suppose that they should come with a discount – potentially more than £100,000 – on the purchase and retention of any future value uplift. We’ve inverted an economic rationale that saw local authorities providing almost 30% of the total housing stock as affordable homes in 1980 to only 8% today. In doing so, we’ve gone from more than 80% of housing subsidies being supply-side in 1975 to support the construction of social homes, to more than 85% of subsidies being on the demand-side by 2000, helping people to purchase – including the help-to-buy scheme introduced in 2014. The result has been less building and inflated demand, reflecting an expectation that the state should largely withdraw from an active role in housing provision. Though it is delayed until April 2018, the government still remains committed to extending the right to buy to housing associations. Accounting for 9% of total stock, this could double the future impact of the policy. The could also cost the Treasury £5.8bn a year, money that could be better spent facilitating construction. Then there are practical problems arising from the sale of homes. Right to buy has introduced a mix of tenures into council portfolios. Private leaseholders and renters are now interwoven among tenants. Approximately 40% of homes sold under the right-to-buy scheme are owned by private landlords; some are rented back by those receiving housing benefit. There are few controls over who occupies these homes and how, and there is no statutory right to enter properties, to inspect alterations or living conditions. With an undeniable need to build more housing in England, to sell homes that are purposefully built and available for those in need is absurd, bereft of logic and utterly irresponsible. It’s time to stop subsidising home ownership. Instead, let’s ensure state resources are deployed as long-term assets. England must now join the other nations of Great Britain and scrap both right-to-buy and help-to-buy schemes.

Meet Littleford today and, in contrast with her description of her early life, the word that immediately comes to mind is “serene”. The self-assured, articulate 30-year-old, who works as a commissioner of children’s health services for Hackney council in east London – and is also a writer and broadcaster – tells her story simply and without rancour. It’s tough to imagine her being slapped and screamed at by her mother, or sexually abused by one of the many men who passed through the household, or dirty, or hungry, or begging for food from the neighbours. But all of these things are true. Littleford is the eldest of nine siblings – all of whom were either taken into care or adopted. She was fostered at 14, but separately from her siblings, who were split up two years before when, after years of concerns, social services finally swooped. They left Littleford – negligently, in her opinion – to remain living with her mother. Since she gave a talk about her early life on Radio 4, Littleford has been invited to speak at a number of conferences. She often holds audiences agog – as much in horror at what she has come through, as in wonder that she has very obviously thrived despite her childhood turmoil. After her six younger siblings were fostered, Littleford’s mother went on to have two more babies. Littleford knew the older of them, a boy, until he was 18 months old, when he was adopted and that relationship was abruptly terminated. “A social worker told me that once siblings are adopted you’re not allowed to see them anymore – but not really the reasons why,” she says. Anger becomes awareness As she has got older, Littleford has become far more aware of the lack of choice her mum was able to exert over her own life, due to her own abusive childhood, “but at the time I was really angry that she just kept having babies that we would never get to know”. She didn’t see her mother for two years after her youngest brother was adopted and she has never met her youngest sibling, a girl. Having utterly transformed her life since those painful days, why has Littleford suddenly opted to speak out? It isn’t about personal catharsis, she says – quite the opposite. One of her ways of coping with her past has always been “not to deny or hide it, but to put things away”. She’s accepted invitations to speak publicly, she says, “because other people might get something useful from it”. Clearly driven by wanting to redress the imbalances she sees – and has experienced – in society, Littleford is keen to show that for children in care, success is an achievable goal. “It’s way more possible than people think. A lot of people say to me: ‘You’re one in a million, you’re really rare.’ I get why they say that but secretly I’m annoyed, because I don’t want that to be the case. I don’t think I’ve worked really hard for it and I don’t think it’s remarkable. Plenty of people who have grown up in circumstances like mine are doing well, but people aren’t aware of them.” Academic success via university, she insists, is not the only way to contribute to society, and there are care leavers without degrees or standard career paths who are flourishing, often in the arts and creative industries. She acknowledges, however, that she has, in some senses, been lucky – lucky to have loved school and always been top of the class; and lucky to have fallen into an “amazing” foster placement offered by a school-friend’s parents that was pivotal in encouraging her into higher education. Littleford did history at the University of Sheffield and then, despite her social worker failing to pay the fees in time, meaning she lost a whole year – “they’d never come across anyone from care wanting to do a postgrad” – completed a master’s at King’s College London. She cannot recall any help from social services that improved her day-to-day life as a child. She sounds sad and frustrated when she describes each new social worker – they were always changing – being more focused on their paperwork than on her family’s urgent and growing needs. “They’d ask me the exact same questions as before – over and over again,” she says. “Maybe they’d talk about the possibilities for the future, like not being able to live with my mum. Maybe a little prep around that and the possibility of all the siblings needing to be split up because there were so many of us. But no actual, practical help.” A lack of intervention Reflecting on her mother’s needs, Littleford says she too received little, if any, social services intervention that might have helped her improve her utterly inadequate and sometimes dangerous parenting. “My mum’s never spoken of anything that was done that she felt helped her,” she says quietly. This still makes her angry, because she believes that her mother could have been supported to parent well enough for the family to have stayed together. Even now, Littleford says, it is rare for social services to work in depth with parents to help them address complex issues relating to early trauma, violence and abuse. “It’s all about: ‘You have to do what’s best for the children,’” she says. “A bit of that might be putting little things in place with parents, but it’s never very intensive, because social workers’ focus is all on the children.” Such a lack of attention to individuals whose needs are acute can’t come close to helping women like her mother, Littleford believes. But she is encouraged by new approaches like the Pause project, first launched in Hackney in 2014, which offers intensive, wraparound interventions to support mothers who have repeatedly had children removed from their care. Littleford has gradually rebuilt fractured relationships with her fostered siblings who have now left care, and has made a fragile peace with her mother. But she keeps some degree of distance from her family, careful to protect the deliberately calm and ordered life she has constructed for herself. She’s had her nieces to stay for a couple of days over the summer, but, although she visits her family occasionally, she’s “super averse to chaos and drama now. Staying away from that is a priority.” Littleford knows her two youngest siblings are approaching the age when they might choose to contact their birth family. Her apprehension is evident. “We’ve been given the opportunity to have letterbox contact, and I’ve never written,” she says, a slightly embarrassed smile flickering across her face. Why not? “I think as I get older I shy away more from painful experiences, to protect myself,” she says. “Every time I tried to write it just seemed so trivial. What would I tell them? And then, I wasn’t sure if I could write about what had really happened, or why our family was in the situation it was. Would the social workers say: ‘No you can’t write that kind of thing?’” She sighs. “I’m not really sure how it works. So, the best thing was just not to write, but as they get closer to 18, I feel really bad about it, because it always feels …” She hesitates. And here it comes, the guilt – an enduring effect of a devastated childhood on a woman who has flourished in adult life. “Like I’ve abandoned them.” She laughs, understanding that this is ridiculous, but feeling it, nevertheless. Having taken on a mothering role for her younger siblings when that responsibility should never have been hers, Littleford is determined to enjoy her freedom now. Professionally though, she senses she’s coming to a crossroads: either commit to becoming a senior leader in public health, or pursue a more creative, even political, path. She’s acutely aware of how far she’s “moved across classes” to gain her current stability, and there’s an evident conflict between her deep desire for security, and her excitement at the prospects opening up from her writing and public speaking. It’s hard to imagine, though, that whatever she does will take her far from the driving force deep in her core. “I really like working in an environment that’s about balancing out inequalities,” she says. “When I don’t think specifically about my job, but about what I want to do in my life, that’s what I want – to give opportunities to people who haven’t had them.” ‘We were asking-for-food poor’: nine children on the breadline I’ve never seen my mum cry. And I’ve seen her being horribly beaten up, and have all of her children taken away from her. But I’ve never seen her cry. I don’t know a lot about my mum’s childhood because she never talks about it, but I know, in my gut, that it was bad. My mum had been a child in care, and now so were her nine children. Just into my teens, I found myself asking: “Why didn’t she learn from her past? Why wasn’t she trying to make things better for us? Was it that she didn’t want to?” That couldn’t be true, because I knew she had a good heart. We were the typical council estate big family on benefits. We were poor, and I mean below-the-breadline poor – asking-neighbours-for-food poor. One of my most embarrassing memories is reading a letter from the council saying the neighbours had complained about us begging for food. I’d never associated my actions with begging before, I just asked the neighbours for some food sometimes because my mum had asked me to, and because we needed to eat. And yes, we were neglected. We were the family who constantly had nits. If you walked around our house with bare feet the soles would turn black. My mum never did schoolwork with us at home. One thing I realised as I got older was that my mum had very little control over her own life. All nine of us children, although loved, were never planned. Pregnancy was a thing that happened to my mum because the man would decide if contraception was used or not. Does anything show a lack of control more than knowing if you get pregnant again you won’t get to keep the child, but having no say over whether you become pregnant? We were a family where the cycles of deprivation and dysfunction passed through the generations. A woman – my mum – who had been in the care system, having her children taken into care. That woman, who watched her own mother suffer violence at the hands of her drunken father, subjected to the same violence from her partners. Can these cycles be broken? I believe they can: I think I’m a testament to that. But I also believe if the right intervention had come along for my mum the cycles would have been broken much earlier.

The prime minister also underlined the fact that the government was preparing for a “no deal” outcome to the negotiations. “It is also our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality, so that is exactly what we are doing,” she said. She reiterated her hope of striking a “unique and ambitious economic partnership” with the EU27. She repeated her expectation, spelled out in the Florence speech, of an implementation periodlasting “around two years”. In response to a question from Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was the darling of Eurosceptic Tories at the party’s conference last week, the prime minister said a transition deal “may mean we will start off with European court of justice still governing rules we’re part of for that period”. She went on to stress that long lead-in times meant it was unlikely any new rules would be implemented in that period, which the government expects to be about two years. But speaking afterwards, Rees-Mogg said: “If the ECJ still has jurisdiction, we will not have left the EU. It is perhaps the most important red line in ensuring the leave vote is honoured.” Asked if that was the implication of May’s statement, he said: “I fear so.” Jurisdiction of the ECJ during a transition was one of the “red lines” set out by Boris Johnson in an interview with the Sun in the run-up to the Conservative party conference. May’s wording on EU laws also appeared to raise concerns from other Brexit-supporting politicians. Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the steering group of a backbench group of Conservative MPs pushing for a decisive Brexit, said: “Most MPs represent leave constituencies, and they may find it hard to explain why we are not taking back control of our laws on day one.” However, he added: “I would want to understand more about this before making any further comment.” Others were pushing May to make clear that she was ready to walk away from European negotiations. Charlie Elphicke, the Dover MP who is also a member of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Tory MPs, said: “It’s clear from the behaviour of Brussels and the Euro parliament we must be ready on day one, deal or no deal. What’s more, we’ll secure a better deal if the EU knows we can walk away from the table.” May was updating the House of Commons on Monday on the content of her Florence speech last month and the status of the negotiations, which have resumed in Brussels. Johnson himself signalled his support for May’s position, saying: “Yes, we will mostly have to operate under existing rules during the transition, but we will be able to negotiate proper free trade deals and business will be able to prepare properly for Brexit … What matters is the end state and our freedom to do things differently and better.” His fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove, now the environment secretary, used a strikingly similar argument, tweeting that being “pragmatic” about a transition deal now would buy Britain “maximum freedom to diverge from EU in end state”. Jeremy Corbyn responded to May’s statement by accusing cabinet ministers of jeopardising Britain’s future by “squabbling” among themselves. “Just at the moment when Britain needs a strong negotiating team,” the Labour leader said, “we have a cabinet at each other’s throats. Half of the Conservative party want the foreign secretary sacked; the other half want the chancellor sacked.” May was attempting to reassert her authority over the Brexit negotiations, and her fractious party, after a calamitous conference and a weekend of media speculation about the future of the foreign secretary and the chancellor. Corbyn said that far from injecting new dynamism into the talks as she claimed, the prime minister’s Florence speech had “demonstrated the scale of the mess the government is making of these negotiations”. May insisted the talks were on track and said her government was “getting on with the job of delivering the democratic will of the British people”. She paid tribute to the work of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and said progress had been made on all of the withdrawal issues the EU has insisted must be resolved before talks can switch to the future trade relationship between Britain and the EU27. As May delivered her statement, the government published two white papers on the legislation it believes will be necessary to strike new trade deals and implement a new customs system in preparation for Brexit. The Liberal Democrats’ Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, urged the prime minister to bring an end to the “backstabbing briefing and counter-briefing from her ministers and their surrogates” and called on her to sack the foreign secretary, whose “back-seat driving” he described as damaging. Earlier on Monday, the European commission dismissed a statement released by Downing Street overnight suggesting May would tell the EU27 the the ball was in their court. At his daily press briefing in Brussels, the commission’s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, insisted that the next move had to come from the UK. “The ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2017/oct/09/elephant-skin-trade-the-animals-latest-existential-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T16:05:10Z","webTitle":"Will Myanmar’s elephants die out because their skin is being made into jewellery?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2017/oct/09/elephant-skin-trade-the-animals-latest-existential-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2017/oct/09/elephant-skin-trade-the-animals-latest-existential-threat","fields":{"headline":"Will Myanmar’s elephants die out because their skin is being made into jewellery?","bodyText":"The extent to which humans can find a use for every part of an elephant seems infinite. Once, it was a desire for ivory that was to blame for the destruction of populations, but now that countries have cracked down on that – including a ban in the UK on the sale of antique ivory – markets for other products are being found. The latest fad is for elephant skin, which is being sold as jewellery and a cure for eczema. In Myanmar there are thought to be only 1,000-2,000 elephants left, down from 10,000 two decades ago. Female Asian elephants, which were always protected to a degree because they don’t have tusks, are now being targeted. Previously, elephants found skinned were rare, says Christy Williams, country director of the World Wildlife Fund’s Myanmar office. “Then we had a [lot] of poachings in Myanmar, where maybe 35-40 elephants were killed in a short space of time, largely for the skin trade. It started this year.” Traffic [the wildlife trade monitoring organisation] puts the price of elephant skin at about $120 (£90) a kilo – up from $10-$20 a kilo 10 years ago. Elephants have even been shot with poison darts, which take days to kill them. Poachers track them, then skin them. “Last year, we went to a place on the Myanmar-China border and found significant quantities of elephant skin for sale,” says an investigator for the charity Elephant Family. In China, “people showed us beads made out of elephant skin and talked about how it was a new thing they were trying out. We have also been conducting research on online forums. There is a lot of talk about this jewellery.” Trade in elephant skin in itself is not new, but the market in jewellery seems to be, he says. (It shouldn’t be confused however with beads made from gemstone and called elephant skin.) “That’s the worrying thing. When these things take off, they take off quickly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/chris-bonington-mountaineer-everest-ascent-british-climber-book-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T13:00:02Z","webTitle":"Sir Chris Bonington: ‘I was caught by the police when I was four years old’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/chris-bonington-mountaineer-everest-ascent-british-climber-book-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/chris-bonington-mountaineer-everest-ascent-british-climber-book-interview","fields":{"headline":"Sir Chris Bonington: ‘I was caught by the police when I was four years old’","bodyText":"Climbing Everest for the first time was fantastic. We had the mountain to ourselves. The summit is quite small, about the size of a pool table. Walking along the final ridge from the Hillary Step is a bit of a trudge. All I could think about was all the mates of mine who over the years had died up there. The first time I showed my adventurous spirit I was about four. I opened the back gate of our flat in Hampstead to explore the heath. I was caught by the police and taken to the station at Belsize Park. Somehow I managed to get into their fridge and poured a pint of milk all over the inspector’s desk. Climbing is not a matter of fear, even on very hard mountains. In a dangerous situation you are completely wrapped up in working out how you are going to get out of it. Solving that brings a wonderful satisfaction. My dad always drank a lot. One night my parents had a huge argument and my mother knocked him unconscious with a fire poker. She panicked and fled. Later she crept back into the house to find a lot of blood, but no sign of him. That was the end of their marriage. I was about three months old. I became a communist when I was 15. I wasn’t very idealistic, but I enjoyed the demonstrations. But the activists were such dreary people. Then I decided I’d rather like to go into the colonial service. Obviously, the colonial service and communism didn’t sit very well together. My wife Wendy and I were very liberal parents. We left our boys to do what they liked. They were wild teenagers – both were pretty much expelled from school. But they emerged as good men and have good marriages. And we made the transition from parental responsibility to loving friendship. I’ve always been interested in escape, not because I was unhappy, I think, but because my dad was in a German prisoner-of-war camp. I was a management trainee with Unilever, working with the margarine people. It was worse than the army and dreadfully hierarchical. The offices, the canteen, even the toilets were all divided on class lines. The climb that made me famous was the North Wall of the Eiger. It was the first British ascent. I sold the story to a chap from the Express for £1,000. The climb made more headlines than anything else I’ve ever done. Wendy found she had motor neurone disease in 2012. With hindsight there were earlier signs. She’d started to fall over quite often. There is no cure and from there it was 19 months – mercifully it was quite fast. We dealt with it as best we could. She was incredibly positive and courageous. I’ve always wanted to please people, which in some ways is a good thing, but in others it’s very bad. I’m delighted beards are back in fashion. For me a beard was always a sign that I was on a climbing trip. I’ve now had one continuously since July 1962. I’ve known Loreto [Herman Bonington, the couple married in 2016] for years. I’ve always enjoyed her company, but she’s younger than me and very vivacious. Our friends started to push us together so I invited her to dinner at the Alpine Club. I kissed her for the first time at a bus stop outside the Ritz. Ascent by Sir Chris Bonington is published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 19 October at £20.

Those who know, must speak up","bodyText":"“It’s unbelievable,” the BBC arts editor told listeners of the BBC’s Today programme. Will Gompertz was discussing sacked Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s alleged conduct over decades. Unbelievable is an unfortunate phrase. Gompertz did not mean that he didn’t believe the women who have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, I guess, he was just expressing shock. Because a powerful man being accused of abusing women both in and out of the workplace is an entirely believable scenario. In fact, it is utterly familiar. According to the New York Times, Weinstein, a major player in Hollywood for almost 40 years, has reached settlements with at least eight women after allegations of sexual abuse. He says the story is false, defamatory and has threatened to sue the newspaper. At the weekend, the actor Rose McGowan called him a “monster” and Ashley Judd has also spoken out. Weinstein is 65 and is still a very rich man. Now fired from the Weinstein Company, he will have the time to spend time working out where it all went wrong. The ramblings in his statement to the New York Times, which were perhaps meant to be an apology for past behaviour, included this insight: “I came of age in the 1960s and 70s where all the rules about behaviour and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.” Really? So it was fine during that time to summon a script editor to your room, and, if the allegation cited is true, signal for your assistants to leave, before asking her to get in the bath with you? Have values changed that much? Regardless of what is alleged of Weinstein, has it ever been appropriate to corner a woman and masturbate into a pot plant in front of her? No. The gloss of the casting couch and its mythology cannot hide what happened in the past. This has nothing at all to do with the desirability of female actors. This is about power. America surely understands the relationship between pussy-grabbing and power these days? It’s hardly just a Hollywood thing, is it? In the new media industries there has been a series of recent firings after sexual abuse allegations. The creator of YouTube channel Honest Trailers, Andy Signore, has just been fired after allegations from two women who came forward in the wake of the New York Times allegations.. Hollywood, old or new, is not the issue here. Similar allegations emerge from less glamorous places, though an invite to watch Weinstein shower, if that is what happened, is actually about as unglamorous as it gets. What Hollywood people do have, though, is access to the media. Helen Mirren, Thandi Newton and Charlize Theron have spoken about sexual harassment, but it is still seen as pretty much a career-terminating move, as it has been, in a way, for Rose McGowan. But for an actor’s career to end, more than one person has to be complicit in an unspoken agreement that certain behaviour is just part of the deal. The fact that Weinstein backed progressive causes including the Womens’ March, which was aimed mostly at Donald Trump, changes nothing. The Republicans have never had the monopoly on sleazebags I’m afraid. The misplaced notion that harassment or the other kinds of inappropriate behaviour that Weinstein has admitted in his statement were just dandy in the 60s and 70s, and that now it’s all lovely, disguises a level of collusion that is present in 2017. Sexual assault is still not career-terminating for men but being vocal about being assaulted is. In true self-congratulatory fashion, some are being praised for speaking out now that Weinstein has actually been fired. Sure, there was a joke on 30 Rock back in 2012, but even Saturday Night Live has steered clear of the subject. The shut-down around prominent individuals who are accused of sexual assault – Bill Cosby comes to mind – is galling. Where are our screen heroes and heroines when you really need them? Activists in many fields know that for change to come, silence has to be broken. “Your silence will not protect you,” as Audre Lorde said. “Silence = death” as Aids activists used to chant. I am not being overly dramatic here but if those who are paid to literally voice our culture are not speaking out about the abuse of women, they are part of it.

New approaches are yielding striking results that could help avert a beds crisis – and improve older people’s chances of continuing to live independently. The latest thinking on hospital discharge is to get people home and then carry out assessment of their support needs and rehabilitation. Hospital trusts and their community health and social care partners are being encouraged to adopt a “discharge-to-assess” (D2A) or “home-first” model. Where the models have been tested, the number of patients subject to delayed discharge has plummeted; the number of patients going into residential care has also shrunk dramatically – in one instance, almost to nothing. “We can see that the impact of D2A is huge,” says Liz Sargeant, clinical lead for the national emergency care improvement programme. “Ten days in bed for patients over 80 is equivalent to 10 years’ ageing of muscles.” This deconditioning means that some people go into hospital never to see their own home again. “Yet people can instead be discharged, then supported in their own homes,” says Sargeant. Images of people waiting for trolleys in A&amp;E and reports of routine operations being cancelled dominate the news every winter, as demand for hospital beds spikes. Nearly two thirds of hospital inpatients at any one time are 65 or older, according to the National Audit Office, while delays in discharge, or “transfers of care”, are almost a third up on 2014. That’s equivalent to almost 6,000 beds a day being taken up unnecessarily, with 55% of delays attributed to the NHS – principally “patients awaiting further non-acute NHS care” – and 37% attributed to social care, principally patients awaiting a care package for when they return home. Measures announced in July aimed at prompting councils to cut delays on the social care side have proved controversial. Critics have questioned the rationale of threatening to cut funding for councils that fail to respond. But part of the drive to free up as many as 3,000 extra beds is based on an expectation by NHS Improvement (NHSI), the agency that works with care providers, that hospitals will adopt the D2A model as good practice and have just one person carry out needs assessments. The agency points to results in east London, where Tower Hamlets Together, a collaboration of health and social care organisations, has piloted D2A. The average length of hospital stay is down and there has been a dramatic fall in the number of patients ending up needing long-term care, says Patricia Oguta, interim team manager for hospital social services. When the pilot was run in 2015-16, just 1% of patients who were discharged under the new arrangements, then assessed at home for care packages, reablement and therapy, ended up in residential or nursing care – compared with an estimated 50% of patients who had conventional in-patient rehabilitation. The approach is now a formal “care pathway” within the admission avoidance and discharge service operated by the East London NHS foundation trust. Running seven days a week from 8am to 6pm, it is staffed by two social workers, four occupational therapists (OTs), two physiotherapists, three nurses and one rehabilation support worker. Patients are given an assessment on the day of referral, if required, and receive up to six weeks’ community input post-discharge. Short-term night care is also possible. The full social care assessment process starts two weeks after discharge, to fully address the change in needs. “Tower Hamlets’ success has been down to partnership working and a whole-system approach, with a big emphasis on supporting people in their homes,” says Oguta. “As a result there are fewer people going into residential care and we have been able to close one of the rehabilitation wards for the elderly.” Another success story is in Kent, where Medway foundation NHS trust has shown what can be achieved with the right mindset. The trust came out of a record four years in special measures in April after overhauling its discharge arrangements. Working in partnership with Medway clinical commissioning group (CCG), Medway council and Medway Community Healthcare, a community interest company, the trust developed the Home First initiative – to provide support for patients who are medically fit to be discharged, but still require additional home support. Again, results have been astonishing – a 25% drop in the number of delayed transfers of care in three months of the pilot last year, with an average of 32 patients discharged by the Medway Maritime each week. That number has since increased to 40, and a total of 2,000 patients have been discharged under the seven-days-a-week scheme, which has four patient pathways, for those needing little or no support through to those with complex needs who may need intermediate care and may not be able to go home safely immediately. Data shows permanent admissions to care homes for over-65s have halved since introduction of the scheme. Barbara Littlewood, 87, from Allhallows, near Rochester in Kent, is a fervent advocate of Home First. She was supported to return to her bungalow last winter, following surgery on her knee, and spent just five days in hospital, compared to three weeks for a similar operation in the past. “I can never sleep in hospital so I was relieved to get home,” says Littlewood. “I had carers in three times a day and an OT came to oversee my exercises. Everyone made sure I had all I needed to get around my home safely and independently.” Lisa Riley, former Home First lead for Medway Community Healthcare, who now works with NHSI, recalls that Medway’s D2A scheme was implemented in April last year just a few weeks before a visit by inspectors from the Care Quality Commission. It used existing teams and directed all care via that route – removing historical “territories” and creating a single point of access for all coordination of a patient’s discharge. Under the new system, transport is arranged for patients, who are assessed in their own homes by an OT within two hours of leaving hospital. The care package may also involve telecare and wraparound care, with people ringing to make sure medication is taken. Riley, who has spoken to 30 other health and social care organisations about the Medway approach, admits that one model won’t suit every situation. However, she believes the key is to make it as simple as possible and ensure that someone has leadership of the overall project, as well as giving control to staff. There is no doubt that the Medway model has involved a huge culture change. Borne out of necessity, with the trust needing to improve on its special measures rating, Home First was implemented throughout the Medway Maritime hospital. The success of the scheme shows how it is possible to make change within current systems. By placing a greater emphasis on an individual patient’s needs, rather than on organisational boundaries, and by making imaginative use of money, resources and skills across established silos, the Medway did enough to elevate itself out of special measures. Sarah Mitchell, a former director with the Local Government Association, who is now strategic adviser for social care for NHSI’s emergency care improvement programme, agrees that cultural change is essential. But she stresses that money needs to be put into community health services to support the change. “There is a focus on front-door services, but the availability of district nurses and assistant nurses reduces pressure,” says Mitchell. “If you want the community to do this, you have to invest in this.” The case for pushing people, within their capabilities, to do more for themselves, so that they avoid becoming dependent is “overwhelming”, says Sargeant. “We ask people to make cups of tea in hospital occcupational therapy kitchens and walk upstairs, even if they live in a bungalow or on one level of their house,” she says. “We ask them intimate questions about how they manage their personal care and then decide whether they have passed or failed these tests. For people with dementia, this is even more challenging. We would not keep children in hospital unnecessarily, she adds, so why do so with older people? “We need a cultural change; we need to develop a home-first mindset. It is happening in some places, but there is slow progress in others. It needs to happen everywhere.” ‘They are talking about a walk-in shower’ Marlene Decozar was celebrating her 80th birthday surrounded by her close family at her home in east London earlier this year. Days later she was on a hospital ward because of a spinal fracture brought on by thinning of the bones. Confused and in extreme agony, she had been taken by ambulance to the Royal London hospital. Yet within a week, she was back at her one-bedroom home in Poplar with the support of the Tower Hamlets reablement team. “In hospital they got my pain under control,” Decozar says. “They then sent different services to see me and follow up back at home. I still have to have help getting in and out of the shower as I can’t bend. “The occupational therapist comes once a week and they are even talking about getting me a walk-in shower, which will be brilliant,” she adds. For daughter Lisa Warren, who lives in nearby Hackney, the care has been an eye-opener. She says: “I thought my mum would be stuck in hospital for weeks. “The reablement team has been supporting her to be independent. They are talking about fitting a wet room and they have given her a tray on wheels, so she can make herself cups of tea etc. I was worried that she would get six weeks of care and that would be it. But the support has been ongoing. Carers come in and the team has extended the help for her while they sort out a care package. We were worried about how she would cope, but she is just really happy to be back home with her dog, Toffee.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Both the Premier League and Football League, whose clubs have 12,000 boys in intensive training from the age of eight, many more in “development centres” from – preposterously – the age of five, pride themselves on providing a “holistic” experience for the children. Undoubtedly the “elite player performance plan” (EPPP) does incorporate child protection procedures, welfare provision and sophisticated coaching policies, and there are many dedicated staff who care and do their best. But here are some experiences told to us by parents and young people, who are seldom heard, and do not have the professional clubs’ corporate and lobbying power, or the favourable ear of the government. “Some academies do not care about the welfare of the boys,” said one mother, whose son was recruited by a Premier League club at the age of six and released at 13. “They just throw them on the scrapheap, ruin their confidence then turn to the next kid showing a bit of promise.” One young man who suffered serial sudden releases by clubs said he nevertheless looks back gratefully for the quality coaching and competition. He was saved when his dreams were “shattered” at 18 by his schoolteacher mother insisting he continue with his education and using her contacts to enrol him in a college. He recalls that the academy coaches at his local club “broke my heart with as much care and class as a slaughterer in an abattoir”. Repeatedly, people have told us that, contrary to stated EPPP practice, boys were released without warning, constructive explanation or support. One father said that for his son, being released was “like being pushed off a cliff”. The mother of a boy who had been at a Premier League club from eight years old said the upset of being released was compounded by the humiliatingly public way it was done. “It was a disgrace the way it was handled,” she said. Asked about help for her son afterwards, which the leagues say clubs do provide for released 18-year-old “scholars”, she said: “No support from the club. [It was] like you didn’t exist.” It appears that never hearing from a club again is common. A retired school head of year said these blows are delivered to teenagers at the worst time – 15- and 16-year-olds spend Year 11 worrying about their football, missing “vital teaching and learning”. They are dealt news of their release in April – just weeks before they sit their GCSEs. “The student then had to return and face his peers with the humiliation of being let go and the whole experience overwhelms them. GCSEs are of no interest to them at this stage and they find the rejection extremely hard to cope with.” It was also common to hear this, that boys’ education had been impaired. Of life at academies, many said they appreciated the superb facilities and coaching – which contrast starkly with grassroots squalor, again suffering a Conservative government’s nonsense insistence that our country cannot afford to maintain park pitches or decent changing rooms. But one mother of a boy recruited at five by a major Premier League club described the academy culture as “really cold and ruthless”. Her son was training three or four times a week, getting home at 9pm, and became “a shadow of his former self”. They decided to pull him out of the academy and now refuse persistent requests from clubs, insisting that he plays with his friends, for his local grassroots club. Several people working in football have told us that clubs scout most aggressively the five- and six-year-olds – perhaps on the basis that once they are in, they will stay with that club until the club releases them. The EPPP prescribes set fees to be paid to a club if a boy does want to leave for another, which means in practice that many are tied to their first club, even if they are unhappy. The Premier League and Football League clubs wrested control of so many young boys’ sporting childhoods from schools and grassroots clubs with Howard Wilkinson’s Football Association “Charter for Quality” 20 years ago this month. Now Premier League clubs are globally focused, aggressively commercial corporations mostly owned by absentee overseas investors, Wilkinson says they are failing in a “moral responsibility” to give their academy players opportunities, and has called for a review. The FA has an inquiry, by Clive Sheldon QC, into what happened to young boys before Wilkinson’s charter, when there was no child protection to speak of and many suffered horrific sexual abuse. Yet football clubs now take thousands more boys into their system, and its necessarily calculating version of what playing sport means. The victims’ voices now, like then, are not being heard, and the inquiry’s remit assumes that all is well in youth development today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/shortcuts/2017/oct/10/mickey-mouse-candidate-disney-ceo-bob-iger-us-president-trump-billionaires-political-experience","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T12:16:06Z","webTitle":"Mickey Mouse candidate: could Disney CEO Bob Iger be the next US president?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2017/oct/10/mickey-mouse-candidate-disney-ceo-bob-iger-us-president-trump-billionaires-political-experience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/shortcuts/2017/oct/10/mickey-mouse-candidate-disney-ceo-bob-iger-us-president-trump-billionaires-political-experience","fields":{"headline":"Mickey Mouse candidate: could Disney CEO Bob Iger be the next US president?","bodyText":"Name: Bob Iger.

But also in that Bob Iger is probably going to be the next president of the US. Oh, really? Will Mickey Mouse be his running mate? Try taking this a bit more seriously. Let’s look at what we know; in 2019, Iger is scheduled to step down as head of Disney. Right. And he’s very deliberately positioning himself against Donald Trump’s big-ticket issues. He’s spoken out about gun violence, and has urged empathy for US football players who kneel during the national anthem. That doesn’t mean … He’s also refusing to rule out the possibility of running for president in 2020. Oh crap! That means he’s definitely going to run for president! It definitely does! At a Vanity Fair conference last week, Iger said: “I have a full-time job right now, and I love this job, and I’m committed to it, and I’m spending all my time on that and on my family.” Which, as everyone knows, is plainly code for: “I want to be president so badly it makes me dribble.” What political experience does he have? None. But surely … Nope, that’s just the way things are now. The current president of the US has zero political experience, so now the floodgates are open. If you’re rich and fancy being president, there’s plenty to prove you’ll probably end up being president. So it’s going to be Trump v Iger in 2020? Steady on. Iger isn’t the only monstrously wealthy magnate with designs on the White House. Look at Mark Zuckerberg. He seems to have given up running Facebook in order to frown and nod at people, which is a clear sign that he also wants to be president. Oh, God. And Howard Schultz from Starbucks has also started to list statistics in public in a very presidential way, so let’s not rule him out either. Is this a joke? And Oprah Winfrey publicly thanked a reporter who wrote a piece recommending her for the presidency last month. Seriously? Is this the future of politics? High-profile billionaires thinking that personal wealth somehow trumps political experience? Terrifying, isn’t it? For God’s sake, nobody tell Richard Branson.

If we’re lucky enough to have eyesight, an inner photo album accrues throughout our lives. On its pages are the sunsets we’ve seen, the dead bodies, and many other defining images – these are the visual shocks and pleasures which help us understand and read emotion. In a refugee camp in Calais last year, I played football with a young teenage boy from Syria. We had no common language, but we had a laugh as we played. Afterwards I wondered what he had seen in his life so far. Before he left Syria it’s likely he would have been an eyewitness to the destruction of buildings around him and, alas, of lives, too. Our immediate worlds, the things, people, animals and buildings around us, are the first act in the story of our looking lives. This boy’s first act is likely to have been one of visible rubble and rage. Then he went on the road, north towards countries – Germany or Sweden – that he will never have seen in real life. When I was in Sarajevo during its siege, and even when I went on a much less difficult trip to China, I noticed how it was the unfamiliar things – buildings, faces, clothes, threats – that popped up visually. I can only begin to imagine my football friend’s forward tracking shot up through the Balkans. Did the Alps excite him or did they just look like a vast wall between him and safety? Did he get close to any of the monumental non-Arab cities of Europe, such as Vienna or Paris? Did their stucco or baroque buildings look beautiful to him, or excessive? Did the visual experience calm him, as horizons often do for travellers, or did it make him realise that he had miles to go before he slept? There seem to be two different streams within our brain’s rear visual cortex. The first, the ventral stream, assesses objects. It’s the “what” function, and tells you, if you are on a tennis court, that this is a ball barrelling towards you. The second, the dorsal stream, assesses the position and movement of the ball, the “where” function. As the young Syrian and I played, both of these streams were working, but his will have been tested in a far more serious way than mine. His visual encounter with Europe will have been unfamiliar. Embedded within the panorama before his eyes, there will have been people who wanted to cause him harm, or verbally abuse him. Tired but adrenalised and therefore in fight-or-flight mode, he will have been doing ventral and dorsal visual scans of his immediate environment, looking out for oncomers, or faces that are unwelcoming or aggressive. We all do this to a certain extent when we are walking home at night and there are strangers around. I don’t know what happened to him – he was probably sent to somewhere in rural France, or backwards, down the line, like a movie in rewind. But if this refugee did find refuge, he will I hope have discovered another aspect of looking – its consolation. If he is safe, his sense of each will derive in part from what he sees: a place to live, modest comforts, food, hospitable people, FaceTime conversations with people back home, football, television. The story of his looking will have been one about the immediate world, encounters and consolation. His inner photo album will already be more dramatic than most of ours.

I lost me’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/10/gail-emms-badminton-retirement-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/10/gail-emms-badminton-retirement-interview","fields":{"headline":"Gail Emms: ‘I lost my identity in badminton. I lost me’","bodyText":"“I’ve written a comedy about this actually,” Gail Emms says with a wry smile as she explains how a former professional feels when she is spat out by the sports industry and a proud career fades away into oblivion. “It’s very British because they’ll say: ‘Well done, here’s a pat on the back. Now fuck off and get a proper job.’ They need to concentrate on the next one. You’ve done your job, so off you go.” Emms is chatty and cheerful in a sports club in Milton Keynes; but the themes of this interview often seem as bleak as they are salutary. The brutal way in which UK Sport cuts funding is matched by the problems Emms has faced as a retired Olympic medal‑winner. She won her silver medal in badminton at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, playing in the mixed doubles with Nathan Robertson, at a time when British sporting success was a rarity. Emms and Robertson were also world champions in 2006 and she won two Commonwealth Games gold medals and a matching pair of European titles. Eleven years later she pauses when asked if she now wishes she had never been a professional sportswoman. “Yeah, I questioned that a lot,” Emms says. “This year especially.’” She played badminton professionally for a decade and, as she says, “I then had a family. So I’m 40 now and feel like I’ve had the career of a 23-year-old. My CV literally reads: ‘Can hit a shuttle really hard.’ But who am I? I’ve got medals to show and I’m really ambitious and determined. But that doesn’t get me through the HR system when they ask: ‘Has she got three years’ experience? Has she got a marketing degree?’ No, I haven’t.” Emms obtained a sports science degree in 1998 and, rather than expecting free handouts as a former Olympian, she would just like a chance to prove her intelligence and vitality could be useful in the job market. In a blog entitled ‘I’m ashamed to admit I’m struggling,’ Emms wrote of how the constant rejections and piles of unpaid bills made her feel like “I am a failure … I am feeling lost and with no direction, no purpose, no career, no identity and who the hell do I go to? I am not sure I can cope with more rejections.” Emms sips her green tea and describes her contradictory emotions. “In my head I’m great, I’m awesome,” she says wistfully. “It’s that ego we have in sport. But, in real life, you keep getting rejected and you think: ‘I knew where I stood in the badminton world rankings but I don’t know where I rate in real life. Am I average? Am I better than that? Where am I?’” Her vulnerability is a reminder of the battle many sportsmen and women face on retirement. She also makes an acute observation about elite sport undermining personal growth. “Sport suppresses you and keeps you like a kid. It’s easier to control kids because if they misbehave you can put them on the naughty step. So coaches turn into parents. And sport makes athletes behave like kids. I’m still a big kid.” Emms rolls her eyes in self‑deprecation. But her hurt is obvious. “I spent seven months trying to present myself to companies saying, ‘Look, I can really help even if I haven’t got experience in an office. I’d love to be part of your company.’ All I got was: ‘No, sorry. No, sorry.’ I nearly cried on someone when trying my interview‑selling technique. I was thinking, ‘Don’t cry, but I’m really desperate and I really need a job.’ I got home and thought: ‘No one has a sodding clue.’ So I wrote this blog so quick [Emms makes rapid typing sounds] and hit ‘Send’. “I had over 1,000 messages – 200 from athletes. So many people were telling me: ‘I was also in a really bad place but I got through it.’ But the fact that 200 athletes from all sports got in touch was scary because they all felt the same as I did. I’ve opened this box so I can’t just say: ‘Yeah, see you everyone.’ I feel a responsibility to do something about it.” Before outlining some of her hopes to help others prepare for their transition into ordinary society, Emms voices concern about contemporary sport. “I’m worried about this pressure cooker of sport. It’s scary that people are retiring at 25. That troubles me. Why do they need to retire at 25? They should be in their prime. Look at [the former world champion sprint cyclist] Becky James. She retired at 25. She was losing herself in cycling so fair play to her for having the guts to get out. But we’ve lost somebody really talented.” British Cycling has come under severe criticism, amid allegations of sexism and bullying by former coaches. James herself has not complained but the consuming nature of professional sport worked against her natural ebullience and wider interests. “There’s so much pressure on athletes, coaches and performance directors,” Emms says. “Their jobs are on the line. If they don’t produce a gold medal they could be gone. And it’s not healthy. I should look back and think I loved every moment of my sporting career. I don’t think I can. How many people in the system can say: ‘I truly love it.’ They can’t because of that pressure. “I’m for and against the UK Sport system. The ruthlessness produces medals. If you invest so much money you expect a return from it. I get that. However, a lot of sports rely on it. Badminton, as a minority sport, is very reliant on that money. I managed to achieve what I did because of funding and investment. But we shouldn’t be reliant on UK Sport money. We should be sustainable as we build from the grassroots. My worry is that we’ve created this massive gap between grassroots and the elite with the UK Sport system.” Emms was shocked late last year when badminton’s funding was slashed from £5.9m to nothing. “I thought it was a joke at first because I was on the [national badminton] board and we had no warning to say: ‘Listen, it’s not looking good, just be prepared.’ Instead [UK Sport] were like, ‘it will be fine’. To go from £5.9m to zero after we had won an unexpected medal at the Rio Olympics seemed totally wrong. “I think there should be a base level for all sports but also an incentive as well – ‘We’ll give you a quarter of a million to start a club system but you need to help your sport be sustainable.’ Once we’ve done that there might be investment into extra funding. Badminton has become a little [she makes a begging gesture]: ‘Please can we have some money?’ I now think: ‘Actually, we can do it ourselves. We’ve got thousands of clubs across the country. We have to pull together. They do it in Denmark very well.’ “But before reaching that point there was anger. You feel: ‘What’s the point? Why don’t they believe in us?’ But now I think badminton needs to show how good we are. We have a lovely little sport but this is the hardest time because people were so used to lottery funding. They’ve got to change that mindset. I’ve been there because I was also pre-lottery. I started when there was no funding. You had to hire the courts yourself, pay for your coaches, buy the shuttlecocks. We’ve almost gone back to that. But it can be done.” What does she think of UK Sport’s strategy of prioritising medals above all else? “Do most people care that we’re second in the medal table? This medal table obsession is unhealthy. Do we need to take a step back and get enjoyment into sport again? Let’s celebrate sport, invest in grassroots and pathways to elite sport. It’s all down to the pressure bubble. If we can relax that, allow people to be themselves as well as athletes, we’d solve many problems around British sport.” Emms wrote an open letter to Katherine Grainger, the former Olympic rower and the new chair of UK Sport. She and Grainger have been friendly since they both won medals at the Athens Olympics in 2004. Emms urged Grainger to ditch UK Sport’s “Simon Cowell approach to sports funding”, where only the most predictable options are rewarded. She also warned that “the pursuit of gold and ‘win at all costs’ could be detrimental to so many.” Grainger responded positively and she and Emms “have chatted a lot”. “I love Katherine and I always learnt from her. Katherine is new to the job and has to make decisions after assessing all the information. I would hate to be in her position because I can see both sides. But I’ve been hurt by how my own sport has been so badly affected.” Emms is striving to cope with her own struggles. “I’m not living in my car but I am battling financially. There are many people in lot worse situations than me because the real world is harsh. It’s also slow. Sport is quick. If you’ve got something wrong it gets fixed. In the real world I was having meetings after meetings. Why are we having a meeting about the meeting? It ground me down.” In the real world, women in sport are constantly undermined. Emms tells a story about her mum playing in the women’s football World Cup in Mexico in 1971. “My mum was 19 and she ran to her bank where she was working, with her letter saying that she’d been selected. They said: ‘You go and you’re fired.’ So she went and had to pay for everything. Against Argentina there was a crowd of 50,000 and my mum – the Blonde Bombshell – scored this amazing goal. She went around two defenders and hit it in the top corner. Back home no one cared. Every time she tried to practise she got abuse. “Things are better for women now but sport is a man’s world. It will never be equal. But I don’t want women being compared to men in sport. Celebrate women’s sport for what it is. I’ve noticed a change in seeing the respect there was for women’s cricket at Lord’s. The World Cup final was a sell‑out. But of course there will always be sexism and sexualisation in sport. So we need more girls playing sport.” Emms is committed to helping sports professionals make a smooth transition back into mainstream society – so is she closer now to the satisfaction of a clearer work path? “Yes and no. I’ve realised no organisation is going to employ me because it’s a big risk. But I’m working on something which can benefit athletes so that when their careers are over they say: ‘That was a great part of my life but it doesn’t define me for ever. I know who I am outside of sport and I feel good.’ I think I’ve got a way of helping them do that. The main thing is I don’t want people to be in my situation. I lost my identity in badminton. I lost me. But slowly I’ve found who I am. I’m beginning to find a new way forward.” Life remains testing and, a few days later, Gail Emms loses her father, Tony. Her message on Instagram was a moving tribute to “the most stubborn man I knew, mad Norwich City fan, incredible cook, my chief supporter and taxi driver to badminton tournaments, talented carpenter and builder, who introduced me to the wonderful music of Johnny Cash. My heart is breaking. RIP Dad. xxxxx.” The spirit of Tony Emms’s daughter, however, lives on following his death on Monday. She sends me a thank you, a tear-streaked emoji and confirmation that she and her family are strong amid the sadness. Her new venture will continue and, as she said at the end of our interview, “It’s early days but watch this space.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/oct/10/deep-racial-inequities-britains-social-housing-bme","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T11:50:54Z","webTitle":"It's time to address racial injustice in Britain's social housing | Cym D'Souza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/oct/10/deep-racial-inequities-britains-social-housing-bme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/oct/10/deep-racial-inequities-britains-social-housing-bme","fields":{"headline":"It's time to address the racial injustice in Britain's social housing","bodyText":"The government’s racial disparity audit confirms the extent and persistence of racial injustice in Britain, but includes precious little on housing beyond commenting on lower levels of home ownership among ethnic minorities. What’s missing is some recognition of wider disparities in the housing system and the role of BME housing associations in confronting racial discrimination and disadvantage for more than three decades. It’s now time for action on this front. Prime minister Theresa May should ensure that a slice of the £2bn new investment in social housing announced in her conference speech last week is allocated to the BME housing sector. With perhaps 20% of the new investment, we could provide upwards of 5,000 social homes in the most deprived neighbourhoods in London, the Midlands and the north. This will not only alleviate housing need among ethnic minorities but enable BME communities to control more housing assets, advancing economic equality and boosting social mobility. The BME housing sector was created in 1986 to improve the housing circumstances of ethnic minorities. With just 17% of social lettings made to ethnic minority applicants by mainstream social landlords compared with over 66% by BME housing associations, it is clear that there remains much more to do. The government’s racial disparity audit, which confirms the extent and persistence of racial discrimination and disadvantage in Britain, comes as no surprise to those of us working in black and minority ethnic housing associations. Specialist BME housing organisations, represented by BMENational, have seen these disparities close up. We’ve witnessed the sparsity of people from ethnic minorities in senior jobs; urban disturbances in the 1980s onwards sparked by heavy-handed policing, unemployment and poor housing; institutional racism; shorter and more deprived lives; and racial stereotyping and stigma. The audit, which brings together a range of data from a variety of fields of inquiry, reveals higher unemployment rates among BME people, disparities in the housing and education systems, and health inequalities that blight BME lives and life chances. The BME housing sector was created to enable ethnic minorities more equitable access to social housing. The aim was also to offer advancement for BME board members and staff from the outset. The result has been that while a mere 7% of senior staff in the social housing sector are from an ethnic minority background, this rises to more than 80% for BME housing associations (pdf). Thirty years on, the BME housing sector remains small but crucial, with 70 organisations managing 69,000 homes, or 2% of the nation’s social housing. The sector has limited capacity to improve the housing circumstances of BME communities and we need to expand to redress racial discrimination and disadvantage in Britain’s housing system. Homelessness has grown massively in BME communities, from 19% to 36% in the past two decadesin the population. BME people are also far more likely to live in overcrowded, inadequate or fuel-poor housing than white people. And their homes less frequently include safety features; especially fire alarms. Around one quarter of BME households live in the oldest pre-1919 built homes. One in six ethnic minority families have a home with a category one hazard under the housing, health and safety rating system. BME communities are over-concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods in Britain’s cities. Deprivation has negative impacts on health, feeding into lower life expectancy and higher illness rates among ethnic minorities. On top of all this, the government’s welfare reforms disproportionately impact ethnic minorities, especially universal credit, since more BME people live in poverty, receive benefits and tax credits, and live in large families. This also makes ethnic minorities more vulnerable to bedroom tax displacement and penalties. Since 1986, BME housing associations have made a telling contribution in confronting racial disparities. Building homes supports our work in providing culturally sensitive services, aiding asylum seekers, refugees and new migrants, investing in BME communities to boost employment and training opportunities, and helping to improve health and wellbeing. Yet more concerted action will be needed to redress the deep inequities found by the racial disparity audit. Enabling the BME housing sector to realise a greater reach – possibly by government allocating a slice of the £2bn extra for social housing – would be a positive first step.

The global wardrobe of cotton and polyester (invented around 80 years ago) spells ecological disaster. World Bank statistics state that 26.3 million tonnes of cotton will be produced this year (almost triple the level of the 1960s). “If there is one single crop to be elected for its most disastrous effects on natural water flows and water quality in river basins, cotton has a good chance of winning,” says Arjen Hoekstra in The Water Footprint of Modern Consumer Society (2013). Meanwhile, according to the World Resources Institute, polyester production releases greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 185 coal-fired power plants every year. We supplement our material world with a smattering of other damaging fibres including leather, the primary driver in the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon biome. To avoid ecocide, it’s not enough to make these materials less bad. It’s time to replace them. Enter the radical disrupters coming up with alternatives, such as orange fibre and apple leather (made from food waste). Fashion Tech Lab, a venture capital fund for innovations aimed at slashing fashion’s footprint, is leading the way. How, for example, do you take the cow (with its thunderous footprint) out of a pair of leather shoes? Researchers for US startup Modern Meadows have discovered a way of biofabricating leather by brewing collagen (a protein found in cows’ skin) in a liquid form. These innovations are still some steps away from the average wardrobe, but suggest that finally fashion really is getting a modern makeover. The big picture: are we losing our shared spaces? A congested planet and the privatisation of land are explored in Is This a Wasteland?, a performance by Charlotte Spencer Projects. A choreographer, Spencer specialises in large-scale outdoor pieces and this one takes place on disused land between a historic flour mill and London City Airport – which is soon to be developed. She asks how we decide what a piece of land is worth, what makes us feel as though we belong, and what is happening to our shared spaces and communities (charlottespencerprojects.org). Well dressed: ‘peace’ silk and seashell sequins Among those in the new vanguard of ethical fashion, Italian designer Tiziano Guardini is one to watch. Recently presented with the Emerging Designer Award by Naomi Campbell at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards in Milan, Guardini was marked out for his ‘ultra chic’ look. Guardini’s winning dress was made from organic ‘peace’ silk, produced without harming the silkworms, which are usually killed in the process. He also used recycled nylon and hand-embroidered sequins made from upcycled seashells and discarded CDs. Previous award-winning designs of Guardini’s have included a dress made from pine needles and a piece made from liquorice root. His next collection will be at Milan Fashion Week in February 2018, which is part of his prize, along with a mentorship scheme with Value Retail.

In the Donbass region of east Ukraine, fighting began in 2014 and has smouldered on to this day. The towns all contain temporary military populations, made up of young men and women living in close proximity to death, far from routine and families. These “heroes” have followings on Facebook. Women want their babies. Underage girls go with the garrisoned soldiers, although in these areas allegiances are mixed and some get in trouble for befriending Ukrainian soldiers. This is territory few writers have covered, particularly from a woman’s point of view. In Natal’ya Vorozhbit’s new play, Bad Roads, teenagers sleep with the garrisoned soldiers because it makes their drab, war-torn lives more glamorous. A paramedic drives the body of her soldier-lover along wild, bad roads to his wife. The most harrowing of all is the portrayal of the relationship between a hostage-taker and his female victim, which moves unnervingly between sadism, abuse and something approaching human warmth. An acquaintance of the playwright was held hostage in Donbass by separatists. In the first years of war this happened frequently: journalists and a theatre director were among those who stumbled into imprisonment and torture and were released after months of suffering. Natal’ya uses records of kidnappings to fashion a scene of such horror and abuse it was both terrible to translate and even more terrible to think of her writing it. A threat of violence hangs over the scene, but in the end it is the power relationship between the young woman and the separatist soldier that shocks: the hostage’s instinctive attempts to humanise, to befriend, to reach out to a man brutalised by war without herself being brutalised. The dialogue is written with such force and nuance that we can instantly imagine ourselves in that situation. The potential of Stockholm syndrome is extended to all of us. Bad Roads is composed of such documentary stories about the war, carefully wound into a fictional, episodic and impressionistic study. The play tells the story of the inhabitants of the region and the combatants on both sides. It opens with the monologue of a young woman who has fallen in love with a soldier and travels to the front line with him. It’s a poignant and vulnerable monologue: after desiring the soldier for days, she finds that PTSD has left him impotent and sex is impossible, but she reflects ironically that she earns her medal, the patriotic Ukrainian pendant he fastens around her neck, by performing oral sex on him: “Conviction is contagious, did you know – you can catch it through oral sex?” The war began in Donbass soon after the 2013 pro-European, anti-government, Maidan uprising in the Ukrainian capital Kiev. Natal’ya, along with her fellow Kievans, spent days on Maidan Square, helping feed, clothe and arm protesters. She took recordings of testimony from protesters, together with other theatre practitioners, and edited the material into a verbatim-style piece of theatre, which the Royal Court produced as a reading in 2014. Already clear in this earlier work was her commitment to real stories, told by the real protagonists, and from the start this documentary approach has had political importance: as relations between Ukraine and Russia soured, Russia’s use of propaganda and fake news to shape opinion and recast history has been monolithic and constant. Natal’ya’s commitment to oral history as drama has, as a result, become a political act of vital importance in the information war. Over the last couple of years Natal’ya has worked on various cultural projects in the ATO (the “anti-terrorist operation zone”), the area re-taken by the Ukrainian army during the war. These include a project with local teenagers and a script for a film about the siege of Donetsk airport. Much of the material for Bad Roads comes from these documentary projects, including harrowing accounts by Ukrainian soldiers under siege at Donetsk airport. One of the characters retells how a group of Ukrainian soldiers sat out the night and waited for the separatists to begin their final bombardment at dawn. There was a rumour they were going to use the powerful Soviet Buratino multiple rocket launcher, and the Ukrainians under siege knew that they had no hope of surviving the attack if they did: the Buratino is a weapon of mass destruction, laying waste to everything in the area. So they sat and waited, washing with wet wipes and phoning their wives and families. One soldier sat on the phone to his daughter on the other side of Ukraine, helping her with her homework. When dawn came the separatists attacked in tanks and without Buratino and the men were ecstatic; their lives were saved. Natal’ya travelled to towns in the area to work on theatre projects with schools. She asked teenagers to write and deliver short monologues about their lives and many of these voices have found their way into Bad Roads, including the poignant tale of a child in a basement during the bombardment of a town in the Donbass region: the family spent a lot of time in the basement during air raids, and to calm their little girl they told her the explosions were fireworks. Every time the little girl heard an explosion she would shout “Yay!”. Donbass is a modern war: Ukrainians crowdfunded for uniforms and Kevlar helmets for their sons and relatives, military heroes reported back on Facebook to their large followings of admirers, soldiers watch TV on plasma screens in their temporary barracks. But it is an ancient war, too: bloody and cruel, affecting no one more than the communities in the east who have endured bombs, rockets and weeks hiding in basements, whose basic desire is to survive and to have some form of human life again: children, vegetable gardens, community. For whom politics is a baleful word and all governments are now hateful. By stressing the sexual and the female in her study of war, Natal’ya haunts us all with the power of conflict to warp modern society. War, as she explained in the rehearsal room, returns us to the most intense feelings of hate and love. Love in war happens against a backdrop of bombs falling, deaths and mutilations, and desire comes inappropriately, when the pity of war is supposed to be uppermost in the mind. Sex in war cares nothing for the taste, the niceties of civilisation, it makes us feel sick to hear of body fluids spilled in sex in such close proximity to body fluids spilled in death. As the central character in the play says of her soldier love, “You’re all jealous, but at the same time you’re cringing”. It’s raw and dark, like the grief of a woman who has lost her man and who drinks and propositions another male comrade “just as a man might”. It reverses sexual roles and takes strange expression in the brutalised mind, which relieves itself in sexual force, but also longs for solace. The extremes of desire in war are equal only to the extremes of bloodlust and depravity. What is unique about this play is that it is written by a woman, from the point of view of the sexual “object”, and it unflinchingly describes the situation of women at war. It charts a careful line round notions of victimhood and complicity. Hardly anyone writes from this point of view. In its combination of documentary and fiction and its point of view it reminds me of the work of Nobel prize winner Svetlana Alexievich. The writings of women from this region should be attended to, because they are carefully documenting a terrible reality in the face of increasingly artful fakery. Translating the play has brought home just how little separates us from these people at war, just how frail our civilisation is. I’ve been working on the play with Natal’ya and with the Royal Court for more than a year and in that time in the UK we have lived through a referendum and an increase in hate crime and violence. While translating a rewrite of the hostage scene, I found the kidnapper’s voice coming more fluently to me, I could feel him in English in a way I hadn’t done previously: “Democracy is a cunning God, those fucking snowflakes thought it up.” Bad Roads is at the Royal Court, London, 15 November to 23 December.

The reasons for this surge are numerous. Risk aversion was a strong factor in the years immediately after the Baby P case. Judges made new case law to tighten up on what they saw as drift in voluntary care, and this brought more cases into court. The extra focus, including in Ofsted inspections, led to better reviewing practice and calling time on unsatisfactory levels of emotional harm and neglect for vulnerable children – these are the two types of poor parenting that explain the bulk of the increase. Years of austerity have also led to early help being less available, with families coming to attention too late to be helped to step back from the edge of care. The child population has been increasing by a small percentage every year. What matters most, though, is how these various factors intersect at the local level. Local decision-making about thresholds and about what happens to children on the edge of care varies dramatically; regional variations are widening. This year the rise has levelled off, probably because there is no big new national driver to restoke the upward trend. It may also be because historic cases have, for the most part, been reviewed. There are two alternative scenarios for the sector. First, that councils have prioritised child protection and children in care services and will continue to do so, including continued cross-subsidising from other local services. In this scenario, children’s social care will continue as one of the main public protection duties of the local state. There is a lot of success to build on. We deal with cases much quicker than nearly all our international neighbours. We foster three in four children in care, whereas in most countries the majority of children are only given residential options. More children do well in our care system than was the case historically. And all bar a handful of the children who come into care through the courts meet the criteria for needing to be in care. The other scenario has children’s social care being given the same priority, while facing a financial cliffedge. The underlying assumption is that government will intervene just before the point of service collapse to protect minimum standards in any particular area or region. In truth, any intervention and investment would have to begin well before a collapse, given the lead-in time necessary to make an impact on recruitment and service provision is between one and three years, if handled well. It is probably an unlikely scenario, given current public policy preoccupations All of us working in children’s social care have a responsibility to ensure the system is harmonised with the demographic, social and economic changes in society. Here is the service mix I think essential for every local system to support the next generation of children in care and those on the edge of care. A local service to disrupt the repeated removal of children from the same parent (one in four care applications), and with six in 10 of these parents having been abused or neglected themselves and four in 10 having been in care, to stem inter-generational harm and to promote reversibility. A local care enterers’ service, working with young people on the edge of care to try to halt the rising numbers of adolescents in the care population. A local therapeutic support service to meet the needs of the growing number of children and young people who require help to recover from trauma experienced at home. Workforce development to build the competent, proud and supported care workforce of the future. This work is “emotional labour” and those providing it need help too. A local care system redesign to put more capacity on the frontline and to re-position child protection services and the care system as one of the major public health issues of our time. Most services, whether successful or failing, are best understood and acted on locally by partners working together. A good national framework supports self-improvement programmes – whether local, regional or national – by updating policy and legislation to keep pace with social trends. Certain service developments could be mandatory where the evidence base is compelling; and some services can only be scoped and developed on a national basis, such as secure accommodation. The numbers of children in care are likely to stay high for a generation at least, hence the need for a “new deal” to future-proof services for the most vulnerable children in the country.

Jennifer Westacott will call for a new education funding system in a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, warning that the current system distorts student choices between university or vocational education. Students would get a new lifelong learning account, that would give them both a subsidy and access to an income contingent loan scheme. Under the scheme a new national body would set the level of subsidies for courses, meaning some university students could face higher fees and lower subsidies from the government while vocational students could receive a higher subsidy. A new income contingent loan scheme would replace the current system in which vocational education and training students can access up to $15,000 in loans while university students can borrow six times as much. In notes of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Westacott says she wants to “restore the status of our neglected [vocational education and training] system”. Westacott will say that tertiary education funding is “distorted, creates the wrong incentives and is basically unfair”, citing the fact that students in vocational training get less government support than university students in many industries. She argues registered nursing students at university get a federal subsidy of $40,000 while the subsidy for enrolled nurse students in vocational training “depends entirely on where they live and the provider they choose”. Westacott suggests it “stands to reason” students will pick the more heavily subsidised higher education qualification “even if they were better suited to the [vocational] course”, which was not in their interest or the national interest. Westacott argues the bias in funding adds to a cultural bias in favour of university at the expense of vocational education in a system “overly focused on credentialising too many things as university qualifications”. Westacott suggested the reforms could be achieved within the current funding envelope of $20bn, raising the prospect that the vocational sector could be pitted against universities for the current allocation of funds. She said it would “require compromise from everyone’s point of view”. The higher education policy proposal comes ahead of a parliamentary sitting week in which the government’s proposed $2.8bn cuts in higher education funding and fee increases are due for debate. The bill would impose a two-year 2.5% efficiency dividend on universities, lower the Help debt repayment threshold to $42,000, and increase fees by a cumulative total of 7.5% by 2021. The bill is opposed by Labor, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team, suggesting the government does not have the numbers to pass it. On Monday NXT’s education spokeswoman, Rebekha Sharkie, reiterated opposition to the current proposal and called on the government to undertake a “comprehensive” review of higher education, including the vocational sector and apprenticeships. On schools funding, Westacott argued that Australia should stop “focusing solely on the quantum of funding rather than the outcomes we actually want to achieve”. The Turnbull government increased schools funding by $23.5bn over 10 years with its Gonski 2.0 policy, as well as instituting a review by David Gonski about how to achieve better outcomes regardless of funding inputs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/tony-abbotts-climate-change-speech-loopy-says-labor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T08:52:29Z","webTitle":"Tony Abbott's climate change speech 'loopy', says Labor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/tony-abbotts-climate-change-speech-loopy-says-labor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/tony-abbotts-climate-change-speech-loopy-says-labor","fields":{"headline":"Tony Abbott's climate change speech 'loopy', says Labor","bodyText":"Tony Abbott has “left the realm of the merely destructive and entered the realm of the loopy”, Labor says, after his provocative speech arguing climate change was “probably doing good”. The deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said on Tuesday Abbott’s speech to a group of climate sceptics in London was “actually just weird stuff from the former prime minister” at a time when the government was trying to settle its energy policy. While Abbott’s London outburst forced government colleagues into various acts of public diplomacy on Tuesday, one fellow conservative, the Sydney Liberal MP Craig Kelly, and chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy, defended Abbott’s rationale. “The point that Tony makes is 100% correct, and the chief scientist has actually confirmed this, the chief scientist has said, no matter what we do here in Australia with our emissions, it’s not going to change the weather, it’s not going to change the temperature of the globe, it’s not going to prevent bad storms,” Kelly told Sky News. The government this week has continued to signal that it will not pursue the clean energy target modelled by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market published mid-year. Abbott has opposed the Finkel recommendation from the outset, branding further subsidies for renewables “unconscionable”, and, alongside fellow government conservative George Christensen, has threatened to cross the floor in the event the government attempts to legislate it. With the government working to finalise its policy and present it during the final parliamentary sitting weeks before the summer break, the energy minister Josh Frydenberg used an energy summit on Monday to argue low emissions technologies may not need further subsidies once the current renewable energy target winds down after 2020. That signal has rattled industry players, who had assumed the government was working on a modified version of the Finkel recommendation. As industry alarm about the government’s policy direction intensified, the chief scientist publicly defended his mechanism as being important to provide investor certainty. While the clean energy target has broad ranging support from industry, the energy sector and state governments, the heavily contested internal dynamics of the Coalition renders the Finkel recommendation hard to deliver. The government’s new energy policy is expected to include an overhaul of the national electricity market rules to provide incentives to bring more dispatchable power in the market. While Finkel’s target has clearly hit an internal roadblock, the policy is expected to include mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy. Industry sources also expect the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, to be given renewed funding. A range of groups, from the business lobby to environmentalists, want the major parties to reach a bipartisan agreement on energy and climate policy and end a wretched decade of partisan argument. As the government is moving to finalise its policy, Labor has increased its public overtures that it is prepared to deal with the Coalition in the event it can produce a credible policy. But Labor has also grabbed Abbott’s public frolic to argue Malcolm Turnbull is not in charge of the Coalition’s policy formulation. Labor’s treasury spokesman, Chris Bowen, said on Tuesday Abbott’s intervention underscored the “catastrophic failure” of Turnbull “to stand up to the climate deniers in his party”. Bowen said Abbott was “an effective handbrake on the elected prime minister, stopping any sensible policy progress when it comes to climate change and energy”. He said Labor has not given the chief scientist the task of drafting a policy settlement for climate and energy, that request had come from the government. “Alan Finkel has delivered a very good report which says here’s a way forward,” Bowen said. “We’ve got this remarkable circumstance with the opposition of the day willing to be bipartisan but the government can’t reach an internal partisan position. “We can’t negotiate with a puff of smoke. “We need the government to have a position so that we can reach that policy certainty. We don’t have that because frankly Malcolm Turnbull is just not up to it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/14/beauty-spot-getting-the-just-kissed-look","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Beauty spot: getting the just kissed look","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/14/beauty-spot-getting-the-just-kissed-look","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/14/beauty-spot-getting-the-just-kissed-look","fields":{"headline":"Beauty spot: getting the just kissed look","bodyText":"Looking like you’ve just been for a snog behind the bike sheds is this season’s lip look.

Some remainers have responded by suggesting that the people were deceived by the false arguments of the Brexiteers – as if referendum campaigns were jury trials in which the witnesses are on oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Others have said that the people did not really know what they were doing. After the 1953 uprising in East Germany, the playwright Bertolt Brecht sardonically remarked that, instead of the people dismissing the government, the government should dismiss the people so as to secure a new and more acquiescent population. Other remainers, such as Alan Duncan, a Conservative minister of state at the Foreign Office, argue that there should be a threshold for constitutional change – either a minimum turnout requirement or a supermajority requirement – perhaps two-thirds – before change is implemented. The Polish constitution provides that a referendum outcome shall only be valid if turnout exceeds 50%. That, of course, would not have altered anything in the Brexit referendum since turnout was 72%, the highest in any nationwide election or referendum since the 1992 general election. The campaign aroused the enthusiasm of those who had not voted since the time of John Major. For, by contrast with a general election, every vote counted. So voters in Hartlepool and Sunderland, safe Labour areas, had a real incentive to participate. However, a 50% turnout threshold would have prevented the introduction of a directly elected mayor of London, for the 72% yes vote in the 1998 referendum was secured on a turnout of just 35%. In Britain, qualified majorities have been required only in the devolution referendums in Scotland and Wales in 1979. In these referendums, as well as a majority yes vote, a 40% majority of the electorate was needed for parliament to implement the devolution legislation. In Wales, devolution was rejected by a four-to-one majority, and so the threshold was irrelevant. But in Scotland, on a 64% turnout, 33% of the electorate voted for devolution while 31% voted against. The government could not proceed with devolution even though a majority had voted for it. Many Scots argued that the rules had been rigged against them, since there had been no threshold requirement in the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Community. The referendum strengthened the Scottish sense of grievance which continues to poison relations with England. Paradoxically, thresholds are likely to discourage turnout since a no voter might assume that an abstention is equivalent to a no vote. That would of course be the case with a requirement such as that in the Polish constitution. But it would not necessarily be the case with the type of threshold requirement in the devolution referendums. Suppose that, in the Scottish referendum, there had been an 80% turnout with 41% voting yes and 39% voting no, but that one-quarter of the 20% who abstained had done so in the belief that abstention was equivalent to a no vote. Then, the true strength of the nos would have been 44%, not 39%. The threshold would have confused voters and yielded an outcome opposed to their intentions. There is, however, a case for a threshold in Northern Ireland, divided as it is between two communities. Here a simple majority, composed entirely of unionists, would be unacceptable to nationalists. A majority in both communities is needed to secure legitimacy. But the threshold should not be in the form of a percentage of the electorate as in Scotland, but either a qualified majority – perhaps 70% – or alternatively a minimum turnout requirement as in Poland – though, in Northern Ireland, it would need to be higher than 50% – possibly 65%. There is also a case for a minimum turnout in local referendums, where the average turnout in local elections is under 40%, so as to prevent vociferous local minorities imposing their preferences on the rest, the very antithesis of the purpose of a referendum which is to allow the majority to rule. But all these arguments for turnout requirements and qualified majorities, together with suggestions that voters did not know what they were doing, evade the crucial point which is that the remainers, of whom I was one, lost the argument. The remainers now have a chance, albeit a slim one, to recoup their position by following the advice of Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, and campaigning for a referendum on the deal negotiated by the government with the European Union. But, if the remainers do secure this second chance, they must not fumble it again. They must learn to respect the sovereignty of the people rather than denigrating or seeking to subvert it. • Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King’s College, London.

Denis Villeneuve’s film begins with £5.21m from 634 cinemas for the weekend, and £6.07m including Thursday. Site average is a robust £8,223, or £9,577 if previews are added in. Comparisons with the original Blade Runner are not possible since Ridley Scott’s 1982 film predates the birth of official box office data gathering in the UK. (Various rereleases of Blade Runner, including a Director’s Cut and a Final Cut, have collectively earned £1.93m.) Instead, analysts are turning to other decades-later reboots for box office comparisons. For example, Mad Max: Fury Road began in May 2015 with £4.54m including £639,000 in previews. Ridley Scott’s Prometheus, which took some of its creative DNA from the Alien franchise, kicked off in June 2012 with £6.24m. Blade Runner 2049 gives Ryan Gosling his second big hit of the year, after La La Land, which debuted in January with £6.60m, including £944,000 in previews. Previously, major box office success had eluded the actor, thanks to his preference for indie movies such as Drive (£3.04m lifetime) and The Place Beyond the Pines (£3.43m). The Notebook (2004), now cited by fans as one of the great romantic weepies, reached only £1.21m. Before 2017, Gosling’s biggest UK hit was Gangster Squad, with £5.25m. Including supporting roles, he also has The Big Short (£6.03m). The runner-up: Kingsman The arrival of Blade Runner 2049 sucked up a huge number of screens, to say nothing of the attention of audiences, and virtually every existing film in the marketplace fell by at least 50%. In that context, a decline of 50% for Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a decent result – Matthew Vaughn’s film added £2.11m for a 19-day tally of £19.46m. The title will soon become the 16th this year to pass £20m at UK cinemas, joining – in order of box office merit – Beauty and the Beast, Dunkirk, Despicable Me 3, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, It, Spider-Man: Homecoming, La La Land, Fast &amp; Furious 8, Sing, The Boss Baby, The Lego Batman Movie, Logan, Fifty Shades Darker, Wonder Woman and War for the Planet of the Apes. Dunkirk sets new Nolan record The weekend saw Dunkirk reach £56.5m, overtaking The Dark Knight Rises to become Christopher Nolan’s biggest ever UK hit. Dunkirk has significantly punched above its weight in the UK – which is not that surprising given the very British storyline and characters. Globally, Dunkirk has reached $522m, which compares with $1.08bn for The Dark Knight Rises and just over $1bn for The Dark Knight. Annual trend: first three quarters Data gatherer comScore has issued its latest monthly update showing box office for the first three quarters of the year – in fact, since it’s a weekly model, for the first 39 weeks of the year from 6 January to 5 October. Total UK and Ireland box office for the period is £1.01bn, which is up 6% on the same period in 2016. Box office was 18% up on 2016 at the end of the first quarter and 12% up on 2016 at the end of the second, so the strong lead has been gradually eroded as the year has worn on. It’s possible that the trend could continue and 2017 end roughly even with 2016, but strong titles in the fourth quarter – including Thor: Ragnarok, Justice League, Paddington 2 and Star Wars: The Last Jedi – make that outcome unlikely. The market Thanks to the arrival of Blade Runner 2049, box office overall rises by 13% from the previous session, but is 21% down on the equivalent weekend from 2016, when The Girl on the Train landed impressively at the top spot. Among this coming weekend’s new releases, look for two titles to do most of the heavy lifting: The Snowman, starring Michael Fassbender and adapted from the Jo Nesbø bestseller; and The Lego Ninjago Movie, which already racked up some decent preview numbers on Saturday and Sunday.

Though currently fighting for second place behind 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz of the centre-right Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Freedom party has managed to dictate the agenda of a campaign centred largely around immigration and fears of radical Islam, and will receive a last-stretch boost from a “dirty campaigning” row between the traditional centre parties. Neither Kurz nor incumbent chancellor Christian Kern of the centre-left SPÖ have ruled out entering a coalition with the Freedom party, whose current leader Heinz-Christian Strache could become the first European politician with a neo-Nazi background to sit in government since the second world war. If it enters government, the Freedom party wants to deny migrants access to welfare payments, introduce Swiss-style referendums and push for Austria to join the Visegrád group of central European states whose borders overlap with the 19th-century Austro-Hungarian empire. FPÖ politician Norbert Hofer, who was beaten in the race for the Austrian presidency by Green-backed Alexander van der Bellen in December 2016, will be pushed by the party as a candidate for the foreign ministry. Founded by a former Nazi functionary and SS member after the end of the second world war, the Freedom party became the first rightwing populist party to form part of a government in postwar Europe when its late leader Jörg Haider entered a coalition with the conservative ÖVP in 2000 – a that which was at the time met with outrage and economic sanctions from Israel and several EU member states. A split in 2005 and Haider’s death in a car crash three years later appeared to have signalled the end of the anti-immigration party, yet 12 years later FPÖ officials are not only confident of surpassing their best results of the Haider years but have managed to turn Austria into what political scientists call a “net exporter of rightwing populism”, pioneering strategies later adopted by far-right parties elsewhere in Europe. Under the leadership of Strache, who was arrested by German police as a 20-year-old for taking part in a march organised by a banned neo-Nazi movement modelled on the Hitler Youth, the FPÖ has professionalised its methods and switched its campaign from broad anti-foreigner sentiment to a more focused anti-Islam rhetoric as early as 2006. For this year’s national elections, the party produced not conventional campaign ads but a short sitcom series called “The Hubers”, which voices fears about welfare tourism and overcrowding to the sound of laughter without ever explicitly mentioning immigration. “In terms of strategy, the FPÖ have had an excellent campaign,” said Thomas Hofer, an Austrian communication consultant. “They have managed to go on the attack without looking like they are going over the top.” Kurz’s candidacy – which has in itself been quite rightwing – appears to have dented the Freedom party’s fortunes. The foreign minister prides himself on having brought an end to the refugee crisis by closing the Balkan route in 2016 and vows to reform the asylum system so that claimants in the future are processed via “rescue centres” outside the European Union. Promises to fight political Islam feature heavily in Kurz’s manifesto. Having led the polls by a considerable margin since spring 2015, the Freedom party was leapfrogged by the ÖVP and the SPÖ after Kurz announced his run for chancellor in the summer. But political observers argue that this has only made it easier for the rightwing populists to frame Austrian political debate. “If they had been top of the polls at the start of the campaign, it would have been a nightmare for the FPÖ – they had no experience with that position. But sitting in third place has allowed them to dictate the agenda,” Thomas Hofer said. The ÖVP and the SPÖ, who have governed Austria in a “grand coalition” for the last 10 years, have further aided the Freedom party’s cause, argued Nina Horaczek, a journalist for Viennese weekly Der Falter and author of a biography of the Freedom party’s leader. She said: “At first, the two centre parties ignored Strache. Then they demonised him. But eventually they adopted his positions. That has dented their credibility. And the problem is that if they tack to the right, Strache can always go one step further.” While Kurz has pushed for fines for migrants who refuse to take part in integration courses at schools, the FPÖ’s manifesto demands scrapping integration courses for asylum seekers altogether. In the case of Austria’s Social Democrats, credibility was further undermined by the revelation that an adviser working for Christian Kern’s party had created a group of websites churning out xenophobic and antisemitic conspiracy theories in order to discredit Sebastian Kurz in the eyes of far-right supporters. The revelations around the so-called Schmutzkübel (dirt bucket) affair have put the SPÖ on the back foot and unable to attack the Freedom party for their own negative campaigning and use of antisemitic rhetoric. On his Facebook page, Strache has repeatedly linked to articles which identify Hungarian-American financier George Soros as the shadowy instigator behind the refugee crisis or sanctions against Russia, similar to those reportedly created by the disgraced SPÖ adviser. Observers such as political scientist Christoph Hofinger believe that the Austrian left had failed to take the right measures to stop the return of the rightwing populists even before the “dirty campaigning” affair. “Alexander Van der Bellen showed that you can win an election with a campaign built around a notion of inclusive, pro-European national identity,” said Hofinger, director of consulting firm SORA. “But the parties on the left never seriously tried to understand how a Green candidate managed to get over 50% of the vote.” In a TV debate between Strache and Kern on Monday, the Social Democrat conceded that Austria should have extended restrictions for jobseekers from new eastern European member states beyond 2011. “Kern could have framed his answer differently,” said Hofinger. “He could have pointed out that the tourism industry in Tyrol or the care system would have collapsed without migration from the East.” In the same debate, Kern was asked if he would consider entering a coalition with Strache’s FPÖ. “As this debate has shown, we are worlds apart,” replied the incumbent chancellor, without explicitly answering the question. Once the cameras had been switched off, Kern and his political opponent Strache disappeared into a hidden corner of the studio’s balcony, for a cigarette and a long chat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/10/tim-cahill-double-keeps-australia-alive-with-extra-time-win-over-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T11:40:00Z","webTitle":"Tim Cahill double keeps Australia alive with extra-time win over Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/tim-cahill-double-keeps-australia-alive-with-extra-time-win-over-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/10/tim-cahill-double-keeps-australia-alive-with-extra-time-win-over-syria","fields":{"headline":"Tim Cahill double keeps Australia alive with extra-time win over Syria","bodyText":"They appear hellbent on making qualification for the World Cup as difficult as possible, but at least the Socceroos’ hopes of reaching Russia are still alive. After falling behind to an early hammer blow at ANZ Stadium, Ange Postecoglou’s side recovered to beat Syria 2-1 by the skin of their teeth in extra-time and book a place in a final qualifying play-off. The bad news for followers of Australian football is that, inevitably, another gut-wrenching 180 minutes of tension awaits. Tim Cahill, restored to the starting lineup having been left on the bench for last week’s first leg in Malaysia, sparked the revival early in the first half and then sealed the win deep in extra-time, both with trademark headers. The second, in the 109th minute, was the talismanic forward’s 50th for his country. You could say it was one of the more important goals of his international career. “He’s just a freak,” Postecoglou said of Cahill. “I can’t think of when he last played 90 minutes, let alone 120. He’s got real belief in himself. He’s just a unique, extraordinary individual. He led from the front today.” It might have been a different story. Omar Al Soma, last week’s Syrian goalscorer in the 1-1 draw that set up such a tense game in Sydney, had stunned the home side inside six minutes and prompted a wave of early panic inside the stadium. Even after Cahill had helped ease those fears, Al Soma very nearly struck a decisive blow with a free-kick that struck Mathew Ryan’s upright in the final minute. A 2-2 draw on the night would have sent Syria through. Such are the margins. “I had belief in the players and in what we do,” Postecoglou said. “I have real conviction in the way we do things and part of that process is that we know we wear teams down and they have to work awfully hard to stay with us. That’s the kind of game we’re built for and we keep going right until the end and make sure when the whistle goes, we’re the ones still standing.” Another two-legged tie, likely against Panama or Honduras of the Concacaf region, in November is the Socceroos’ prize for a heart-stopping victory that puts Syria out of the running. For Postecoglou, who was shouldering intense pressure going into this game, his tenure continues for at least another two games. Postecoglou is his own man and has always done things his own way. Tuesday was no different, with his team selection raising eyebrows when it was announced hours before the kick-off: out went Aaron Mooy, last week’s standout player in Malacca, and in came Tom Rogic. Cahill, who turns 38 in December, got the nod to lead the line while Brad Smith, who endured a torrid time against Japan at the end of August, and James Troisi also started. It was a statement of attacking intent but the Socceroos could not have got off to a worse start. With just five minutes on the clock, Mark Milligan lost the ball cheaply in the middle of the park and Syria made him – and Australia – pay dearly. As the visitors broke at pace Al Soma received the ball from Tamer Hag Mohamad and kept his cool, finishing astutely past Ryan. Postecoglou later said it was a “dumb goal to concede”. Cue delirium among those in the 42,136-strong crowd sporting white, red and black. The main section of Syrian fans, mostly assembled behind the goal at the opposite end, had already made their presence felt. Against a complex political backdrop and divided loyalties towards their conflict-ravaged country, the national anthem was sung with gusto by those inside the stadium – outside protests against Bashar al-Assad’s regime had been staged before kick-off. Their counterparts in gold were left stunned. This was not going how their night was supposed to pan out. To their credit, the Socceroos responded well to the early blow and, off the back of what was superficially a moment of misfortune, the tide turned in the hosts’ favour. Smith, having picked up what looked like a hip injury, could play no further part; enter Mooy in his place, to cap his exile at a touch over 10 minutes. The equaliser came soon after. And it was who else but Cahill to haul his side out of the hole they had dug for themselves. Matthew Leckie delivered the kind of cross that Cahill dreams of – his bread and butter – and he rose, loosely marked, to power a header past Ibrahim Alma. With Mooy back in the lineup, Australia became a more potent attacking threat and the Huddersfield midfielder’s deft touch brought a calming influence to the Socceroos’ midfield, which began to impose itself on the game. Troisi stung Alma’s fingers before he ran onto a delightful reverse pass from Mooy to cross for Cahill, whose goalbound effort ricocheted wide. Alma was tested again, this time by Leckie, Rogic’s snap shot on the turn bounced wide of the mark and a handball shout was turned down as half-time approached but despite their ascendency, the Socceroos went in at the break locked at 1-1 – the only result that would have prompted a period of extra-time. The chances continued to come after the break, but frustration mounted as the Syrians’ defence repelled the hosts. Leckie saw a header bounce the wrong side of an upright, another Cahill header was easy for Alma to claim and the keeper made a stunning save to deny Rogic, who then saw a curling effort drift wide of the post. Tempers threatened to boil over as the Syrians, apparently happy to prolong the game, sought to run the clock down; the quality of the game suffered but with two minutes left, Rogic emerged from the scrappiness to get a shot off. It was deflected wide and with that any hope – from either side – of ending the tie in regulation time evaporated. Extra-time – and yet more mileage on the journey to Russia – beckoned. Syria’s hopes were dealt a blow early in the first period of extra-time as they were reduced to 10 men after Mahmoud Al Mawas was cautioned for a second time – for a challenge on Leckie – and the manner of his departure from the pitch only served to reinforce the theory the visitors fancied their chances more in a shootout. To say the midfielder took his time in reaching the touchline would be the understatement of the night. Still, there was opportunity for Syria to snag a winner on the break, and had Al Soma not dragged his shot wide midway through the first half of extra-time, things could have been different. Likewise, had Nikita Rukavytsya’s volley from a wonderful Mooy cross not been diverted over the bar. But it was left to Cahill, so often Australia’s saviour, to deliver the knockout blow, bring up a personal milestone, avert the lottery of spot-kicks and keep his side in the running to reach the World Cup finals. Not bad for a night’s work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/10/football-transfer-rumour-mill-mijat-gacinovic-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T08:13:58Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Mijat Gacinovic to Manchester United?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/football-transfer-rumour-mill-mijat-gacinovic-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/10/football-transfer-rumour-mill-mijat-gacinovic-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Mijat Gacinovic to Manchester United?","bodyText":"Today’s big news is that the Mirror has cracked the mystery surrounding José Mourinho’s presence at Serbia’s World Cup qualifier against Austria. Surely he wouldn’t have gone all that way just to keep an eye on Nemanja Matic, who he can keep a perfectly good eye on most of the time without so much as leaving Manchester? No he was not: he was checking out Matic’s team-mate Mijat Gacinovic, the 22-year-old Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder, who the paper reports, “has been identified as one of the most exciting young talents currently operating in the Bundesliga”. Bayern Munich also had a representative at the game, and Arsenal had a scout at Serbia’s two previous internationals, so if Manchester United want to actually sign him they should be ready to rumble. Brighton also had scouts at the match, though they aren’t likely to compete for Gacinovic – they’re interested in the Newcastle outcast Aleksandar Mitrovic, with whose constant disciplinary tightrope-walking Rafael Benítez has finally lost patience. Manchester City want to sign yet another full-back, says the Sun, to help them cope with Benjamin Mendy’s absence through injury. Never mind that Mendy is expected to be back in four months and the transfer window opens in three, meaning the new signing would become essentially redundant within weeks of his arrival. Anyway, they fancy Napoli’s Faouzi Ghoulam, who is out of contract next summer and could thus, they speculate, be snapped up for a paltry £3m. Conveniently, “City are hoping to open talks with Napoli next week when they face each other in the Champions League”. Paris Saint-Germain want to buy a goalkeeper next summer and have drawn up a shortlist of potential recruits. A very short list. There are just two names upon it, reports le10sport.com, and they are Atlético Madrid’s Jan Oblak and Manchester United’s David de Gea. The French club believes either could be purchased next year without breaking financial fair play rules, so long as someone takes Javier Pastore and Ángel Di María off their hands. Di María could move to China as early as January, apparently. Talking of PSG players, Real Madrid have located “the new Kylian Mbappé”, reports Don Balón, and they are not going to let this one slip through their fingers like they did the last. This one is Dimitri Oberlin, currently on loan at Basel from Red Bull Salzburg (confusingly, the new Kylian Mbappé is some 14 months older than the old Kylian Mbappé). “The young pearl of European football scored two of his side’s five goals against Benfica in their last Champions League game,” Don Balón reports. “Of course, several of the biggest clubs in Europe are already monitoring him. But Florentino Pérez hopes to be the first to move.” The Lazio centre-back Stefan de Vrij appears to be attempting a BorisJohnsonesque have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too-style negotiation with the Italian club. Lazio want to bind him to a new contract, and have offered a healthy pay rise which the defender is minded to accept. However, they also want to set the player’s release clause to something in the off-putting neighbourhood of £40m, but he wants it to be just half that “as he would still be interested in joining a big club in the summer”, according to Calciomercato. Thus he hopes to end up with all the benefits of a bumper new contract, with all the advantages of a miserly old one, the cunning old dog. This news is particularly pertinent to Liverpool, one of the big clubs – along with Juventus and Atlético Madrid – who have been linked with the 25-year-old. Across town at Everton, they are mulling over a move for the giant Sporting Lisbon striker Bas Dost. “Ronald Koeman is determined to sign a forward when the transfer window opens in January and has held a long-term interest in his fellow Dutchman,” reports ESPN. Finally, the Italian FA is hoping to convince Antonio Conte to abandon Chelsea and return to the helm of his national team next summer, the Express exclusively reports. “Express Sport understands influential figures within the FIGC want Conte back in charge after Gian Pero Ventura failed to impress during their World Cup qualifying campaign,” it says. “Milan are also keen on Conte and are ready to make him an offer this summer, but Chelsea want the popular Italian to stay.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/news-blog/2017/oct/09/bitcoin-price-bubble-government-cryptocurrency","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T12:00:41Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin's price bubble will burst under government pressure | Kenneth Rogoff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/news-blog/2017/oct/09/bitcoin-price-bubble-government-cryptocurrency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/news-blog/2017/oct/09/bitcoin-price-bubble-government-cryptocurrency","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin's price bubble will burst under government pressure","bodyText":"Is the cryptocurrency bitcoin the biggest bubble in the world today, or a great investment bet on the cutting edge of new-age financial technology? My best guess is that in the long run, the technology will thrive, but that the price of bitcoin will collapse. If you haven’t been following the bitcoin story, its price is up 600% over the past 12 months, and 1,600% in the past 24 months. At over $4,200 (as of 5 October), a single unit of the virtual currency is now worth more than three times an ounce of gold. Some bitcoin evangelists see it going far higher in the next few years. What happens from here will depend a lot on how governments react. Will they tolerate anonymous payment systems that facilitate tax evasion and crime? Will they create digital currencies of their own? Another key question is how successfully bitcoin’s numerous “alt-coin” competitors can penetrate the market. In principle, it is supremely easy to clone or improve on bitcoin’s technology. What is not so easy is to duplicate bitcoin’s established lead in credibility and the large ecosystem of applications that have built up around it. For now, the regulatory environment remains a free-for-all. China’s government, concerned about the use of bitcoin in capital flight and tax evasion, has recently banned bitcoin exchanges. Japan, on the other hand, has enshrined bitcoin as legal tender, in an apparent bid to become the global centre of fintech. The United States is taking tentative steps to follow Japan in regulating fintech, though the endgame is far from clear. Importantly, bitcoin does not need to win every battle to justify a sky-high price. Japan, the world’s third largest economy, has an extraordinarily high currency-to-income ratio (roughly 20%), so bitcoin’s success there is a major triumph. In Silicon Valley, drooling executives are both investing in bitcoin and pouring money into competitors. After bitcoin, the most important is Ethereum. The sweeping, Amazon-like ambition of Ethereum is to allow its users to employ the same general technology to negotiate and write “smart contracts” for just about anything. As of early October, Ethereum’s market capitalisation stood at $28bn, versus $72bn for bitcoin. Ripple, a platform championed by the banking sector to slash transaction costs for interbank and overseas transfers, is a distant third at $9bn. Behind the top three are dozens of fledgling competitors. Most experts agree that the ingenious technology behind virtual currencies may have broad applications for cybersecurity, which currently poses one of the biggest challenges to the stability of the global financial system. For many developers, the goal of achieving a cheaper, more secure payments mechanism has supplanted bitcoin’s ambition of replacing dollars. But it is folly to think that bitcoin will ever be allowed to supplant central-bank-issued money. It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies; indeed, this would be desirable. But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity. Of course, as I note in my recent book on past, present, and future currencies, governments that issue large-denomination bills also risk aiding tax evasion and crime. But cash at least has bulk, unlike virtual currency. It will be interesting to see how the Japanese experiment evolves. The government has indicated that it will force bitcoin exchanges to be on the lookout for criminal activity and to collect information on deposit holders. Still, one can be sure that global tax evaders will seek ways to acquire bitcoin anonymously abroad and then launder their money through Japanese accounts. Carrying paper currency in and out of a country is a major cost for tax evaders and criminals; by embracing virtual currencies, Japan risks becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven – with the bank secrecy laws baked into the technology. Were bitcoin stripped of its near-anonymity, it would be hard to justify its current price. Perhaps bitcoin speculators are betting that there will always be a consortium of rogue states allowing anonymous bitcoin usage, or even state actors such as North Korea that will exploit it. Would the price of bitcoin drop to zero if governments could perfectly observe transactions? Perhaps not. Even though bitcoin transactions require an exorbitant amount of electricity, with some improvements, bitcoin might still beat the 2% fees the big banks charge on credit and debit cards. Finally, it is hard to see what would stop central banks from creating their own digital currencies and using regulation to tilt the playing field until they win. The long history of currency tells us that what the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates. I have no idea where bitcoin’s price will go over the next couple years, but there is no reason to expect virtual currency to avoid a similar fate. •Kenneth Rogoff is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.

We can’t even be sure that Ware’s opening note is true: his novel grew, he says, from family stories about his grandfather, purported to have been a spy who was helped to escape from Nazi-occupied Norway by a man whose family paid a terrible price for his courageous act. Just who is telling this story? There are different narrators, but verbal tripwires indicate that all is not as it seems: impossible echoes from one person’s account to the next alert us to the, yes, fictional nature of what we are being drawn into and pull us up short.

A senior government official told the Guardian that ministers remained deeply pessimistic about the hopes of adequate progress in this round of talks or those that will start in November. They claimed it might take a bout of “theatrics” to force a breakthrough in December, perhaps involving a change of tone from the Brexit secretary, David Davis, that would allow the EU to say it had pushed Britain enough. “He may have to emerge without a smile on his face,” said one source. The UK government is desperate for the European commission to conclude that enough progress has been made on issues relating to the divorce settlement, such as financial liabilities, Northern Ireland and citizens’ rights. Only then can officials move on to talks about the future relationship. May will try to encourage the commission by declaring that “the ball is in their court”. She will use a statement to parliament on Monday to argue that a good deal is important for European countries as well as Britain: “So while, of course, progress will not always be smooth, by approaching these negotiations in a constructive way – in a spirit of friendship and cooperation and with our sights firmly set on the future – I believe we can prove the doomsayers wrong.” May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister has said that we want to see momentum, and that the response so far has been constructive.” He said the white papers were part of the domestic parliamentary process, which involves a string of legislation to prepare the country for life after Brexit. However, it is not clear how customs and trade arrangements can be pinned down when talks on those factors have yet to start. Asked about the existence of secret legal advice believed to say that parliament could stop Brexit before 2019 if MPs think it is in the national interest, the spokesman said: “You will know we never comment on government legal advice but we’ve also always been entirely clear that we are leaving the European Union.” At his daily press briefing in Brussels, the EC’s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, insisted the next move had to come from the UK. “There is a clear sequencing to these talks. There has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings, so the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen,” he said. Concerns about the lack of progress in Europe has led to speculation that the government is ready to plough in money after Christmas to speed up preparations for the possibility of no deal. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “We go into the fifth round of talks confident we can build on the concrete progress we have made across a range of issues. “We have taken decisive steps forward on citizens’ rights, Northern Ireland and on a large number of the separation issues. “It’s important to continue that momentum and for the negotiations to move on to the next phase in order that we can discuss our future partnership.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/09/lewis-hamilton-show-still-young-at-heart-closes-on-f1-title","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T16:38:00Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton out to show he is ‘still young at heart’ as he closes in on F1 title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/09/lewis-hamilton-show-still-young-at-heart-closes-on-f1-title","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/09/lewis-hamilton-show-still-young-at-heart-closes-on-f1-title","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton out to show he is ‘still young at heart’ as he closes in on F1 title","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton has said that he wanted to prove he is still more than a match for Formula One’s upcoming young talent during his victory at the Japanese Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver saw off Red Bull’s 20-year-old Max Verstappen at Suzuka and is within touching distance of a fourth world championship while his title rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, was forced to retire from the race. The British driver’s team executive director, Toto Wolff, also observed how strong he believes the 32-year-old has become this season during a closely fought title battle. Hamilton won at Suzuka from pole position and Vettel was forced to retire on lap four after a spark-plug failure. A charging Verstappen chased Hamilton to the line. The Dutch driver had taken his second career victory at the previous round in Malaysia, relegating the championship leader to second, and was constantly in Hamilton’s mirrors while looking to repeat the feat in Japan. After a late virtual safety car period, when Hamilton’s tyres took time to come up to temperature, Verstappen closed to within a second of the race leader and was eager to attack over the final laps. “We didn’t have a massive fight out on track but we all know how quick Max is,” Hamilton said. “I thought: ‘You won the last race, I’m not letting you have this one.’ I was driving down the back straight at one point and I’m thinking: ‘Jeez, the guy behind me is so much younger than me, I’ve got to make sure I kind of man up and show my age and make sure that I stay ahead. Show that I’m actually still young at heart.’” Hamilton is in his 11th season in F1 and, having been able to hold off Verstappen, the win has given him a huge advantage in the world championship. He leads Vettel by 59 points, with four races remaining and 100 points available to score. Should he win at the next round in the US and Vettel finishes below fifth he will take the title. However, in the aftermath of the win in Japan he was able to take pleasure in how competitive Verstappen and the Red Bull had proved. “I’m enjoying being in an era with such great young talent coming through,” he said. “He’ll be here far beyond after I stop but until then I will try to not give him too many poles or too many wins.” After a fractious season in 2016 during which he ultimately lost to his then team-mate Nico Rosberg, Hamilton has appeared to be far more comfortable this year. His eight wins have been achieved despite the Mercedes not having a clear advantage over Ferrari and struggling with what has been a difficult car to manage under different conditions and at different tracks. Wolff believes Hamilton, who won one world championship with McLaren in 2008 and has two with Mercedes, has stepped up his game this season. “My experience with sportsmen at that level is that the way they develop is almost inspiring,” he said in Suzuka. “They look at their weaknesses and try to improve them. Over the winter Lewis analysed what went wrong and came back a completely different person and since then we have not had a moment where we saw any weakness.” Wolff had expressed sympathy for Ferrari immediately after the race in Japan but remained blunt about his team’s approach to the climax of the season. “In this sport you take no prisoners,” he said. “It is about having the fastest car, the best driver and the most solid performance. We have been there, we have had difficult moments for each of our drivers in the past. When you are pushing the boundaries you will eventually reach its limits.” He said the team would not be taking anything for granted at the final races of the season until both championships were in their hands, with the next meeting at the Circuit of the Americas in two weeks. “I wouldn’t want to change the way we approach things,” he said. “Looking at each race at a time, trying to maximise the performance of each race weekend, that appears to have been the right approach and we want to maintain that. “You need to have a humble attitude towards motor racing, it is what makes it exciting. There is always a degree of the unexpected that can happen and in so far as there are 100 points left to score, we won’t take the good from the battle until it is done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/tim-dowling-buys-new-mattress-wife","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: ‘Our new mattress is missing, and neither of us can sleep’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/tim-dowling-buys-new-mattress-wife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/tim-dowling-buys-new-mattress-wife","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: ‘Our new mattress is missing, and neither of us can sleep’","bodyText":"Back in July, my wife and I spent an afternoon lying on a series of mattresses in a department store, before finally agreeing on one. It was more than we’d intended to spend, but she convinced me a good mattress was an investment. “By the time we need a new one, we’ll be dead,” she said. A new bed base was delivered a few days later, but as summer drew to a close, we were still sleeping on the old mattress. “It takes ages,” my wife said. “They make them to order.” I imagined a team of people hard at work on my specially commissioned mattress, sewing my name into it by hand. By this time, I had come to believe the new mattress was the solution to all my problems. I believed that when it finally arrived, my back would stop hurting, my sleep would improve, my anxieties would dissipate, and my wife would cease to be angry with me for no reason on waking. “Where is my posh bed?” I ask one morning, staring up at the ceiling. My neck is stiff and the fingers on my left hand are tingling. “I was fast asleep,” my wife says. “You said four weeks,” I say. “It’s been more than four weeks.” “I’ll ring them later,” she says, rolling over. “If you shut up.” She’s not cross with you, I tell myself. That’s just the mattress talking. Later that morning, I walk into the sitting room just as my wife is getting off the phone. She shakes her head. “Nobody knows anything,” she says. “They gave me another number to ring.” “OK,” I say. “I’m not doing it with you staring at me,” she says. The next time I go downstairs, I find the sitting room door shut. I can’t make out what my wife is saying, but I recognise her tone: she is very disappointed in the person she is talking to. “So,” she says, striding into the kitchen 15 minutes later, “they never processed our order, and they’ve since discontinued the model.” “What does that mean?” I say with a note of panic in my voice. “They were apologetic, eventually,” she says. “They’re sending me a £20 gift voucher.” “I don’t need a voucher,” I say. “I need a new bed!” “This isn’t my fault,” she says. “It doesn’t matter whose fault it is!” I shout. “We need to find another mattress!” “You find a mattress!” she shouts. We are back on speaking terms within 24 hours, except about mattresses. My wife will not allow the subject to be raised again for many weeks. There are dark circles under my eyes most mornings. “Where had we got to on mattresses?” I ask one afternoon, putting a month’s uneasy truce at risk. “We hadn’t got anywhere,” my wife says, wheeling around in her chair. “I’m still punishing you for your outburst.” I think about my reply for a moment. “Really, though, you’re just punishing yourself,” I say. “With continued poor sleep.” My wife exhales impatiently. “Someone recommended this website,” she says, typing. “They’re meant to be good.” A page of mattresses appears. “They all look the same,” I say. “This is more or less what we chose,” she says, the cursor circling a picture. “Isn’t it?” “Don’t remember,” I say. “How long does it take?” “Forty-eight hours,” she says. “Click buy,” I say. “We should go down there and lie on it,” she says. “I’m never doing that again,” I say. “Click buy.” “It’s half the price of the one we ordered,” she says. “We don’t want to end up with the wrong mattress.” “We’ve had the wrong mattress for nine years,” I say. “Click buy.” Sixty hours later, I wake with a curious sensation of weightlessness and a strange lack of pain. I turn over; my wife opens her eyes. “It’s like sleeping on bubbles,” she says. “I can feel all my limbs,” I say. I am disappointed to discover that, despite an amazing night’s sleep, I still retain a certain anxiousness about the coming day. Never mind, I think, pulling the duvet over my head, you can just stay here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/09/eu-cannot-rely-on-uk-to-stick-to-brexit-deal-because-of-cabinet-divisions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T11:30:08Z","webTitle":"EU 'cannot rely on UK to stick to Brexit deal' because of cabinet divisions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/eu-cannot-rely-on-uk-to-stick-to-brexit-deal-because-of-cabinet-divisions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/09/eu-cannot-rely-on-uk-to-stick-to-brexit-deal-because-of-cabinet-divisions","fields":{"headline":"EU 'cannot rely on UK to stick to Brexit deal' because of cabinet divisions","bodyText":"The battle within the cabinet to replace Theresa May as prime minister has left the UK an unreliable negotiating partner in the Brexit talks, unable to convince the EU that it will stick to any agreement it strikes, a former Irish prime minister has said. Speaking to business leaders in Brussels, John Bruton accused the British government of being hopelessly divided, and offering only a vague and impractical vision of what may come once the UK leaves the bloc in 2019. “If it got into detail, the disagreement between cabinet members is so deep that the Conservative party would split and the government would fall,” Bruton told the Institute of Directors. “The Labour opposition has a similar problem. UK party and public opinion has been polarised and is unready for compromise. The Conservative party is consumed with its leadership struggle and cannot be relied upon to make a deal that will stick.” Bruton, who served as taoiseach from 1994 to 1997, and as the EU’s ambassador to the United States from 2004 to 2009, was speaking before a statement by May in the House of Commons in which she is to warn the 27 other member states that “the ball is in your court” after the concessions offered in her Florence speech, including €20bn (£17.8bn) to ensure no member states loses out in the two years directly after the UK leaves. The European commission’s chief spokesman on Monday told reporters in Brussels that there was “clear sequencing” to the talks and “no solution” had been found to move the talks on from the opening withdrawal issues. “The ball is entirely in the UK’s court for the rest to happen,” the spokesman said. The EU is refusing to address issues relating to a future trading relationship with the UK until sufficient progress is made on the issues of citizens’ rights, the Irish border and, perhaps most problematically, the UK’s financial settlement. Asked about the absence of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, from the first day of the fifth round of negotiations starting on Monday, the spokesman added: “The European commission article 50 team is available 24/7. The timing of talks depends on the availability of our UK partners. We are always here and we are ready.” The comments suggest there is little hope in Brussels that there will be progress in the negotiations this week. In Bruton’s address, the former Irish prime minister said he feared that the timescale allowed under article 50, under which the UK formally gave its intention to leave the EU, was simply too severe to allow for the negotiations to prosper. The EU, he said, was necessarily inflexible in its approach to the talks as it needed to determine its position by agreement in 27 European capitals. This time-consuming process left a real risk of disaster as a transition period would also be difficult to negotiate, he said. The UK would have left the customs union and there could be need for protracted talks with both the EU and the WTO in order to organise a new temporary arrangement. Bruton further warned that a deal on what EU regulations and directives would apply in the UK could additionally require ratification by all the member states, and their parliaments. He said the UK could find itself out of the EU in April 2019 before the transition deal had been ratified by all countries, meaning the deal would be inoperable.. “Negotiating and ratifying a transition deal could be almost as difficult as negotiating the final permanent deal,” he said. Bruton said the UK should “engage itself seriously with the complexities of Brexit” and seek to extend the timeframe of article 50, something that would require unanimity by the 27 other EU member states. While recognising this would be politically difficult both for the British government and the EU, Bruton said he feared it could take six years at least for an agreement between the two parties to come to fruition and such an extension may be the only way to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. He said: “If it looks at all these complexities thoroughly, my sense is that it [the British government] may then conclude that, despite Boris Johnson’s anxiety to leave quickly, the time limits are already far too severe and that more time is needed … Of course this would be difficult. There are really no good options here. It is a question of deciding which option is the least bad one. “The present tight timeframe minimises the opportunity for creative thought. Instead, it maximises the influence of blind bureaucratic and political forces.

After the shooting massacre in Las Vegas, millions of people clicked to YouTube videos suggesting that the killing of 58 people and the wounding of another 500 was a hoax. I am sure – please let it be so – that the overwhelming majority of those viewers realised they were false postings and dismissed them as yet another ridiculous conspiracy theory. But why bother to go there in the first place? Whether concocted by propagandists or mischief-makers, the fact that their insensitive nonsense attracted large audiences should be a matter of deep concern. What is it about “fake news” that draws such widespread attention? Is it, as I increasingly suspect after the EU referendum campaign and the build-up to the Trump presidency, a wilful desire to reject “boring” reality and choose its “exciting” opposite? However much we might want to believe that the fakery did not affect the voting outcomes, it is hard to conclude that it made no difference whatsoever. After all, mMany voters have continued to regurgitate some of the lies. I don’t think I’m going too far out on a limb by declaring, in the British context at least, part of the problem seems traceable to the way news and comment have been conflated in our mainstream media outlets. Sure, it was always the case with newspapers. No one reading newspapers down the years can have been in any doubt how their political stance has influenced their content. Our press has been proudly partisan. The result has been blatant bias. It is an understatement to call it spin. Heavily angled stories and headlines are the norm. Comment articles merely underline the prejudice in the so-called “news” items. They are indistinguishable. Nor is there the slightest embarrassment about omission, about failing to inform readers about news that, for one reason or another, fails to fit the editorial agenda. Almost everyone involved in producing papers – publishers, editors and journalists – has been relaxed about this situation. They offer two interlocking arguments as justification. First, plurality. Given that there are several titles on offer with differing views, people can make a choice about what they read (and don’t read). Second, freedom of the press. Publishers and editors are merely exercising their right to tell readers what they think. If they don’t like it they can go elsewhere (back to plurality). Once the media extended beyond newsprint, the effect of this “press freedom” on audiences became clearer. The lack of a distinction between news and comment had imprinted itself on readers. Now they either cannot distinguish the difference or, just as worryingly, even if they can it would appear they no longer care. Time perhaps to coin a neologism for news-as-comment in the style of the one applied to broadcasting integration of information and entertainment: infotainment. So then, what about TV and radio news? Is that not an “objective” alternative to the press? Without entering the debate about whether or not such objectivity is possible, consider instead the public response to BBC output. It should not be overlooked that Politicians of all shades have accused a succession of the corporation’s political editors of unfairness and/or favouritism. The verbal attacks on the incumbent, Laura Kuenssberg, although more threatening than previous instances, are part of a pattern. Why? Because these correspondents are required to inform viewers and listeners about what is happening in Westminster through analyses that, by their nature, mix comment with fact. That elision, despite Kuenssberg’s admirable subtlety and desire to avoid partiality when trying to interpret complex and fluid events, is problematic. It redefines what we mean by information. It is “the facts” plus. Politicians are not alone in monitoring these pieces to camera in order to spot prejudice. Many thousands of people do so, as evidenced on social media in vituperative postings and below-the-line comments on mainstream media sites. According to Trinity Mirror’s digital editor-in-chief at its regional titles, Alison Gow, many newspaper website readers scan headlines and then go to the comments thread without bothering to read the copy (the facts). Gow told a Welsh assembly inquiry she was worried about a change in the public attitude towards news. She said: “People will actively not read a story because they will have a view.” A dozen or so years ago, the public’s striking back at the gatekeepers of news seemed refreshing. It notified journalists that ; the top-down journalism of old was no longer relevant. Audiences were not passive consumers. They had opinions too and, at last, were able to express them. That initial healthy phase has been transformed into something much more worrying. Having exploded the myth that journalists deal only in facts, aA significant portion of the public, especially the younger generation, have adopted a virulent strain of anti-journalism journalism. Having accepted that news is ideologically determined, they prefer to trade in views – And they do so wwithout apparently realising that news-as-comment is one step away from fake news. There is a bleak paradox here. In seeking to combat the hated mainstream media output, which they regard as a form of fake news, they have become ready recipients of fake news themselves. Once all news is identified as fake, then its fakeness becomes a matter of degree. This is the gateway to a perilous path leading to the triumph of Trumpism. Eeven facts can be adduced to be fake. This is not far-fetched, as illustrated by the dispute over the size of the crowd at Trump’s inauguration speech. Photographic evidence disproved the claim by the then White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that it was “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period”. It made no difference to those who wished otherwise. That is the problem with the fake news/news-as-comment phenomenon. If people only believe what they want to believe, regardless of the facts then journalism’s mission to inform is in real peril. Editors should not give copy approval, but … Journalists were swift to decry the practice of giving interviewees advance sight of their copy following claims that Saga magazine granted Clare Balding prior approval. Some details of the story have been disputed, but it was clear the article by the experienced and excellent Ginny Dougary was changed ahead of publication, and for the wrong reasons. I went down this road in the past, especially when I worked on newspapers where no PR would dare to allow their celebrity clients to appear unless they could see the copy. So deals were done. Check the facts, I recall saying, but not the opinions. Inevitable result: outrage. You can’t possibly publish that. But, dear reader, we usually did. Why did Coogan’s win get so little coverage? I know phone-hacking is an old story. I know newspapers where former staff were guilty of intercepting voicemail messages want to “move on”. Of course they do. Even so, the muted, and oftenor absent, coverage of Steve Coogan’s legal victory over Trinity Mirror last week was a disgrace. He was given a six-figure sum because his privacy had been compromised in some 62 articles in the Daily and Sunday Mirror and Sunday People that emanated from hacking. None of Trinity Mirror’s current executives and senior editorial staff are responsible, for what happened. Bbut they, and the paper’s editorial staff, have taken the hit. How many journalistic jobs could the company have saved if it had not had to put £50m aside to cover the costs of the scandal? But the main question is aimed at the police. Why has nobody been held to account for the illegal practice of hacking? The perpetrators have got away with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2017/oct/09/guardian-launches-the-party-a-virtual-experience-of-autism","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T08:43:12Z","webTitle":"Guardian launches The Party - A virtual experience of autism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/oct/09/guardian-launches-the-party-a-virtual-experience-of-autism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2017/oct/09/guardian-launches-the-party-a-virtual-experience-of-autism","fields":{"headline":"Guardian launches The Party - A virtual experience of autism","bodyText":"The Guardian is pleased to announce the launch of The Party - A virtual experience of autism, the publisher’s latest virtual reality (VR) project. The Party places viewers in the shoes of newly-diagnosed Layla, a 15-year old, autistic girl at her mother’s surprise birthday party. Through the dramatised piece, viewers experience Layla’s attempts to cope with a stressful situation using the coping mechanisms she has devised to manage her anxiety. Viewers also undergo the sensory and auditory overload that can be endured by autistic people in a challenging environment. Inspiration for The Party came from research which suggests that autism may present far more frequently in women than previously thought, leading some scientists to believe that women and girls may have been significantly under-diagnosed. It also suggests that girls and women can be better at social camouflaging and imitating their peers which can mask their symptoms. The Party is written by autistic writer Sumita Majumdar, who reflected on her own experiences and perceptions of similar situations and considered how she might react to the environment the character Layla finds herself in. Throughout the film, viewers hear Layla’s inner thoughts, voiced by autistic teen Honey Jones. The impression of sensory overload within the film was also informed by extensive interviews with autistic people, and made with input from the National Autistic Society, the Autism Research Trust and the Cambridge University Autism Research Centre. Filmed with the Jump, Google’s stereoscopic 360° camera, The Party was shot on location with over 25 actors. It is based on a concept by author Lucy Hawking, who has an autistic son and is a trustee of the Autism Research Trust. Lucy Hawking, executive producer, story content and script editor said: “I realised that VR had the potential to raise awareness about the challenges that autistic people face. By immersing the viewer in the perception of an autistic teenage girl, struggling to cope at a party, the film gives an extraordinary perspective of the very real issues faced in day to day situations. It’s been a pleasure to collaborate with the Guardian team on this film and we hope it helps to give viewers a way to understand autism as it appears from within.” Francesca Panetta, executive editor, virtual reality, Guardian News &amp; Media said: “This is the first time that we have created a fully scripted VR film and have worked with a large cast of actors. The Guardian’s VR studio is interested in how we can work with researchers and academics to turn journalism into first person dramas. This is an ambitious piece, which enables viewers to get a glimpse into what it feels like to experience sensory overload.” Owen Parsons, researcher at the Cambridge University Autism Research Centre, said: “Some autistic individuals, particularly females, hide their difficulties because of the pressure to fit in, and this can lead to their difficulties being overlooked and can be exhausting for them on a daily basis. VR provides a great tool to help other people to gain an insight into some of the challenges faced by autistic individuals.” The Party is available to watch using Google Cardboard or Daydream. Download the Guardian’s new VR app from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The Party is also available as a YouTube 360 video.

Statement festival, which forbids cis men, comes in the wake of a series of sexual assaults at Swedish music festivals such as Bråvalla and Putte I Parken. There were four rapes and 23 sexual assaults at this year’s edition of Bråvalla, leading the event to be cancelled next year. The organisers of Statement have railed against “year after year” of unsafe events for women. In their plea for crowdfunding, they wrote: “Help us to create a safe space for the people who want to attend a festival without feeling scared for their personal safety.” Statement will allow cis women, trans women and those who identify as non-binary to attend. An update on the project’s Kickstarter page said the crowdfunding revenue would secure an as yet undisclosed venue for the festival.

Dozens of UK wastewater treatment plants use tiny plastic pellets, known as Bio-Beads, to filter chemical and organic contaminants from sewage, according to a study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC). The report found that many millions of these pellets, which are only about 3.5mm wide, have been spilled and ended up in the environment. The author of the report, Claire Wallerstein, said once the Bio-Beads had been released they are hard to spot and almost impossible to remove – yet can cause significant harm to marine wildlife. “We are learning more all the time about the environmental impact of consumer microplastics in wastewater such as laundry fibres, cosmetic microbeads and tyre dust,” said Wallerstein. “However, it now seems that microplastics used in the wastewater plants’ own processes could also be contributing to the problem.” However, South West Water said there was “no evidence that Bio-Beads are currently being released into the marine environment” from any of its sites. It said only nine of its 655 plants use Bio-Beads but did accept there had been spills in the past that “were subsequently cleaned up”. A spokesperson added: “We worked with the authors to encourage evidence-based rigour to this well-intentioned report. However, in parts, it remains anecdotal rather than factual, some of its conclusions are not supported by evidence and it insufficiently differentiates between nurdles [tiny pellets that form the basis of most plastic products] and Bio-Beads.” However, Wallerstein said samples had been analysed by a plastics expert who had been studying nurdles for 20 years and he had confirmed they were Bio-Beads. The Bio-Bead system is used in at least 55 wastewater treatment plants around the UK, according to CPPC. Wallerstein said the scale of the subsequent pollution could be far-reaching adding that in Cornwall Bio-Beads account for the majority of industrial plastic pellets found littering the beaches. “We know that these Bio-Beads have now reached the coast of northern Europe as well as the beaches here in the UK. What we need is more research into the scale of this problem and for a concerted effort by water companies to do something about it.” Industrial pellets and small bits of plastic such as Bio-Beads are mistaken for food by birds, fish, and other marine animals. These particles can kill animals, not only by causing digestive blockages, but also as a result of the high concentrations of pollutants, such as DDT and PCBs, which adhere to them in seawater. Plastic pollution can also enter the food chain. Last August, the results of a study by Plymouth University reported plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. Wallerstein said: “We understand that Bio-Bead plants have been good at improving the quality of the effluent discharged by our wastewater plants – but this should not involve the risk of polluting our seas and waterways with microplastics, which could have long-term and far-reaching consequences.” Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage cleaning process before treated effluent water is released back into rivers or straight into the sea. There is currently no mechanism in place to trap lost Bio-Beads in the event of a spill and the CPPC report details several spills and near misses in recent years. Wallerstein said: “We believe that the Bio-Bead system is far too vulnerable to losses. We are calling for a range of safeguards to be put in place at all plants using it, and ultimately for water companies to phase out its use altogether.” South West Water said it welcomed the report but called for more research. “We commend the report’s authors in raising this subject but they insufficiently acknowledge other potential sources of small plastic pellets on south-west beaches such as plastic manufacturing plants in the UK and abroad, or spills from container ships, all of which are worthy of further investigation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/09/indias-supreme-court-bans-diwali-fireworks-in-delhi-to-tackle-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T13:57:01Z","webTitle":"India's supreme court bans Diwali fireworks in Delhi to tackle pollution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/09/indias-supreme-court-bans-diwali-fireworks-in-delhi-to-tackle-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/09/indias-supreme-court-bans-diwali-fireworks-in-delhi-to-tackle-pollution","fields":{"headline":"India's supreme court bans Diwali fireworks in Delhi to tackle pollution","bodyText":"India’s supreme court has banned the sale of fireworks in Delhi during the upcoming Diwali festival, hoping to prevent the usual spike in toxic air pollution levels that accompany the holiday. Last year’s Hindu festival of lights, in which tens of thousands of firecrackers are burst in Delhi over several days, left the city sheeted in toxic smog that forced the closure of schools, power stations and construction sites. The increase in airborne pollution to levels up to 29 times higher than World Health Organisation standards led the supreme court in November to ban the sale of fireworks in the Indian capital. The ban was overturned after a challenge by fireworks manufacturers, but India’s highest court said on Monday it would remain in place until November to monitor whether air pollution levels would be substantially affected. “Let’s try out at least one Diwali without firecrackers,” one judge said on Monday, according to The Hindu. The court was hearing a public interest lawsuit brought in the name of three toddlers, asking for judicial intervention to force the state to boost vehicle emissions standards and control dust, among other measures to clear the air. Studies have attributed Delhi’s extremely poor air quality to factors including construction activity, road dust and vehicle emissions, all of which worsen in winter when slower winds and colder temperatures trap more pollution in the city. Autumn is also when farmers across Punjab, Haryana and other states surrounding Delhi burn the crop waste on their properties, sending plumes of dark, foul smoke billowing across the Ganges plain. Adding to this cocktail each Diwali is the bursting of tens of thousands of cheap firecrackers, sometimes manufactured using toxic chemicals such as mercury and arsenic, turning Delhi into what its chief minister last year called a “gas chamber”. High levels of toxic pollutants in the air have been linked to increases in respiratory diseases, heart attacks and strokes. A 2015 study found about half of Delhi’s 4.4 million schoolchildren had compromised lung capacity and would never totally recover. On 15 October the Delhi government will implement a new scaled action plan that restricts polluting industries and traffic as the air quality worsens. Diesel generators will be stopped, parking fees will rise and public transport services will increase when the air is classed as “very poor”. At emergency levels, trucks will be prevented from entering the city, construction will halt and traffic will be restricted to number plates ending in odd numbers one day and even numbers the next. Despite an official ban on setting fire to crop waste, pollution control officials have reportedly warned that even greater amounts are likely to be burned this year than in the past. Firecracker manufacturers argue that their product only causes a temporary jump in pollution levels and that state efforts should be directed at the year-round contributors to Delhi’s dirty air. Nights of bursting colour in the sky have become a fixture of the festival in the city and many Delhi residents are likely to bristle at the ban. One popular Mumbai-based author, Chetan Bhagat, compared the ruling to “banning Christmas trees on Christmas”. How strongly the sale ban will be enforced remains to be seen, though one seller, Anwar Ali, said he would grudgingly comply with the order. “It’s a headache that isn’t going away,” he said of the decision, from his fireworks store in south Delhi. “They say the firecrackers increase the pollution but I don’t believe that. All they do is kill mosquitoes.” He said uncertainty over the legal status of fireworks had left the business he ran with his brothers 2.5m rupees (£30,000) in debt and he was struggling to pay his children’s school fees. Hundreds of people in his village, Swarupnagar, just outside Delhi were involved in manufacturing or selling firecrackers and would suffer without the traditional surge in Diwali sales, he added. “The whole village survives on these firecrackers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/09/the-harder-i-try-to-sleep-the-more-worry-keeps-me-awake","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T12:13:51Z","webTitle":"The harder I try to sleep, the more worry keeps me awake | Michele Hanson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/09/the-harder-i-try-to-sleep-the-more-worry-keeps-me-awake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/09/the-harder-i-try-to-sleep-the-more-worry-keeps-me-awake","fields":{"headline":"The harder I try to sleep, the more worry keeps me awake","bodyText":"Isn’t it fascinating to read all the recent research on sleep, fruit flies and circadian rhythms?

Tonight’s penultimate episode finally staged what is surely the biggest reveal, confirming the identity of the ninja-garbed assassin who had apparently made it their mission to ruin Gabriel’s life. Congratulations to those of you who predicted that the killer was DI Elaine Shepard, shown coolly slitting the throat of drunk psychiatrist Jonas Borner, her face fitfully illuminated in the darkness by some slightly improbable welding sparks. A recent transfer to Gabriel’s squad, Shepard had three burning passions: collecting vinyl records, melting the identifying marks off her victims with hydrochloric acid and Gabriel himself. She also wasn’t working alone, sort of. Those heart-to-hearts with her unnamed flatmate? That was actually a hallucination of her murdered mother, which would explain why they were usually talking about Shepard’s banged-up dad Henry. So does it all add up? Let’s look at how the episode would play out forward. Press play It is a month before Gabriel’s acid attack. Shepard is reliving a childhood trauma, discussing it with a mental manifestation of her dead mother. Then she stalks and kills Jonas Borner, a psychiatrist colleague of Isaac Taylor, and poses his acid-scarred body at a playpark. The next morning, after having sex in a police station toilet with her hungover colleague Gabriel, Shepard finds herself assigned to the case. Isaac calls in the police after receiving a panicked voicemail from Jonas. He and Gabriel pull an all-nighter to review his patient files for persons of interest, including future suspects Christine Levison and Steven Mills. Shepard visits her father in prison and hears that he has advanced lung cancer. After discovering Isaac has a restraining order against another patient, Gabriel chases and arrests the clearly disturbed Richard Bell. Confident that they have nabbed their murderer, Gabriel ducks out of a family dinner for another assignation with Shepard, who presses him on the seriousness of their affair. They receive a call confirming that a second body has been found and since Bell was in custody at the time of the attack, they have to release him. The investigation is back to square one, and Gabriel has no idea he is sleeping with the killer. Rewind In retrospect, the signs were all there. Jodi Balfour being Rellik’s second-billed star combined with the fact that Shepard seemed reserved to the point of sullenness at work hinted that something else was going on under the surface. While we’ve watched Gabriel evolve – physically healing but emotionally regressing into a nasty piece of work – Balfour’s performance has remained unnervingly static. Shepard has always been a wary, watchful presence and finding out she was the similarly methodical killer felt like a satisfying reveal – shocking while still somewhat inevitable. That said, her killing spree does start rather arbitrarily. It seemed safe to assume that her renewed visits with her imprisoned father after such a long period of estrangement might have triggered her childhood trauma. But by the time she hears that Henry is definitely on his way out, she has already killed poor Jonas. Why him? It seems unlikely that Shepard would choose her first victim at random. And this wasn’t an impulse kill – she was waiting for the burned-out boozehound in the back seat of his car, with the belt-and-braces approach of both a suffocating plastic bag and a short, sharp knife. Is there a pattern to the killings we are still not seeing? Isaac and Jonas were involved in something shady at a psychiatric unit 20 years ago, and Gabriel also seems aware of the scandal. Might it yet have some bearing on Rellik’s overarching story? There have been various trips up blind alleys but the show’s recurring mission statement, repeatedly espoused by Gabriel, is that if you travel far enough into someone’s past you can explain how they became who they are. It doesn’t feel as if we’ve unlocked that touchstone with Shepard yet, and because the final episode will jump forward in time to where we were left dangling at the end of episode one, it’s unclear whether we will ever get a fuller explanation. What has also emerged of late is that Gabriel, Rellik’s nominal hero, used to be a monumentally unlikeable guy. In his professional life, he was a self-serving cop willing to bend or break any rule to get his collar. In his personal life, he was a cocky coke fiend and notorious womaniser. Tonight, it was implied that he had leeringly propositioned a tattooed barmaid, beaten up her publican husband then had sex with her upstairs. En route to interrogate Isaac, Gabriel was asked by his plodding subordinate Martin about his apparent addiction to infidelity: “I don’t choose to screw around, it just happens … We’re all just animals, right?” By snapping back to the events of episode one, the upcoming finale risks incurring a serious case of narrative whiplash. But it will also bring into sharp relief the differences between pre-attack Gabriel and his more empathetic scarred self. Will we be able to spot any similar change in Shepard, the preternaturally calm puppet-master behind it all? Probably not, but I’m ready to be proved wrong. Notes and observations • This week’s weird cop shop side-plot: poor Martin in a bedraggled chicken costume. • “All you need is a crystal ball and a wart on your chin.” Gabriel does not seem particularly impressed by Isaac’s predictive powers. • So many sex scenes this week, presumably to emphasise the early intensity of Gabriel and Shepard’s affair. One dreamlike sequence had their naked bodies entwined in (very painful-looking) Christmas tree lights. Seems to come earlier every year. Did you guess Shepard was the killer? How did you feel about ghost mum? Where can Rellik go from here?

Richard Thaler co-wrote a bestselling book on the nudge concept read by politicians around the world and soon had them embracing the notion that people can be influenced by prompts – such as changing the wording of tax demands – to alter their behaviour. As well as tweaking the sentences in tax reminder letters to increase HMRC takings, Thaler’s branch of economics has influenced Theresa May’s announcement of an “opt out” policy for organ donations where it is presumed that people wish to donate body parts unless they state otherwise. The Department of Health has also adopted nudge principles in its approach to e-cigarettes. The Nobel committee said the 72-year-old, who made a guest appearance in the 2015 credit crunch film The Big Short with Selena Gomez, has provided a “more realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions.” Asked what he planned to do with his 9m krona (£840,000) prize money, Thaler joked that he intended to spend it “as irrationally as possible”, in a nod to his work showing how people’s choices on economic matters are not always rational. Nudging stems from the field of behavioural economics, examining how gut instincts can often overrule rational choices, in which Thaler is regarded as a pioneer. The US academic, who is a professor at the University of Chicago, has previously suggested that Brexit could be an example of behavioural economics in action. He argued British voters chose an economically irrational route when considering the options put to them by elites and the mainstream media. “Personally I think a vote to leave is a highly risky move. Most voters aren’t really thinking about it in a very analytical way,” he said in an interview before the referendum last year. Thaler co-wrote the global bestselling book Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness in 2008 with the US professor Cass Sunstein, which brought the theory to wider attention. He was an adviser on the creation of the “nudge unit” at the heart of Whitehall initiated as a pet project by David Cameron in the earliest days of his premiership from 2010 in the coalition government. The unit was initially focused on public health issues such as obesity, alcohol intake and organ donation, although its scope has ballooned to cover everything from pensions and taxes to mobile phone theft and e-cigarettes. Formally called the Behavioural Insights Team, but widely known after Thaler’s book, the nudge unit is credited with encouraging 100,000 extra organ donations a year and persuading 20% more people to consider changing energy provider. Thaler is a leading voice on how nudging can tackle problems in society, although retailers often employ behavioural economics to encourage greater sales by making small changes to alter the buying habits of consumers. The academic has previously said the Ponzi scheme fraudster Bernie Madoff was a master in winning people’s confidence, and could have written a similar book showing how to use nudge theory for personal gain. Nudge theory has been criticised by some sections of the political right for being overly paternalistic, while it has also been described as a neoliberal idea by the left because it relies on individual choice instead of overt state intervention. Unlike the field of classical economics – whereby decision-making is based on cold-headed logic – behavioural economics allows for irrational actions and attempts to understand why this might be the case. The concept can be applied in miniature to individual situations, or more broadly to encompass the wider actions of a society or trends in financial markets. Thaler becomes the latest American economist to win a prize increasingly dominated by US citizens, now accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the Nobel prize in economic sciences in 1968. Women are significantly underrepresented in the economics prize compared with some of the other Nobel awards, such as those given for peace or literature. The US political economist Elinor Ostrom, who died in 2012, remains the only woman to have won the award. She shared the prize in 2009 with fellow US academic Oliver Williamson for her work exploring how people manage collective resources. The award for economics is not among the Nobel Foundation’s official awards for literature, peace, medicine, physics and chemistry, but was established separately by Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in memory of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/09/grime-trailblazer-major-ace-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T11:03:43Z","webTitle":"Grime trailblazer Major Ace dies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/09/grime-trailblazer-major-ace-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/09/grime-trailblazer-major-ace-dies","fields":{"headline":"Grime trailblazer Major Ace dies","bodyText":"Grime pioneer Major Ace has died, his family reports.

The 25-year-old, who was almost certain to be included in Wayne Bennett’s 24-man squad for the tournament this autumn, was initially left out of Castleford’s squad for the Super League Grand Final last week after what the Tigers described as a “breach of club rules”. It has now emerged that he tested positive for cocaine after Castleford’s Super 8s game against Leeds on 8 September, leaving his rugby league career in the balance. Hardaker is the third Super League player to test positive for cocaine in the past three months. Rangi Chase tested positive for the drug after Widnes’s league game against Wakefield on 14 July and, along with Trinity’s Adam Walker, was suspended by his club a month later. Hardaker is now likely to receive a two-year ban from the sport, with this the latest indiscretion in a career blighted by controversy. Undoubtedly one of the most talented players of his generation, Hardaker had produced arguably the best form of his career for Castleford this season after a £150,000 move from Leeds in January. But for the second consecutive occasion at a World Cup, off‑field misdemeanours have ended his chances of playing, following his removal from the England squad during the 2013 tournament after a disciplinary issue. The player issued an apology on Monday via his club – who would not comment any further on the matter – and insisted he had no intention of enhancing his performance by taking a banned substance. He said: “I would like to apologise to my Castleford Tigers team-mates, the staff and all fans for my enormous error of judgment. “I was given an opportunity by this great club and, in what has been one of the most important weeks in its history, I have let everyone at the club down. For that I truly apologise. Finally, I would like to make it clear that in no way did I, nor would I, ever take a substance with the intention of enhancing my performance.” Castleford were informed by the RFL last Thursday that Hardaker would be unavailable for selection for the Grand Final, with the governing body confirming the suspension on Monday. “The Rugby Football League can confirm that Zak Hardaker is provisionally suspended from all competition after it received notification from UK Anti-Doping that he had tested positive for a banned substance following a Super 8s game between Castleford Tigers and Leeds Rhinos on 8 September 2017.” Without Hardaker, England will travel to Australia on Thursday for the World Cup with a squad that includes two uncapped players. The Warrington forward Ben Currie, who played for Ireland in the 2013 World Cup, is included, as is Alex Walmsley of St Helens. The 2017 Man of Steel, Luke Gale, is one of two Castleford players selected along with his team-mate Mike McMeeken while the champions, Leeds, also have two call-ups in Kallum Watkins and Ryan Hall. Hardaker’s exclusion and impending suspension means the full-back role will be fought for between Warrington’s Stefan Ratchford and Jonny Lomax of St Helens, with Sam Tomkins overlooked. There are six players selected from the NRL, including the 2016 captain Sam Burgess along with his younger brother, Thomas. Thomas’s twin, George, has been left out. Wigan’s Sean O’Loughlin will lead the side, whose tournament begins on 27 October against Australia in Melbourne before further group games against Lebanon and France. “Selecting the final 24 with the help of my coaching staff was tough and that was down to the effort and performances of many players throughout the season,” Bennett said. “The England programme has been very active leading into this tournament and having the squad meet up on regular occasions on and off the field has put us in a positive place before everyone gets into camp. “We had to put the disappointment of the Four Nations behind us quickly and the meetings that followed that tournament set out what was required to be successful in the World Cup. Everyone has fully bought into this and we can’t wait to get started.” The England women’s side have also named their squad for their World Cup this autumn. Players from four clubs are represented, with the Women’s Super League Grand Final champions Bradford Bulls represented by 10 players. Featherstone’s Andrea Dobson will captain the side in her fourth World Cup. England’s 24-man World Cup squad John Bateman (Wigan), Kevin Brown (Warrington), Sam Burgess, Thomas Burgess (both South Sydney), Ben Currie (Warrington), Luke Gale (Castleford), James Graham (St George), Ryan Hall (Leeds), Chris Heighington (Cronulla), Chris Hill (Warrington), Josh Hodgson (Canberra), Jonny Lomax (St Helens), Jermaine McGillvary (Huddersfield), Mike McMeeken (Castleford), Sean O’Loughlin (Wigan, captain), Mark Percival (St Helens), Stefan Ratchford (Warrington), James Roby (St Helens), Scott Taylor (Hull FC), Alex Walmsley (St Helens), Kallum Watkins (Leeds), Elliott Whitehead (Canberra), Gareth Widdop (St George), George Williams (Wigan)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/11/has-any-striker-had-a-more-prolific-month-than-harry-kane","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Has any striker had a more prolific month than Harry Kane? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/11/has-any-striker-had-a-more-prolific-month-than-harry-kane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/11/has-any-striker-had-a-more-prolific-month-than-harry-kane","fields":{"headline":"Has any striker had a more prolific month than Harry Kane?","bodyText":"“Harry Kane has just scored 13 goals in September. That’s a lot. What’s the record for the most goals scored in a calendar month by a professional footballer?” asks Gregg Bakowski. Evan Rye points out that Robert Lewandowski managed 14 in September 2015. “He started off with a goal and a double in Euro 2016 qualification matches against Germany and Gibraltar respectively, before scoring one against Augsburg in the Bundesliga. He failed to score against Olympiakos in the Champions League but bounced back with his famous five goals within nine minutes against Wolfsburg , another double against Mainz and a hat-trick in the Champions League against Dinamo Zagreb.” Rodion Camataru, one of the great Romanian strikers, also managed 14 in June 1987. The Dinamo Bucharest forward scored twice against Flacara Moreni, four against Sportul Studentesc Bucharest, five against Jiul Petrosani and added another three against Rapid Bucharest on 25 June – the final day of the season. That streak comes with a caveat, however. Camataru had also managed 12 in May, giving him 44 for the season and enabling him to overhaul Rapid Vienna’s Toni Polster for the European Golden Boot that season. The suspiciously generous defending, prompted by the Ceausescu regime, that had helped him get to that tally (there was no shortage of Romanian golden boot winners in the 1970s and 80s) meant he was stripped of the award in 1990. Has anyone managed 15? Well, yes. Step forward, um, former Burnley, Bolton and Blackburn manager Owen Coyle. The young Airdrieonians striker demonstrated his form with a couple of goals on the August opening day of the 1990-91 season but in September he went supernova with a double against Meadowbank Thistle, hat-tricks against Kilmarnock, Forfar and Ayr Utd and then all four against Clyde. But even that streak can be bettered by Masashi Nakayama. “In April 1998, Nakayama – the scorer of Japan’s first ever goal at the World Cup finals, at France 1998 – scored at least three goals in four consecutive J1 League matches played for Jubilo Iwata on the 15th, 18th, 25th and 29th day of that month,” writes Luca De Angelis. “Five goals away at Cerezo Osaka, four at home to Sanfrecce Hiroshima, four goals away at Avispa Fukuoka and three goals at home to Consadole Sapporo. He also scored a goal for Japan, in a friendly against South Korea on 1 April, taking his tally for that month to a remarkable 17.” And while it’s perhaps not quite in the spirit of the thing: “Archie Thompson managed 16 goals in six days for the Australian national team,” writes Oliver Robinson. “He scored one against Tonga on 11 April 2001, then 13 against American Samoa on 3 April and two against Real Samoa on the 16th. He was also playing in Australia’s National Soccer League with Marconi Stallions at the time.” A bit of rooting around tells us that Thompson didn’t score for Marconi in April. In fact, he scored six for them all season – less than half his goal glut for Australia. And no Knowledge article on this kind of topic would be complete without reference to the ludicrously prolific Albanian forward Refik Resmja, who managed 13 goals in two games for Partizan Tirana in February 1951 and followed it up with 13 in four games in March. Mascots honoured “During the Stuttgart v Augsburg game in the Bundesliga, the home team wore a special kit to mark their mascot’s 25th birthday – with his face on the front. Can any other fans recall a mascot being given such special treatment?” asks Steve Joseph. Fritzle’s birthday – Stuttgart’s alligator mascot emerged from a giant red and white egg on 22 August 1992, the egg having been first seen in Stuttgart’s 1992-93 team photo – was marked by a fairly uninspiring 0-0 draw at the Mercedes-Benz Arena and he isn’t the first mascot to have featured prominently on a club’s shirt. “Didn’t the mighty Jags, aka Partick Thistle, have their LSD-trip-gone-wrong mascot on their shirt all of the 2015-16 season if not longer?” wonders Tim Maitland. They did indeed: Multiple statues “Can any football players match or better Geoff Hurst’s two statues (one at Curzon Ashton FC and one at the old Boleyn Ground)?” wonders Scott Sumner. The answer to this is an absolute doddle thanks to Jon Matthews, who points us in the direction of this: the Sporting Statues Project, a database of, yes, sporting statues compiled by researchers from the University of Sheffield. “The earliest footballer statue identified, an anonymous player, can be found in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was sculpted in 1903,” says Dr Chris Stride, one of the academics behind the project. “However, almost 95% of football statues have been created since 1990, and over half in the last decade, showing it to be a largely modern phenomenon.” Which is all very well but who has the most? In the UK, Hurst’s two can be matched by, among others, Jackie Milburn (who has one at St James’ Park, one in nearby Ashington, his home town), Sir Stanley Matthews (one at the Britannia Stadium, one in Hanley), and Bobby Moore (Wembley and Upton Park). Brian Clough can go one better with three – in Nottingham’s Market Square, at Derby County’s Pride Park and in Albert Park, Middlesbrough. When it comes to British footballers with statue collections, he’s in the top one. But worldwide, three statues just won’t cut it. Ferenc Puskas, for example, has four (three in Hungary, one in Melbourne, Australia where he spent three years as a manager) while Diego Maradona has five dotted around Argentina. But the undoubted king of the football statue is, of course, Pelé, who has 11 (ELEVEN) around the world – eight in Brazil, two in India (in Bangalore where a colourful effigy stands alongside Mother Teresa and in Kolkata, where he’s resplendent in gold) and one in Ukraine, at the Pelé museum in Lugansk. Gigs at grounds (3) Over the past couple of weeks we’ve looked into the unlikeliest gigs played at football grounds, and the examples just keep on coming. “How’s three for the price of one?” begins Tim Postins. “Back in 2005 Neil Diamond played Hull City, Ipswich Town and Bristol City as part of a four-date UK tour (the fourth was at Woburn Abbey, which hasn’t, to my knowledge, housed any football in its almost 900-year history, although it did play host to an episode of Treasure Hunt in 1986). I should know, I was at the Ashton Gate gig with my family.” And in European tour news: “Dire Straits’ Love Over Gold tour in the summer of 1983 involved them undertaking an apparently random run of Italian lower division football grounds,” writes Stuart Webber. “Over a period of five nights they played at Novara (then in Serie C2), followed by Ferrara (home of Spal, then in Serie C1), Prato (Serie C1), then Cava de’ Tirreni (home of Cavese, then enjoying the most successful period in their history in Serie B). This run of obscure Italian football stadia was interrupted by a gig at Le Capannelle, a racecourse in Rome. I may blow any vestiges of credibility by admitting that I went to the gig at Prato …” And Alun Watkins points out that Stevie Wonder played at the Vetch Field in 1984. Knowledge archive “Over a few beers last week a friend regaled me with a tale that included the rather random fact that John Hartson once stole a sheep but I have no means to check the veracity of the story,” wrote a bemused Phil Sedgewood in 2007. “Say it ain’t so.” Sadly, Phil, it isn’t just defenders, scales and Eyal Berkovic who have been given a fright during the Welshman’s career but also our woolly four-legged friends. “I was at Luton and two of my Swansea mates, Jason Wright and Kevin Davis, came up for some fun,” Hartson told the Sunday People in an interview. “We got absolutely lashed and, at about three in the morning, we found the minibus that was to take us back to my place. On the way we stopped beside a field and stole a sheep that was minding her own business, threw her in the back of the van and then drove on home for a sleep. “There was understandable pandemonium in the morning. I had a hangover and I’d completely forgotten about the sheep, which was roaming around the back garden in a state of some distress. We bundled her back in the van and dropped her off in the first field we found with sheep in it. Somehow we got away with it.” For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? “Sitting down to watch Lithuania v England (with little else to do) I noticed that Gareth Southgate has handed starts to three Harrys – Winks, Maguire and Kane,” writes Alex Chance. “When was the last time three players with the same forename lined up for England?” “This article about a non-league team in Bradford losing five players before kick-off as they set the satnav incorrectly got me wondering,” writes James Mackenzie. “I remember Manchester United under Louis van Gaal having to delay kick-off due to the bus taking a detour in central London before a game with West Ham, but has a game ever been postponed due to a satnav error? Has it ever happened to a professional team?” “Before their World Cup qualifying match, Bolivia striker Marcelo Martins took the unusual step of posing in Brazil’s team photo,” writes Chai. “Has there been any previous instance when an opposition player has been included in a team photo for an official match?” “On a particularly slow day at work today, looking back through previous World Cup qualifying campaigns, it seems that Ethiopia were part of the Uefa qualifying for the 1962 World Cup in Chile, along with Italy, Cyprus, Israel and Romania (who later withdrew),” writes Dominic Gray. “Is there any explanation for this?” “Has a European player ever won the Copa Libertadores?” wonders Stoyan Ivanov. “Since the advent of the League of Ireland in 1921, 10 sides bearing the city name of Cork have appeared in the League’s top two divisions,” writes Phil Farrell. “They are Cork FC (1930-38), Cork Bohemians (1932-34), Cork City I (1938-40), Cork United I (1940-48), Cork Athletic (1948-57), Cork Celtic (1952-79), Cork Hibernians (1957-77), Cork Alberts (1977-79), Cork United II (1978-82), and Cork City II (1984-present).

Ze’ev Elkin, minister for Jerusalem affairs and environmental protection, said keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv would not advance peace and warned Israel could approve further construction in the occupied Palestinian territories. “I deeply regret that President Trump has chosen to delay keeping his election promise to move the American embassy to Jerusalem because of the illusion that it will be possible to advance any real peace process with the current Palestinian leadership,” said Elkin, a minister from Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party. His comments on settlement-building appeared to be a deliberate attempt to jump the gun on a widely expected announcement by the prime minister to green-light about 4,000 new settlement housing units in the occupied Palestinian territories. In its own spin on the settlement-building plans, however, a senior Netanyahu official said the Israeli prime minister had in reality done a deal with the Trump administration to permit the announcement of new settlement construction every three to four months. Speaking to the Israeli news site Ynet on Sunday, the official explained: “There was a long dry period during the Obama era, and we were hit with condemnations for every construction in the settlement. “After Trump came into office, Israel and the new American administration set clear criteria for construction that the Americans were not opposed to, such as canceling the distinction between settlement blocs and isolated settlements. In addition, it was made clear that the Americans no longer consider the settlements an obstacle to peace.” That interpretation, however, seems sharply at odds with repeated public statements by US officials that insist the Trump administration “has made clear that unrestrained settlement activity does not advance the prospect of peace”. Elkin’s remarks follow comments on Sunday by settler leader Yossi Dagan, until now a vocal admirer of the US president, who accused Trump’s advisers of supplying him with misinformation around settlement-building. “We are pleased that Trump was elected but not satisfied with the direction that people around him are taking with regard to Judea and Samaria. He has unfortunately received misinformation.” Elkin’s criticism of Trump came as Likud members appeared to be jostling for position should Netanyahu, who faces a series of corruption investigations, leave politics. The transport and intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, this weekend formally announced he would seek the leadership of the Likud party and would run for prime minister after Netanyahu leaves office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/09/wu-tang-clan-ghostface-killah-celebrity-accessory-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-initial-coin-offerings","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T09:54:28Z","webTitle":"Introducing the new celebrity accessory: bitcoin-style cryptocurrencies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/09/wu-tang-clan-ghostface-killah-celebrity-accessory-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-initial-coin-offerings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/09/wu-tang-clan-ghostface-killah-celebrity-accessory-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-initial-coin-offerings","fields":{"headline":"Introducing the new celebrity accessory: bitcoin-style cryptocurrencies","bodyText":"Forget a Gucci handbag, massive sunglasses or a teacup Chihuahua – the must-have celebrity accessory for 2017 is a cryptocurrency endorsement deal. So much money is floating around the sector that companies will pay almost anything to attract attention to their fundraising rounds – called “initial coin offerings”, in a legally questionable analogy to initial public offerings for tech startups. That’s not to say every celebrity promoting a cryptocurrency is being paid to do so. The other motivation is the same for all who buy in to these offerings: get in on the ground floor, and then encourage as many people as possible to buy in after you. There’s a lot of money to be made if you do it right – and a lot to lose if you do it wrong. Last week Wu-Tang Clan’s Ghostface Killah became the latest to jump on the bandwagon. He announced his co-founding of a cryptocurrency firm called Cream Capital, which is looking to raise $30m to build a blockchain-based ATM network, a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar and an exchange to buy into both of them. For those who don’t speak startup hype, Killah’s company wants to build technology that can be used as a middle ground between popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and eventually serve as a medium of exchange in its own right. For those who don’t speak old school rap, the company’s name serves as an allusion to Wu-Tang Clan’s hit C.R.E.A.M. (“Cash rules everything around me”). As for the role of Ghostface, real name Dennis Coles, the company says he “serves as a vessel to increase brand awareness surrounding Cream Capital and cryptocurrencies.” While assuring investors Cream Capital adds that: “[Coles] understands the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the importance and gravity of the technology. He is not a random celebrity that is lending his name to a project. “Wu-Tang is for the children and the children will use the blockchain.” Ghostface follows a fair few other celebrities who have seen an opportunity to make huge amounts of cash – and, of course, express their understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain technology. In September, Paris Hilton, hotel heiress and reality TV star, said that she would be participating in LydianCoin’s ICO, a company which describes its offering as the “first AI big data marketing cloud for blockchain”. For those concerned that Hilton may have been sucked in by the buzzword bingo, fear not. Hilton has had a genuine interest in the sector for some time, appearing in a now-deleted Instagram post back in 2016 with cryptocurrency entrepreneur Stephan Tual, the former chief commercial officer of Ethereum. Those connections weren’t enough to stop observers pointing to her involvement as proof that the cryptocurrency market is firmly in bubble territory. They may have a point: one or two celebrity endorsements may be easily dismissed, but there have been so many stars backing ICOs that it’s getting hard to ignore. A couple of months before Hilton backed LydianCoin, boxer Floyd Mayweather also jumped on the bandwagon, posting his support of Stox.com’s ICO (the company is a “Bancor-based open source prediction market platform that is built on the digital currency Ethereum”, to quote industry news site Coin Telegraph). Mayweather didn’t hide his motivation, though, announcing that he was “gonna make a $hit t$n of money on 2 August on the Stox.com ICO”. A month later, just days before his headline fight with UFC star Conor McGregor, he promoted a second blockchain startup, Hubii Network (a content marketplace), and dubbed himself “Floyd Crypto Mayweather”. And in mid-September, Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx also jumped on board, promoting Cobinhood, a “zero trading fee cryptocurrency exchange”. But all these johnny-come-latelies pale in comparison to the original celebrity cryptocurrency backers: the Winklevii. The Olympic-rowing, Zuckerberg-suing identical Winklevoss twins launched Winkdex in 2014, a Bitcoin price index intended to provide a more stable measure of value for the cryptocurrency as it went through turbulent times.

The foreign secretary’s intervention in a message to a WhatsApp group of Conservative MPs follows an article in the Daily Telegraph on Monday in which unnamed backers of Johnson said he may refuse to move if the prime minister tried to demote him in a reshuffle. One supposed ally told the paper that moving Johnson would go down “like a bucket of cold sick” with pro-Brexit voters, with one saying there was now a “stench of death” emanating from Downing Street. In his message, a copy of which was passed to the Guido Fawkes website, Johnson said he did not support such briefings. “Folks I have seen yet more stuff in the Telegraph and the Sun purporting to come from so-called friends and allies of mine,” the message reportedly read. “I am frankly fed up to the back teeth with all this. I do not know who these people are. I do not know if they are really my friends and allies or if they represent some sinister band of imposters [sic]. “I heartily disagree with the sense, tone and spirit of what they are quoted as saying. Whoever they are they do not speak for me.” It follows a Conservative party conference in Manchester last week overshadowed partly by tensions sparked by a 4,000-word Brexit manifesto Johnson wrote for the Telegraph. On the eve of the Tory conference, he intervened again, telling the Sun that any transition period for Brexit should not last “a second more” than two years, and that the UK should not abide by any new EU rules during this period. Since May’s disastrous speech on the final day of the conference, Johnson has sought to join other ministers in rallying round the prime minister, dismissing calls from the former party chairman Grant Shapps and a handful of backbench Tory MPs for her to face a leadership contest. Johnson’s claims to loyalty were backed by Crispin Blunt, a pro-Brexit senior Tory backbencher, who said the foreign secretary had supported May in his conference speech and now in the WhatsApp message. “He’s declaring his loyalty, as he did in his speech, and he’s declaring it privately. And somehow that’s machinations,” Blunt told Sky News. Of the briefings, Blunt said: “Who are these people? They’re not friends of Boris’s, as far as I’m aware. I’m absolutely certain from what I know that Boris doesn’t want this nonsense to be going on.” Blunt said May should remain in her job. “It would be a huge disservice to the country if the Conservative party now indulged itself in peering at its navel in a leadership election over the next three month,” he said. Johnson’s message nonetheless risks again overshadowing May before a statement to the House of Commons by the prime minister about the progress of Brexit on Monday, following her speech in Florence last month. May is expected to say that Britain has made sufficient concessions in the Brexit negotiations for now. “The ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response,” she is to tell MPs. She will add: “So while of course progress will not always be smooth, by approaching these negotiations in a constructive way – in a spirit of friendship and cooperation and with our sights firmly set on the future – I believe we can prove the doomsayers wrong.” May has full confidence in bothJohnson and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, according to her official spokesman. The spokesman also pointed reporters towards the prime minister’s suggestion in a Sunday Times interview that she considerd herself to have a “terrific cabinet”. The comments come as speculation about a reshuffle led to calls from different wings of the Conservative party to remove either Johnson or Hammond. Some believe the foreign secretary has recently overshadowed the prime minister on Brexit – while Hammond is seen by ardent Brexiters as potentially blocking progress towards Britain’s EU exit. Asked about Johnson in the newspaper interview, designed to get herself back on the front foot after a difficult party conference, May said it had “never been my style to hide from a challenge”. The comments were widely seen as suggesting she was prepared to demote the foreign secretary. However, her spokesman said: “The prime minister was talking broadly that she is a woman that doesn’t duck a challenge. She was talking broadly.” He said the challenges she was referring to were delivering a smooth Brexit that works for Britain and tackling injustices in society. He did not explain why May had made the comments in reply to a question specifically focused on Johnson’s position. The latest round of Brexit talks begins on Monday, amid expectations that European leaders are unlikely to decide later this month that sufficient progress has been made to move discussions towards a future trading relationship. Bernard Jenkin, a leading pro-Brexit backbencher, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that May should take a tougher line with the EU. He said: “She would be cheered to the echo if she was to say: ‘Look, I’ve had enough of this. We’re going to get ready to leave in 2019, we’re going to spend the money we need to be ready to leave in 2019, and if the European Union wants to come back to the table and talk to us about what kind of relationship they want with us in the long term then we’re ready to talk.’ “They’re just stringing us along, and there comes a point where you’ve got to say: look, if you want to talk, we’ll talk, but otherwise we’re going to get ready to leave.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/09/andy-signore-honest-trailers-founder-fired-following-sexual-abuse-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T14:44:57Z","webTitle":"Honest Trailers founder fired following sexual abuse allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/andy-signore-honest-trailers-founder-fired-following-sexual-abuse-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/09/andy-signore-honest-trailers-founder-fired-following-sexual-abuse-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Honest Trailers founder fired following sexual abuse allegations","bodyText":"The creator of the popular web series Honest Trailers has been fired following several accusations of sexual abuse against women. Defy Media, parent company of the Screen Junkies YouTube channel which airs the series, announced on 9 October that Andy Signore’s contract has been terminated. “There is simply no justification for this egregious and intolerable behaviour,” the company said in a statement posted on Twitter. The accusations were made public on 5 October following a Twitter post by Emma Bowers, who was an intern for Screen Junkies in 2010. Bowers claims that, while working with him, Signore had sexually propositioned her and made inappropriate sexual comments to her. On 6 October, two other women made accusations of sexual misconduct against Signore. April Dawn said in a statement on Twitter that Signore had tried to sexually assault her on multiple occasions, and had threatened to fire her boyfriend, an engineer at Screen Junkies, if she spoke out. Dawn says that she and an unidentified woman had contacted the company’s HR department about Signore’s behaviour two months ago, but her claims were not taken seriously. “All they’ve done is protect him,” she wrote. A third woman, Devin Murphy, has claimed that Signore had made sexual overtures towards her and tried to meet her on several occasions. Defy Media said it was first made aware of accusations against Signore in August and began an internal investigation. “On Friday, new information became available and the scope and magnitude of his inappropriate actions became apparent. We are acting swiftly to address the concerns of the people affected, and that going forward, our community is free of harassment or discrimination of any kind,” it said in a statement. “Our Screen Junkies colleagues and freelancers are a team of remarkable creators serving loyal fans and we will support and protect them. If anyone else is aware of behaviour of this type, we would encourage them to bring it to our attention.” The film industry is contending with other claims of sexual misconduct. Hours before Signore was fired, the Weinstein Company announced that it had terminated the employment of Harvey Weinstein after additional allegations about inappropriate behaviour by the film producer were made. Weinstein had been on a voluntary leave of absence after a New York Times investigation accused him of multiple counts of sexual harassment against women. Saying “I own my mistakes,” Weinstein has also said he regrets his behaviour towards women going back decades, but his lawyers say he also denies many of the allegations made against him. Film websites in particular have been beset by allegations of abuse against employees. In September, Harry Knowles, founder of the film website Ain’t It Cool News, announced that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the site after he was accused of improper conduct. Knowles “categorically” denies the allegations. In August, Cinefamily’s board launched an independent investigation into allegations of sexual assault by two executives, who have since resigned (both executives deny the allegations); last month the website set up a hotline for people with information relevant to the investigation. Meanwhile, in October 2016 Devin Faraci resigned as editor-in-chief of the website Birth.Movies.Death following allegations of sexual assault against him. The accusations against Faraci resurfaced last month when it emerged that he had resumed working at the Alamo Drafthouse cinema chain, which owns the website. Faraci left the company for a second time shortly after. Signore co-founded Screen Junkies in 2011 and launched Honest Trailers a year later. The series, which mockingly deconstructs popular movie franchises, is hugely popular, with its YouTube page amassing more than 157m views. The Guardian is trying to reach Signore for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27329","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T23:00:43Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,329","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27329","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27329","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,329","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/27334","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 27,334","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/27334","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/27334","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 27,334","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27331","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T23:00:37Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,331","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27331","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27331","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,331","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/08/bob-corker-white-house-adult-day-care-center-trump-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T12:54:24Z","webTitle":"Bob Corker: White House is 'adult day care center' and Trump may start WWIII","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/bob-corker-white-house-adult-day-care-center-trump-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/bob-corker-white-house-adult-day-care-center-trump-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Bob Corker: White House is 'adult day care center' and Trump may start WWIII","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s fractious relationship with the Republican establishment reached a bizarre new level on Sunday when Senator Bob Corker described the White House as an “adult day care center” and warned that the president risked setting the US “on the path to World War III”. An extraordinary exchange between Trump and the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee began when Trump accused Corker, who is retiring, of “not having the guts” to run for re-election. In response, Corker tweeted: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” Trump also said that Corker had “begged” him for an endorsement for re-election. “He also wanted to be secretary of state, I said ‘NO THANKS’,” Trump tweeted. “He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran deal!” In a statement to the Guardian, Corker’s chief of staff, Todd Womack, directly contradicted Trump. “The president called Sen Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,” he said. Corker was considered for both vice-president and secretary of state and was a key Trump ally during much of the 2016 campaign. He has since become a vocal critic. In an interview with the New York Times later in the day, Corker said he was alarmed about a president who acted “like he’s doing The Apprentice or something” – a reference to the reality television show Trump had once hosted. “He concerns me. He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,” the senator said, adding that Trump’s threats towards other countries could set the nation “on the path to World War III”.Corker is an important and supportive voice on the deal between Iran and six major nations including the US that restricts Tehran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was reported this week that Trump, against the wishes of senior advisers, will not re-certify the deal. That would put it in the hands of Congress, which would decide whether to reimpose sanctions, a move that would threaten the deal’s existence. Corker announced his decision to retire last month. “The most important public service I have to offer our country could well occur over the next 15 months,” he said, hinting at his opposition to the president. “I want to be able to do that as thoughtfully and independently as I did the first 10 years and nine months of my Senate career.” Last week, he made headlines when he implied that Trump was leading the US to the brink of “chaos”. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill about reports that the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called Trump a “fucking moron” and considered resigning, Corker said: “I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary [of defense Jim] Mattis and Chief of Staff [John] Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos.” Asked if he was referring to Trump, he said: “[Mattis, Kelly and Tillerson] work very well together to make sure the policies we put forth around the world are sound and coherent. There are other people within the administration that don’t. I hope they stay because they’re valuable to the national security of our nation.” On Wednesday, Tillerson denied he had thought of resigning but did not say he had not called the president a moron, leading to reports of presidential fury. Speaking briefly to reporters on Saturday, Trump said he and Tillerson had “a very good relationship” but said the secretary of state could be “tougher”. Last weekend, the president, who in his debut at the United Nations said the US could “totally destroy” North Korea, slapped down his top diplomat over efforts to pursue talks. On Saturday, Trump tweeted that “only one thing will work” to rein in Pyongyang. In his remarks to the press, he refused to clarify what that meant. Corker has also said he could oppose moves by Trump and congressional Republicans to pass tax reform, a priority after the repeated failure of attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Corker has insisted that any changes to the tax code must reduce the deficit. Trump’s plan would probably increase it. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, making defections costly. Later on Sunday, Trump tweeted again: “Bob Corker gave us the Iran deal, &amp; that’s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!” Trump’s endorsement for Senate races, meanwhile, may be of dubious utility. Last month in Alabama, Luther Strange, the man Trump endorsed for the seat vacated by the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, lost a party primary runoff to Roy Moore, a hardline conservative twice removed from the state supreme court. Trump subsequently deleted tweets in support of Strange and switched his support to Moore."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/09/uk-rents-fall-amid-property-glut-in-south-east-england","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"UK rents fall amid property glut in south-east England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/09/uk-rents-fall-amid-property-glut-in-south-east-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/09/uk-rents-fall-amid-property-glut-in-south-east-england","fields":{"headline":"UK rents fall amid property glut in south-east England","bodyText":"Rents in Britain dropped in the final summer months for the first time in at least five years, according to Rightmove. National asking rents outside London fell by 0.2% in the three months to September, which is one of the busiest times of year for tenants looking for a new home. It was the first fall at this time of year since Rightmove started tracking rents in late 2011. The decline comes as landlords flood the south-east of England with newly available rental properties, distorting the national picture, as they turn away from a stuttering London property market. The glut of homes available to rent pushed down rents in the south-east by 2.3% in the period. Average rents rose in every other UK region apart from Greater London and Yorkshire and the Humber. The biggest quarterly increase came in the north-east, where the average asking rent rose by 2.6% to £564 per month. Britain’s housing market is looking increasingly broken amid a chronic shortage of new homes. Young people are particularly hard hit, with millennials spending three times more of their income on housing than their grandparents, often for worse quality accommodation, according to the Resolution Foundation. The proportion of households privately renting in the UK has ballooned in the past 20 years. According to official figures, around 65% of UK households were owner-occupiers at the end of 2016, while 17% were renting from a private landlord and 18% from a social landlord. Theresa May pledged an additional £2bn a year to councils and housing associations for affordable homes in her speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester last week. Rightmove’s head of lettings, Sam Mitchell, said more landlords were acquiring homes immediately outside London, therefore increasing the supply of available property and pushing down rents. “Agents are reporting that some investors looking for better yields are shifting their focus from London,” he said. Areas such as Surrey, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire are among the most popular for landlords seeking investments outside of London. Prices have not fallen as much in areas with good commuter links, where demand remains strong. Asking rents in the capital fell at an annual rate of 3.3% in September to an average of £1,920 per month. The average asking rent per month across the country in September was £789. However, Mitchell said he expected the cost of renting to increase in London due to the supply of available accommodation decreasing as landlords look elsewhere for investments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/08/nra-lapierre-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T16:45:15Z","webTitle":"'Monsters out there every day': NRA refuses to contemplate major gun control","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/nra-lapierre-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/nra-lapierre-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"'Monsters out there every day': NRA refuses to consider major gun control","bodyText":"The National Rifle Association chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, said on Sunday bump stocks, novelty devices that may have been used in the Las Vegas shooting, “fuzz the line” between semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons. Federal regulators need to draw a “bright line” when regulating such devices, LaPierre said on CBS’s Face the Nation, in an unusually defensive interview in which he blamed Hollywood, criminal justice reform and the mental health system for the increasing carnage of America’s gun violence epidemic. Gun control advocates in Congress continued to push for broader gun restrictions, saying that even if tougher laws might not have stopped the Las Vegas shooting, they would have an impact on the more than 80 Americans killed in gun suicides and homicides every single day. Fifty-eight people were killed and nearly 500 injured when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival from a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. In a speech on Saturday in Las Vegas, Vice-President Mike Pence called the shooting an act of “unspeakable evil” and celebrated the heroism of Americans who tried to save each other. He made no reference to any laws or policies that might have prevented the attack or lessened its toll. Donald Trump previously called the attack “an act of pure evil”. Congressional gun control advocates praised the NRA’s “step forward” in supporting more regulation for bump stocks, which make semi-automatic rifles mimic the rapid fire of fully automatic weapons. But simply banning or more tightly restricting bump stocks would not be a sufficient response to the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history, Democrats said. “You have to go beyond simply clarifying Americans shouldn’t have automatic weapons in this country,” said Chris Murphy, a Connecticut senator who represents the town where 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012. The Las Vegas gunman had 12 rifles fitted with bump stocks in his hotel suite, law enforcement officials said. It is not yet clear exactly how he used them. Murphy said Congress also needed to act to save the Americans who are killed every day with guns, not just focus on the victims of rare and horrific mass shootings. Though closing loopholes in the background check law would not have stopped Paddock, who had no serious criminal record and reportedly passed a background check, he said, it might save the lives of some suicide and homicide victims. The California senator Dianne Feinstein, a longtime gun control advocate, said no law would have prevented Paddock from carrying out his attack. “He wasn’t a criminal, he wasn’t a juvenile, he wasn’t gangbanger and he was able to buy 40 weapons over a period of time,” Feinstein told CBS. “He passed background checks registering for handguns and other weapons on multiple occasions.” But speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Murphy questioned whether the wide legal availability of military-style guns and accessories might have fueled the Las Vegas shooter’s vision of carrying out a public attack. “Maybe he would never have walked into that hotel if he had only a pistol, if he didn’t have all these tactical semi-automatic weapons,” he said. Frances Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to President George W Bush, said on Face the Nation legislators should also focus on the legality of high-capacity ammunition magazines, which allow shooters to fire dozens of rounds without pausing to reload. These magazines, once banned under federal law, may have been used by Paddock in conjunction with bump stocks to achieve a very rapid rate of fire. Murphy, one of Congress’s most dedicated advocates for gun violence prevention, said he would not demand that other gun control measures be included in legislation to ban or regulate bump stocks. “I think you have to walk before you run,” he said. “This is the first time the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table.” Feinstein, who introduced legislation to ban bump stocks, said she had Republican “interest” but not yet any Republican sponsors. She said she “appreciated” the NRA’s “step forward” in supporting any kind of increased regulation. LaPierre was less gracious, saying he was concerned about Feinstein’s “anti-gun circus” once again trying to push forward a wide range of regulations. The NRA said on Thursday it supported examining whether bump stocks should be more tightly regulated, though the group’s chief lobbyist said it had not called for an outright ban and asked instead for a focus on how federal regulators have interpreted current law. “Regulations aren’t going to do it,” Feinstein told Face the Nation. “We need a law.” Without new legislation, she said, a ban on bump stocks could be “changed by another president”, as Trump is currently rolling back many Obama regulations. NRA executives expressed grief at a shooting in which members of the group were among the victims. But LaPierre argued on Sunday that the answer to mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas lay in expanding Americans’ access to guns, including federal legislation that would overrule some local restrictions on gun carrying and allow licensed gun owners to carry their weapons nationwide. “There are monsters like this monster out there every day,” he said. “Nobody should be forced to face evil with empty hands.” Asked how it would have helped Las Vegas victims to be carrying guns while they were under attack by a gunman firing down on them from a room on the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel, La Pierre had no clear answer. Instead, he pointed to the importance of “good guys with guns” at the hotel locating and eventually stopping the shooter. Paddock shot himself dead before police could reach him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/08/lewis-hamilton-dreamland-nothing-for-granted-japan-win","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T13:38:31Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton in dreamland but taking nothing for granted after Japan win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/lewis-hamilton-dreamland-nothing-for-granted-japan-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/08/lewis-hamilton-dreamland-nothing-for-granted-japan-win","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton in dreamland but taking nothing for granted after Japan win","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton has put himself within touching distance of a fourth Formula One world championship after his victory at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. His fifth win in the past seven races, plus a spark plug failure that forced his rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, to retire after only four laps means the Mercedes driver holds an almost insurmountable points lead going into the final four races of the season. Hamilton had entered the race with a 34-point advantage over Vettel and leaves 59 ahead, with 100 available. If the 32-year-old wins at the next round in the US and Vettel finishes below fifth, the title will be his and he will become Britain’s most successful racing driver, with one more F1 championship than Sir Jackie Stewart. “I could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap,” Hamilton said. “Ferrari have put on such a great challenge all year long. All I can really say is that I have to put it down to my team. They’ve done a phenomenal job.” Vettel suffered a spark plug problem that proved terminal and it followed a sequence of races in which the championship has swung firmly in Hamilton’s favour. The German crashed out on the first lap in Singapore and could manage only fourth at the next round in Malaysia when he started from the back of the grid after an engine change. His failure to finish at Suzuka is his second DNF in three races. Vettel knows he has a mountain to climb but remains hopeful. “We go flat out for the last four races and see what happens,” he said. “We still have a chance this year, it is not as much in our control as we would like but overall the team is in a good way. I think we have got further than people thought. We have a lot of positives but today is not a day to look at positives.” Amid the commotion as Ferrari mechanics hurried to fix his spark plug problem on the starting grid before the race, Vettel missed the national anthem, earning himself a reprimand from the race stewards to add to the one imposed on him at the Monaco Grand Prix in May. Another reprimand this season would earn the German driver a 10-place grid penalty. Hamilton had managed his lead from pole well, although the Red Bull of Max Verstappen, who finished second, stayed with him to the end. The British driver had proved uncatchable but was sympathetic to his rival. “I think it’s kind of unbelievable really, to think that we are where we are,” he said. “I was excited actually to have a good race with Sebastian here, as I was in the last race – but he’s obviously been incredibly unfortunate. In Formula One it is a lot about reliability, it is about the team’s whole performance.” Mercedes have won the past three drivers’ and constructors’ championships and appear certain to do so again but the team’s executive director, Toto Wolff, refused to be complacent. “If I told you Seb was going to DNF twice you would have said it was impossible,” he said. “This is motor racing, you have a DNF or two and suddenly things swing around. So we shall not count our chickens.” It was a view shared by the driver who won two of those three titles, despite having his third for the team all but in his grasp. “There’s still a long way to go,” Hamilton said. “One hundred points is a lot of points. Anything can happen in life. I’ve just got to try to keep my head down and hopefully continue to perform like this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/23/pickups-review-london-film-festival-aidan-gillen","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Pickups review – Aidan Gillen laughs at himself as he turns killer in meta-film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/pickups-review-london-film-festival-aidan-gillen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/23/pickups-review-london-film-festival-aidan-gillen","fields":{"headline":"Pickups review – Aidan Gillen laughs at himself in meta-film","bodyText":"Like Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm or Matt LeBlanc in Episodes, the Irish actor Aidan Gillen plays an actor called Aidan Gillen in this scrappy, low-fi meta-musing on fame and life as a jobbing actor. Gillen, who co-wrote the script with director Jamie Thraves, runs the risk here of looking like a raging narcissist by making a film all about himself. Instead he sketches the travails of mid-range celebrity with likable self-mockery. The film’s running gag is that his character is constantly being recognised as “that fella off the TV” by people who then won’t believe it’s really him. “Nah. The guy I’m thinking of is much younger looking than you.” Pickups is Gillen’s third film with Thraves, after The Low Down and Treacle Jr, two authentic, tiny-budget London dramas. Since Treacle Jr in 2010, he has become stop-you-in-the-street famous playing Machiavellian brothel owner Petyr Baelish in Game of Thrones. This film, with its feel of an experimental side project, seems to be his attempt to process that. Robert De Niro once said that the hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you. Pickups feels more truthful in its insistence that the reverse is true: being a celebrity is like working in a call centre – you’re not allowed be rude to anyone. Easily the best moments of the film are Gillen’s encounters (shot-on-hoof and surely improvised) with people on the streets of Dublin, who stop him to ask for selfies or advice on how to break into acting. Gillen is public property, and graciously mugs for the cameras while pretending not to hear when they talk about him (“I thought he’d be taller”). One morning, while scraping his dog’s poo off the pavement, he politely says “No” to a guy asking for a photo, then relents. “I’m still going to tell everyone you’re a wanker,” the man tells him cheerfully. Meta-Gillen whinges about the attention but has the self-awareness to admit he’d hate it if it stopped. His conspicuous off-duty-actor uniform of dark sunglasses (even in the rain) and Withnail-ish overcoat reminded me of the story about Jude Law causing a security alert at a cinema in Bath while attempting to maintain a low profile. A wry voiceover explains that Gillen is divorced with two kids. We watch his awkward chats on FaceTime with his teenage kid – the two-second delay in the digital ether speaking volumes about the distance between them. Inevitably, you watch all this wondering what’s real. Where does Pickups Gillen end and actual Gillen begin? Does he really have a dog called Echo? Who really cares? Pickups nearly disappears up its meta-arse when Gillen, playing a serial killer in a film-within-the-film, goes full-method and drowns his friend in a bowl of cornflakes. The film is partly asking questions about the business of being an actor: is it a way of ducking out of real life? Is it good for the soul to strangle people for a living? Here’s where the film wobbles, feeling like a late-night conversation over the dregs of the last bottle of red that’s been stretched into a film. But Gillen’s unpredictable, predator-like charisma and those hilarious who-do-you-think-you-are scenes make it a risk that pays off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/08/terry-downes-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T13:46:18Z","webTitle":"Terry Downes obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/terry-downes-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/08/terry-downes-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Terry Downes obituary","bodyText":"Terry Downes, the “Dashing, Crashing, Bashing Paddington Express” who has died aged 81, was a popular all-action fighter who became world middleweight champion for nine months in 1961-62, retiring aged only 28 in 1964, when he was beaten in a challenge for the world light heavyweight title. A headline writer’s dream with a sharp cockney wit that spawned numerous one-liners, he was beloved by boxing promoters. His aggressive style rarely produced a dull fight, and Downes also had the charisma to ensure he was a major box-office draw. Born and brought up in London, where he boxed as a junior for the Fisher amateur boxing club, Downes completed his boxing education in the US, where he fought for the Marine corps, which he had joined after his family emigrated in 1952. Downes’s elder sister, Sylvia, had previously travelled to Baltimore to join the famed Ringling Bros circus, but her family moved to the US to be with her when she lost an arm in a road accident. She was thrown from a bus on the way to the circus, suffering injuries when she was trapped between the vehicle and a telegraph pole. Downes’s first fights were for the YMCA, but he was persuaded to join the Marines after boxing against them and performing impressively. In four years, he lost only a handful of fights, was believed never to have been floored in 51 contests and missed out on selection to box for the US Olympic team for the 1956 games in Melbourne because selectors ruled he was ineligible through failing to satisfy a residence qualification. Downes had been a champion in the American amateur Golden Gloves competition, and had become all-services champion, defeating Pearce Lane in the final. Lane went on to be chosen for the Olympics, representing the US in the welterweight division. Although Downes boxed in the Olympic trials and was given rave reviews in American newspapers – some of which campaigned for his selection – he missed out and reflected: “I was all right to be in the bloody Marine corps, catching bullets in the frontline, but with boxing gloves they said no, you can’t represent us.” His Olympic ambitions thwarted, in 1956 Downes returned to the UK and soon turned professional. Managed by Sam Burns, who had made his name as the righthand man of Jack Solomons, Britain’s leading promoter after the second world war, Downes won his first two contests in the paid ranks before being matched with a young Nigerian named Richard Ihetu, dubbed Dick Tiger by promoters. Tiger had lost seven of his first 21 fights. He would ultimately become world middleweight and light heavyweight champion, but was handpicked, at that stage of his career, by matchmaker Mickey Duff, as no more than a tough fighter likely to make Downes look good. Duff spectacularly miscalculated. Downes was battered and defeated, pulled out by his corner after just five rounds. Asked for his thoughts about the contest by reporters, Downes said: “I thought, fucking hell they’ve put me in with a giant. Then I realised I was flat on my back looking up at him. I don’t remember much after that, so I look forward to reading your reports to see what happened next.” But the quote which went down in boxing history as one of the great one-liners came in the follow-up question, when a reporter asked the beaten Downes who he thought he would like to fight next. Quick as a flash, he retorted: “The fucker who made that fight.” Perhaps wisely, Duff was nowhere to be seen at the time. Downes would say of his manager, Burns, that he “didn’t know a left hook from a meat hook”, which was a tongue-in-cheek appraisal of a man who was linked with several other leading British fighters including Kevin and Chris Finnegan, and Tony Sibson. But Burns served Downes well in terms of financial advice. By 1961, Downes was established as one of the biggest names in British boxing. He had beaten John McCormack to regain his British middleweight title and was regularly packing in big crowds to Wembley’s Empire Pool. He had defeated the highly rated American Joey Giardello to set up a world title challenge against another American, Paul Pender. However, it was outside the ring that Burns gave Downes his shrewdest guidance, with the two men taking advantage of the newly relaxed gaming laws to set up a chain of betting shops. Making the most of Downes’s name, they would eventually own 90 shops before being taken over in the early 1970s by William Hill, of which Burns would be managing director for the next decade, with Downes investing his money as a major shareholder. The shops provided Downes with financial security for life, but he achieved his dream of winning the world title when he fought Pender for a second time at Wembley in July 1961. Their first contest, in Boston, Massachusetts, had been stopped in the seventh with Downes having suffered an injury to his nose, but Downes prevailed in London when Pender was stopped on cuts after nine rounds. A third rubber match in Boston between the two was won on points by Penderover 15 rounds in April 1962, in what Downes would always contest was a hometown decision. Burns had said his man would need a knockout to win, and he was proved right. Downes defeated the faded 41-year-old Sugar Ray Robinson later that year but drew the curtain on his fighting career in November 1964, when he was stopped by Willie Pastrano in a world light heavyweight title challenge at Belle Vue, Manchester. Downes had been winning before being twice sent to the canvas in the 11th round. Resisting the temptation of a comeback, Downes said: “That was as good as I could do. If I couldn’t win that fight, it was all downhill from there.” After retirement from boxing, Downes appeared in several films, including Roman Polanski’s Dance of the Vampires (1967), and various television series where he often played the role of thug, villain or minder and was last seen in a bit part role in The Bill, in 1990. He also owned a nightclub and car dealership. A regular at major fights, before he was afflicted by declining health, Downes’s robust observations – often in colourful, expletive-strewn language were much loved by ringsiders. A staunch supporter of the London Ex-Boxers Association, Downes remained a respected figure, although his public appearances were limited after the onset of cancer. In 2012 he was awarded the British Empire Medal for his charity work and services to sport. In 1958 he married Barbara Clarke. She survives him, along with their children, Terry, Paul, Richard, Wendy and Melanie, and eight grandchildren. • Terry Downes, boxer, born 9 May 1936; died 6 October 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/08/lithuania-v-england-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T18:15:33Z","webTitle":"Lithuania 0-1 England: World Cup 2018 qualifier – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/08/lithuania-v-england-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/08/lithuania-v-england-world-cup-2018-qualifier-live","fields":{"headline":"Lithuania 0-1 England: World Cup 2018 qualifier – as it happened","bodyText":"Right, I’m off. It’s been a blast. England are World Cup-bound, and anything can happen when they get there. If they did nothing else today they inspired a few dreams – if only because they provoked sleep. Bye! Before I go, here’s a match report for you: Gareth Southgate has had a chat: We haven’t scored the number of goals we’d like to. But we wanted to try something, and we’ve picked a team that I think [had] some encouraging performances from players that have come in. A little bit of quality in the final third was what was missing. I think the packed defence, we were just a fraction off on some of the passes, and on that surface running at people doesn’t work, you’ve got to play quick one-twos. The games we have next month [against Germany and Brazil] will be different. That’s a completely different challenge. We know the style of the game will be completely different. I have to say I think the application was really good today, the mentality was good given we’ve already qualified, and I think the average age was about 23. So lots for me to take away and think about. I think you’ve got to put today into context. We made seven players, and that inevitably means it could be a bit disjointed. It was a new system and we’ve only had a couple of days to work on that, but for next month we should already be up and running with it. In some aspects the back three worked. The goal came from Harry Maguire bringing the ball forward. We’re still a bit open on the counter-attack, and maybe took false positions up at times. And finally, on Harry Kane’s captaincy: Importantly, he’s scoring goals for us and he’s leading from the front. We need that leadership through the team. He’s certainly impressed me with everything he’s done. In other World Cup news, Northern Ireland have guaranteed a play-off place, and Poland have booked their place in Russia by beating Montenegro 4-2. Kane’s point about shooting when it’s better to pass is key, I think. It’s the easy option, but random snap-shots from 18+ yards rarely end up in the net. I think England miss Lallana, one player who loves a bit of penalty-area interplay. Some Harrys have spoken, first Harry Kane: It wasn’t a fantastic performance. It was a solid one. They didn’t create many chances. We had a few. But it’s a win to finish off the group. It’s been a good campaign for us and now we move on. Maybe we had shots when we didn’t need to, maybe looking for more passes. It was a difficult surface but we had to do better. And then Harry Winks: It’s been a dream week for me. To be called up into the seniors was fantastic. I nearly scored. The keeper made a great save off my left foot, if that had gone in it would have been brilliant. I was quite surprised when I got the call to step in, but obviously I’m happy to step in. It was brilliant for me, yeah. Meanwhile the game in Slovenia is over, and Scotland have drawn 2-2 and will not be at the World Cup. They finish third in Group F, behind Slovakia on goal difference. 90+3 mins: The final whistle blows on England’s qualifying campaign, and the Group F table looks very handsome indeed if you’re an Englishman. Sadly, you’d have more fun gazing at that than the actual team. 90+2 mins: It’s hoisted into the area, and headed back out again by Kane. 90+2 mins: Lithuania have a free kick on the right, 10 yards into England’s half, and it might be the last action of the night. 90+1 mins: Into the first of two stoppage-time minutes, and Sturridge slams a shot from eight yards out into a defender when the goal beckoned. 89 mins: Scotland have scored an equaliser, and have two minutes plus stoppage time to score a play-off-qualifying winner. 87 mins: England haven’t attacked particularly well, or defended particularly well. Still, they’re winning, and they have tried out a modified if underwhelming shape. They might have been winning by more had Sturridge not just flicked his header from Lingard’s cross, which was just a fraction too high, wide. 85 mins: “With apologies to Ted Striker, it looks like I picked a hell of a day to give up not watching International football,” writes Damian Clarke. Deciding that a meaningless fixture between England and Lithuania is the unmissable occasion you’ve been waiting for shows a contrary side to your character, so perhaps you’re contrary enough to be enjoying it. 84 mins: Great chance for Lithuania! A flick-on finds Matulevičius running free into the area, but his shot is straight at Butland. 82 mins: Kane, Sturridge and Lingard link up nicely, before Sturridge hoots wide from the edge of the area. 80 mins: Dele Alli is walking slowly off, and Jesse Lingard is preparing to come on. 77 mins: Even by England’s standards, this game has been unusually dull. 76 mins: Lithuania’s first substitution sees Sernas go off and Matulevicius come on. 74 mins: Slovenia have scored again and lead 2-1. Scotland must score at least twice in the last 15-or-so minutes or they’re out! 73 mins: England make a substitution, bringing Sturridge on for Rashford. 72 mins: Kane shoots wide from just outside the area. Elsewhere in Group F it’s Slovenia 1-1 Scotland and Slovakia 3-0 Malta, and as it stands Slovakia are claiming a play-off place on goal difference. 70 mins: The interesting thing about this Harrylanche is that before Kane’s first cap in 2015 England had endured more than 60 Harryless years, since Harry Clarke’s one and only cap in 1954. It seemed England’s Harryful years were over, but suddenly they’re very emphatically back. 69 mins: Another save! Henderson’s cross from the right, Cresswell’s back-post header and it took a good diving stop to keep it out. 66 mins: Plus when England beat Ireland 4-0 at Molyneux in February 1903 Harries Johnson, Davis and the excellently-named Harry Hadley were all in the line-up. So it basically happens all the time. 64 mins: I have an answer to the trivia question, and it is no! When England lost 3-2 to Scotland at Bramall Lane on 10 March 1883 Harry Swepstone, Harry Goodhart and Harry Cursham were all in the team. 63 mins: Nice chance for Lithuania! A pass into the box, a backheeled set-up, and Semas blasts a left-footed shot over the bar from 15 yards. That’s certainly their finest attacking move, and possibly the best of the game. 59 mins: England have a cross, which is cleared, and then work the ball to the left for another cross, which is also cleared. Still, they’re getting it into the mixer, which is something. 55 mins: And a save at the other end! Lithuania break, and though Keane reaches the low cross first he sidefoots it towards the corner of his own goal, and Butland does well to push it wide. 53 mins: Save! Winks gets a spot of luck, volleying a shot into his own ankle and seeing the ball rebound handily back into his path before jinking nicely to earn himself space for another shot and then spearing a left-footed effort goalwards from 15 yards, but Setkus gets two hands to it. 51 mins: Sernas spins and slams a left-foot shot high from 25 yards. 49 mins: I’m working on an answer to this. I can confirm that though there have now been 31 international Harries, few have had England careers of any note. Harry Hibbs, with 25 caps, is the all-time most-capped Harry though Kane is only two behind. 46 mins: The second half has begun. The players are back out! More football on its way! It has been pretty unexceptional. There have been a few shots, and of course a penalty, but basically no actual proper genuine certified chances. But it’s a results-based business, etc and so forth. “Presumably the thing behind England’s goal is to remind defenders to pay at-tent-ion to their marqueeng,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. 45+2 mins: That’s all for now. England have dominated, they have scored, but they haven’t really thrilled. 45+1 mins: There’ll be a minute or so of stoppage time. 45 mins: Cemych shoots low from just outside the area, the ball going just wide. It looked to me like Butland got a fingertip to it, but the referee disagreed. 42 mins: Andriuskevicius executes an excellently-timed tackle on Rashford, but the England player also takes a thwack to the ankle and is now receiving treatment to it. 41 mins: This is extremely one-sided, though England are yet to create a really good goalscoring opportunity from open play. 38 mins: Rashford gets to the byline, executes a turn that sends a sliding defender screaming off the pitch, turns again past another, and then shoots across goal. Setkus saves it, though. 34 mins: Rashford is sent scurrying down the right (he’s back there again), and he tries to roll the ball across to Kane only for a defender to slide across and poke it behind. The corner is cleared. 33 mins: Alli is now on the right, and Rashford more lefty. Meanwhile Scotland have taken the lead in Slovenia – more details here: 30 mins: The penalty hit the post on its way in, and not lightly either. Had it gone as much as an inch further leftwards it would have come back out. This makes the penalty either better or worse, depending which side your bread’s buttered. 29 mins: Here’s some blurry footage of the penalty courtesy of the Lithuanian FA: The penalty flies low, hard and right into the left-hand corner, and though Setkus went the right way, he had no chance. 27 mins: It wasn’t a terrible tackle – Alli and Verbickas went for the same ball and when the Englishman got there first, Verbickas’s boot had nowhere to go but into his opponent. 26 mins: England have a penalty! Dele Alli was taken out, and the referee points to the spot without delay! 25 mins: Chance for England! A free-kick is kind-of-cleared, miskicked, bounces about a bit and suddenly drops to the feet of Keane, on the edge of the area, but his low shot goes wide. 24 mins: Zalgiris, currently top of the Lithuanian league table, play their home games here. When the gaffer demanded a marquee signing, he didn’t expect the board to take the request so literally. 22 mins: Curiously, behind one of the goals there is a small marquee. 19 mins: Now Lithuania win a corner, which turns out to be exceptionally high and loopy and prompts some extended head tennis and then, at the end of it all, a volley from Verbickas that Butland saves with ease. 16 mins: England have had 65% of possession in the first quarter-hour, a statistic they are currently burnishing by playing it at length around the back three. 14 mins: Sartorial update: “As well as the dubious blazer pocket, it is painfully obvious that Southgate’s jacket simply doesn’t fit, being far too big for him,” sniffs Jay Collins. “I’m not sure if there is a symbolic meaning there somewhere. It is also difficult to have much faith in the judgement of a man who thinks that blue suit plus big brown leather belt is a good look.” Does he want a black belt, then? Or a slimmer brown belt?Blue-on-blue embroider, but I’m not good on these little details. 13 mins: Winks seizes upon a poor defensive header and pulls back to Alli, who dallies a moment too long on the edge of the area and is dispossessed. 11 mins: Lithuania go close! It’s a lovely low cross from the left, Maguire slips and Sernas, granted precious space inside the penalty area, flicks the ball just wide of the near post! 8 mins: Harry Kane shoots wide from 20 yards. He insists there was a deflection, but the referee is having none of it. 7 mins: Looks like they forgot to say cheese. 5 mins: It’s a decent corner, but somehow missed by everyone in the middle. Cresswell picks it up on the left and crosses, and it looks very much like the ball will dip onto Maguire’s forehead, six yards out, until it unexpectedly doesn’t. A pesky defender must have got a touch on it. 5 mins: Trippier’s cross is headed behind, and England have their first corner. Rashford will take it. 4 mins: England start with Rashford unexpectedly on the right of the front three, and Alli on the left. 2 mins: The night’s first shot comes from the left boot of Novikovas, who strikes over the bar from 25 yards or so. 1 min: They’re off! Lithuania get the game started, on a jade green pitch that looks like, and indeed is, a carpet. The players are out, the anthems have been sung, and it’s still raining! Let’s (watch other people) play football! Gareth Southgate speaks! Specifically, he speaks about the switch to a back three and his decision to give Harry Winks, only an occasional presence in Tottenham’s team in the Premier League, a full international debut: We’ve looked in the summer at what our best system would be moving forward. We felt 4-2-3-1 for qualifying got us an extra attacking player on the pitch, but we wanted to look at something different. I think we’ve got to pass the ball better, we’ve got to keep possession. Our connections have been better when we played this system, and also when we lost the ball the other night we were wide open on the counter-attack and we need to be better. Harry Winks is a very good passer of the ball. It’s a bit early for him, but it’s a great opportunity to look at him and I think it’s a good game for him to come into. Writing as someone employed to type vaguely immediate text-based updates of this match, I’m hoping Vytautas Andriuškevičius has a quiet game. Here’s our piece on Zelenogorsk, which will be England’s home from home for a couple of weeks (or more, you never know) next summer. It does look genuinely miserable over in Vilnius, weather-wise: Vilnius weather latest: It’s forecast to rain for the next hour or so, but should have stopped by 9pm local time, or within the next two-and-a-half hours. “That blue embroidery on blue jacket makes it look like Southgate has put his jacket on inside out and not noticed,” suggests Adam Griffiths. But if the jacket was inside out we couldn’t see the pocket at all. It does look like the pocket has been sewn on the wrong ray round. Here’s the Lithuania side, and indeed both teams in full: Lithuania: Setkus, Andriuskevicius, Girdvainis, Zulpa, Linas Klimavicius, Borovskij, Slivka, Verbickas, Novikovas, Sernas, Cernych. Subs: Zubas, Freidgeimas, Kijanskas, Mikuckis, Silenas, Vaitkunas, Matulevicius, Chvedukas, Papsys, Spalvis, Valskis, Cerniauskas. England: Butland, Keane, Stones, Maguire, Trippier, Winks, Henderson, Cresswell, Alli, Kane, Rashford. Subs: Pickford, Forster, Smalling, Walker, Cahill, Dier, Livermore, Defoe, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sturridge, Sterling, Lingard. Referee: Orel Grinfeld (Israel) Exclusive: what the Conservative party conference lettering-fixer did next: What’s your thinking on the blue-on-blue embroidery going on here? I know this has been Southgate’s matchday blazer of choice for months, but I still haven’t come to terms with it. The England team has been announced, and Harries Maguire and Winks both make their debuts. There are seven changes in all: Hello world! So it ends, for England at least, who head to Lithuania for the final match of another successful qualifying campaign with top spot in Group F already sewn up. It’s all very familiar, coming as the match does just four days before the second anniversary of England’s only previous visit to Lithuania, in the last match of Euro 2016 qualifying, when the visitors had top spot in Group E already sewn up. A quick perusal of the Lithuanian press reveals that the England team is staying, as they did in 2015, at the Kempinski hotel in Vilnius, which looks lovely, has some excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and offers guests a variety of entertainment options including a luxury spa, pool, and “an exclusive time in one of the best cheese houses in Lithuania”. “Among the team’s requirements are detailed instructions for the food required immediately after the match,” reports Irytas. “The menu includes fast food. As everywhere, players love hamburgers and tortillas, while coaches will eat more seriously. A spokesman for the Lithuania Football Federation said that while the English team’s requirements were higher than the likes of Slovenia or Malta, they were not too demanding.” Talking of Malta, after a 1-1 draw in Ta’ Qali on Thursday there were some heated confrontations between Lithuania’s fans and players. “The mini-conflict after the game was resolved,” Edgaras Jankauskas, the manager, reported. “The players talked with the fans. I think they saw that we fought, we tried to win, but luck was not on our side. I think everything is now fine.” In other news, having watched England romp to a 4-0 win over 10-man (boy? Youth?) Chile earlier today in their opening match at the Under-17 World Cup I can report that it was a lot more fun than watching the seniors in major competitions has ever been. Still, there’s always next year, right? Here’s the England team practising their diving in training yesterday. Simon will be here shortly. In the meantime, read Gareth Southgate’s motivational thoughts on his England side: Gareth Southgate has claimed no one in his squad can yet consider himself a “big player” but believes England are hungry to prove their quality before next summer’s World Cup as they seek to repair the relationship with a disillusioned fanbase. England go into Sunday’s final Group F game against Lithuania with qualification for the tournament in Russia already secured and the management intent upon experimenting. While a core of the team who defeated Slovenia on Thursday will be retained, Southgate will employ three at the back, recall Dele Alli after suspension and the Stoke City goalkeeper, Jack Butland, will start a competitive international for the first time in a little under two years. Southgate has acknowledged the disconnect between his team and supporters, whose patience has been tested by an uninspiring qualification campaign and stodgy recent performances. Yet, in defending his players, he sought to put expectations into perspective.

But if this sharp-eared and patiently curious artist has her comfort zones, she evolves at her own pace nonetheless. On Friday, the second night of her four-night Hang festival, Mancio took not one dive into unfamiliar waters but two: working with the idiomatically nimble Guastalla string quartet under pianist and arranger Kate Williams’s bold direction, and mixing poignant originals on old loves and homecomings with life-and-death emotions stirred by her encounters at the Calais refugee camp last year and her fundraising for the charity Phone Credit for Refugees. The theme of “Finding Home” didn’t entirely hide the joins in an evening of songs with such diverse inspirations, but the gig was nonetheless a triumph of integrity and classy musicality, and the audience paid it fittingly rapt respect. Mancio began with The Journey Home and The Last Goodbye, two pieces from her recent Songbook album (a partnership with elegant American pianist Alan Broadbent) revealing her deceptively effortless precision with her own ardent lyrics. Williams improvised with typically terse lyricism and languid swing, propelled by Oli Hayhurst’s bass and David Ingamells’ drums. A vibrant account of Antonio Carlos Jobim’s Chega de Saudade (turned into No More Blues by Jon Hendricks’ lyrics) sprang an ingenious surprise when the string quartet chased another brisk Williams solo with an exhilarating arranged passage of flying contrapuntal bebop. Mancio then devoted her light-touch assurance to the 1930s classic I Cover the Waterfront, over a dark, stalking Williams strings arrangement that lent an ominous undertow to the lyric’s hopeful seaward gaze and dream of reunion. Guastalla violinist John Garner uncorked a fleet, melodically audacious improvisation in the midst of it. Mancio’s The Last Boy on Earth, inspired by an Afghan 14-year-old who was terrified by the fires at the destruction of the Calais camp, was sensitively written and unnervingly delivered. Alan Broadbent’s Quiet Is the Star was a delectable snapshot caught in a silvery gleam of strings, and a portrayal of a tortuous Afghanistan mountain journey brought Mancio to a fierce emotional edge she usually keeps under wraps. It was a memorable gig, if sometimes inevitably a sombre one. •Georgia Mancio’s Hang festival continues at Pizza Express Jazz Club, London, until 8 October.

That’s good for Glyndebourne and, largely, good for Mozart. But one side-effect of having such a close association with a particular composer is that the company has to keep renewing the work. Nicholas Hytner’s 2006 production of Così fan tutte, Mozart and Da Ponte’s tricky comedy, is to be retired from touring after this run, which is a shame as it is one of the most intelligent and insightful stagings of this work around. In Vicki Mortimer’s designs it is also still one of the best looking, with its azure sky, honey-coloured walls and lemon trees bathed in Mediterranean, early-evening, end-of-an-era sunshine. Hytner’s staging, safe in the meticulous hands of the revival director Bruno Ravella, takes this work, with its ridiculously thin disguises and unpalatable sexual politics, and makes it work by playing it more or less straight. The ironies in Da Ponte’s text don’t register any less strongly for this, and if anything its cruelty is more apparent than ever. But then, so is its tenderness. That’s also thanks to the energised orchestral playing, and to detailed performances from each of the six-strong cast. José Fardilha’s Don Alfonso sets things in motion. He is highly watchable, almost deadpan until his bitter pronouncement about fidelity as he rounds off the first scene, which he and the conductor Leo McFall whip up angrily to make it almost a mini aria. What has made him this way? There might also be an opera to be written about the back story of Ana Quintans’s Despina, a maid seemingly bent on world domination; she is sung with poise and point, though when in disguise she overdoes the funny voices a bit. But this opera isn’t so much about them, and the central four characters are uncommonly well balanced. If there’s a vocal star in there, it’s Kirsten MacKinnon, who has the high notes and the low notes for Fiordiligi and everything in between. But then there’s Rachel Kelly, who plays her sister Dorabella with irresistible charm and openness, singing beautifully if without enormous variety of tone. And there’s the tenor Bogdan Volkov, who shapes glowing phrases in Ferrando’s arias and doesn’t seem to need to breathe, ever. And finally Ilya Kutyukhin, a more interesting, subtle Guglielmo than usual. If this is indeed the last chance to catch this production, it will have been given a good send-off. •In rep at Glyndebourne, Lewes, until 26 October. Box office: 01273 815000.

Family doctors are losing sleep because they are so anxious that they have put patients’ safety at risk by missing a symptom or not keeping their medication up to date, said Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard. The doctor, who is the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), told the Guardian: “GPs, like many caring professionals, never completely leave their jobs behind when they go home; it’s a 24/7 responsibility. “However, the situation for GPs has deteriorated and I know of GPs who have told me that they have sleepless nights worrying about their patients, or that they’ve missed something because they’ve been constantly up against it all day long, working in ways that don’t feel safe. “The ones I’ve spoken to are women in their 30s and 40s, but I’ve heard anecdotal stories about other colleagues as well,” she said. GPs have told her how they are still awake at 3am or 4am wondering if, as a result of being under constant pressure, they have made errors. Stokes-Lampard said GPs were struggling to keep up with rising demand for consultations, giving patients as much time as they needed in appointments and a relentless flow of correspondence from hospitals about the latest developments about patient. “GPs are professionals’” she said. “We do everything we can to be meticulous; that’s in our nature and is part of our training. But when you’re shattered, it is possible to overlook a changed prescription request, or not update a patient’s record as comprehensively as would be ideal – things that can impact on patients’ health further down the line. “But there are also more sinister things we worry about. Did I miss a symptom of something that could be more serious? If I’d had more time with that patient, would my eventual diagnosis have been different? These things play on your mind, and it isn’t healthy.” Despite the anxiety, actual errors were rare, said Stokes-Lampard, a GP in Staffordshire. “Most of the time, of course, we haven’t missed anything, but when the seed of doubt has been planted, it’s hard to get it out of your head.” The RCGP’s annual conference in Liverpool this week is expected to hear vocal warnings from GPs about their workloads and calls for urgent government action to tackle the profession’s worsening staff shortages. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is likely to face tough questions when he addresses the gathering on Thursday. Stokes-Lampard said: “It isn’t just the hours in clinic I’m talking about. It’s the urgent duties we have to perform long after our patients have all left the surgery: prescription reviews, hospital letters and ensuring records are up to date. These might seem like routine administrative tasks but they have a major impact on the delivery of high-quality patient care, and the more fatigued we are, the more room there is for error. “GPs are trying to do more and more, but worn-out doctors are no good to anybody and there is a limit beyond which we cannot guarantee that we are practising safely.” She said family doctors were suffering from physical and emotional exhaustion because workloads had grown by an estimated 16% over the past seven years, but investment in GP services had fallen over the past decade. “We know GPs are burning out. The GP health service was launched earlier this year and there are already more than 500 GPs on its books,” she said. In 2015, the Conservatives pledged to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020 to tackle growing shortages caused by family doctors retiring early and too few medical graduates choosing that branch of medicine as their career. But numbers have fallen over the past year, record numbers of surgeries have been closing and NHS England has had to increase its recruitment of foreign GPs from 500 to between 2,000 and 3,000 in order to help meet the 5,000 target. Stokes-Lampard’s remarks come days after the British Medical Association warned that GP practices might have to start turning away new patients because they could not cope with the demand for appointments caused by the ageing and growing population. The Department of Health said: “GPs are the absolute bedrock of the health service, which is why we have committed to an extra 5,000 doctors in general practice by 2020, are investing an extra £2.4 billion into the sector in real terms every year, and are helping practices reduce their workload, free up GP time and improve care. “We know working in general practice is challenging, and we are also helping GPs to prioritise their mental health through a £16m programme of free confidential advice and support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/08/theresa-may-prepared-demote-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T10:23:50Z","webTitle":"Theresa May suggests she is prepared to demote Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/08/theresa-may-prepared-demote-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/08/theresa-may-prepared-demote-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May suggests she is prepared to demote Boris Johnson","bodyText":"Theresa May has suggested she is prepared to demote Boris Johnson in a signal of strength after Downing Street successfully deflected an attempted coup by a former Conservative chair. The prime minster said she would not “hide from the challenge” when asked about the foreign secretary, who has infuriated colleagues by interventions on Brexit that triggered questions of leadership. Her comments, after a nightmare conference speech that she admitted was “uncomfortable”, were backed up by the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, who warned: “People serve in cabinet entirely at the pleasure of the prime minister.” Davidson stressed that Johnson had made a public show of loyalty, but urged May to ensure that the foreign secretary was true to his word. “He has come out this week to say he is fully behind every dot, comma, and word of the Florence speech,” Davidson told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “I want to see the prime minister hold him to that.” Davidson described Johnson as a “big intellect and big figure in the party”, adding that the prime minister had her support if she believed he was the best person to be foreign secretary. But in a warning that appeared to be aimed both at cabinet members and Grant Shapps – whose attempted coup fizzled out after a backlash from colleagues – Davidson claimed colleagues had forgotten that they were lucky to be serving the country. “It is not and should never be about private ambition.” She added that “lying in wait [is Jeremy Corbyn’s] neo-Marxist government ready to take over”. In further signs of angst within the party between the most ardent Brexit supporters and those who campaigned for remain, the Tory MP Nadine Dorries told ITV’s Peston on Sunday she believed it was wrong to focus on Johnson. She said May should sack her chancellor, Philip Hammond, arguing that any attempt to put the brakes on Brexit would not be forgiven by voters. Davidson disagreed, telling Robert Peston that May should “absolutely not” remove her chancellor, and arguing that it was his job to set out how different Brexit outcomes would affect the British economy. Davidson refused to say whether she would want to run to become a Tory MP in 2022, opening the door to the possibility of becoming a future leader. Asked about the issue, she said: “I’ve got a job at the moment. I’m not looking beyond 2021.” Davidson argued that she was focused on making the party in Scotland a credible alternative government, insisting: “This is my job right now.” Meanwhile, the former Tory prime minister John Major launched a blistering attack on “self absorbed and, frankly, disloyal behaviour” within his party over recent weeks. He strongly criticised those who had tried to manoeuvre against May. “Their conduct has undermined their own party, their own prime minister, and their own government. It is profoundly unbecoming and it must stop,” he wrote in the Mail on Sunday, claiming the public were desperate for the government to speak for them. “The British people are sick and tired of the navel-gazing that has dominated the news headlines, all of which has been deeply unedifying to behold.” May’s comments, in an interview with the Sunday Times, are part of an effort to get on to the front foot as MPs return to parliament this week after a damaging conference season. After days of Johnson dominating the headlines, the prime minister finished the week with a speech that was overshadowed by a prankster handing her a P45, an incessant cough and a problem with the staging. Asked if she could move the foreign secretary in an expected reshuffle, after claims that he was unsackable, she said: “It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I’m not going to start now. “I’m the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party.” The prime minister denied that she had cried after the speech and hit out at some of the media portrayals of her. “One minute journalists are accusing me of being an ice maiden or a robot, then they claim I’m a weeping woman in dire need of a good night’s sleep,” she told the newspaper. “The truth is, my feelings can be hurt, like everyone else, but I am pretty resilient.” She admitted the speech was an “uncomfortable” time but said she never considered abandoning the address. “I am not someone who gives up,” she said. The prime minister will be relieved that a decision by Downing Street to out Shapps as a figurehead of a potential coup attempt shut down any rebellion, as the vast majority of MPs turned on him for disloyalty. Johnson intervened by claiming that those hoping to take on the prime minister were “nutters” but did suggest that MPs had “sniffed the air” before an outpouring of loyalty. “Are we really going to be stampeded myopically over the edge of the gorge, with an election that no one wants?” he wrote in a Sunday Telegraph article. “Quo quo scelesti ruitis? as Horace put it at the beginning of a fresh bout of Rome’s ghastly civil wars, and which roughly translates as: what do you think you are doing you nutters? “From what I can see the Tory herd has refused to be so goaded. We have sniffed the air and turned sensibly away from the cliff.” However, there were claims that three serving cabinet ministers had discussed May’s future on Thursday – the day after her disastrous speech. And a number of other MPs have told the Guardian that they believe she should go. Meanwhile, the prime minister attracted sympathy from opposition leaders. The SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon told Andrew Marr she felt sorry for the prime minister, but that did not obscure the central problem for May. Speaking at the start of her party conference in Glasgow, she said: “The problem for Theresa May is she is a very weak prime minister presiding over a deeply divided party. It’s a massive problem for the country at the moment, and for the livelihood and living standards of everyone in the country.” Sturgeon dismissed claims by May that she and Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, had “saved the union” in June’s election after the Tories won 13 seats in Scotland, helping cut the Scottish National party’s constituencies from 56 to 35. Brexit and the Tories’ disarray was making the case for independence more and more compelling, Sturgeon said. “I think that the case becomes greater and stronger by the day,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T01:01:40Z","webTitle":"Web of Australian Adani solar companies leads to offshore tax havens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/18/web-of-australian-adani-solar-companies-leads-to-offshore-tax-havens","fields":{"headline":"Web of Australian Adani solar companies leads to offshore tax havens","bodyText":"Adani has spread its use of offshore tax havens to its Australian solar projects, providing another avenue that could allow the wealthy Indian family behind the transnational to legally minimise tax paid on income from local operations. Six companies linked to Adani’s renewables business, which chairman Gautam Adani wants to make the biggest in Australia by 2022, were registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 3 August. The companies all have Australian-based Adani executives as directors. But they fall into two groups – three companies in each – which follow a markedly different path to their ultimate owners. One trail leads back to Adani Enterprises, the stockmarket-listed company in India which is vying to build Australia’s largest coalmine, and in which the Adani family are the major shareholders. The other bypasses the public company in India entirely, leading back to the Adani family via privately owned companies based in the Cayman and British Virgin islands, recognised tax havens. The companies were registered a month before the energy giant said it would proceed with “one of the world’s most advanced solar energy plants” at Rugby Run near Moranbah, the largest of three plants Adani proposes in central Queensland and South Australia. Gautam Adani trumpeted the group’s Australian solar ambitions when announcing a power purchasing agreement for Rugby Run with an unnamed but “significant power retailer”. “We are the largest generator of solar energy in India and we aim to replicate that in Australia,” he said. Adani bought Rugby Run – a former cattle property once earmarked as a rail thoroughfare for transporting coal from its contentious Carmichael mine – for $1 on 9 June last year from Queensland beef barons the Acton family, transfer documents show. The site gives its name to one of three companies that signal the start of the tax haven trail from the Australian solar business: Adani Rugby Run Operations Pty Ltd, Adani Renewable Operations Pty Ltd and Adani Renewable Operations Holdings Pty Ltd. All three companies have a parent company in Singapore, Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd, which was incorporated in January with Vinod Shantilal Adani as sole director. Singapore company filings show Global Renewable Energy Holding Pte Ltd is owned by Atulya Resources Ltd in the Cayman Islands. Atulya Resources is in turn owned by ARFT Holding Ltd in the British Virgin Islands. Documents held by the Singapore corporate regulator disclose that “the Adani Family” is an ultimate shareholder of ARFT Holding Ltd. Back in Australia, the other three companies registered in August were Adani Renewable Assets, Adani Renewable Asset Holdings and Adani Rugby Run. They are held by Adani Global Pte Ltd in Singapore, which is held by Adani Global Ltd in Mauritius, in turn owned by the public company Adani Enterprises Ltd in India. Adam Walters, the principal researcher for Energy Resource Insights, who uncovered the new tax haven links, said Adani’s use of tax havens and parallel company structures was entirely legal. But he said they could enable the Adani family to generate income from operating the solar farms, via agreements with the public Indian parent company that owned the assets. These profits could then be channelled to the Adani family via the Cayman and British Virgin islands, which would have favourable tax implications for them, Walters said. “Rather than benefit because of their shareholdings in listed companies in India where they have to pay lots of tax, they could benefit via the British Virgin Islands,” he said. “What could well be the case is the listed companies have got the money behind them, they can build the things, but then the profits can be generated in the family-owned businesses.” Walters said this was a pattern suggested elsewhere in Adani’s corporate structures around Australian mine and rail projects. It arose when Adani Mining had an opportunity to dispose of a future liability worth billions, in the form of a $2 a tonne royalty deed held by the original owner of the Carmichael mine site, Linc Energy. When a distressed Linc agreed to offload the deed for $150m in 2014, it was not Adani Mining that bought it. Instead, Adani Mining lent $150m to an Adani family-held trust, linked to the rail project, to snap it up. “This means that the family could potentially receive over a billion dollars in the Caribbean even if the mine is unprofitable in Australia,” Walters said. “Adani Mining, rather than spending $150m, now have an IOU on their balance sheet for $150m. In the short term, the company looks healthier than it actually is and in the longer term, if the mine does go ahead then the Adani family make the money.” The trust that could enrich the family through coal royalties is held via the same tax haven companies as the solar companies. The $150m was one of several multimillion-dollar loans in Australia by public Adani company subsidiaries to private Adani family-owned companies. “If [the solar business] is the same as elsewhere, we know the Adani family has not actually put a single dollar into Australia – they’re inter-company loans to the family from the listed company,” Walters said. He said there were another three trusts registered by Adani in Australia around the solar projects but “beneficial ownership of these remains unclear at this stage”. The chief executive of Adani Mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, has dismissed any suggestion the Australian operations would be “hiding profits” via holding companies in tax havens. “There is absolutely no implication of this, as everything that is being done in Australia or in India is transparent,” he told India’s Economic Times. “We make regular filings to the tax offices and government authorities. This report is a desperate attempt by the activists who were not able to legally stall the [Carmichael] project or get the government to do it. “This is their last attempt to hurt the goodwill we enjoy, but we are going ahead with the project as planned.” The 175-megawatt plant would rate among Australia’s biggest solar projects, along with Adani’s proposed 100MW farm at Crinium Creek, also in central Queensland, and a 140MW far near Whyalla in South Australia. Adani is the largest solar generator in India. Adani declined to comment on the company arrangements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/09/harry-winks-confident-place-england-world-cup-squad","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T21:30:30Z","webTitle":"Harry Winks sets sights on World Cup squad place after strong England debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/09/harry-winks-confident-place-england-world-cup-squad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/09/harry-winks-confident-place-england-world-cup-squad","fields":{"headline":"Harry Winks sets sights on World Cup squad place after strong England debut","bodyText":"Harry Winks has no doubt he could perform for England at the 2018 World Cup after a fine debut for Gareth Southgate’s side in the 1-0 victory against Lithuania on Sunday. The 21-year-old was drafted into the squad for the final two qualifiers after Manchester City’s Fabian Delph was forced out by injury. Winks did not feature in the 1-0 home win against Slovenia on Thursday but the Tottenham midfielder played in all of the win against Lithuania. Winks impressed in the central midfield role in which he was given licence to move forward and caught the eye with his ability to create. Southgate’s side have been criticised for lacking this dimension behind the attack, and Winks’s display may persuade the manager to offer him further opportunity. “I trust my ability and believe I am good enough to play at this level,” Winks said. “All I can do is keep performing for Tottenham and then for England if I get the opportunity … It is a long way away and all I can do is work hard, stay level-headed and keep trying to improve and do everything I possibly can. Of course it is something I’ve dreamed of, to be able to say I’ve been to the World Cup.” Winks praised Mauricio Pochettino, his club manager, for his guidance after making his full Premier League debut last November. Winks scored in that 3-2 defeat of West Ham United but there have been only three league starts since. Winks is the 12th player coached by Pochettino at Southampton or Tottenham to get an England debut.Winks said: “He is a top manager but a top man as well. He is someone always there to give you advice and he breeds confidence around the camp. He gives everyone that confidence to just go and show what they have got. As a player that is the most important thing. “Obviously when you get that opportunity, not only is it great for the manager to do it, but as players we have to justify it. I can say I’ve done that with the manager but not only has he helped me physically and technically, he’s helped me mentally and that is something I can’t thank him enough for. “He says not to get too ahead of yourself, try to find that balance with everyone in the squad, especially with me first getting in the [Tottenham] team as it was difficult for opportunities. He congratulated me [on the call-up], dropped me a text and said it was deserved.” Southgate, who also gave a debut to Harry Maguire in Lithuania, said: “Winks is a real plus because we were thinking people like Delph would come in [the squad reckoning], but Winks was one we thought might take longer. But [this] was the perfect game to give Winks a feel of playing for England. But I am also conscious he’s a very young player and at a very formative stage of his career.” Winks had expected to play for the under-21s before Delph left the squad. “We were all at St George’s Park,” he said. “I got the text from the under-21s manager [Aidy Boothroyd] to come to the dressing room and I went in there and he told me I was promoted to the senior squad. I was in shock. I didn’t really believe it. Then he took me up to see Gareth and luckily it all went well.” Winks has also attracted attention for wearing boots that are black and unbranded. “I’m not getting into that,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/09/barbarians-first-womens-team-debut-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T21:00:29Z","webTitle":"Barbarians women’s team to make historic debut in Ireland in November","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/09/barbarians-first-womens-team-debut-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/09/barbarians-first-womens-team-debut-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Barbarians women’s team to make historic debut in Ireland in November","bodyText":"The Barbarians will on Tuesday officially launch its first-ever women’s team with the side set to make their debut in Ireland next month in what can be considered further evidence of the growth of women’s rugby. The invitational side will run out for the first time against Munster at Thomond Park on 10 November – taking to the field before the men’s side face Tonga – and will be led by Giselle Mather, a World Cup-winner with England and currently the Wasps director of rugby. Players from seven nations including New Zealand, France and Canada have already been recruited for the match, which will be followed by future contests against international sides, with a full schedule to be confirmed later this year. In August the Women’s World Cup in Ireland broke numerous records in terms of attendances and TV viewing figures – a peak of 2.65m watched New Zealand beat England in the final on ITV – while the Rugby Football Union has committed to investing £2.4m into revamping its women’s domestic league. “We’re delighted to open a new chapter in the Barbarian FC’s history with the creation of our women’s team this season,” said the chairman, John Spencer. “Its formation is something we’ve been working towards for a number of years and it is a reflection of the excellence of the global women’s game which was showcased so brilliantly at this year’s World Cup. “Our aim is to welcome more talented players into this iconic club to forge new friendships and play with the style and passion for which the Barbarians are famous. We are working with clubs and unions around the world to make sure it benefits the players and the game.” Among the players already confirmed to face Munster are England’s Megan Goddard and Claire Cripps – who was part of the 2014 World Cup-winning squad – as well as the former Ireland captain Fiona Coghlan. Scotland’s Susie Brown, New Zealand’s three-times World Cup-winner Emma Jensen, France’s Christelle Le Duff and Kelly Russell of Canada will also take the field at Thomond Park. “The Barbarians are one of the reasons I fell in love with rugby and to be coaching this side is a massive honour,” Mather said. “It’s going to be a massive opportunity for all these athletes. The state of the women’s game is phenomenal at the moment following events like the World Cup and the launch of the Premier 15s in England. With the Barbarians coming in on top of that it’s taking the game to a different level.” The Barbarians men’s team will face New Zealand at Twickenham on 4 November to celebrate the All Blacks’ 125th anniversary before facing Tonga six days later. The Pro14 has announced that a playoff between the two fourth-placed teams in each conference at the end of the season will determine who takes the seventh and final qualification place in next season’s Champions Cup. From the start of this season there is no longer a guaranteed Champions Cup place for at least one team per country in the Pro14 but the addition of the two South African franchises – who are at this stage not eligible for the Champions or Challenge Cup – led to the creation of two conferences, which initially muddied the waters as to how the seventh qualifier would be determined."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/09/new-york-comic-con-2017-what-we-learned","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T22:00:14Z","webTitle":"X-Files, Superman and gun control: five things we learned from New York Comic Con","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/09/new-york-comic-con-2017-what-we-learned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/09/new-york-comic-con-2017-what-we-learned","fields":{"headline":"X-Files, Superman and gun control: five things we learned from New York Comic Con","bodyText":"Superman’s return in Justice League is an open secret The final trailer for Joss Whedon’s superhero epic debuted on Sunday at New York Comic Con, and it looks like Henry Cavill’s man of steel won’t be confined to his coffin for long. The promo opens with Amy Adams’s Lois Lane dreaming of Clark Kent, as we see the other members of the Justice League (Batman, the Flash, Wonder Woman and Cyborg) going head to head with Steppenwolf and his army of invading Parademons.The only problem here is that Justice League’s battle scenes look an awful lot like the ones directed by Zack Snyder in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Why is it that every time the Earth comes under attack in these movies, all semblance of realism goes out the window and our heroes are imported wholesale into what appears to be Hades: The Video Game? The painful cover version of David Bowie’s Heroes that plays throughout certainly sounds like the kind of tune that probably plays on loop in hell. Wonder Woman’s creator seems to have mostly empowered himself Wonder Woman may have taken 80 years to get to the big screen, but she’s certainly making up for lost time. The final trailer for Angela Robinson’s Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, which tells the story of the superhero’s unorthodox creation, serves up more Wonder Woman fare after Patty Jenkins’ blockbuster. The psychologist William Moulton Marston is widely considered to have created Diana of Themyscira in order to satisfy his own bondage fetishism, as much as to advance the cause of his own particularly idiosyncratic vision of feminism. But he seems to get off rather lightly here, with the trailer striking something of an elegiac tone. By casting the handsome and affable Luke Evans as Marston, alongside the captivating Rebecca Hall (as Elizabeth Holloway Marston), Robinson seems to be painting her subject as a harmless, rather charming goon, rather than a creepy jerk. Michelle Yeoh’s Captain Georgiou will return to Star Trek: Discovery Saturday’s panel for CBS All Access’s slick and spiky revival of the long-running space saga was notable for the revelation that the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon actor might not have fired her final phaser. Georgiou was killed off in the second episode of the first season following the mutinous actions of Sonequa Martin-Green’s Michael Burnham, but Yeoh seemed pretty determined that we haven’t seen the last of her, telling the crowd: “I’m not going to let them kill me, okay?” Showrunner Gretchen J Berg later confirmed that Georgiou will be back, and those who caught last night’s fourth episode will probably have a good idea how (spoiler alert). Will this be anything more than a temporary return? John Boyega follows in Idris Elba’s footsteps for Pacific Rim 2 When it comes to giant robot movies, give me Guillermo Del Toro’s Pacific Rim over Michael Bay’s meatheaded Transformers franchise any day of the week. The Mexican director’s bonkers 2013 kaiju flick came wrapped up in a huge bubble of joy, with Del Toro clearly having the time of his life imagining the most preposterous kaiju possible and sending them hurtling through the void to take on mankind’s equally cool mega-machine defence systems. The only problem with Pacific Rim: Uprising, the debut trailer for which hit NYCC on Friday, is that Del Toro isn’t actually directing, and most of the cast we care about have also neglected to return. So in place of Charlie Hunnam’s Raleigh Becket, we have John Boyega’s Jake Pentecost, son of Idris Elba’s rousing Gen Pentecost in the original movie. Is Boyega as good at winding up the troops as his dad (brilliant sample line: “Today we are cancelling the apocalypse!”)? In short: no. But at least the young Star Wars actor gets to do his own accent for the first time sinceAttack the Block. The Punisher’s gun fetish causes controversy One of NYCC’s biggest talking points was the cancellation of Marvel’s panel for The Punisher, its forthcoming Netflix show about the vigilante antihero (played by Jon Bernthal). The studio decided to act in the wake of the horrific Las Vegas attack in which a lone gunman killed 58 people and injured countless more last week. The thinking here seems to be that a show about a hero whose only superpowers are hatred and skill with military-grade weaponry isn’t the sort of thing to be celebrating in the wake of America’s deadliest mass shooting in modern history. It’s a fair point, and one those who turn their nose up at more traditional superheroes might do well to remember. However ridiculous Superman, Wonder Woman and their ornately costumed friends might be on the face of it, at least they do not need semi-automatic weapons to help them win the day. The X-Files’ Cigarette Smoking Man gets an origin story At Sunday’s X-Files panel for the sci-fi show’s upcoming 11th season, its creator, Chris Carter, revealed we’ll be getting another look at the past of Mulder and Scully’s greatest nemesis, William B Davis’s nefarious Cigarette Smoking Man. Given the show’s fourth season revealed that the sinister, chain-smoking government conspiracist was responsible for the assassinations of both John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Hr – only for the key episode’s denouement to reveal it may have been little more than smoke and mirrors – viewers might have to decide for themselves if they can trust the narrative this time around. An even greater danger in season 11 might be our heroic duo’s son, William, who according to Scully must be stopped “before he releases hell on Earth”. The Stephen Kingnaissance ain’t over yet The first trailer for Hulu’s series Castle Rock, which debuted during Saturday’s NYCC panel for the show, is one of those teasers that doesn’t give much away at all. But there are Easter eggs galore, from the casting of Carrie’s Sissy Spacek to a shot of a vehicle marked “Shawshank State Prison” sinking into a lake. The title is a reference to the fictional Maine town featured in many of the suspense icon’s books. Spacek described the JJ Abrams series as “an homage to Stephen King”. We’ll have to wait and see which characters appear, but would it be too much to hope for a cameo from Pennywise the clown, given Bill Skarsgård has also joined the cast?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/why-i-wish-my-parents-had-spent-22000-on-naming-me","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T12:30:33Z","webTitle":"Why I wish my parents had spent £22,000 on naming me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/why-i-wish-my-parents-had-spent-22000-on-naming-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/why-i-wish-my-parents-had-spent-22000-on-naming-me","fields":{"headline":"Why I wish my parents had spent £22,000 on naming me","bodyText":"I spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to get the names of the characters in my novels right. So devoted am I to this task that I wander through my local cemetery with a notebook collecting promising examples (I am still toying with the possibilities suggested by the latest addition to my collection, a man evocatively memorialised as “Roger Mycock”). But this is not just a literary concern. Naming your children correctly is even more crucial than christening fictional characters. The process of naming is, in a strange sense, magical or, at least, powerful. Unfortunately, as the naming of people takes place when they are unborn or only just born, you don’t have any character to match the name to. This being the case, most rely on tradition (Muhammad or Patrick), family history (all my children have some family element to their first and second names – grandparents’ names, etc), class aspiration (one can hardly imagine Jacob Rees-Mogg naming his son Wayne instead of Sixtus) and desperately hoped-for “originality” (Gravity, Zowie, Heavenly Hiraani). Perhaps character partially coalesces around a name (I cannot help believing this of the late Mr Mycock, even though I have no evidence). I have no idea why my parents called me Timothy, but I have never stopped wishing they hadn’t. As Will Self (was ever a name more evocative of its owner?) has gleefully pointed out, literary Tims never seem to make it into the top rank. Sorry, Messrs Winton, Pears and Parks – you are all fine writers, but you are simply not as likely to make it into the canon as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie or F Scott Fitzgerald. (Phoenicia Hebebe Dobson-Mouawad, who wrote in this newspaper about her difficulties with her unwieldy name, should seriously consider a career in writing.) For reasons I could never fathom, I always wanted to be called Frank. But you are stuck with what you have, and I am stuck in a canyon of forgettability and implied mediocrity. Worse still, Tim has not only been tedious but straightforwardly mockable since Harry Enfield came up with his character Tim Nice-But-Dim. My parents didn’t know it was going to be this way. They thought Timothy was “nice”. But that’s the point. When choosing names for children, avoiding ones that are easy to take the rise out of is very tricky. Of my four daughters, one has a first name that rhymes with an unpleasant disease, another with a mammary gland and a third that means weak or crybaby. Apparently, there is a Swiss company that charges £22,000 to find the perfect name for your baby. They employ 14 names experts, four historians and 12 translators, who spend more than 100 hours creating a list of 15 to 25 potential names before helping to whittle them down to one. Pricey, but I would have been grateful to my parents for making such an investment. Getting it wrong can be bad – calling a kid who ends up with a weight problem Nelly is unlikely to work out well – although there is wrong and really wrong. Last year, for instance, a woman in Wales was legally prevented from calling her child Cyanide. Actually, thinking about Cyanide (or Sixtus, for that matter), perhaps Tim isn’t so bad. It could have been worse, particularly with my surname. Noah, Costa, Jamaica and Lancer spring to mind. I would still have preferred Frank – but even then I wouldn’t have been safe. My desire is to be the Frank conjured by Tom Waits in Frank’s Wild Years – louche, cool and dissolute. But with my luck – and propensity for falling over, bumping into things and breaking valuable gewgaws – the association in people’s minds would almost certainly have ended up as Frank Spencer. timlottwriter.wordpress.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/15/robert-plant-carry-fire-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Robert Plant: Carry Fire review – more of a good thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/15/robert-plant-carry-fire-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/15/robert-plant-carry-fire-review","fields":{"headline":"Robert Plant: Carry Fire review – more of a good thing","bodyText":"In recent years Robert Plant has been defined by a stylistic restlessness, but his 11th solo album doesn’t deviate wildly in tone from 2014’s Lullaby and … the Ceaseless Roar.

Piqué, who plays at centre-back for Barcelona and the Spanish national team, vigorously defended the right to vote; he recalled the dark years of the Franco dictatorship, and lamented the return of police brutality during the referendum. It was widely assumed that he voted in favour of an independent Catalonia. Yet within 48 hours, Piqué was training with the Spanish national team alongside his madridista – Real Madrid – team-mates. The apparent paradox was echoed in the chants directed against Piqué during training sessions, which – politely translated – informed him that “Spain is your nation” while telling him to “go back to your country”. It is a paradox deeply embedded in Iberian history. In regions such as Catalonia, Galicia, and the Basque country, simultaneous and competing loyalties have often made for uneasy bedfellows (and team-mates). Spanish politicians invoke the word “democracy” with a frequency that suggests deep-rooted uncertainty about its longevity and stability. But Piqué’s call for dialogue suggests that these tensions could be contained and controlled. The independence movement, he claimed, was like the outburst of an 18-year-old threatening to leave home. “If you talk to him,” he suggested, “maybe he won’t leave.” Piqué’s metaphor downplays the role of parents in provoking teenage outbursts. Back in 2010, in response to a case brought by the then-opposition People’s party, the Spanish constitutional court ruled many articles in the Catalan statute of autonomy unconstitutional. Yet in at least one respect he was right: the crisis has until recently fed on a desire for justice and self-assertion that is more widespread than the aspiration for a total rupture. This is reflected in the vacillations of the current Catalan leadership – President Carles Puigdemont, who speaks for a conservative nationalist base, has so far refrained from making a unilateral declaration of independence, holding his cards close to his chest in advance of Tuesday’s pivotal meeting of the Catalan parliament. Some members of the unwieldy nationalist coalition are holding out for independence. But the pugilistic posturing of nationalists on both sides has polarised a Catalan population that has been generally inclined to productive resolutions of political and economic grievances. The rise of Ada Colau, the Barcelona mayor who is closely allied to Pablo Iglesias and other leaders of the Podemos party, points to Catalans’ frustration at the brutal effects of the austerity policies pursued by corrupt oligarchies in Madrid and Barcelona after 2008, but also to their willingness to support a politician working within a national left movement. “Escombrem-los!” (“Sweep them away!”) read the slogan on one pre-referendum poster, showing a Catalan woman brushing a panicked circus of cartoon villains into the Mediterranean: prime minister and former prime minister Mariano Rajoy and José Maria Aznar; King Felipe VI; Cardinal Antonio Cañizares; and a cluster of corrupt regional politicians. “Drain the swamp,” it might have read, if Barcelona were located on the same mythical terrain as Washington. But on neither side of the Atlantic is nationalism an effective response either to the immediate social crisis or its underlying problem: the emaciation of the welfare state and the precarious economic condition of the working class. Any search for a resolution must start with the national dialogue that many prominent Catalans – and others – have called for. But this is unlikely to be generated spontaneously by the principal parties involved. Throughout the crisis, Rajoy has exacerbated tensions, forcing the hand of his Catalan opponents in what looks suspiciously like the pursuit of electoral advantage. Meanwhile, the signals sent by Saturday’s white-shirted, pro-dialogue demonstrations have been scrambled by protests in favour of national unity, culminating in yesterday’s massive anti-independence demonstration in Barcelona. While many of the unity demonstrators are motivated by high-minded ideals, the mobilisation of fierce nationalist sentiments has also awakened civic violence, and will take months, if not years, to reverse. International intervention will therefore be critical in reducing tensions and stabilising Spain. The court of international opinion is the only arena outside Catalonia in which the government in Madrid is currently losing. Diplomatic pressure should be applied on Rajoy to recognise the Catalonian government as a legitimate interlocutor, and to move more decisively away from any semblance of adherence to a Francoist ideal of unity. Progressive forces in the Spanish Socialist party should be encouraged to speak out in favour of dialogue, and against the destabilisation of democracy in Spain by any party, including the central government. Dialogue must go beyond the current binary debate. It should explore a variety of potential relationships between Catalonia and the central state government, and embrace the possibility of constitutional reform. It might contemplate a second referendum, requiring a two-thirds super-majority, to be held in late 2018. Meanwhile, the Catalan and Spanish governments alike should lose no time in reversing the economic and social policies that have inflicted suffering on the Catalan working class. All parties must acknowledge that the brutalisation of civilian populations, whether through direct police action or even greater economic austerity, will further undermine Spanish democracy. • Simon Doubleday is a professor of history at Hofstra University, in New York.

She is known for her critically acclaimed releases The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas (2013) and debut album Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit (2015). Over in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kurt Vile is the former lead guitarist of the War on Drugs; he has released six solo albums including Smoke Ring for My Halo (2011). Together they have collaborated on the album Lotta Sea Lice, out now on Matador/Marathon Artists/Milk!. How did you and Kurt meet? We kept bumping into each other on tours and festivals, and we became friends over music and movies and TV and just making stupid jokes – we both have a similar sense of humour. How did the project come about? He emailed me one day out of the blue and said he had a song in mind he thought would work as a duet, or with my voice. So the next time he was in Australia we booked a studio and just started from there, with one song, then another song. We definitely didn’t have a clear idea at the start. We just trusted our guts, and whatever felt like the best option for the song was what normally won out. It wasn’t too ego-heavy. What are the differences in the way you approach music? I think it’s quite similar – we both have some of the same little writing paranoias. But I have noticed since knowing him that he keeps on creating stuff constantly, and that’s where we differ. I tend to stand back and wait until something seems perfect, which is never, so it takes me a lot longer to get things done. But every time I text him he’s either on tour or in the studio, which I find really inspiring. It seems like the third presence is [Barnett’s partner] Jen Cloher: she’s the support act on tour and there’s a cover of one of her songs. What’s her influence on the album? A lot. She’s just a huge constant influence. We’ve been together for six years or so, so I think everything I do is influenced by Jen. We run the Milk! record label together in Melbourne, and I play guitar in Jen’s band, so we’re touring next year for her new album. You’ve said that you and Jen fell in love to the Kurt Vile album Smoke Ring for My Halo. Why do you think music is so good at capturing particular times in our lives? It’s such a strong force. We forget sometimes that music really shapes so many memories because we get used to it being there – music’s everywhere, like in the supermarket – so you just kind of ignore it. But the nostalgic side of it is that it gets implanted in those memories, no matter how good or bad the music is [laughs]. If it relates to an important part of your life, it’s always going to affect you in whatever way that moment did. That’s pretty cool. Do you get people telling you about what your music reminds them of in their lives? Yeah, and I love hearing those stories because it affects everyone so differently. Every now and then a couple will be, like: “We got together to your music” or “We met at your show”. Or some people say they were going through a really hard time when they happened to come across the music and it helped them through stuff. It’s nice to be reminded of how powerful music can be, especially when you have moments of thinking, what’s the point of writing it? On the tour in America you’ll be donating $1 from every ticket to the American Civil Liberties Union. Why is their work important to you? It’s always important, but especially in the last year, everything just gets worse and worse. It’s easy to feel helpless and hopeless and completely lost in this weird, fucked-up world. It’s hard, because it feels like most people who listen to my music will probably be of a like-minded persuasion, so am I just preaching to that choir? But I know I constantly need encouragement from people I admire, so it’s nice to know there’s a whole lot of people fighting for the right thing. On the album you talk about the challenges of keeping intercontinental friendships going. What are your tips? [Laughs] Erm, I don’t feel like I’m very good at it most of the time – all you can do is stay in touch as best you can. I stopped using Facebook years ago, but I just email everyone, send photos. The social media world is weird because you kind of feel you have nothing left to say – it’s like, “Didn’t you see my post? Don’t you know I’ve been on holiday?” I’ve had weird moments when you catch up with someone and you sit down to tell each other your stories, but you already know everything because you’ve seen it on Instagram. But then it’s nice to see what your friends are doing. Continental Breakfast has the most wholesome rock video ever. Are you at a time in your life when you’re embracing domesticity? We were trying to capture the idea of not being on tour, and being around family and friends who are basically family. I like a balance – I’ve always been a bit of a homebody, but I also love travelling. In the artwork you play off the fact that you and Kurt seem to have quite similar fashion styles – do you share tips on haircare and clothes? Ha, not at all. We decided on the black and white, yin and yang thing, but we didn’t overthink it too much – I think we’re both pretty casual."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/11/sugar-money-jane-harris-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T11:01:10Z","webTitle":"Sugar Money by Jane Harris review – slavery obscured by a rollicking adventure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/11/sugar-money-jane-harris-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/11/sugar-money-jane-harris-review","fields":{"headline":"Sugar Money by Jane Harris review – slavery obscured by a rollicking adventure","bodyText":"Jane Harris’s first two historical novels showcased the voices of unsung, socially disadvantaged characters: a young Irish immigrant in The Observations, an elderly Victorian spinster in Gillespie and I. Harris is an empathetic and intelligent writer, with an instinct for the delicate alchemy that produces page-turners. In her third novel, based on a true story, Harris takes us to 1765 and the voice of Lucien, a “mulatto” slave who is “thirteen or fourteen or thereabouts”, and has been brought over to Martinique from his native Grenada. Lucien works tending livestock on a plantation run by French friars. His only family is older brother Emile, who works “a long day hike away”. Lucien is a vivid character from the first page: when called from the cows to his master’s side, he responds to the slack-jawed messenger with the delicious scorn of youth (“he had froth at the corner of his mouth from which signs I deem him to be of no startling intelligence”), while exhibiting a soft centre in regard to the animals (“She had the fluffiest, most velvety ears of any cow you did see”). The summons is important: Father Cleophas wants the brothers to undertake a highly suspect mission. They must return to Grenada and smuggle back 42 slaves, former property of the friars, but claimed by English invaders when they took over that island two years ago. Celeste, Emile’s former sweetheart, is among them. Cleophas says the endeavour is blessed by the English governor of Grenada, but also warns that the plantation overseers strongly contest their claim. Harris’s decision to cast this as an adventure story – tremulous tone and all – seems intended to express the joie de vivre of our young protagonist. Her gentle beginning barely nods to slavery’s barbarity. What with the humorous references to the eccentric “dummie” of a ship’s captain, Bianco, who swigs rum as he whisks them across the sea, and with Lucien’s hero-worship of Emile and Emile’s longing for Celeste, readers may feel as if they’re on a jolly themselves. By the time they reach Grenada, and begin to convince their old friends to return with them, I wanted to scribble a huge note in the margin as a reminder that slaves have been sent to gather other slaves, and that the 289-kilometre trip from Grenada back to Martinique would be a journey into more slavery. Some might argue that Harris shows deliberate restraint so that the eventual violence hits more strongly, and certainly when she does describe the physical and psychological horrors she pulls no punches. Emile and Lucien witness the atrocities of British rule, and must face what has happened to Celeste since they left. Mounting fear becomes visceral. By the time we reach the story’s thundering and inevitable climax, I had nearly forgiven this early restraint – nearly. I still think it’s a tactic that compromises authenticity and tone for too long. The violence of slavery was unremitting. There was no respite; it permeated all aspects of life, and was meant to do so. Viet Thanh Nguyen, in an article in the Los Angeles Times about the complex issue of white writers creating black characters, says it is “not simply an act of culture and free speech, but one that is enmeshed in a complicated, painful history of ownership and division”. I think Harris understands that complexity; and she does a heartfelt job of evoking this time and place. Her research is clearly extensive and her characters are well rounded. The language of the period is sure and consistent. But there are blind spots. When the brothers meet their old friend Chevallier, he tells them whipping has been cut back because it impedes productivity; “other punishment” is being applied. When Emile presses him to explain further, Chevallier demurs to protect Lucien: “Hard to say – bad things.” Harris wants this journey to sweep away Lucien’s innocence, but his back has already been torn by the whip. Lucien says it himself: “I am a man already.” As I climbed through Grenada’s lush vegetation with Lucien, I couldn’t help but think of Harris on my bookshelf, alongside Colson Whitehead’s searingly original Underground Railroad, Marlon James’s uncompromisingly brutal The Book of Night Women, and Caryl Phillips’s wonderfully characterised Cambridge. It is appropriate to ask what an author brings to an established canon. By the time I dared to consider the spine of Toni Morrison’s Beloved leaning against Sugar Money, the game was up. Harris spends sentences on moments that Morrison would explore for pages; many readers will find this novel a suitably affecting introduction to this brutal subject and its themes, but for me the work of those authors who have gone before Harris will eclipse Sugar Money. This is a tale that has already been told, in so many complex, beautiful ways and will be told again, not least by writers who will not be read or promoted as widely as Harris. Pointing this out may be unfair to a writer who has worked so hard – but such risks arise, when one is ambitious and steps into this particular fray. • Leone Ross’s Come Let Us Sing Anyway is published by Peepal Tree.

The high acid of vinegar, for one, can overwhelm softer styles of wine, masking the flavours and leaving your mouth with little but alcohol to be getting on with. With those soused mackerels and pickles, then, the only choice is to match tartness with tartness, which means a white wine with plenty of acidity – a style that also happens to be the best to cut through the oily flesh of mackerel (with or without vinegar). Chablis, the Basque wine Txacoli, or a limey dry Australian riesling are candidates, as is Domaine la Haute Févrie’s superior, super-racy, mineral muscadet. Tandem Syrah du Maroc, Morocco 2013 (from £14.95, Yapp Brothers; Borough Wines) With fiery spices – whether Szechuan pepper, ginger or, in the case of Rosie’s chermoula paste, the combination of paprika, garlic and chilli – it’s not acid but sugar, or at least an impression of sweetness, that I often find myself turning to. The sugar in an off-dry white such as the stone-fruit-filled Australian Alsace-alike Tesco Finest McLaren Vale/Adelaide Hills SR 2016 (£8) would act as a kind of cushion for the heat in Rosie’s marinade. Another option, particularly if you go a little easier on the chilli, is a rich and spicy warm-climate red with enough flesh and presence to out-muscle the spice. Given the origins of chermoula, the sweetly spiced, ripe plum and fig of top Rhône winemaker Alain Graillot’s Moroccan syrah would make an apt and satisfying combination. Regina Viarum Mencía, Ribeira Sacra, Spain 2016 (£11.50, The Wine Society) Rosie’s satsuma salad has a little bit of sweetness from the honey, and plenty of acidity in the citrus and vinegar, but it’s really all about the invigorating interplay of the tanginess and bitterness in the fresh fruit and vegetables. A white style that shares those qualities is Austrian grüner veltliner, which often has a kind of herbal-greenness and a pleasingly bitter snap in the finish that is reminiscent of fennel or endive. Marks &amp; Spencer has a lively example in Rabl Grüner Veltliner, Kamptal Austria 2015 (£9.50). The brightness of pomegranate and satsuma dish would also work with a high-acid red that goes easy on the tannins and big on pure red fruit. Regina Viarum Galician Mencía is particularly supple and juicy.

In a democracy dissent must be allowed and the voice of the opposition must be heard. Brexiters, rather than listen to the dissenters, seek to silence them. The abuse directed at Philip Hammond by leavers (Tory Brexiters turn their fire on Treasury, 9 October) suggests that they are unwilling to engage with the difficult reality of the negotiations; they just seek to suppress the uncomfortable facts. What we instead see is the encroachment of Orwell’s newspeak on the political dialogue: bad news is turned into good, the message in the media should be encouraging, inconvenient awkward facts about the costs of Brexit should be ignored and replaced by the warm words spoken about Brexit by such as James Dyson. One positive message from Dyson is more credible than the collective expressed anxieties of the CBI and the City. They seem to wish to control the political debate so that when the Brexit begins to have significant negative impact on the economy, both the media and Westminster remain on message, and so that when the negative effects of Brexit impact on people’s income, the media story will be one about wicked Europeans doing the British down that will absolve our political leaders from any blame for the post-Brexit economic mess. Derrick Joad Leeds • Bernard Jenkin’s opening words (A sad truth: on Brexit we just can’t trust the Treasury, 9 October) “there is no intrinsic reason why Brexit should be difficult or damaging” reveals the extent of the Brexiters’ delusions. No argument or expert opinion (other than those of known Brexiters) is evaluated. Vague slippery assertions such as “only a fraction of the UK economy is dependent on the EU” (“fraction” sounds small but the 44% of our trade with the EU is a large fraction) skate over the underlying economic risks which have alarmed so many. The EU is accused of being unreasonable by expecting the UK to stand by commitments and treaties it has already signed up to, when it is the UK that is trying to leave. The sad truth is that on Brexit not only can we not trust the Brexiters, we don’t even know what kind of Brexit they want. Why should we (or the Treasury) accept this kind of slippery thinking as justification for an act of national self-harm? James Churchill Baslow, Derbyshire • In contrast to Bernard Jenkin’s fantasy economics, a number of Ukippers that I came to know during my time as an East Midlands European Movement public speaker had no doubt that Brexit would damage the UK’s economy. They had the honesty to accept that the economic cost was a price worth paying to achieve their aims. Jenkin has now confirmed what many have feared for years: the core of the Conservative party simply does not understand how wealth is created; not by derivatives, banks or playing with other people’s money, but by manufacturing, design and hard graft. The CBI, IOD, EEF, FSB and TUC are not in a grand conspiracy. They are simply speaking the truth as evidenced by devaluation, inflation, loss of investment, flight of talented staff and companies, and a growing sense of gloom at the looming economic precipice that he seeks. Eric Goodyer Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland • Bernard Jenkin MP blames the UK Treasury and the EU for refusing to discuss and for blocking our global negotiations on trade deals. It would strengthen his case if he listed the nations eager to sign new low-tariff deals with Brexit UK; eg the US cancelling the 300% tariff on Canadian/UK planes. He cites, as fervent Brexiters, two private billionaires: Lord Bamford, with 17 far-east manufacturers and Caribbean mansions, and Sir James Dyson, whose workforce is 80% Malaysian. Both will survive a hard Brexit – outside the UK. Noel Hodson Oxford • There is something strangely Trumpian about Bernard Jenkin’s argument that Brexit would be oh so simple if only the Treasury (and the CBI, City, chancellor plus, I am sure, a host of other so-called experts) would accept the alternative facts presented by Bernard and his friends rather than follow their own professional judgment and experience. The implication of course is that they should either shape up or ship out to be replaced by those with greater faith. The obvious replacement candidates would be either Lewis Carroll or JM Barrie but for their untimely deaths. If, however, we were to all shut our eyes tight and say “I do believe in fairy stories” then I am sure that even that minor obstacle could be overcome. Colin Garwood Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire • Bernard Jenkin states that “The Treasury seems unable to hear any voices except those that reinforce their preconceptions. It seems blind to the facts…” Surely that very precisely describes his own position. What irony. Terry Holmes Pocklington, East Yorkshire • John Harris (If everyone picks a side, who’ll speak truth to power? 6 October) should be more careful with the words he chooses if he wants to convince me that his own journalism lives up to the standards he is setting for the profession. At the end of his extended interrogation of biased journalism, he makes a jibe at the “insanities of Brexit”, coupling it with Trump’s election. Is this an example of the dispassionate writing he wants to see? He is right to argue that journalists should be asking awkward questions – and his own inquisitive tour of Britain in 2016, asking people how they intended to vote in the referendum, was an eye-opener for me – but he is falling into the same habits as those he criticises. And wasn’t the journalist who challenged Dennis Skinner asking a loaded question when he suggested that Labour had not learned from the lessons of its high-spending past? Sure, we need some objective journalism in these hysterical times, but I’m not sure Harris is providing it in this article. Linda Edmondson Westbury, Shropshire • Dick Taverne proposes a new referendum but this time with the voters “knowing what Brexit actually means” (Letters, 6 October). The government made sure everyone knew the implications before the first referendum, spending nearly £10m distributing a booklet to 28m households. You didn’t have to open it to get the message. It was helpfully titled “Why the government believes that voting to remain in the EU is the best decision for the UK”. It warned of: increasing prices, falling living standards, job cuts, loss of single market access, a falling pound and so on. A majority of voters simply decided that the advantages, as they saw them, (sovereignty, control of laws and borders) outweighed the well-rehearsed financial disadvantages and went for Brexit.

Silver cloud drifting across the glen, golden sunlight on the peaks, it certainly is a magical spot. That “magical sound”, meanwhile, is the roaring of stags, the signature of the red deer rut. As the cuckoo is to spring, so the bellowing stag is to autumn in Scotland’s wild places. “It is,” says the stalker and gamekeeper, “one of nature’s great events.” Small and stocky, in his early 40s, Frost has two qualities which suit him to his trade: a low centre of gravity and a low voice. He is also a fine example of nominative determinism, having an intense love of winter (which round here can get down to -15C or so) and the sort of eyesight one might expect from a bird of prey. He seems able to spot deer at vast distances; the telescope slung across his body in a leather case is merely there to confirm the sighting. He also carries a rifle – deer are culled on Glenfalloch, and elsewhere in Scotland, in order to protect the environment from being overgrazed. The red deer is Britain’s largest land mammal. It is estimated there are 400,000 in Scotland, and approximately 50,000 in the rest of the UK, the vast majority of those in Exmoor, East Anglia and Cumbria. There are around 700 on Glenfalloch. This is hill country. Glenfalloch contains six Munros – peaks over 3,000 feet high – including Ben Lui, known as the queen of the Scottish mountains. Most of the folk walking on this land will be Munro-baggers, but, keeping off the paths, we don’t see a single soul all day. What we do see is deer, and plenty of them. From mid-September to early November, red deer display rutting behaviour; stags battling for the right to mate with as many hinds as possible. The biggest stags, when I see them roar, tilt their heads back and gape wildly, drawing attention to their powerful neck muscles and shaggy manes. This is usually enough to make challengers walk away, but sometimes it comes to a fight: the butt and clash of antlers. We are here just a bit too early in the season for me to witness these battles, but Frost explains that these great warriors, testosteroned and reckless, do sometimes get hurt or even killed, especially if one of them is a “switch”, also known as a “murder stag”, meaning that his antlers end in sharp points rather than cups. One stag can impregnate up to 30 to 40 hinds during the rut; they are known as his “harem”, a usage which gives him a despotic, sultry air. “You do feel as if you are spying on something you shouldn’t be seeing,” says Bella Lowes, a member of the family that owns the estate, as she passes me her binoculars. “It’s very primal.” Pure sex and death? She nods. “It is.” Experiencing the rut in the wild like this is utterly different from seeing it in the likes of Richmond Park. We walk for hours and miles for glimpses of deer, but what glimpses. Sixty or more gathered on a hillside, the biggest stag charging around, keeping his hinds together, warning off rivals. Smaller, younger stags loiter on the edges of the herd, newcomers at a dance, waiting for a chance to cut in and make a conquest. Stalking deer – getting close enough to hear the roar – is hard going. You walk into the wind so the animals don’t smell or hear you coming. You walk up the course of burns, keeping below the level of the bank, sometimes wading against the icy current. You crawl over cold bog, wrist deep in peaty water. There is a lot of sitting in silence, face lowered close to the ground; in these meditative moments one’s perspective distorts and the miniature world looms up. This is a landscape of browns and greens, but up close the colours pop. Pink lousewort, blue milkwort, yellow potentilla. The heather is full of a lichen known as stag moss; pale and branching, antler-like. Frost, stalking, is alive to wind and weather. He stoops now and then for a fist of grass, tossing it into the air to check the direction of the breeze, and shaking his head at the results, a diviner dissatisfied with the prophecy of the I Ching. He shot his first hind when he was nine, but he loves these animals, and – through close study of their behaviour – believes he has come to think like a deer. He adores the strategy of stalking, pitting his wits against these masters of evasion. Everything up until the pull of the trigger is a pleasure; the rest is duty. How, I ask him, does he feel when a deer is culled? “Remorse isn’t the word. But you’ve got to feel it. The day I lose that feeling, I shouldn’t be in the job.” What would he call the feeling? “Sadness,” he says. At a little before 5pm, Frost leads us on to the east face of the smaller Munro Beinn a’ Chleibh. The cloud has come down, grey and blinding. But we can hear the roar. Five or six stags, lost in the mist, bellowing at each other. It is a deep and defiant grunt, zealous and jealous. Keats had it wrong: there is nothing mellow about this fruitfulness. Anger, aggression, braggadocio and extreme sexual promiscuity are not characteristics and behaviours one would admire in a man, but in a stag they are undeniably impressive. When one of these beasts appears in silhouette, black-antlered and roaring on a nearby ridge, it has a heraldic quality: a rampant beast from a barbarian’s shield; or perhaps a cave painting glimpsed by torchlight. That roar ... it’s a rage against the dying of the year. It has been a privilege to experience it, especially in such a raw environment, feeling something of the wet and cold that these animals must endure as they struggle to survive as both individuals and a species. The rut has been going on for ever, and for ever may it continue echoing through these glens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/09/ritual-observance-of-pms-pious-pause","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T17:32:19Z","webTitle":"Ritual observance of PM’s pious pause | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/ritual-observance-of-pms-pious-pause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/09/ritual-observance-of-pms-pious-pause","fields":{"headline":"Ritual observance of PM’s pious pause","bodyText":"My father had one of those three-wheeled “invalid carriages” designed for driver only (Lorraine Gradwell obituary, 4 October).

Try looking at it differently","bodyText":"Psychologists are regularly berated for spending their workdays reaching blindingly obvious conclusions about the world – an accusation that isn’t entirely unwarranted. (My favourite recent finding comes from the journal Psychological Science: “Depressed individuals may fail to decrease sadness.”) At first glance, it’s tempting to respond that way to a new study from the University of British Columbia, explaining why people tend to assume that their friends have more friends, and lead less solitary lives, than they do. Can you guess? That’s right: because every single time we see our friends, they’re socialising. By definition. Assuming you don’t spy on your friends via telescope from treetops, you never see them at home alone in their pyjamas, eating pickled onion Monster Munch while watching The X Factor and feeling sorry for themselves. You’re never there when they wake in the dark at 3am, wondering where their lives are headed. Or, likewise, consider those happy throngs you glimpse through the windows of the bar you pass each day on your way home from work: doesn’t it seem like they’re always meeting friends at the bar? In fact, it’s a mathematical oddity that your friends do have slightly more friends than you do, on average. (Essentially, this is because people with large circles of friends are more likely to have you as a member of theirs.) But the main culprit, this new study confirms, is an observability bias. The more instances of something we encounter, the more significant we naturally assume it to be – and though we encounter our own solitude frequently, we never encounter other people’s. The distorted judgments we reach as a consequence have real emotional effects, the researchers found, leaving people with lower wellbeing and less of a sense of belonging. So, yes, the fact that we only ever experience loneliness when it’s happening to us is blindingly obvious, I suppose. But blindingly obvious in an almost literal sense: it’s so self-evident, we barely ever see it. And the bias isn’t limited to loneliness. It’s at the core of impostor syndrome: you assume you’re the only one with a constant inner voice of self-doubt, because you never hear anyone else’s. It’s also probably why other people’s problems seem so much easier to solve than our own: we see only the main features of theirs, in outline, whereas we see every tiny complicated detail of our own, so they seem more unique and therefore challenging. This bias may be too fundamental an aspect of our experience for us ever to overcome it completely. Still, when faced with almost any distressing problem, it’s worth asking what you might be missing not through stupidity, or error, but because you’re systematically denied certain kinds of information, as a result of being you, rather than anyone else. At the very least, it’s something to ponder on those evenings you so often seem to spend on your own. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/08/lithuania-england-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T18:13:58Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane penalty gives England win in Lithuania to end qualifying campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/08/lithuania-england-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/08/lithuania-england-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane penalty gives England win in Lithuania to end qualifying campaign","bodyText":"There was a moment early in the second half here when the referee, Orel Grinfeld, had to stop play after the children enjoying a kick-about on a five-a-side pitch at the open end of this tiny arena hoofed a yellow football over the netting and on to the artificial surface. Those standing behind the goal at that end of the ground, amused by the brief interruption, must have been tempted thereafter to turn around and watch the kids’ whooped attempts to keep warm instead. So much of the main attraction proved desperately humdrum. Perhaps this was a fitting way for England’s qualifying campaign to conclude. The main objective has been met and the fact that the team will grace the World Cup next summer should be applauded. Holland, for instance, and Argentina must crave being in the position to linger over negatives while progressing to Russia. Yet so much of the side’s journey to the finals has been forgettable, lacking in drama with the exception of those frantic final moments at Hampden Park back in June. A last-minute equaliser to choke the Scots was about as memorable as it got. The tempo of the football has rarely set the pulses racing and the wins have been rather laboured in a group where the English have found themselves confronted by massed defence at almost every turn. There has been no room to breathe, let alone scintillate. The friendlies against Germany and Brazil next month are enticing purely because they should be more open occasions, fixtures likelier to have the juices flowing, for all that the calibre of opponent will generate a different kind of problem. But, even taking into account the particular quirks of this group, something has been lacking up to now. The worry is that it might be quality. Harry Kane admitted that was what had been lacking in the final third in Vilnius, when the visitors hogged the ball but only four of their 20 attempts forced Ernestas Setkus into saves. Gareth Southgate suggested his players were “a fraction off” in the decisive pass, perhaps unnerved by the speed of the playing surface or disoriented by the seven changes made to the line-up. He clung to the positives of Harry Winks’ impressive debut and the implementation of three at the back, a strategy he considers this team’s best way forward. This had become an occasion to experiment, whether with tactical tweaks or personnel, given qualification had been assured early with that similarly narrow win over Slovenia. Yet those soaked to the skin through their plastic ponchos in Lithuania, the rain having been relentless all night, had still surely hoped for a little more in terms of attacking promise against a team ranked 120 in the world who had failed to defeat Malta last week. But there was no real zest to the visitors’ approach play, moves running aground too often at the critical point, with glimpses of goal forever snatched or anxious amid the clutter of Lithuanian bodies. In truth, this might have been a training match, an exercise in rather nervy, laborious attack versus enthusiastic but limited defence. It was not much of a spectacle. It was encouraging to see Winks – the 12th player coached by Mauricio Pochettino, either at Southampton or Tottenham Hotspur, to make his debut for the England senior team – settle into midfield and offer some busy energy and tidy delivery. He was hardly pressured by Arvydas Novikovas and Ovidijus Verbickas, of course, but the 21-year-old scuttled about in his throwback black boots, drew a fine save from Setkus from a left-footed half-volley and generally looked as if he belonged. “One of the big things playing for England isn’t necessarily the opposition but whether you can carry the England shirt,” said Southgate. “Harry showed he could.” The Spurs midfielder’s contribution was the night’s shining positive, though in the context of the whole occasion it was tempting to wonder whether Winks might have been given the No40 jersey just to sum up the mood. There were flashes of enterprise and menace, too, from Marcus Rashford whenever he glided into space, or Dele Alli when he was able to charge forward from deep into enemy territory. It was the Spurs player, restored after suspension, who was chopped down by Verbickas as he attempted to gather a bouncing ball midway through the first half. That Kane bulged the net from the resultant penalty was to be expected, a seventh international goal in six appearances never in doubt. The striker became the first player to score for England in his first four games as captain in the process. All-comers will be wary of him come the tournament next summer. Yet, by then, England will need to have unearthed a threat from others in their ranks. Not that they were likely to be punished for profligacy here. The hosts had their moments but they were fleeting. Vytautas Andriuskevicius’ centre prompted a pang of early panic as Harry Maguire, another debutant, slipped and Darvydas Sernas flicked a volley into the side-netting. The Leicester City defender was on edge, perhaps unsettled by an early inability to convert Aaron Cresswell’s centre from close range, and was exposed by Fiodor Cernych on the counter-attack just before the hour. While Maguire was desperately charging back having been caught up-field, the Lithuania forward flung over a centre which Michael Keane inadvertently poked goalwards. Jack Butland, on his first competitive start for his country since the last visit here two years ago, did well to push the ball aside and would deny the substitute, Deivydas Matulevicius, before the end. He would not be beaten. Neither would England. And yet, even in victory, it still all felt vaguely unfulfilling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/08/democrats-cut-ties-with-harvey-weinstein-as-fresh-allegations-emerge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T18:40:04Z","webTitle":"Democrats cut ties with Harvey Weinstein as fresh allegations emerge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/08/democrats-cut-ties-with-harvey-weinstein-as-fresh-allegations-emerge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/08/democrats-cut-ties-with-harvey-weinstein-as-fresh-allegations-emerge","fields":{"headline":"Democrats cut ties with Harvey Weinstein as fresh allegations emerge","bodyText":"Dozens of Democrats have moved quickly to sever ties with Harvey Weinstein, with many donating his campaign contributions to women’s charities, as more allegations of sexual harassment emerged. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he would donate $14,200 received from the Hollywood producer to women’s charities. Another senator, Kristen Gillibrand, said she would give $11,800 to a sexual assault victims group and hit out political critics seeking to embarrass her with the link to Weinstein. A spokesperson for Gillibrand said: “Kirsten invites the rightwing activists using this terrible story as a political tool to join her in actually working to combat sexual assault and sexual harassment in our society.” Weinstein has given more than $1.4m in political contributions since 1992, virtually all to Democrats. In an extensive report by the New York Times last week, it was alleged that Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women he had sexually harassed, and that he would invite women to his hotel room under the guise of work and then greet them naked or ask them to massage him or watch him shower. Among Weinstein’s accusers are the actors Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, the latter of whom allegedly reached a $100,000 settlement for an incident of misconduct that happened when she was starring in Scream. On Saturday Donald Trump waded into the scandal, telling reporters at the White House: “I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time. I’m not at all surprised to see it.” More allegations against Weinstein emerged over the weekend. Liza Campbell, a British artist and writer, alleged that he had asked her to join him in the bath. A TV reporter said Weinstein had masturbated in front of her, and a waitress who worked at a restaurant in Weinstein’s office said she had witnessed him dining with and being inappropriate towards a succession of young women. Campbell told the Sunday Times that she had gone to see Weinstein at the Savoy hotel to discuss film scripts when he disappeared into the bathroom and then asked her to “jump in the bath” with him. She said he then called out to her: “Come on, it’ll be fun. We can drink champagne. You can soap me – whaddaya say?” Campbell said she tried to leave the hotel room but two of the doors were locked, and it was only after she found a third door that she was able to leave. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been tipped as a possible 2020 presidential nominee, said she was donating $5,000 received from Weinstein to Casa Myrna, a charity that fights domestic violence. Others Democrats who followed suit included the senators Patrick Leahy, Martin Heinrich, Cory Booker, Al Franken, Bob Casey and Richard Blumenthal. Weinstein was key in influencing other Hollywood heavyweights to make political donations, and he contributed substantially to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s campaigns. The Democratic national committee has received almost $250,000 from him over the past two decades. It announced it would be contributing the $30,000 Weinstein had given this year to organisations that promote women in politics, but it was criticised for not donating the total of all Weinstein’s contributions over the years. Weinstein’s allegedly inappropriate behaviour towards women he worked with and those who starred in his films has been referred to as an open secret in Hollywood. Jade Budowski, who worked at the Tribeca Grill in Weinstein’s company’s office, told the New York Post she had witnessed him with “a string of young women, some seemingly no older than 21,” who she said “entered the restaurant for long, flirty dinners with him”, Budowski said there had been an unspoken rule that he was not be disturbed when dining with these women and that “after dining, Weinstein and a woman would often disappear for a while, exiting the restaurant through a side door”. In another account, Lauren Sivan, a TV journalist, alleged that Weinstein had once cornered her in a restaurant kitchen, and, when she refused his sexual advances, masturbated in front of her. Weinstein has expressed regret for his inappropriate behaviour towards women stretching back decades, saying “I own my mistakes”, but his lawyers say he also denies many of the allegations made against him. Weinstein has taken a leave of absence from his company as internal allegations are investigated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/08/dove-apologises-for-ad-showing-black-woman-turning-into-white-one","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T17:31:30Z","webTitle":"Dove apologises for ad showing black woman turning into white one","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/dove-apologises-for-ad-showing-black-woman-turning-into-white-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/08/dove-apologises-for-ad-showing-black-woman-turning-into-white-one","fields":{"headline":"Dove apologises for ad showing black woman turning into white one","bodyText":"Dove has apologised after publishing an advert on its Facebook page which showed a black woman turning into a white woman. The brand was accused of racism over the online advertising campaign and it later admitted it had “missed the mark” with an image posted on Facebook. The advert showed a black woman removing her top to reveal a white woman underneath supposedly after using Dove body lotion. The white woman then removes her top and turns into a Middle Eastern woman. The campaign has since been removed from Facebook but was shared by Naomi Blake, an American makeup artist who goes by the name Naythemua. “So I’m scrolling through Facebook and this is the #dove ad that comes up … ok so what am I looking at,” she wrote as the caption. Under the post, she was asked if people would be offended if the white woman had turned into a black woman. She said: “Nope, we wouldn’t and that’s the whole point. What does America tell black people? That we are judged by the color of our skin and that includes what is considered beautiful in this country.” She added that Dove’s marketing team should have known better and said “the tone deafness in these companies makes no sense”. Following the removal of the advert, Dove, which is owned by Unilever, tweeted: “An image we recently posted on Facebook missed the mark in representing women of colour thoughtfully. We deeply regret the offence it caused.” In a further statement Dove said: “As a part of a campaign for Dove body wash, a three-second video clip was posted to the US Facebook page. “This did not represent the diversity of real beauty which is something Dove is passionate about and is core to our beliefs, and it should not have happened. “We have removed the post and have not published any other related content. We apologise deeply and sincerely for the offence that it has caused.” However the damage was done and the nearly 3,000 comments below the tweet were almost exclusively negative. Many social media users called for a boycott of Dove’s products. Ava DuVernay, the director of the film Selma, was one of many prominent people to criticise both the advert and the apology. She said on Twitter: “You can do better than ‘missed the mark’. Flip + diminishing. Deepens your offence. You do good work. Have been for years. Do better here.” The trans model Munroe Bergdorf, who recently was at the centre of a racism row with L’Oreal, tweeted to say: “Diversity is viewed as a buzzword or a trend. An opportunity to sell product to women of colour. Dove – Do better.” Others pointed out this was not the first time the company has been accused of racism. In 2011 Dove’s before-and-after advert charted the transition of a black woman to a white woman after using its body wash. At the time, Dove said in a statement: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.” • This article was amended on 10 October 2017 to include more information about the advert’s sequence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/08/exeter-jack-nowell-injury-sam-simmonds","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Bloodied Jack Nowell an injury concern for Exeter as Sam Simmonds impresses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/exeter-jack-nowell-injury-sam-simmonds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/08/exeter-jack-nowell-injury-sam-simmonds","fields":{"headline":"Bloodied Jack Nowell an injury concern for Exeter as Sam Simmonds impresses","bodyText":"Exeter’s brief return to the top of the Premiership, of which they are the champions, was marred by the uncertainty over an injury to Jack Nowell. The England wing was forced off in the 20th minute of the bonus-point win against Newcastle on Saturday. He left the field with blood pouring from his face after a collision, and never returned. Exeter are as yet unsure of the extent of the damage to his left cheek, but such is the injury crisis in English rugby the temptation to fear the worst would be understandable with the autumn internationals five weeks away. Not that it is all bad news. England’s list of absentees at No8 may be up to three, but one of the several thrusting youngsters in the back-row continues to catch the eye. Sam Simmonds scored another try, his fifth in as many appearances, and this one was a beauty. Sweet handling across Exeter’s back division released him down the left from about 40 yards out. He had options on either side of him, which he used expertly as decoys, while he cut inside two defenders like the centre initial impressions suggested he was. “I played a bit of colts rugby in the centre and wing,” he said. “I pride myself on being a little bit quicker than other back-rows.” Whether he is Eddie Jones’s idea of an international No8 remains to be seen. Heavy-duty carrying in the style of Billy Vunipola may not be his thing. Simmonds confesses that his natural weight is little more than 16st, but if what you do with it counts for anything that should not be held against him. His dimensions are almost the same as those of David Pocock, Australia’s talisman of a No8, but his pace is of a different class. Simmonds revealed that he has been clocked at close to 34km/h, which puts him just short of James Short and Olly Woodburn, the fastest players in Exeter’s squad. “I am not going to be able to keep up with them … [but] I do like to work on my speed,” Simmonds added. “I’m trying to beat the tight five forwards with footwork and pace, but I don’t really get anywhere close to Shorty.” That said, he is not alone among Exeter’s back-row forwards in displaying such pace. Don Armand has apparently clocked similar speeds and as an England tourist last summer of grander physical dimensions, he may be perceived as higher up the pecking order. Despite the growing talk, Simmonds has had no contact from those who matter with England. “Not as of yet. A lot of people are going to be talked about, not just at this club,” he said. “There are other guys playing just as well as me. Anyone who has ambitions is going to be trying to push on as a player. If things come my way then happy days.” Certainly he is a different proposition as a No8 to the man coaching the opposition, Dean Richards, the last word in English No8s 30 years ago. Not for the first time in his long career, he is building quite the project in the north-east. If scoring four tries in the lair of the champions is something to be quietly proud of, there was no sign of it in his glowering countenance after this 34‑24 defeat. He is teaching the Falcons to hate defeat, whatever its form, which is as valuable lesson as any of the more technical ones they are clearly taking on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/08/donald-trump-scottish-golf-resorts-heavy-losses","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T15:04:02Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's Scottish golf resorts suffer heavy losses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/08/donald-trump-scottish-golf-resorts-heavy-losses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/08/donald-trump-scottish-golf-resorts-heavy-losses","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's Scottish golf resorts suffer heavy losses","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s loans to his golf resorts in Scotland have increased to more than £150m after their losses last year accelerated, partly because of the oil price crash and currency costs. The latest accounts for his network of Scottish companies show he had to plough another £1.3m into his debt-ridden resort in Aberdeenshire to keep it afloat after the North Sea crisis saw its popularity slump among local golfers. Trump International Golf Links Scotland lost nearly £1.2m in 2016, forcing Trump to increase his interest-free loans to the resort to nearly £41m ($54m) while he was campaigning for the presidency last year. Trump’s much larger and better known golfing resort and hotel at Turnberry in Ayrshire, which he bought in 2014, has also suffered heavy losses, largely because of its partial closure for refurbishment and building works. Trump increased his funding of the resort by £49m last year. In all, Trump Turnberry owes Trump £112m ($146m), the accounts for its parent company Golf Recreation Scotland show, nearly double the £63m it owed him the previous year. In all, his interest-free loans to both resorts reached £153m ($200m) by the end of last year. His son Eric Trump, who was given operational control of the smaller resort north of Aberdeen just before his father became president in January, said 2016 had been a difficult year, and hinted that those financial troubles were continuing. The “crash in oil price and economic downturn” which had hit the north-east of Scotland had seen its income fall by 12.4%, he said, while winter storms had badly damaged part of its 18-hole championship course. That pushed up its operating losses by 43%. “The industry is both competitive and challenging, factors that were heightened by the ongoing dip in the local economy, and adverse weather conditions,” Eric Trump said in the firm’s annual report. The volatile global economy has previously hit Trump’s ambitions for the course. He was forced to dramatically scale back his plans for a five-star hotel, timeshare flats and private villas on the site after the financial crisis in 2008, and is only now seeking planning permission for its promised second 18-hole course. Largely due to its closure for refurbishment, Turnberry’s losses in 2016 more than doubled from the previous year to £17.6m. In addition, the Trump Organization, which is now run by Trump’s sons and their lawyer Allen Weisselberg, lost another £9.6m because of currency transaction costs and currency losses. The Trumps fund Turnberry in US dollars but pay its bills in sterling. The accounts said that after the resort was fully reopened on 30 June last year, its income for the remaining year jumped to £6.7m. In the previous six months, when the hotel was partly open, its turnover stood at £2.3m. Eric Trump insisted these losses would soon be stemmed and then reversed. “It is expected that revenue will increase in subsequent years as the property is re-established as an industry-leading resort,” he wrote in the accounts. Both firms owe their survival to the Trump Organization’s continued financial support, these accounts showed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/08/one-in-five-stopped-by-immigration-enforcement-is-a-uk-citizen-figures-show","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"One in five stopped by immigration enforcement is a UK citizen, figures show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/08/one-in-five-stopped-by-immigration-enforcement-is-a-uk-citizen-figures-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/08/one-in-five-stopped-by-immigration-enforcement-is-a-uk-citizen-figures-show","fields":{"headline":"One in five stopped by immigration enforcement is a UK citizen, figures show","bodyText":"One in five people stopped by immigration enforcement teams in Britain’s biggest cities is a UK national, according to newly revealed figures that critics say cast doubt on official claims that such stops are “intelligence-led”. The figures, obtained through freedom of information requests, show that out of 102,552 stopped in the past five years, 19,096 – 18.6% – were British citizens. Lawyers say they lend credence to suspicions of unlawful racial profiling. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), working with the Bristol Cable, obtained the new Home Office data after repeated attempts by officials to block their requests stalled its release for seven months. The data, which covers 11 of the largest cities in England, Wales and Scotland, shows that in London alone, 8,002 British citizens were stopped. In Sheffield and Glasgow, nearly a third of those stopped were British citizens. In each city, British citizens were the most stopped nationality, despite Home Office guidance which states that stops must be carried out on “an intelligence-led basis”. Immigration enforcement is the Home Office body responsible for tracking down people who are in the country illegally and ensuring they return to their home countries. In recent years their liveried vans have become an increasingly common sight in areas with large migrant communities. Two barristers at Garden Court Chambers, Chris Williams and Nicola Braganza, who analysed the data, concluded that “by reason of those individuals being British, by definition, any intelligence relied on to spot-check them must have been wholly flawed”. Prominent Glasgow human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar told TBIJ: “There is definitely racial profiling going on, and we’re increasingly concerned about the intelligence.” In light of the findings, Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy, Manchester Gorton MP and shadow immigration minister Afzal Khan, Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq and Bristol West MP Thangam Debbonaire told TBIJ they would call on the Home Office to review its procedures. “These statistics reveal a system which seems arbitrary, unsophisticated and possibly discriminatory to British citizens simply trying to go about their day,” Siddiq said. “I hope the Home Office will reflect on these figures and consider whether their current approach is fit for the challenges they are seeking to address.” It is not the first time that immigration enforcement has been accused of racial profiling. In 2013, the Equality and Human Rights Commission wrote to the Home Office after human rights campaigners and politicians raised concerns that immigration officers were using racial profiling techniques at public transport hubs. Jeremy Corbyn – then a backbencher – raised the issue in parliament, saying that he had witnessed such stops at tube stations in London. In response, the then immigration minister, Mark Harper, insisted “we do not stop people at random; we are not empowered to do so by law”. He added: “We stop people when we think there is intelligence to indicate that they are breaking our immigration laws.” Responding to the release of the new figures, the Home Office said: “Immigration enforcement officers are empowered to carry out an in-country examination of a person to establish their immigration status where they reasonably suspect that the person is in breach of immigration law. “British citizens may be arrested for connected criminal offences arising from an immigration enforcement encounter. British citizens are not arrested with a view to removal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/08/gender-neutral-activist-takes-uk-passports-case-to-high-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T16:22:08Z","webTitle":"Gender-neutral activist takes UK passports case to high court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/gender-neutral-activist-takes-uk-passports-case-to-high-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/08/gender-neutral-activist-takes-uk-passports-case-to-high-court","fields":{"headline":"Gender-neutral activist takes UK passports case to high court","bodyText":"The Home Office is to be challenged to provide gender-neutral, or “X”, passports to UK citizens at a high court hearing this week. The application for a judicial review is being made by lawyers on behalf of Christie Elan-Cane, who has campaigned on the issue for 25 years and given evidence to parliament about transgender equality. Last month Canada became the 10th country to offer citizens gender-neutral travel documents. Australia, Denmark, Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India, Ireland and Nepal already have a third category besides male and female. Standards for machine-readable passports set by the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) allow for individual states to enter M, F or X in the category specifying an individual’s sex. X stands for unspecified. Elan-Crane appeared before the Commons women and equalities select committee two years ago to give evidence for their inquiry into transgender equality. “Legitimate identity is a fundamental human right but non-gendered people are often treated as though we have no rights,” Elan-Cane said. “The UK’s passport application process requires applicants to declare whether they are male or female. It is inappropriate and wrong that someone who defines as neither should be forced to make that declaration.’’ Elan-Cane, who was born a women but began transitioning after surgery, believes individuals should be given more than the binary choice of being a man or a woman. Since July more than 40 MPs have signed an early day motion in favour of gender-neutral passports. Elan-Cane argues the government is discriminating against its own citizens as it allows holders of foreign X passports to enter the country at border checks. The permission hearing is expected to be held in the administrative division of the high court in London on Wednesday. Elan-Cane’s initial application on paper was dismissed. Solicitors from Clifford Chance as well as Kate Gallafent QC and Tom Mountford of Blackstone Chambers are working pro bono on the claim. They will argue that Elan-Cane’s human rights under articles 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights – the right to private and family life and absence of discrimination – are being illegally restricted by the Home Office’s refusal. They maintain that UK nationals whose identities are neither male nor female are subject to and humiliated by a discriminatory passport policy that fails to acknowledge their identities or their existence. Elan-Cane planned to launch the legal challenge two years ago but held off pending the select committee inquiry’s findings. The MPs’ final report recommended that the government “must look into the need to create a legal category for those people with a gender identity outside that which is binary and the full implications of this”. Meanwhile, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested the “sex” question in the next census, in 2021, could be made voluntary in response to claims that it discriminates against transgender people. The move would make the UK one of the first countries in the world not to require its citizens to tell officials what sex they are. A two-step option, with separate sex and gender identity questions, was ruled out. The ONS has explored other options, including a hybrid question with the addition of an “other” category. “We would tentatively recommend that an unchanged 2011 census question should not be mandatory, for the benefit of, particularly, intersex and non-binary people who cannot choose male or female as a reflection of their current sex or gender,” it said in a report. It also recommended changes “to better meet the needs of trans respondents”, such as removing “sex” and adding one or more additional categories for non-binary and intersex people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/08/chris-rock-n-word-television-graham-norton-black-british","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T14:19:02Z","webTitle":"Don’t fall for it.

Chris Rock’s use of the N-word on television is not OK","bodyText":"One watches television with expectations. Watching the American comedian Chris Rock on the Graham Norton show, I expected to hear adult comedy. That is what he does. Still, it’s a mainstream show, a flagship show. So I was shocked to hear him blithely, and without objection, use the N-word . Rock was talking about being discovered by Eddie Murphy, then about a white girl who met Murphy and wanted to kiss him as she had never kissed a black man before in her life. He then mentioned what Murphy said to the girl: “You can’t start at the top – you’ve got to kiss some of these broke n*****s first.” Rock was not involved. He merely witnessed what had happened. He could have said, “Eddie used the N-word”, or some such. His forte is words. Instead he used the full term and no one challenged him. Everyone simply laughed. Even the studio audience were laughing hysterically, highlighting perhaps how the N-word has been allowed to slowly drift into our vernacular and into our living rooms without being challenged. There are no excuses. Rock is an international superstar. He is a role model to a global audience. And that comes with a number of responsibilities. It felt rather unpleasant to watch the rest of the programme, especially as we are at the start of Black History Month. As a black British Londoner I felt the production team on the show hadn’t just fallen short but had shot themselves in the foot by disrespecting black minority and ethnic viewers. Questions need to be asked: who allowed the programme to be aired without any edited or vetting? I have campaigned for a ban of the N-word or referencing it in any context. That’s increasingly an uphill task. In the US, they still haven’t got to grips with how to educate people on not using the word. It’s used on rap tracks as a form of endearment. Hip-hop artists often greet each other using the term. The result is that it’s an increasingly generalised term used by a younger generation in a social context. But that’s not OK, and this wasn’t OK. My parents could have been watching, and they would have been offended. No apology was given at the end of the programme. It’s still there, unedited, on iPlayer, even though a use by Rock of the F-word sounds muted. If Norton himself, Kate Winslet or Liam Gallagher had used or said the N-word there would probably have been uproar, but Rock was allowed to get away with it because he’s black. Idris Elba, sat beside him on the sofa, laughed. So that’s OK, then? No it isn’t. Don’t fall for this. It’s not necessary. It certainly doesn’t represent my world as a black Briton or forward any notion of black acceptance. I think it’s time for programme makers to be educated on the use of N-word. It’s out there, they can’t stop that, but they have responsibilities for their output. There is a line in mainstream entertainment as there must be in all genres. The N-word crosses it every time. • Edward Adoo is a DJ, broadcaster and writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/08/everything-at-once-review-store-studios-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T13:57:26Z","webTitle":"Everything at Once review – a trip beyond death and into a cosmic womb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/08/everything-at-once-review-store-studios-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/08/everything-at-once-review-store-studios-london","fields":{"headline":"Everything at Once review – a trip beyond death and into a cosmic womb","bodyText":"A white line snakes through the spaces of Store Studios, housed in a 1971 brutalist office block on the Strand. Painted using one of those wheeled contraptions that mark out football pitches and sports fields, the line trundles from under a closed lift door, makes its way splashily up a swanky staircase – passing a Lawrence Weiner work that repeats the same phrase, “WHOLE CLOTH STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT”, on the wall in big letters on every level – makes arcing oxbow detours across the concrete floors, and comes to a stop, where the machine ran out of paint, on the first floor. There it stands. Phew. Ceal Floyer’s Taking a Line for a Walk follows Paul Klee’s famous definition of drawing. Floyer’s work is a nice detour in a show of 24 Lisson Gallery artists that doesn’t try too hard to make any sense at all. I looked for a theme but there wasn’t one, apart from the fact that all the artists show with the gallery, now celebrating its 50th year. From Dan Graham, who first showed at Lisson in 1972, to Turner prize winner Laure Prouvost, who joined this year, it is just everything at once, and one damn thing after another, in a group show whose title comes from a 1966 quotation by John Cage. “Nowadays everything happens at once and our souls are conveniently electronic (omniattentive),’ Cage wrote, presciently. He should have tried 2017. Attentiveness is difficult. Everything at Once is a portmanteau conceit, unlike the Hayward’s excellent offsite film and video project The Infinite Mix, which occupied the same building in 2016. Neither a medium nor a message connects the works here. There is Ai Weiwei’s iron-cast tree-trunk and tangled roots painted gold, and a room devoted to what looks like a gigantic bowler hat, by Anish Kapoor, that hangs above our heads. Or maybe it’s a 1950s flying saucer. Standing under the crown, the interior dome is a deep, dark red, threatening to suck us back up into some sort of cosmic womb. I ran out, in search of Rodney Graham’s shipwrecked sailor, stranded on a tropical island with a parrot, who repeatedly gets concussed by a falling coconut in Graham’s 1997 film loop Vexation Island. After all these years, I still wince every time the nut knocks Graham out. Time has been less kind to some other works here. Much, much later in the show we come to a series of paintings by American painter Stanley Whitney. Now in his 70s, Whitney makes every colour in his abstractions of bars and rectangles glow and sing and jump. Like a sax player, he also makes the breathy slurs and delays count. At once casual and precise, Whitney shows us how fickle painterly relationships are, and how all colours can get along with one another if they’re painted right. A rare moment of visceral, optical pleasure, Whitney’s canvases have a great, light touch. On a wall that runs the breadth of the building, Richard Long tries to keep the tempo up in his mud drawing. It goes on and on and on and on some more, his fingers pawing at the mud, the mud dripping. I keep running out of steam. In three videos by Marina Abramović (two from 1975, another from a decade later), she tests her own endurance and ours. And that of the bongo player who accompanies her naked solo dance, masked. In another performance video she tries to remember Serbian words (“Red carpet … rhomboid … monotonous”), and in a third she lies on the floor with her head tilted backwards and screams till she loses her voice. Shall we never scream again? Of course we shall, but will anyone hear? Have I died already? Susan Hiller has recorded anecdotes of near-death experiences. When I go towards the light, I hope never to come back. I hope I don’t find Kapoor’s throbbing red womb on the other side, or the pulsating blips and glows and rainbows of Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg’s recent video installation. Whatever has happened to Djurberg’s work, which used to be full of foolish wisdom and hilarious stop-motion animated action? Wherever she is going in her recent collaborations with Hans Berg, I cannot follow. Better to escape altogether on to the roof, where, in one of several other projects at Store presented with the Vinyl Factory (in this case, a co-presentation with the Serpentine Gallery), Arthur Jafa shows Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death, a gritty compilation of found footage – Jimi Hendrix and James Brown, LA Riots, brutal beatings and shootings, the inequalities and racism of America – set to Kanye West’s brilliant, gospel-inspired Ultralight Beam. Seven minutes long, Jafa’s work is the timeliest thing in the building, condensing time, place and history, giving us it all at once.

Sturgeon said the pledge would protect up to 20,000 EU nationals who work in Scotland’s hospitals, schools, universities and public agencies who face losing their UK residency after Brexit. The measure was unveiled on Sunday as the Scottish National party gathered for a subdued conference, its first since it lost 21 Westminster seats in June when voters rejected Sturgeon’s attempt to use Brexit as the justification for a fresh Scottish independence referendum. Sturgeon’s government is now changing tack to focus far more heavily on domestic policy and managing the Brexit process, pushing back a decision on the timing of an independence vote by at least a year. The offer to pay residency costs for any EU citizen working in the public sector will be popular among SNP activists. The UK government has said EU nationals will be able to apply for “settled status” if they have lived in the UK for five years or more at the point of Brexit. It remains unclear how much that would cost. The current Home Office fee for naturalisation is £1,282, implying that it may cost the Scottish government up to £25.64m to fund those applications, but a UK residence card for nationals of non-EU countries costs far less, at £65. After urging private companies to consider the same offer in a statement on Saturday, Sturgeon told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 on Sunday that the offer sent “a message to EU nationals that we want them to stay here because we welcome them”. The Scottish Tories dismissed the offer as a stunt. The Scottish government would want EU nationals to have a vote in a future Scottish independence referendum, as they did in the 2014 referendum. Restive members inflicted a heavy defeat on the party leadership on Sunday by voting overwhelmingly in favour of a motion calling for a ban on under-18s being recruited by the UK armed forces in roles requiring combat training. The proposal from the SNP’s youth wing, backed by a large number of children’s rights and civil rights groups, was opposed by ministers, but delegates rejected calls for the motion to be amended and for it be dismissed. It is the first SNP conference in recent years when Sturgeon or her predecessor Alex Salmond have not had an election or an imminent referendum to galvanise activists. Sturgeon confirmed in interviews with Marr on BBC1 and Robert Peston on ITV that she was some way off deciding if and when another referendum would be staged. Sturgeon was forced to suspend her demands for a second independence vote by spring 2019 after the SNP held only 35 of its 56 Westminster seats in June’s snap election. She is instead pursuing a compromise deal with the Tories over the EU withdrawal bill, to increase protections for Scotland’s powers and spending after Brexit. The latest opinion poll by YouGov for the Times, published on Saturday, showed the SNP’s support declining to 42% of the Holyrood constituency vote and 35% of the regional list vote for Holyrood, a 4.5% fall on the constituency vote and 6.7% down on the regional list, implying it would lose six seats of its 63 in a Scottish parliament election. Sturgeon dismissed claims by Theresa May, the prime minister, and Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, last week that they had saved the UK at the general election. She said they were “clutching at straws”, since the YouGov poll still put the SNP comfortably 17 points ahead of Labour in second place. John Swinney, the deputy first minister, unveiled an attempt to tackle a substantial shortage of science, engineering and technology teachers in Scottish schools by offering a £20,000 bursary for professionals to take a one-year postgraduate course to retrain as a teacher. Labour and the Scottish Tories said that policy was a direct lift of their own proposals. The shortages in those subjects have been so acute that headteachers at a school in Swinney’s own constituency and others have been forced to appeal for parents to step in by teaching classes. Swinney earned a huge cheer from delegates when he directly linked the government’s efforts to reinvigorate its domestic agenda with its eventual goal of independence. “We meet today to rededicate ourselves to the cause of Scotland,” he told the hall. “We rededicate ourselves to independence – the best possible future for Scotland.” Sturgeon is putting far greater emphasis on new domestic policies, including school reforms and heavier investment in education in deprived areas, a more radical climate strategy and a pledge to invest £500m above inflation into the NHS. With Treasury funding being cut and Scottish tax receipts likely to be subdued, economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute calculate that these spending increases mean other departments could see their funding cut by up to 20% by 2020-21. Public sector unions are pressing her government to increase pay across the board by 5%, after Sturgeon pledged to lift the 1% cap on public sector pay, putting her budgets under even greater pressure. Pressed by both Marr and Peston to set out her thinking on the timing of the next referendum, Sturgeon insisted she had not dropped plans for a new independence vote. She said the 2016 Holyrood elections, reinforced by the 35 seats the SNP won in June, gave her a hefty mandate to stage one. She confirmed she would update Holyrood on her thinking about the best timing later in 2018. “At the core of everything I do, what will guide me, is what’s in the best interests of the people I represent as first minister, and not simply to accept the inevitability of a path that’s going to [damage] jobs and livelihoods and living standards,” she told Peston."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/08/conservative-brexiters-turn-fire-philip-hammonds-treasury-sack-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Conservative Brexiters turn fire on Philip Hammond's Treasury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/08/conservative-brexiters-turn-fire-philip-hammonds-treasury-sack-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/08/conservative-brexiters-turn-fire-philip-hammonds-treasury-sack-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Conservative Brexiters turn fire on Philip Hammond's Treasury","bodyText":"Philip Hammond’s Treasury has come under fire from a leading Conservative leave campaigner, who said that the gloomy outlook and “Brexit in name only” approach of the department risked scuppering the UK’s EU exit. Bernard Jenkin’s highly critical intervention came while other Tory MPs urged Theresa May to sack the chancellor, as those on the right of the party flexed their muscles following days of criticism of Boris Johnson and speculation about an autumn cabinet reshuffle. Nadine Dorries was the only MP to publicly call for Hammond to go, although other Brexit-supporting politicians told the Guardian that concerns about the chancellor were being widely discussed on the Tory backbenches. Jenkin insisted that his intervention was not a personal attack on the chancellor, who he wanted to remain in place, but he wrote in the Guardian to express his unhappiness about the Treasury, which he believes is among the anti-Brexit doomsayers. The MP, who was a director of the Vote Leave campaign, complained that the Treasury was frogmarching the UK towards a damaging EU deal and called on the prime minister to assert her authority over the department. Jenkin argued that the EU had “coopted the CBI, parts of the City and, it seems, the Treasury” to assist it in making the Brexit process difficult and damaging. “They are legitimising EU threats of economic disruption,” he said. A Treasury source said Hammond and his department were committed to delivering Brexit. “Britain will leave the European Union, the customs union, and the single market in March 2019. The Treasury is working hard to make sure that can happen.” Allies of the chancellor were quick to respond, with one cabinet minister warning that “realism is no sin when it comes to Brexit.”. The Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, argued that it was the Treasury’s job to set out the risks associated with different Brexit outcomes. A febrile atmosphere has dominated the Conservative party since May struggled through the party conference with a mishap-laden speech. A handful of backbench MPs criticised her leadership, and a larger group voiced concern about Johnson, whose Brexit interventions overshadowed May’s own positioning on the subject. Over the weekend, several MPs said privately that May should think about removing Johnson as foreign secretary and conducting a wider cabinet reshuffle. May will attempt to get on the front foot on Monday by warning that Britain has made sufficient concessions in the Brexit negotiations for now. “The ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response,” she will tell MPs in a statement to parliament on Monday. Appearing to adopt some of the language of ardent Brexiters on her backbenches, the prime minister will add: “So while of course progress will not always be smooth, by approaching these negotiations in a constructive way – in a spirit of friendship and cooperation and with our sights firmly set on the future – I believe we can prove the doomsayers wrong.” Jenkin, who chairs parliament’s public administration and constitutional affairs committee, accused officials of being “blind to the facts” adding: “The Treasury seems unable to hear any voices except those which reinforce their preconceptions ... People like Sir James Dyson or Anthony Bamford of JCB are ignored.” His comments may have been aimed at officials, but Dorries told ITV’s Robert Peston that she thought May should sack the chancellor himself, claiming: “I think he has been deliberately trying to make the Brexit negotiations difficult.” Another backbencher told the Guardian that there were several conversations going on behind the scenes among Brexit-supporting Tories who were fed up with the gloomy predictions of the Treasury. One senior figure claimed that it was hard to see how any major government policy could be a success without the full support of the chancellor, implying that Hammond could end up blocking Brexit. Others lept to Hammond’s defence. Davidson responded to Dorries by telling Peston that May should “absolutely not” remove the chancellor. Hammond is due to appear in front of the Treasury select committee this week and could face difficult questions on Brexit. However, the committee chair, Nicky Morgan, called it “truly extraordinary” that a Tory MP would attack the people “trying to limit the economic risk to the UK by Brexit. This says more about the Brexiters desperately defending their win than them having any interest in supporting the finances of Britain’s households,” she said. One high-profile business figure agreed. Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of RBS, said the damage to the City from Brexit was “going to be quite considerable over time” and will result in job losses. Davies said there would definitely be a cost to British jobs, adding that the question was whether Britain could negotiate enough market access so that the cost was not tens of thousands. Speaking on Sky News, Davies said there were some business concerns that “it is taking quite a long time to get to the nitty-gritty of what a new trading relationship with the EU would be”. He added: “Certainly some time, I think, has been wasted up to now in negotiations which haven’t really got anywhere.” The disagreements over Brexit the progress of the negotiations are a sign of continued deep divisions within the party, with some coalescing around Hammond, who they see as fighting for a soft Brexit, and others lining up behind key Brexit figures. Johnson had caused anger with his Brexit interventions, but rushed to the prime ministers defence on Sunday by calling those plotting against her “nutters”. The vast majority of Tory MPs have rallied around May following revelations that the former party chair Grant Shapps was attempting to gather names of colleagues who would ask the prime minister to step down. The MP was quickly isolated, in a move that some colleagues branded a “witch hunt”, in WhatsApp groups of Tory parliamentarians. Some had claimed that Shapps was working for a cabinet member such as Johnson or David Davis, the Brexit secretary, but that has been strongly denied. May used a Sunday newspaper interview to hint that she could be prepared to reshuffle Johnson or other colleagues. When asked if she could move the foreign secretary in an expected reshuffle, she said: “It has never been my style to hide from a challenge and I’m not going to start now. I’m the PM, and part of my job is to make sure I always have the best people in my cabinet, to make the most of the wealth of talent available to me in the party.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/23/brazil-police-shoot-dead-spanish-tourist-rio-de-janeiro-favela","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T16:04:55Z","webTitle":"Brazil police shoot dead Spanish tourist in Rio de Janeiro favela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/brazil-police-shoot-dead-spanish-tourist-rio-de-janeiro-favela","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/23/brazil-police-shoot-dead-spanish-tourist-rio-de-janeiro-favela","fields":{"headline":"Brazil police shoot dead Spanish tourist in Rio de Janeiro favela","bodyText":"Police in Rio de Janeiro said they shot dead a Spanish tourist after the car she was in failed to stop at a police roadblock in the Rocinha favela, near the city’s famous beaches. Local media named the 67-year-old victim as María Esperanza Ruiz Jiménez and said she was with two other Spaniards, an Italian and a guide. She is the third tourist to have been shot dead in Rio favelas in less than a year. Her killing puts the spotlight back on Rio’s deteriorating crime situation just a month after the Brazilian military were sent into the Rocinha favela in an attempt to control violence between warring drug gangs. The operation failed to bring peace to Brazil’s biggest favela, and shootouts between gang members and police have continued on a daily basis, residents said. In the last year, two other tourists have been shot dead in Rio favelas and in August a British tourist, Eloise Dixon, survived being shot near Angra dos Reis, a three-hour drive from Rio de Janeiro. In each case the shootings were blamed on drug gangs. Police said the latest violence broke out around 9.30am on Monday at two separate locations in the sprawling Rocinha favela, Brazil’s biggest. Two officers and a gang member were injured. “Around 10.30 a Fiat Fremont broke a police roadblock,” police said in a statement. “Officers reacted, hitting the vehicle. Upon approaching it, it was discovered that the vehicle was carrying tourists. A Spanish woman was injured and taken to the Miguel Couto hospital but did not survive.” Police said the case was being investigated. A recording that is circulating in the Rocinha favela on the WhatsApp cellphone message service said police were sheltering from the rain when they ordered the vehicle to stop but had not entered into the roadway. “The woman must not have even heard,” an unidentified man said in the recording, describing the shooting. Launched in 2008, Rio’s much-lauded programme to pacify favelas run for decades by drug gangs, by installing armed police bases, is in a state of collapse. The state government is broke and has struggled to pay police salaries. As crime has escalated, drug gangs have recaptured old territory and spread their control to new areas – and tourists have increasingly been caught in the crossfire. In December 2016, an Italian motorcyclist was shot dead in the Prazeres favela in central Rio after he and a friend inadvertently drove into a gang-held area. In February this year an Argentinian tourist was shot when the car she was in entered the same favela. She died a month later of her injuries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/24/women-abortion-rights-service-crisis-nhs-no-specialist-doctors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T06:30:39Z","webTitle":"Women fought for abortion rights.

Fifty years on, the service is in crisis","bodyText":"Half a century after abortion was made legal in England, Scotland and Wales, outsourcing of NHS services and a subsequent lack of specialist doctors mean that hundreds of women each year are prevented from having an abortion, sometimes seriously threatening their health, according to leading medics. “The system is broken. It’s in crisis. Not fit for purpose,” says professor Lesley Regan, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Abortion is the most common medical or surgical procedure in the UK: more than 200,000 women have one each year. It is still illegal in Northern Ireland but this week the government revealed plans to provide free abortion services in England for women from Northern Ireland. Women can have either a medical abortion, which involves taking two pills usually 24 to 48 hours apart to induce a miscarriage, or they can have a surgical abortion. Around 80% occur at under 10 weeks gestation. Only in exceptional cases, if there is a grave risk to the woman’s life or severe foetal abnormality, are abortions legal beyond 24 weeks. But one major provider of abortion services says women needing late abortions (between 19-24 weeks) are not always able to get them. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), along with Marie Stopes International (MSI), is one of the two main providers of abortion services for the NHS. Clare Murphy, BPAS’s director of external affairs, says: “We think there are probably hundreds of women a year prevented from having an abortion, due to long waiting times and the distance to a hospital providing an abortion – or because it is simply not equipped to carry out a termination late in the pregnancy.” BPAS says that last year 158 women who had been referred for an NHS hospital termination due to complexities, gave up on their decision to have an abortion because they had been confronted with long distances to travel to a hospital that could carry out the procedure, and lengthy waiting times. A further 20 women diagnosed with multiple health problems who wanted an abortion could not be allocated a place in hospital – and had to continue with their pregnancies and give birth, despite the threat to their health. “Unless this situation is addressed urgently, more and more women will have to continue with pregnancies they don’t want – and which may pose a serious risk to their health,” warns Murphy. These women’s stories are harrowing and desperate. Because they went on to have a child after being denied an abortion, and are few in number, they are understandably wary of being identified. But there are recurring themes to their predicaments: pregnancy not detected until late on, then made difficult because of high blood pressure, heart conditions, obesity, or unexplained seizures. Some had abusive partners, others had existing children who were unwell. One woman became so ill that the baby was delivered at 26 weeks; another’s condition deteriorated so badly she qualified for a post-24-week abortion. One of the problems is the growing number of young women seeking an abortion who are obese, diabetic or have hypertension. Increasing obesity among women of all ages makes operations more complex, and the later a termination, the more skilful the surgeon has to be. At 19 weeks there are just four hospitals offering medical terminations across the whole of England and Wales, and three offering surgical procedures. From 21 weeks, only Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust and King’s College Hospital NHS foundation trust, both in London, have one doctor able to undertake late procedures. At 15 weeks’ pregnancy, 18 hospitals across England and Wales can provide a medical abortion, 11 a surgical one. The Department of Health (DoH) says there are 524 more obstetricians and gynaecologists now than there were in May 2010, but not all of those will work in abortion care. Regan says the attrition rate is high and some junior doctors are choosing not to specialise in abortion services because of vilification from anti-abortionists, and sometimes even criticism from medical colleagues. But another factor is that opportunities to train within the NHS have disappeared. Although figures are not held centrally on numbers of acute hospitals training in abortion care, as an indication of declining numbers, the RCOG advanced training skills module in abortion – a core part of training – has not been completed yet this year in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley or the West Midlands. Only one has been completed in Wales, Wessex and south west England. “When my generation goes, there will be very few people who have any experience, ,” says Regan. “Less than a handful” of consultants in England are doing late surgical abortions.” The way in which commissioning has developed since the 1980s accounts for the lack of training. In 1981, abortion services were split almost evenly between the NHS and the private sector, such as Harley Street clinics. The NHS-funded independent sector – effectively the BPAS and Marie Stopes – played a tiny role. But it has grown steadily, often as a result of commissioners searching for less expensive contracts. Now the BPAS and Marie Stopes have 70 clinics each, accounting for two-thirds of NHS-funded services. The problem is, neither organisation is contracted to train doctors in abortion care, or to terminate pregnancies if there are complications because the patient has multiple health problems, leaving a dwindling number of acute teaching hospitals to train medics and provide more specialist care. This is leading to regional gaps in provision. In Colchester, Essex, for example, the NHS trust would have done some late-stage abortions, but these services have now been transferred to the independent sector, so women have to travel a long way. A spokesman for north-east Essex clinical commissioning group says it awarded the contract for abortion services to Marie Stopes for greater efficiency. Dr Sarah Prince, 31, a senior registrar in the east of England, is one of the few junior doctors ready to take on abortion work. “It’s part of women’s health and I’m really passionate about that,” she says. “But I might have trouble completing advance study modules because at least three hospitals in my area have stopped providing abortion care, instead contracting it out. I may have to move to live near a hospital over an hour away to complete my studies. The pity is they were really good services – and the staff were really proud of them.” Prince says she has not encountered animosity because of her work, but she has seen complacency in the profession, such as having only one consultant in a hospital covering the entire abortion workload. When they are away, crucial decisions can come to a standstill. And she’s aware of colleagues who might claim a conscientious objection to abortion, but actually simply don’t want to be involved in contentious work. “It’s terrible seeing women pushed from pillar to post,” says Prince. Regan, who set up an abortion taskforce two years ago, says: “I don’t want in any way to cast aspersions on BPAS and MSI, they do a fantastic job. I work very closely with them because we’ve got to find a solution together.” But she believes that commissioners of services have often been involved in “a race to the bottom” to find ever cheaper contracts. And fewer hospital chief executives and clinical directors are prepared to get involved in potentially complex cases, particularly when the tariff generated for the hospital is the same as giving a woman two tablets to miscarry. “It’s something people have rather washed their hands of,” she says. One solution her taskforce will look at is going into the independent sector and making training part of the commissioning – something that BPAS and MSI say they are prepared to consider. The BPAS says regional centres of excellence could be the way forward. “The independent sector must be on hand to help in any way it can, collaborating with the NHS to improve training and provide support for existing NHS services and the doctors and trainees within them,” says Murphy. At Birmingham Women’s Hospital, doctors have been developing a centre of excellence for abortion services. But Professor Janesh Gupta, head of obstetrics and gynaecology, is facing considerable hurdles. Funding for trainees is under threat and he says “the DoH is putting up further barriers on grounds of cost”. Gupta warns: “The service in England is almost at the point of self-destruction. The health department needs to know that.” He already carries out late-term abortions, but would like the capability to go to 24 weeks when necessary. He thinks a total of up to five such regional centres – at least two in London, and others in Birmingham and Newcastle – would go a long way to providing a service fit for purpose. “We have to provide for the future,” he says. Part of the recent pressure on services was because Marie Stopes suspended some of its terminations in August 2016 after safety concerns raised by the Care Quality Commission. They have since been reinstated, but CQC inspections are continuing. Caroline Gazet, Marie Stopes UK deputy medical director, says: “The current shortage of surgeons is a sector-wide issue that we would like to see addressed by including abortion as part of the general training for new obstetricians and gynaecologists, as it has been previously.” Easing demand for later terminations by making earlier abortion more accessible could help: currently two doctors must authorise an abortion and there are growing calls for a relaxation of Britain’s abortion law to allow nurses and midwives to give women the pills that can end an unwanted pregnancy. That would require a free vote in parliament. A survey by the charity Women on Web, published last month, found that among 519 women who had tried to access abortion pills online over a four-month period, running the risk of imprisonment, around 40% said they did so because the barriers they had met trying to obtain an abortion within the NHS – including travel difficulties and a perceived lack of confidentiality – were insurmountable. Regan would like to bring back experienced clinicians to act as mentors and make training modules more widely available. “This is about changing hearts and minds as opposed to just putting in a workforce that can do the job,” she says. Regan warns: “When you don’t have facilities for safe, high quality abortion care, girls and women die.” A DoH spokeswoman says: “The late abortions service is high risk and needs to be within the NHS – we are working with the RCOG and NHS England to develop a different approach for this highly specialised area of clinical practice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/nobels-furniture-design-was-dynamite","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T17:39:56Z","webTitle":"Nobel’s furniture design was dynamite | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/nobels-furniture-design-was-dynamite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/23/nobels-furniture-design-was-dynamite","fields":{"headline":"Nobel’s furniture design was dynamite","bodyText":"All this discussion about the relative design and merits of three-legged stools (Letters passim) is as nothing compared with the so-called suicide stool, a one-legged stool designed by Alfred Nobel to prevent operators of the nitroglycerin reaction vats – part of the production process of his dynamite – falling asleep and allowing an exothermic runaway to occur, with the consequent explosion ruining everyone’s day.

It was two years since they’d had a decent run of results and it felt almost as long since they’d had a decent meal. For the 13th time in five years they were under new management and this time things were actually going to change. Not just the coach but the culture, everything from the president to the players to what was put on their plate. If you are what you eat, it was time to eat something good. At Paterna, the club’s training ground, food was prepared for them, but not much of it and not exactly the tasty treats either, while detailed diets were sent home: rigid new regimes written out to be followed to the letter, families called upon to help impose them on famished footballers. Marcelino García Toral, Valencia’s new manager, has a reputation for obsessing over weight and physical condition. A pioneer, even now when professional football is catching up with him, every detail controlled, tests conducted daily, weight pinned on notice boards at training grounds worldwide, he goes further. He is so strict that stories circulate of players starving themselves or starting the day in the sauna, scared of arriving a gram overweight. Gabriel said: “The first time I worked with him, I thought: ‘What a pain this coach is!’” The first time his new Valencia team-mates worked with him, they felt much the same. “We went hungry,” said the captain, Dani Parejo. There had even been arguments with his wife, he admitted. But Gabriel knew and, soon, so did they. When Gabriel joined Arsenal he called Marcelino, his manager at Villarreal, to thank him; when Marcelino called him back this summer he didn’t even have to think about it. When Marcelino arrived at Mestalla and spoke to Parejo he didn’t have to think about it for long, either. He had intended to leave, ready to follow 16 other players out of the club, but Marcelino made him stay. “From the very first session, I could sense something different,” he said. “I don’t know, something. Not just him, all of his staff. The way we trained, the way they saw football, the way they worked, prepared games. It really struck me. And I said to myself: ‘I can’t waste a year of my career not working with this coach.’” So, Parejo got to work. They all did. Within weeks, the captain was describing Marcelino as one of the two best coaches he had worked with alongside Ernesto Valverde. It’s a big field: Parejo admitted that he has lost count of how many coaches he has had. At Valencia, there were four spells last season alone: Pako Ayesteran followed by match-day-delegate turned caretaker manager and go-to saviour Voro, followed by Cesare Prandelli followed by Voro again. The year before that they had gone from Nuno to Voro and Phil Neville, briefly, and then from Gary Neville to Ayesteran. And this summer, they changed again, but this time it was different. The fact that they got a manager was a start; better still, they got the right manager. Born in Asturias, a former Sporting Gijón player who began his coaching career at local side Lealtad and then at Sporting’s B team, Marcelino took Recreativo de Huelva from the second division to an astonishing eighth place in primera, won promotion with Real Zaragoza even in the midst of a crisis from which they have still not fully recovered, led Racing Santander to their best finish, and brought Villarreal back from the second division and to the top of the table for the first time. Now, after two years finishing 12th, of instability and errors, of division and a lack of direction and seemingly continual crises, it was time to make Valencia Valencia again. It was not just Marcelino: conscious of the mistakes made, Valencia changed everything. The new president is Anil Murthy, a former diplomat and West Ham fan, and Mateu Alemany, once the president of Real Mallorca, became the director general. “The whole club is just much more serious in everything,” one insider says. They have even announced that they are actually going to get the new Mestalla built, where work stopped eight years ago and where all they do each day is sweep up. There was a clean out of the dressing room, too. Only five players remain from Peter Lim’s first year as owner and 16 left in the summer, while seven came in. If the turnover was high, it was rational and thought through this time. Signings were also – and here’s the thing – agreed with the manager; he was handed an authority others lacked. More importantly, so the departures were agreed with him, too. Here, advice was sought from Voro. Had he asked, Ayesteran and Gary Neville would have told a similar story and remember Prandelli’s “Fuori!” rant, when he accused the players of lacking professionalism? Well, now at last they were fuori, on Voro’s well-placed advice. There was a dressing-room clean out, Enzo Pérez, Álvaro Negredo and Diego Alves among them. “Purge” may be an unpleasant word, but there was something in that. Marcelino called the players who went “prescindible” – expendable. He wasn’t naming names but it was, he admitted with a tinge of sadness “necessary … to change a negative run, there are players we had to get rid of”. The squad had been made manageable; now he had to manage. Although some players say the serious image is exaggerated, that his demanding nature does not make him draconian, that he engages with players, reaches them and knows how to convince them, that he is likeable, his touch light at times, that Marcelino pushes them and it works. Direct and honest, he has talked about his admiration for Arrigo Sacchi and Rafa Benítez, while Diego Simeone says he identifies with him, and Marcelino insists on a building committed, competitive team. The word Gabriel used for him is “pesado”: roughly, a pain, heavy, hard work, tough going. Intelligent and intense, he wanted a squad that he could lead and that would follow him, creating a climate conducive to a change in culture. Some of his key men had things to prove: Simone Zaza had West Ham to leave behind; Gonçalo Guedes, only 20, barely played at PSG; things didn’t entirely work out for Geoffrey Kondogbia at Inter; Rodrigo had never scored more than five league goals; Parejo had been halfway out; José Luis Gayá, like Parejo, stood accused but was given a second chance; Neto emerged from Gianluigi Buffon’s shadow. Marcelino wanted them hungry, metaphorically. And, some soon found, literally. “We got used to it,” Parejo said. It’s not only about the weight, although that does symbolise the seriousness and it is genuinely something that people in the game talk about. Marcelino insists that the physical condition and analysis “quantifies the footballing work; it does not dictate it” and says that he doesn’t really know anything about the physical preparation – the genius is Ismael Fernández, his fitness coach – but it is fundamental and non-negotiable. Everything starts with tests that set the parameters for the season, identifying players’ optimum statistics which are monitored constantly, with fines for those who do not fulfil the criteria daily, and they work in what the coach calls “micro-cycles” that seek to maintain that. If a player’s body fat index goes over 9.5 he simply doesn’t play. That speed, stamina and agility goes hand in hand with his style: playing in a 4-4-2, Marcelino wants the ball and, more importantly, wants it back when they lose it. But he is not interested in possession for its own sake. “A team with 80% possession and only three shots on goal bores me,” he said. Instead, it is the pace and precision of counter-attacks that most occupies him, built on defensive solidity. His teams are, as the Spanish word has it, very vertical, but that doesn’t mean a long ball: instead it means compact and coiled, always ready to spring forward and always in numbers, across the turf, players making runs across each other. The mechanism is built on repetition, carefully planned and conducted with intensity, underlining that while quantification matters individual analysis does not mean individualisation of approach: “You start with the idea that football is collective,” he says. Nor, he insists, can you ask a player to do something he is not capable of, although you can hide defects and maximise qualities. It is working. Before the match at Mestalla on Saturday night, Zaza collected the award for La Liga’s player of the month; by the end of it, he had scored his eighth goal of the season, second only to Leo Messi in the scoring charts. Rodrigo has scored five league goals after nine games – as many as he has got in an entire season at Mestalla. Kondogbia has been sensational in the middle of midfield: Valencia have a €25m option to buy which, right now, they would be mad not to take up. Alongside him is Parejo, a playmaker and passer who, his manager says, makes the difference – a personal, pastoral project and a professional one too that is producing goods. Parejo has refound himself and leads team-mates. As for Gayà, he has started every game but one. And there have been opportunities for those coming through: Carlos Soler has been superb. And then there is Guedes – fast, skilful, with a ridiculously good shot on him, a sensation who scored two goals this weekend, one of them absurdly good to go with the absurdly good one he got last weekend against Betis. “An extra-terrestrial,” one local paper called him, while a former player made his view clear in a column that said simply: “Mamma mia!” Guedes has scored three and made five assists already. This week, he got the “Gold” award from AS, which is something that rarely happens if you do not play for Madrid or Barcelona. On loan from PSG, who paid more than €30m for him and whose value is surely climbing way beyond that, they are already singing for him to stay. “I don’t know what will happen,” he says. Guedes scored twice on Saturday, his second, clipped neatly over Sergio Rico, was Valencia’s fourth. The team they defeated were Sevilla, Spain’s fourth Champions League side this season, the best of the “other” teams as Valencia once were, and this felt like a shift in power. A claim made. Not just because of the result, although it was fantastic, but because of the way they played: it was not just fast, it was frantic. Or it would be, except that “frantic” implies out of control and they weren’t: the ball was theirs and it was moved quickly, accurately, deliberately, full-backs flying past, every pass seeming to propel them forward, every runner with another in support. It was exhilarating, Mestalla roaring along with them. “Even the oldest people in the stadium don’t remember a spectacle like this,” wrote Cayetano Ros in El Mercantil. Super Deporte called them a “steamroller”. Eduardo Berizzo, the Sevilla manager, said: “They were unstoppable in attack.” Asked if he thought this was the perfect performance, Marcelino, also revealing own character, replied: “I don’t think it’s possible to play the perfect game because that intensity can never be kept up.” One move just before half-time neatly encapsulated it, starting deep at left‑back and finishing way up the other end on the other side of the pitch, with the right‑back in the opposition area. That didn’t lead to a goal but another similar move did, Santi Mina scoring the third. There was still another to come, taking Valencia to four to go with the five they got against Málaga, the three against Athletic and Real Sociedad, and two against Madrid, and the six against Betis. Nine weeks into the season, they have scored 25 times – only Barcelona have more – thanks to nine players. They are second and unbeaten despite having already played Atlético, Athletic, Madrid and Sevilla: they have faced six of the top eight teams going into this weekend and have only been behind for eight minutes. “It’s mad what’s happening,” their former goalkeeper Santi Canizares said. “We’ll try to make history,” Gabriel said. They already are: you have to go back almost 70 years for a better start. This time last season, they had already lost five times and had sacked a manager. Relegation was two points off; now everything has changed and the top of the table is only one place away. But, asked what their limit was, Marcelino replied: “It’s normal that there is euphoria among the fans, and we thank them for it, but our limit is to keep working, with humility, effort, togetherness and commitment. We have to be ambitious, but euphoria would confuse us and we wouldn’t play the way we are.” Marca “declared a state of euphoria” and the question was asked: never mind the Champions League, could this team aspire to more? Maybe, but one thing seems sure: Valencia are back and they’re hungry. Talking points • So, Sevilla’s horrible week came to an end, beaten in Bilbao, beaten in Russia, and beaten by Valencia. One goal scored, 10 conceded. “I’m not scared of being sacked,” Berizzo said, “I’m scared of not finding solutions to all of our problems.” • “The bookmakers have us down as favourites? That’s a chorrada,” the Leganés manager, Asier Garitano, said. A chorrada is, roughly, a load of balls, but it wasn’t. A gorgeous goal from Claudio Beauvue gave them a 1-0 win and it’s no fluke. Butarque bounced, the sun set and Lega are fifth. They haven’t conceded for five weeks. • “Refereeing is hard, but that hard?!” the Málaga manager, Míchel, asked after Barcelona took the lead in the second minute, Deulofeu backheeling in following a cross that had been clipped in from out of play. “Inexplicable help”, Marca moaned on its front cover. It wasn’t great, but it finished 2-0 and Barcelona are still top, unbeaten in nine. • Atlético are unbeaten too, after another 1-0 win, but that wasn’t great either. And if that sounds very Atlético, it’s not really. “Jan Oblak is always there,” said Diego Godín. Right now, he is there a little more than they would like. As for the fans, there were quite a lot fewer of them than anyone would like. The main stand at Balaídos was declared unsafe and closed down, leaving 9,000 locked out. • The memorable moment came at the end of a night that was largely forgettable, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Theo and Marcelo creating a lovely third in a 3-0 win against Eibar, via three backheels, six passes, and a neat finish from the Brazilian. “It was very nice,” Zinedine Zidane said. • Five years later, the derby was back at Anduva, an old, square, atmospheric ground that could be in some tiny town in England somewhere, a place with personality and even a sign, Anfield-style declaring “This is Anduva”, where 4,655 gathered for Mirandés against Burgos in Segunda B, two teams competing for promotion, first and second in Group Two. A gorgeous goal gave Burgos the lead and that, they might have thought, was that. After all, they had gone nine games without conceding a single goal – they had only scored five. But then again, they had not faced Doctor (yes, really) Diego Cervero yet. He scored his ninth of the season – in nine games – and it finished 1-1.

Publishing a summary of a report it commissioned on the bank’s controversial global restructuring group (GRG), the FCA said lending to small businesses and other companies was largely unregulated. But Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said the regulator was investigatingmattersarising from the report and focusing on whether there was “any basis for further action within our powers”. The FCA has been under intense political pressure in recent weeks to publish the full “skilled persons” report, known as section 116, which was commissioned from a specialist consultancy called Promontory. The consultants were appointed in 2014 after Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an adviser to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier alleging the bank deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. The FCA had begun a general investigation last November but said its work was now “more focused”. It also said it had been looking at what “RBS management actually knew or ought to have known”. The section 116 report, according to the summary, found “instances of inappropriate treatment” towards 92% of the viable businesses that were part of the review, for which RBS handed over nearly 1.5m pages of information and 270,000 emails. It identified nine areas of “widespread inappropriate” treatment including failing to comply with its own policies about transferring business to the GRG division and failing to support troubled businesses in a way that met industry good practice. But Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The report found that “almost all customers who entered GRG were already exhibiting clear signs of financial difficulty”. McEwan did not work for RBS at the time of GRG’s alleged wrongdoing but said: “We have acknowledged for some time that mistakes were made and have apologised that we did not always provide the level of service and understanding we should have done for these customers in the aftermath of the financial crisis.” McEwan said some of the individuals employed by GRG continued to work at the bank, and that the bank and individuals could be the subject of investigations by the FCA. RBS put aside £400m to compensate small business customers last November, but the controversy has continued because Bailey has insisted the FCA will not publish the report in full. Bailey maintained that view as the interim report was published. The Treasury select committee has appointed a QC to compare the summary report with the full document. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the lawyer would report back to the MPs this week. “It has taken the FCA too long to publish its summary of the skilled persons’ report,” she said. The FCA report makes no mention of criminality, and the regulator refused to say whether it had made any reference to police forces around the UK. Last week Police Scotland said it was looking into reports it had received about the bank’s treatment of small businesses. Bailey said the FCA had received many requests for help from small businesses and heard some “very sad stories”. He said the FCA was looking at whether the Financial Ombudsman Service, which considers complaints from individuals,was able to handle small business customers too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/31/wittenberg-spotlight-500-years-reformation-martin-luther","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-31T11:27:04Z","webTitle":"Wittenberg in the spotlight: Luther rules, 500 years after Reformation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/31/wittenberg-spotlight-500-years-reformation-martin-luther","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/31/wittenberg-spotlight-500-years-reformation-martin-luther","fields":{"headline":"Wittenberg in the spotlight: Luther rules, 500 years after Reformation","bodyText":"Today is exactly 500 years since Martin Luther famously (or, for exacting historians: reputedly) nailed his 95 Theses to the door of Wittenberg’s Schlosskirche, turning a rumbling religious rift into a roaring ecclesiastical schism and starting what became to be known as the Reformation. Without Luther, the course of history would be unrecognisable. Yet without Wittenberg, a hive of pioneering intellectual debate in late-medieval Europe and a prosperous power centre of the Holy Roman Empire, Luther would neither have developed his rebellious ideas nor enjoyed the political support to propagate them against the long arm of the papacy. Within a century of the Reformation, however, Luther’s fame had eclipsed that of the town, and the town responded by capitalising on his reputation. As early as the 1590s, for instance, English travel writer Fynes Moryson noticed an inscription in a scholar’s room there: “Here stood the bed in which Luther gently died”. “See how much they attribute to Luther,” wrote Moryson, mocking the spurious claim, “for this is not the place where he died, neither was there any bed, yet suffer they not the least memory of him to be blotted out.” Luther City Day visitors to the town today can easily leave with much the same impression. Named Lutherstadt Wittenberg in 1938, it has traded under a variant of that ever since: the anti-clerical GDR post-positioned the attribute, but didn’t dare remove it entirely, even celebrating Luther as a kind of communist avant la lettre on his 500th birthday in 1983. Since German re-unification, Lutherstadt has been back at the head of the name and costumed choleric monks now patrol the lovingly restored town centre providing tourists with that period kick. The annual Wittenberg festival in June commemorates the marriage of Martin Luther to Katharina Bora and souvenirs include punning socks sporting Luther’s most celebrated quote (“Here I stand, I can do no other”) and T-shirts advertising that the city has been “Protestant since 1517”. Unsurprisingly, Wittenberg has not let 2017 slip by unnoticed, with a whole summer of celebrations involving international heads of state and church groups from around the world; the Reformation Jubilee will culminate today on 31 October in the presence of Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Wittenberg in numbers -12% Difference in population 2017 measured against 1981 (from 54,000 to 48,000) 172,514 Number of overnight stays annually (most recent figures: 2014) 15.1% Percentage of Protestant residents (Catholics: 3.5%, no religion: 79.5%) 4 Number of Unesco world heritage sites on one single thoroughfare History in 100 words Strategically situated on the Elbe, Wittenberg rose to importance in the patchwork Holy Roman Empire, blossoming around 1500 under the Electors of Saxony, patrons of Renaissance men such as Dürer, Cranach, and of course Luther. Its university was renowned Europe-wide: languages like Finnish and Hungarian owe their first transcriptions to bible translators trained there and it attracted intellectuals through into the 1700s (notably: Lessing, Amo). Its academic star waned after the Prussians turned the university into barracks in 1817, but industrialisation brought new wealth – and military production. Despite this, its historic centre survived the second world war and decades of GDR neglect unscathed. Wittenberg in sound and vision Several world-famous Renaissance portraits were painted here – mainly of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchton, mainly by Cranach the Elder or the Younger. The poetic Luther is also responsible for the text of several hymns: the title of the most famous, Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott, is emblazoned on the Schlosskirche tower. It still echoes through the city on a regular basis – sometimes in translation as a “A Mighty Fortress” when sung at the English language services put on for international visitors. Due to his anti-Semitic outbursts in later life, Luther is also anachronistically associated with the Medieval Judensau – ‘Jew pig’ – carving on the exterior of the Stadtkirche. In a controversy reminiscent of “Rhodes must fall” at Oriel College, Oxford, there is a conflict between the concerns of today’s Jewish community and the danger of sanitising history. In 1988, a plaque in memory of the persecution of the Jews was laid below the image to contextualise it and a cedar tree planted as a symbol of peace. Wittenberg also takes part in the Germany-wide “stumbling stones” project to commemorate the victims of National Socialism. Throughout 2017, local filmmaker Peter Benedix has been documenting the Reformation festivities. Regular shorts have been published ahead of the feature length film, set to appear next year. Wittenberg’s most popular on-screen appearance was in 1983 in Der lange Ritt zur Schule (The Long Ride to School), a fantasy film from GDR days in which a dreamy young boy gets distracted on the way to class and ends up riding across the prairies, his bicycle transformed into a mustang. How liveable is Wittenberg? Despite its secular bent (only the truest believers withstood 40 years of communism), the population is proud of its heritage, of its resplendent historical centre, and of the 2017 Jubilee; yet a slight disquiet makes itself felt. Some older residents mention the 1983 celebrations, for which the East German government had the fronts of the town’s historical buildings refurbished, leaving the actual substance to decay. “Some people are worried that 2017 could be the next 1983. Another attempt to make the town a showcase – followed by more neglect,” says Alexander Baumbach, a journalist at regional daily Mitteldeutsche Zeitung. Baumbach freely admits that his fear is probably unfounded. The houses once inhabited by Luther and Melanchton as well as the two churches are Unesco protected, and the centre generally is in visibly good shape. General satisfaction with life in Wittenberg is high: in the 2001 survey of residents, only 55% of those living centrally were happy with their surroundings, with 8% registering their discontent. By the 2015 survey, 68% were happy and only 1% dissatisfied. The same survey also records a sharp increase in the number of town-centre residents spending more than a third of their income on housing, however, as the flip-side of the extensive renovation work. “Against other comparable towns in the former East, Wittenberg is doing really rather well,” Baumbach adds, alluding to the nearby city of Bitterfeld, with its desolate shopping streets, 20% unemployment, and staunch support for political extremists. At 7%, joblessness in Wittenberg is above the nationwide average, but below the regional rate; following two tough decades in which East German industrial companies reeled from exposure to international competition and ruthlessly expansionist western firms, chemicals firms are now creating jobs in the town again. Meanwhile, combined with the increasing popularity of German destinations both internationally and domestically, the lasting interest in Luther means that there is no shortage of work in the hospitality and tourism sector. Inside city hall At the recent federal election, support for the far-right AfD ran at 20% – above the nationwide share (13%), but by no means comparable with strongholds in the party’s former GDR heartlands. “This is still the East, though,” Baumbach adds, “with all its problems.” An overstretched police force spent much of 2016 struggling to deal with right-wing extremist attacks on homes for asylum seekers while, in late September this year, an altercation between a local man and a Syrian refugee which resulted in the death of the former outside the town’s Arsenal shopping centre hit the headlines. The local branch of the right-wing extremist NPD held a “memorial ceremony” days later. Then there is the aging population. Tragically for a town which for centuries thrived on a renowned university, its young move away to study, often settling down elsewhere, too. In the overall fall in population since Reunification, the number of people between 20 and 40 has declined more strongly than other age groups. “That’s why local employers such as SKW Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz – which produces industrial chemicals – are investing heavily in municipal infrastructure and in extras like creches: they need to attract and retain staff,” says Baumbach’s colleague, Anne Nicolay-Guckland. Not everyone is comfortable with the close symbiosis between the municipality and SKW, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Agrofert conglomerate belonging to controversial Czech billionaire and winner of the neighbouring country’s recent elections, Andrej Babiš. When the town used SKW money to refurbish the fire station, there were rumblings that surely any self-respecting municipality should be able to ensure the basic safety of citizens without recourse to private money. Yet there is a broad political consensus that, in times of low state investment and in view of the importance of the chemicals industry in this part of Germany, the town cannot do without the company. What’s next? According to mayor, Jochen Kirchner, Wittenberg’s population is still not rising because there are only half as many births as deaths but, with more people moving in than moving away, the outflow has been staunched. He goes on to outline how the town intends to profit from the publicity of the Jubilee in the long term: “There are lots more 500th anniversaries to come – of Luther’s burning of the Papal Bull in 2020, for instance, or his marriage to Katharina Bora in 2025 – many of which we can celebrate with other Luther locations such as Eisleben, Halle, and Worms. But we can’t top 2017,” he admits, and “so will be broadening the focus to include, but not be dependent on, the Reformation.” He mentions the town’s new role hosting small-scale conferences. “Moreover, we have an industrial tradition as well as a religious and cultural one,” he says, referring to SKW’s historic Piesteritz workers’ village as a classic example of industrial paternalism, “and the town is strongly supportive of its industry today, too. Along with our natural surroundings, that gives us three key elements to build on.” At the Wittenberg tourist bureau, Kirsten Ruske expands on Wittenberg’s non-Luther-related charms: “The Klosterkirche is crucial to the history of the House of Ascania,” she says, starting in the early Middle Ages and moving through a range of attractions in town and nearby: “Just down the River Elbe, there’s the Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm,” she says referring to another Unesco world heritage site in the region, as well as the original Bauhaus from where the design movement began its march to ubiquity. “The Elbe nature reserve begins at Wittenberg, too. Then there are numerous cycle routes: the Elbe path, Berlin to Leipzig, an industrial heritage trail and, obviously,” she adds, “the Luther route.” Closer zoom For the final months of the Luther Jubilee, follow @luther2017_de on Twitter or go to Visit Luther for information in English; @lutherstadt offers information on what to do and see in and around Wittenberg.

Koeman, 54, was sacked on Monday after a dismal run of form that has left Everton third from bottom of the Premier League and with two wins in 13 games. The decision was taken by Farhad Moshiri, the major shareholder, and it fell to the chairman, Bill Kenwright, and the chief executive, Robert Elstone, to tell Koeman after he had taken training at Finch Farm. The Dutchman told friends on Sunday evening, hours after a 5-2 defeat by Arsenal, that he retained Moshiri’s support. The Everton hierarchy are considering several candidates to replace the manager lured on a lucrative deal from Southampton in June 2016. The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, Watford’s Marco Silva, the former Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti have been linked with the vacancy, although there had been no formal approach from Everton to their counterparts at Turf Moor by Monday evening. Tuchel, Jürgen Klopp’s successor at Dortmund, is available but is believed to want a club in the Champions League or, ideally, the opportunity to become Ancelotti’s long-term replacement at Bayern Munich next summer. Hoffenheim’s Julian Nagelsmann is likely to provide strong competition for that role. Unsworth is another candidate to replace Koeman on a permanent basis. The former Everton defender, who has flourished as manager of the club’s under‑23s, took charge of one Premier League game after Roberto Martínez’s sacking in 2016 and will reprise his caretaker role for Wednesday’s Carabao Cup tie at Chelsea. The under-23s coach John Ebbrell will also be in the Everton dugout at Stamford Bridge. Unsworth, 44, is highly regarded within Goodison and, although he lacks managerial experience in the Premier League, would welcome an extended run of games to press his claims for the job. He may be given the next four matches until the international break – Chelsea, Leicester City, Lyon away and Watford – to impress. Moshiri moved to sack Koeman after watching the Arsenal defeat on Sunday, Everton’s seventh loss in 11 matches in all competitions. The former PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and Benfica coach led the club to a seventh-placed finish in his only full season in charge but, despite an investment of almost £140m in players this summer, Everton’s form has nosedived. A club statement read: “Everton football club can confirm that Ronald Koeman has left the club. Chairman Bill Kenwright, the board of directors and major shareholder Farhad Moshiri would all like to express their gratitude to Ronald for the service he has given to the club over the past 16 months and for guiding the club to seventh place in last season’s Premier League campaign.” Three weeks ago, following a home defeat against Burnley, Moshiri insisted Koeman retained his total support. Since then, Everton have needed a 90th‑minute penalty to draw at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, lost at home against Lyon in the Europa League, thereby extending the worst start made by an English team in the competition, and been routed at home by Arsenal. The summer’s spending increased expectations on Koeman but most of the acquisitions have struggled. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Davy Klaassen cost almost £70m but have had minimal impact and senior players such as Ashley Williams and Morgan Schneiderlin have been badly out of form. Romelu Lukaku’s £90m departure for Manchester United and the failure to adequately replace the Belgium international have had a major impact. There will be questions asked of Steve Walsh’s performance this summer as director of football but ultimately it was Koeman, who has struggled to find a settled or effective side this season, who shouldered the blame. Koeman will receive a handsome pay‑off from Everton, who had to pay £11m to Martínez and his backroom team after their departure. Koeman’s assistant at Goodison, his brother Erwin, the fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg and the goalkeeping coach Patrick Lodewijks are also expected to leave. The first-team coach Duncan Ferguson may be retained."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/23/leipzig-gewandhaus-orchestra-blomstedt-barbican-london-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T16:47:12Z","webTitle":"Leipzig Gewandhaus Orch/Blomstedt review – warmth and wisdom of a 90-year-old master","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/23/leipzig-gewandhaus-orchestra-blomstedt-barbican-london-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/23/leipzig-gewandhaus-orchestra-blomstedt-barbican-london-review","fields":{"headline":"Leipzig Gewandhaus Orch/Blomstedt review – warmth and wisdom of a 90-year-old master","bodyText":"It remains one of the endlessly debated mysteries of music why the work of some orchestral conductors gets more and more compelling with age. Herbert Blomstedt is perhaps the prime example of this phenomenon in the current era. Now a spritely 90, Blomstedt has come slowly and unobtrusively through a long career in Europe and America to reach cult status, but he has unquestionably ascended to that lofty point now, and a packed Barbican hall was proof that the Swede’s drawing power has never been greater. Blomstedt and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, itself marking its 275th birthday, gave them what was very much a concert of two halves. Before the interval, there was a rare opportunity to hear Beethoven’s triple concerto for violin, cello and piano, a work better known from recordings than from performances in the flesh. But the rewards of this live performance, in a hall that allows the ear to follow detail and interplay between the soloists so clearly, were captivating. Blomstedt set a bright allegro in the opening movement, but for the most part he was content to ensure that the orchestral accompaniment was efficient and unobtrusive, allowing space for the ear to focus on the soloists. With three such fine players as the Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos, the French cellist Gautier Capuçon and the Russian-born pianist Kirill Gerstein, this was a constant reward. Capuçon’s light and ardent tone in particular ensured that the textures never became stodgy, as can happen in this piece. His exchanges with Kavakos’s more intense and physical playing were a constant highlight, but the two string players never eclipsed Gerstein’s mellow piano playing, particularly notable in an encore, the adagio from Beethoven’s opus 11 trio. After the interval, high seriousness reigned in the shape of Bruckner’s seventh symphony, a work premiered by this orchestra under Arthur Nikisch in 1884. And the chance to hear a special warmth of Brucknerian sound, too, from the Leipzigers, aided and encouraged by Blomstedt’s unusual mastery of transitions, in which new phrases, colours and tempi seemed to emerge naturally out of one another, notably in an unerring handling of the long adagio. Blomstedt’s Bruckner did not dwell on perfection of sound, on orchestral detail or portentous pauses, though it contained all of these things. It felt, above all, organic and forward flowing, with the score coming alive from the inside rather from any attempt by the conductor to impose his ego on it. It was, one understood, the wisdom of years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/23/small-minded-shrews-shrink-their-skulls-to-survive-winter-study-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T16:00:21Z","webTitle":"Small-minded?

Shrews shrink their skulls to survive winter, study shows","bodyText":"They use echolocation to explore their habitat and produce an unpleasant scent to avoid being eaten by cats. But the common shrew has another survival trick: as winter approaches, its skull shrinks and then regrows in the spring. Dubbed “Dehnel’s phenomenon” after the scientist who first spotted the effect, the shrinkage has previously been studied by looking at the skulls of shrews that died at different times of year. But since the changes weren’t followed in the same animals, it was not clear whether other factors might be responsible, such as smaller shrews being better able to survive the winter months. Now researchers say they have finally shown the phenomenon is real. “Now for sure we can say this is happening [within] individuals – we can really talk about the shrinkage and regrowth,” said Javier Lázaro, co-author of the research from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. The phenomenon, he adds, appears to be an unusual way to prepare for the harsh months of winter. “These animals cannot hibernate [and] they cannot migrate and they live in a very seasonal environment – so they need some alternative strategy to deal with winter,” said Lázaro, adding the shrews need to eat near-constantly to survive and that smaller animals need less food. “If you shrink an organ like the brain which is disproportionally more ‘expensive’ than other kinds of tissue you might save energy,” he said. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Lázaro and colleagues from Germany and the US report how they captured shrews of the species Sorex araneus, or “common shrew”, between summer 2014 and autumn 2015. The team measured each animal’s body mass and took X-rays of its head while the creature was under anaesthetic. The animal was then microchipped and released back to the same spot. In total 37 shrews were captured more than once by the team, allowing the researchers to explore changes in the skulls size of individual creatures as the seasons changed. The results reveal that the animals’ body mass changed over the year: during the autumn it fell by 17.6%, before increasing by 83.4% in the spring, ahead of the onset of the breeding season. However the animals’ skulls also changed in size, with the height of the shrews’ brain cases decreasing just over 15% on average during the autumn, before regrowing by 9.3% during the spring months. What’s more, while shrews generally don’t live for much more than a year, data collected from a small number of elderly creatures reveals that they appear to undergo a second shrinkage in skull size as they approach a second winter. “The fact that they shrink a second time in a second winter, really suggests [a] correlation between seasonality and the skull size and not just an ageing effect,” said Lázaro. But, he added, mysteries remain, not least why the brain case does not completely regrow in adults in the spring (leaving them with a smaller skull than juveniles despite having a greater body mass), how exactly tissue is reabsorbed to generate the shrinkage, and what is driving the effect. “We don’t know [to what extent] this is genetically programmed, and to which point this is influenced by environmental factors,” said Lázaro, adding that his current research is looking at how the brain itself also shrinks, and the effects of such changes on the animals’ cognition and behaviour. But, it seems the common shrew is not alone: research has revealed that other species of red-toothed shrews as well as weasels appear to show Dehnel’s phenomenon. Dr Allan McDevitt, a shrew biologist from the University of Salford who was not involved in the study, said that the research highlighted the drastic changes some species of shrew undergo to cope with the cold. But, he added, the research also threw up conundrums about how such animals might respond to climate change, and might also have ramifications for human health. Dr Anna Champneys, an expert in small mammals at Nottingham Trent University, described the study as fascinating. “If scientists can work out how skeletons grow and shrink it will aid our understanding of skeletal diseases and could potentially provide a cure one day,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/24/could-science-fiction-data-improve-health","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"Could science fiction save NHS data and improve our health? | Anne Perkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/24/could-science-fiction-data-improve-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/24/could-science-fiction-data-improve-health","fields":{"headline":"Could science fiction save NHS data and improve our health?","bodyText":"The NHS lurches its way through funding crises and organisational dilemmas. It faces the challenge of antibiotic resistance and it must ponder the deeply conflicted question of the uses and abuses of new technology. Its short-term horizon is so thronged with urgent problems that it would be a surprise if anyone had the spare capacity to consider how things could look by the end of the century. A new social enterprise, Kaleidoscope Health &amp; Care, however, decided it would be useful to try to raise the collective medical gaze into the very long term. Last year it organised a science fiction short story competition and invited writers to consider healthcare in 2100. The winners are announced on Thursday. The stories (I was a lay judge) raised some fundamental questions about how the explosion of innovation in genetics and biotechnology would reshape our sense of being human. Most writers were anxious about how to preserve equality of access to healthcare; one of my favourite stories explored the scope for understanding better what we already know about the human biome and its relationship with the natural world. No one considered what seems to me likely to be the existential threat to the NHS, its reluctance to convert itself from a sickness to a health service. But if that particular problem isn’t resolved by 2100 it will probably be too late. The most persistent anxiety was about the ownership and exploitation of genetic data. Not surprising: only consider the fog that shrouds the subject now, where knowledge and expertise is all on one side. Merely contemplating the mix of big data analysts and, different but related, artificial intelligence developers on the one hand, and the vast resource of the NHS’s 70 years of records of the nation’s health on the other makes me feel a bit like King Logenbula faced with Cecil Rhodes, slavering over his goldfields. You know there’s only going to be one outcome. In the 21st-century dystopia of some of the entries for the Kaleidoscope prize, big data becomes big business, captures the secret of life, or at least of postponing death, and then exploits human vulnerability – the desire for perfection, the urge to protect – to enslave us all. It feels horribly plausible. It convinces me that something needs to be done, now. The relationship between the use of NHS data, its huge potential to unlock understanding and at the same time the enticing prospect of building a world-beating life sciences industry by exploiting it – the sort of thing envisaged in the government’s recent life sciences industrial strategy – is something that ought to be keeping us all awake at night. Instead, most of us park it in the too complicated file, and if asked about data sharing tick the box saying no. But that’s a mistake too. NHS data is an astonishing resource. It has the capacity to transform our understanding of care and drugs and environmental and occupational impacts. There may be arguments for saying it’s best left undisturbed; but already, cash-starved NHS managers are plotting ways of monetising it. So, instead of leaving it to them we should demand that it becomes a much more open and public process that sets out to inform and engage, instead of walling off knowledge behind a barricade of techspeak. Parliament, since government may not see what’s in it for them, should consider, say, the experience of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority as a model for how a complex scientific and ethical subject can be handled so that it builds support from both the medical and scientific community and the public. The mission statement of the NHS Data Commission would be similar: to build popular confidence by bringing expert scrutiny to the way the life sciences industry wants to use information gained from patients with the power to dictate the terms. Along with scientists and ethicists, it would include intellectual property and privacy lawyers who understand the implications of developments. Its meetings would be public and its reports published, with a particular remit to be accessible. It would be a proper basis for a new industry. The purpose of good science fiction writing is, at least partly, to reflect on the present. That’s what the Kaleidoscope prize does. It would be foolish not to listen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/23/lucy-charles-ironman-triathlon-british-swimming","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T15:17:50Z","webTitle":"Iron woman Lucy Charles: ‘I kept willing my body to fight that little bit longer’ | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/23/lucy-charles-ironman-triathlon-british-swimming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/23/lucy-charles-ironman-triathlon-british-swimming","fields":{"headline":"Iron woman Lucy Charles: ‘I kept willing my body to fight that little bit longer’","bodyText":"“In the last five miles my legs were screaming at me to stop and I was praying I wouldn’t cramp up,” admits Lucy Charles, Britain’s new iron lady, as she reflects on her shock podium finish in her first Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii, last week. “I kept willing my body to keep fighting that little bit longer, kept telling it ‘you can do this; just think about getting to the next aid station, then the next’ until the finish line finally arrived.” At that moment Charles, a 24-year-old from Essex, lifted her arms to the sky and roared in delight – the pain and strain of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run in 30C heat giving way to dizzying exhilaration. Few had expected her to be a contender. Instead she led for much of the race and shattered her personal best to finish in 8hr 59min 48sec. Charles eventually came second to Switzerland’s Daniella Ryf, who retained the title she won in 2015 and 2016. What makes Charles’ story so extraordinary is that until 2014 she had never ridden a racing bike. Instead her goal was to compete for Britain in the Olympics as a swimmer. She was not far away either. Not only was she talented enough to compete in the 800m trials for London 2012 alongside Rebecca Adlington but she also beat Keri-Anne Payne, who was chosen for the 10km open-water swim in London ahead of her, in the Great North swim a month before the Games. “The open-water swim was my best chance of making it,” she says. “There was a few other girls with a chance in the squad but we were all second best to Keri-Anne. It meant none of us got our shot of getting on the London 2012 team, which was a shame,” she says, the frustration evident. “It disheartened me. I thought: ‘What’s the likelihood that in four years’ time the exact same thing is going to happen?’ It made me want to find something different to do.” That led Charles to enter an ironman event with her partner Reece Barclay on a whim, even though her knowledge of the event was almost non-existent. “When I signed up to do my first one in 2014 I said to myself, ‘I’ve got a mountain bike, I can do it on that’,” she says, laughing. “I soon learned that it definitely wouldn’t be possible. Then it was a case of having to learn to ride a road bike – but I just kept falling off, because I kept forgetting that my feet were stuck to the pedals and I had to unclip before I stopped.” “So many people would laugh at me,” she says. “They would say, ‘You can definitely swim but we don’t know whether you will be able to get through the other two disciplines.’ It’s crazy to think that three years ago I couldn’t ride a racing bike and now I’m the second best ironman athlete in the world.” Charles got through her first ironman – it helped that she was a strong club runner as a teenager – and she progressed so rapidly that in 2015 she won the 18-24 age group in Kona as an amateur. That led to a professional contract but her hopes of making an immediate impact were ruined by a stress fracture in her leg. “I was trying to get my name out there and because of that I raced an ironman and a half-ironman with a massive pain in my leg before I decided it was so sore that I needed to get a scan,” she says. “The experts told me that, if I had done one more race, then I probably would have cleanly snapped the bone in my leg. They couldn’t believe I was even running. That’s probably one of my downfalls – I can’t give up, no matter how bad it gets. Sometimes I need to listen to my body more.” Charles tells another story of winning a big middle-distance triathlon in Slovakia earlier this year, despite feeling so rotten beforehand due to food poisoning she nearly pulled out. She chuckles at suggestions she might be seen as a little stubborn. “I train with Reece, who is a very good triathlete as well as my coach, and when we are in the pool doing time trial efforts I will never let him leave me,” she says. “I think it drives him mad but it is also what makes us work together so well.” Until this year the pair were personal trainers in Chingford and, while they maintain an online business writing triathletes’ training programmes for £100 a month, Charles now spends most of her time preparing for races. “We do a hell of a lot of intensity in our training, which I don’t think a lot of ironman athletes do,” she says. “Most competitors do really long days at a pace that is pretty comfortable. But because we have such good endurance already from our swimming backgrounds we like to work at the top end and really be hurting in our sessions.” One of her favourite routines involves doing 30 repetitions of one minute flat out, with one minute recovery, on a stationary bike. It sounds easy – until you try it. “That said, when we did eight weeks of warm weather training in Lanzarote before Kona we did do some very big days to simulate an ironman,” she adds. “That would be a pretty hard swim in the morning of about 5-6km, then the bike for a minimum of three hours but sometimes six to seven and then straight off the bike for a 10km run.” Charles emphasises her sport is not only about arms, legs and lungs but the mind too. “The biggest thing is the mental strength because you are not far off your limits for nine hours. You go through dark periods in a race. Everyone does. You have got to stay so strong in your own head if you want to succeed.” In Kona Charles went through some tough moments on the run but was spurred on by some on-course advice from Chrissie Wellington, Britain’s four-times ironman world champion, whom she met for the first time in Hawaii. “Afterwards we spoke at the finish and she told me: ‘You’ve got to soak this up and enjoy it’,” Charles says. “I was thinking, ‘I am! I am! I’ve come here on my debut and come second at the world championships, I’m definitely enjoying it!” Inevitably she is already being hailed as Britain’s next Wellington, a label she says is flattering but premature. “It’s incredible to be even compared to her because she is a huge hero and icon to me. If I can be even half as good as her, and provide half the inspiration to others that she has to me, then that would be amazing.” The next aim for Charles is to emulate Wellington by going one better and becoming the world champion. “I used to think it would take me five years but after what happened in Kona my goal is to do it in 2018.“The good news is there is still so much I can improve on, across all three disciplines. I know I am only going to get faster.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/24/how-police-miss-chances-to-investigate-modern-slavery","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T23:01:30Z","webTitle":"How police miss chances to investigate modern slavery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/24/how-police-miss-chances-to-investigate-modern-slavery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/24/how-police-miss-chances-to-investigate-modern-slavery","fields":{"headline":"How police miss chances to investigate modern slavery","bodyText":"A highly critical report on police forces’ response to modern slavery has uncovered some shocking instances of failures to investigate suspects and protect victims. Here are examples of poor conduct by some of the 10 forces inspected, as highlighted by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services. Cases closed prematurely Fourteen Romanian workers attended a police station complaining of exploitation on a building site. The group said they did not wish to support a prosecution and were repatriated back to Romania. Formal statements containing the victims’ accounts were not taken to enable the police to understand whether modern slavery and human trafficking offences had taken place. This means the alleged offenders were not prosecuted and other current and potential victims were not protected. Failure to identify victims A Romanian man went to a police station to report the theft of his national ID card by his employers at a car wash and to complain that expected him to work without pay. The report was not initially recognised as modern slavery by the front desk officer and instead was recorded as theft. Delay in protecting victims An eastern European man attended a police station to report an assault, and an appointment was made for him to return the following day when an interpreter would be present. The victim failed to attend until two days later. During an interview it became clear that he was being beaten and had been raped by men he worked for in a takeaway restaurant below the flat he rented. He worked excessive hours and although he received cash payments for this work, he paid most of this back to the shop owner in rent. More effective questioning at the front desk during the initial contact would have helped to identify the seriousness of the offences and the immediate and continued risk facing the victim at his home address. Too much focus on immigration status In January 2017, officers entered a suspected brothel being run by Chinese nationals and arrested a 48-year-old woman on suspicion of immigration offences. It emerged that she was present in the UK legally, and despite her not knowing where she was in the UK or having a key to the premises she was returned to the premises. On the way she disclosed her fear of the man who ran the business, but she was left outside the property regardless. Other officers later expressed concern that she may be a victim of modern slavery and human trafficking, but by the time they returned the property had been vacated. The woman is now a missing person. Failure to record modern slavery offences A police force received information from the environmental health department that it had recently inspected an Italian restaurant and found eight workers there being “treated as slaves”, receiving insufficient food and no pay. The state of their accommodation was described as poor. No modern slavery crimes were recorded by the force. ‘Cancelling’ a crime Five unaccompanied Vietnamese children – three girls and two boys – arrived in the UK in the back of a lorry and were arrested for immigration offences. The children were placed into foster care but went missing. The police considered that the girls may have been trafficked into the UK but did not seem to view the boys as also being potential trafficking victims. Police inquiries as part of the missing person investigation found that the children had used a mobile phone in a cafe and received a text suggesting they should travel to London. A phone number from which the text was sent was found to be connected to a Facebook group for Vietnamese nationals looking for work in nail bars. However, the girls were not found and they remain at risk of exploitation. No investigation was undertaken into modern slavery and human trafficking offences. The crime was cancelled by the force crime registrar, with the rationale that “the report does not amount to an allegation of modern slavery within the UK. The subject’s asylum claim/status is being considered by the Home Office UKVI [visas and immigration] department. For the above reasons I am satisfied this matter should be cancelled on the basis that the crime was recorded in error.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/28/childrens-books-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T09:01:00Z","webTitle":"Children’s books roundup: the best new picture books and novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/28/childrens-books-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/28/childrens-books-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","fields":{"headline":"Children’s books roundup: the best new picture books and novels","bodyText":"Ghoulish goodies abound for picture-book fans this Halloween, including I Want to Be in a Scary Story by Sean Taylor and Jean Jullien (Walker). Asked what sort of story he’d like to be in, Little Monster demands a scary one. But a spooky forest and haunted house prove too perturbing – and he wants to be the one doing the scaring … This is beautifully structured for reading aloud; a vibrant, viewpoint-flipping picture book that should lessen small readers’ fairytale fears. Also from Walker, The Wolf, the Duck and the Mouse by Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen is a subversive delight. When a wolf meets and instantly devours a mouse, a happy ending seems unlikely; but the wolf already contains another resident: a duck, who enjoys the cosiest of creature comforts in his windowless abode. “I may have been swallowed,” declares the defiant bird, “but I have no intention of being eaten.” The earthy darkness of the wolf’s interior contrasts with soft shades of moonlit forest in this unexpected, hilarious collaboration. Benji Davies’s The Grotlyn (HarperCollins) also examines the terrors of the unknown, via rhyming text and a dark Victorian landscape full of aproned maids and silhouetted chimney pots. Rubi is afraid of the Grotlyn after she hears a noise on her way up to bed; when she discovers the sound’s true source, though, her anxiety is allayed. An unusual, thought-provoking story of unfounded fears and a joyous flight to freedom. Addressing courage in a very different way, Malala’s Magic Pencil (Puffin) tells the beguiling tale of Malala Yousafzai’s dream of a magic pencil and her discovery of education’s transformative power, in a beautiful paean to children and their potential for heroic change. Husband-and-wife duo Kerascoët’s watercolour illustrations, with their golden flourishes and bursts of pink, perfectly complement the text – the black page detailing the Taliban’s attack on Malala (“My voice became so powerful that dangerous men tried to silence me. But they failed”) is a clear and resonant call to arms. Sleuths aged five and above will rejoice in Hiro Kamigaki’s Pierre the Maze Detective: The Mystery of the Empire Maze Tower (Laurence King), a follow-up to the bestselling original story about Pierre. Seductively intricate, with the narrative guiding the reader via ballrooms, sweetshops and fairgrounds to the pinnacle of the titular tower, this gorgeous combination of search-and-find and maze is seeded with exciting hidden extras – mini-mazes, trophies and stars to spot. Too fascinating for bedtime, it’s the perfect rainy-day companion. Alex T Smith provides more mysterious high-jinks in Mr Penguin and the Lost Treasure (Hodder), featuring a seabird-turned-private detective, his silent spider sidekick Colin and missing treasure concealed in a museum. Full of fish-finger sandwiches, secret jungles, nefarious plots and cryptic codes, it’s addictive slapstick, with Smith’s appealingly arch black, white and orange illustrations. Tom Fletcher’s The Creakers (Puffin), meanwhile, is a stonkingly good novel for the over sevens. One morning, Lucy Dungston wakes to discover that the town’s adults have vanished. How will the children – glamourpuss Ella, geeky Norman, and conscientious Lucy herself – manage without them, and can they be brought back? Laced with direct addresses to the reader and gleeful descriptions of malodorous underworld creatures, it’s both a compelling adventure and a nuanced celebration of friendship and family love, to which Shane Devries’s vigorous illustrations add inclusive richness. Readers aged eight and over are in for a treat in Kate Saunders’s new fantasy The Land of Neverendings (Faber). Emily is mourning her sister, Holly, with whom she once shared stories of Smockeroon, an imaginary idyll; her mother’s friend Ruth is mourning her lost son Danny. When Danny’s old toys begin to appear, bickering and picnicking, in the “hard world” of reality, Emily realises that Smockeroon may not be so imaginary after all. But the door between worlds is not supposed to open … A delicate, funny, poignant exploration of grief, love and memory that has the welcoming warmth of an instant classic. In The Midnight Peacock (Egmont) Katherine Woodfine brings her tautly plotted Edwardian series The Sinclair’s Mysteries to a stylish conclusion, in a book filled with deft characterisation and delectable period detail. Sophie and Lil, now transformed from shop-girls to detectives, must first join a fashionable house party at snowy Winter Hall, then foil a fiendish plot at the Midnight Peacock New Year’s Ball if they are to discover the truth about the Baron and, at last, defeat him. Fantasy fans will devour Jessica Townsend’s striking debut Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crowe (Orion). Morrigan has always known that, as a cursed child, she will not live past her 11th birthday. When she is saved by magical traveller Jupiter North, however, she does not expect the impossible challenges that await her in the fascinating world of Nevermoor. Detailed, inventive world-building, a strong heroine and a rousing refrain (“Step boldly!”) all make for a splendidly involving read. For teenagers, Juno Dawson’s Grave Matter (Barrington Stoke) is a super-readable illustrated novella of lost love and dangerous yearning. When Eliza is killed in a car accident, Samuel is willing to do anything to get her back – even to enter the world of hoodoo and accept the Milk Man’s dangerous assistance. A deliciously succinct, creepy chiller, interspersed with Alex T Smith’s shadowy, atmospheric images. Amy Reed’s The Nowhere Girls (Atom) follows Grace, Erin and Rosina, outsiders in a small-town community in Oregon, as they take up arms on behalf of a girl raped by three members of the high-school football team, challenging the apathetic complicity of the powers that be. Told from multiple perspectives, at once harrowing and heart-lifting, it’s both an indictment of entrenched victim-blaming and a demonstration of what can happen when girls lay aside their differences to demand better treatment. There is more clear-sighted feminist analysis (and many more belly laughs) in Holly Bourne’s latest young adult novel, It Only Happens in the Movies (Usborne). Audrey, weathering the aftermath of a big break-up, declares war on the cliches of romantic comedy while simultaneously trying to hold notorious charmer Harry at arm’s length. It doesn’t help, however, that they are co-workers at an indie cinema, or that film-mad Harry is attempting to shoot his first zombie feature. Boasting emotional depth and believable heartbreak alongside such memorable lines as “frostbite of the bumhole”, this is Bourne at her outrageous, courageous, necessary best. • To order these books go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Political correctness is back – and I love it","bodyText":"Bad news everyone – that bleedin’ political correctness has gone mad again. I know, you thought we killed off political correctness on 23 June 2016, along with open borders, economic security and a modicum of respect for people who don’t look exactly like Robert from the original Guess Who board game. But it turns out that political correctness was only wounded. It’s back. And according to the experts in identifying the madness of political correctness (that is, Daily Mail commenters and Twitter users whose avatars are British bulldogs waving union jacks), it’s ruining everything you love. It started, as these things always do, with a children’s animated TV show. If you didn’t know, Thomas the Tank Engine is dumping two male trains in favour of two female trains in its next series, and the reaction has been, as you’d expect, a healthy dose of frothing at the mouth. Most commenters on Mail Online seemed angry with the idea of female trains being foisted on to children, which I can’t get my head round. We’re talking about sentient steam engines with no recognisable human anatomy save for giant, constantly grinning faces. Questions about their gender are among the last I would have, after “Do they have brains and if so, are they behind the face?”, “Do they have lungs?”, “Can they breathe?”, “Are they truly alive?”, “Will this nightmare train try to kill me?” and “Where are the emergency exits?”. But before I could get any answers to those, there was another political correctness insanity outbreak – this time over Fireman Sam. The head of the London Fire Brigade dared to ask whether the title character could change his name to Firefighter Sam, given that “fireman” is a loaded sexist term. Cue more mouth-foaming. “How dare they ruin our childhoods?” was the cry, knowing full well that the next step after this could only be to perform lobotomies on every Fireman Sam fan over the age of 30, replacing their happy memories of animated burning buildings with an intimate understanding of the works of Gloria Steinem and the plight of women in the 1950s. The idea that political correctness, while good for society, makes entertainment worse is a popular one. Last month Mel Brooks claimed that politically correct society was the “death of comedy”, which is something the maker of Robin Hood: Men In Tights would know all about. Political correctness is often portrayed as a limiting factor or an obligation – a token nod to minorities or women that gets in the way of the story. It’s seen as something we need, not as something we want – we begrudgingly put up with it, like taxes, or speed limits, or Phil Neville as co-commentator on an England match, because we know that if we didn’t our lives would be worse: we’d have more poverty, more deaths on the road and more Andy Townsend on our TV. Who actively likes political correctness? I’ll tell you: me. I love it. I want more of it. In comedy, on TV, in films, in advertising, in everywhere. I want “politically correct” to become a cool thing to say, like “dank” or “mad ting”. In my perfect world, a breakdancer would invent a new move, and everyone in the crowd would say: “Woah, that was so politically correct!” Why? Political correctness forces easy jokes off the table. Most people telling politically incorrect jokes like to tell themselves that they’re edgy, but in fact they’re just trading off of dull stereotypes. They’re not “saying what we’re all thinking”, they’re harking back to cosy, easy bigotry. You’re not being shocking, you’re telling jokes many of us have heard our racist family members tell. Stop wearing your inability to grow and listen to other people as a badge of honour. For some reason, politically correct has become a synonym for “safe”, the suggestion being that it stops shows from being honest about race, class and sex. But it should be the opposite: trying to get new voices and new conversations into an industry that has been dominated by middle-class white men for decades. For instance, Timewasters on ITV, the great new show about four black south Londoners who travel back to 1920s Britain via a time-travelling lift, is completely unlike anything that’s been on UK TV before. Jokes about their interactions with racist Edwardians wouldn’t work if the characters were white and middle-class: as Daniel Lawrence Taylor’s character points out, no time period before 1980 is safe for black people, which is why time travel is more of a white person thing. In reality, the enemy of comedy isn’t political correctness – it’s nostalgia and lazy characterisation. There’s a belief that old sitcoms were better because they weren’t so concerned with being “politically correct”, but really it’s because they were willing to take risks and do stories that hadn’t been done before. Porridge created brilliant, well-rounded and flawed characters who were also hardened criminals, while Only Fools and Horses made an audience sympathise with a pair of conmen. Attempts to remake those shows fall flat not because they can’t do the old “politically incorrect” jokes, but because the truth that the show is based on is no longer there. Del Boy’s East End is all coffee shops now, prison isn’t the cheeky fun playground Fletcher made it seem, the department store from Are You Being Served probably got closed by Philip Green and none of the characters received their pension. Trying to pretend that the last 40 years haven’t happened in order to keep a formula that worked once is doomed to fail. Political correctness should be actively embraced, not as a quota to be ticked off, but as an opportunity to explore new avenues of what it’s like to live in Britain today. So bring on Nia the female train. Gimme Firefighter Sam. Bring on the version of Paddington where he falls in love with Bagpuss and they campaign for same-sex marriage. Above all, just give us new stories. • Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and performer • This article was amended on 24 October 2017. An earlier headline said Thomas the Tank.

The right of peoples to self-determination has been a principle in international law since Versailles and confirmed as the basis for negotiations on issues as varied as Kashmir in 1948, Vietnam in 1973 and the state borders of eastern Europe in 1990. But from Kirkuk to Barcelona, the national question has resurfaced to flummox modern democracies and confound the political tradition of technocratic centrism. As the Spanish Socialist party prepares to endorse the takeover of Catalonia by a rightwing government in Madrid, as an Italian president of the European parliament issues panicked warnings to autonomists in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, those in power are having to reach for the textbooks on international law. The issue of national self-determination is back and unitary states are struggling to cope with it. The left, particularly, seems psychologically unprepared for the eruption of struggles for democracy and social justice where nation and ethnicity, not class, is the driver. And the EU is trapped in a legal limbo. Its own founding treaty failed to include the right to self-determination of peoples – preferring instead to give that right only to nations already recognised as states, in the form of article 50. International law on this issue exists only because certain people fought for the principle of self-determination towards the close of the first world war: the subjugated peoples of the former German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires; Wilson, who forced the principle into the founding documents of the League of Nations, and the Bolsheviks. Having recognised the right of self-determination in theory, by the summer of 1920 Lenin realised struggles for national sovereignty had the power to tear apart the imperialist powers that had invaded Russia. In response, the Comintern ordered communist parties around the world to support “national revolutionary movements” even where they were not led by workers or the left. One hundred years ago, then, politicians ranging from conservatives to Bolsheviks had a strong theoretical understanding of nationhood, the competing claims and the principles against which they were to be judged. This is not true today. The “principle” from which Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish socialist leader, derives opposition to Catalan independence is his own country’s constitution. But if that constitution took absolute priority, then article 1 (2) of the UN charter would be redundant. For the European parliament’s president Antonio Tajani, who berated those who voted for autonomy in Lombardy and Veneto this weekend, the principle is simply fear: fear of “the proliferation of small nations”, as Tajani put it – which, again, is not an argument in international law. To move forward we need to understand: why are regions, states and peoples beginning to re-pose the question of national self-determination now? For Spain and Italy it is clear: the mixture of austerity, corruption and political sclerosis at the centre has limited the reality of regional democracy. It has pushed autonomous regions such as Catalonia towards independence and places such as Lombardy and Veneto towards seeking fiscal autonomy from an essentially dysfunctional central state. But in other countries there is an action-reaction cycle under way: Britain leaves the EU; the Scottish government seeks a different form of exit, heightening the tension with the centre; republicans in Ireland spy an opening to stage the referendum on Irish unity they were promised in the 1990s, when everyone assumed economics would solve the problem. You can see the same process happening in a different way in the French pacific department of New Caledonia, whose indigenous Kanak people were promised a referendum on full sovereignty by 2018. When I spoke to Kanak leaders in January, few believed there would be enough support for a break with France. Then in the presidential elections, the white settler population of the island swung heavily behind far-right racist Marine Le Pen, changing the dynamic. As calls for autonomy and independence proliferate, mainstream left parties are failing to understand the basic principle: in some circumstances, the national question is not a distraction from the fight for social justice – it is the frontline of it. And it is not going away. Above the problems of economic failure and racial polarisation, the positive factor driving progressive nationalisms, from Scotland to Catalonia, is technological change. Information-rich societies reward the development of human capital; so the ability to study in your first language, to participate in a rich national culture, to create unique local selling points for incoming foreign investment is more important than ever. If the regions, peoples and nations currently demanding more freedom seem to be driven by “cultural nationalism”, that in turn is driven by technological change plus global competition. The second impact of these forces is the emergence of successful big cities and devastated small towns. In large cities with dense networks of information and culture, you can survive globalisation. In small towns it is harder. So the logical economic strategy is to create a “region” or small nation focused on one big city, and develop the suburban and rural economy in synergy with that city, not the bigger unitary state. If Barcelona were not a massive global success story, the impetus behind Catalan nationalism would be smaller. One Dublin-based financial intermediary told me that Irish businesses continually struggle to make the idea of “Ireland” salient for big Chinese investors: that is despite Guinness, James Connolly and James Joyce. How much harder must it be to project Lombardy or Veneto as a global destination for inward investment, when you’re up against a corrupt and semi-functional Italian state? Understanding claims for secession and autonomy does not mean acceding to them: authoritative legal referendums are the method enshrined in international law to test such claims – and it is a disgrace that the EU and Spanish state have refused one in Catalonia. But in December the European court of justice ruled that article 1 of the UN charter, which guarantees the right of self-determination to states that are not yet independent, is a legally enforceable right in the EU. It has yet to be tested in relation to Catalonia, Flanders or Scotland, but it will be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/25/world-without-mind-by-franklin-foer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-25T06:29:00Z","webTitle":"World Without Mind by Franklin Foer review – the turn against Big Tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/25/world-without-mind-by-franklin-foer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/25/world-without-mind-by-franklin-foer-review","fields":{"headline":"World Without Mind by Franklin Foer review – the turn against Big Tech","bodyText":"Once upon a time, everybody loved the internet. It would make us freer, richer, smarter. It would make us better citizens, better consumers, better humans. This gospel of digital optimism first arrived in the 1990s, when the dotcom boom made it something of a religion. And somehow it persisted, long after the rest of the decade’s delusions washed away. It’s only relatively recently that this faith has begun to unravel. Later historians will pinpoint the precise moment, but two obvious traumas stand out: the revelations of Edward Snowden and the election of Donald Trump. The first demonstrated how much the companies who own the internet know about you, and how easily that knowledge can be acquired by government agencies. The second illustrated how deeply the tech industry shapes the public sphere, and how little it cares about basic civic norms. Now, suddenly, it’s open season on Silicon Valley. Even our mildest commentators and most purchased politicians are finding the courage to say critical things. The tech industry still gets everything it wants, of course, and the spectre of meaningful regulation remains distant, at least in the US. But the narrative has shifted. The dotcom dream, stubborn residue of the 1990s, has died. Franklin Foer’s World Without Mind belongs to this turn. And it couldn’t have appeared at a more opportune moment, with the news cycle constantly feasting on fresh infusions of tech mischief, from Facebook’s fondness for Russian trolls to Google’s forced reorganisation of a major Washington thinktank. Foer is writing for a readership that is ready to re-evaluate the role technology plays in their lives, and to pay closer, less credulous attention to the companies that are building it. To his credit, he seizes the opportunity. This is not a book of small, gentle criticisms. According to Foer, Silicon Valley threatens our souls and our civilisation. Big tech companies, he believes, are on a global crusade “to mould humanity into their desired image of it”. And this moulding is highly destructive. It involves the demolition of privacy, individuality, creativity, free will, competitive markets, the media and publishing industries, the distinction between facts and lies, the possibility for political compromise, and the space for solitary contemplation. The book describes these demolitions in detail, dwelling in particular on Google, Facebook and Amazon. In Foer’s telling, Google wants to hijack human evolution by stockpiling all information and using it to build an artificial mind. Facebook wants to automate away our capacity to think and choose in order to forge a more harmonious social whole. Amazon wants to make knowledge worthless and to kill the traditions that nurture creativity, culture and complex thought. Your receptiveness to these claims will probably have a lot to do with how technology has touched your life. Foer is candid about how it’s touched his. He writes as someone with skin in the game – as someone who has already lost some skin, in fact. He not only comes from a magazine industry decimated by Silicon Valley, but is the former editor of a journal that has a specifically tormented history with tech. In 2012, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes bought the New Republic, and hired Foer as editor, a position he had previously held from 2006 to 2010. Foer says their relationship began well, then soured when Hughes demanded they turn a profit by becoming “a technology company”, which essentially meant chasing clicks more aggressively. In 2014, Hughes fired Foer, triggering an editorial crisis that resulted in the resignation of two thirds of the staff. Foer writes about his time at the New Republic vividly. He comes across as a humane and honourable editor, the kind any writer would want to write for. He tries to resist the rising power of corporate sponsors, who want to peddle propaganda via “native advertising”. He tries to resist the ruthless Taylorisation of his contributors into streams of clickable content, ranked by their traffic metrics. Above all, he tries to resist the deprofessionalisation of literary labour, as the economics of writing deteriorate to the point of pauperism. One can admire these acts of defiance without sharing all of Foer’s nostalgia for the worlds that Silicon Valley killed. After all, the New Republic often played a toxic role in American political life. Its longtime former owner, Marty Peretz, on many occasions expressed anti-Muslim sentiments, and its 1994 publication of excerpts from Charles Murray’s The Bell Curve supported the “race realism” that survives to this day. More broadly, the institutions that Foer celebrates for their stewardship of the public sphere in the era before big tech sometimes stewarded it poorly. Those of us who grew up with the Iraq war rather than Watergate may find it harder to recall a time when journalists placed meaningful constraints on power. Not that we’re better served by having Facebook as our information overlord. But there’s no doubt that the digital dismemberment of old media has cleared space for new voices. Ideas long banished by editorial boards can now bubble up into the mainstream, propelled by the internet and the communities it sustains. These communities couldn’t exist without new technologies of connectivity. And this connectivity is what Foer fears the most: the “hive mind”, he calls it. In Silicon Valley, he sees not merely an industry but a forced collectivisation campaign aimed at melting us down into a Borg-like mass. Solitary genius is replaced by the wisdom of the crowd. The networked mob enforces conformism. Algorithms make it impossible to think for ourselves. Leaving aside the question of whether this characterisation is accurate, the more pressing question is whether it’s politically useful. Because Foer sees collectivism as the problem, he has trouble imagining collective solutions. He proposes that we each make a personal commitment to consuming more artisanal forms of culture. He asks us to forgo the easy pleasures of technology in favour of “the sustaining nourishment of the contemplative life” – a slow-food movement of the soul. But there are many who don’t find the contemplative life all that nourishing, and others who prefer to draw their nourishment from the new forms of collectivity created by the internet. Telling these people to read more books will do little to curb Silicon Valley’s growing power over our lives. At best, it amounts to a lifestyle choice; at worst, it risks alienating potential participants in a political movement to tame the tech industry. Politics is about giving people stuff, not making them eat their vegetables. With scepticism about Silicon Valley reaching a record high, there’s never been a better time to advance a vision for how to organise technology in a way that benefits everyone, not just a handful of executives and investors. “We have deluded ourselves into caring more deeply about convenience and efficiency than about the things that last,” Foer writes. This is a false choice. We can have Twitter and Turgenev. We can keep our humanity intact while enjoying the new tools tech has built – and use politics to make them better. • Ben Tarnoff is editor of Tech Against Trump, published by Logic magazine.

Everyone does. That grand départ into the unknown, the bewildering, clean-sheeted novelty of it all. That initial feeling of hesitation. The lingering trepidation. Then, bang, that’s all behind you. You’re away. You’ve found your feet, you’ve hit your stride. Pulse quickening, limbs loosening, excitement mounting. But your senses are where the real action is taking place. They’re off the charts, flying high. Everything is pinging and buzzing, brimming and popping. You’re alert, you’re alive, you’re there, in the zone, on the mark, nearing your peak. Yes, everyone remembers their first time. And that was how it was for me. Just the other day. A new arrival in Porto, hitting the Portuguese city’s cobbled streets for my first morning jog. Out of the door I headed, a Day 1 novice, a Portugal virgin, my runners fresh from the suitcase, an EasyJet crick still in my neck. I had a tourist map for guidance, full of colourful squiggles and mall-shaped blobs. Pretty, but useless. In no time, I was completely disorientated. Was it left at the bottom of Avenida do Aliados or straight on? Did I go over the Luís 1 bridge or below it? I ditched the map. I’d follow my nose instead, I resolved … and my eyes … and, who knows, maybe even my toes. The hour that followed was intoxicating. Utterly so. For 60 whole minutes, the world around transformed into something palpitating and enlivened. Everything looked brighter, sharper-edged, more given to meaning, perhaps even to magic. Above, the blue of the sky looked bluer than I ever thought possible. Below, the waters of the Douro river glistened brilliantly as though flirting with the sun. As I jogged, the urban landscape seemed to be shouting out, clamouring for my attention. Every bit of it. Pavements declaring their narrowness; roads announcing their cobbliness; riverbanks proclaiming their steepness. Every section of the run had its song, every step its specific note. A week on and I can still close my eyes and retrace my route from start to finish, every inch of it. Spotting Porto’s wood-panelled tourist tram for the first time and wondering if I could outpace it (I couldn’t). Catching my first glimpse of the city’s magnificent Palácio de Cristal as it poked from a cliff high above. The sight of urban anglers idling by their rods and tackle boxes; of the old men with their playing cards and collegial smiles; of the aproned chef cooking fresh sardines on a roadside barrel barbecue. The whole run, cinematically sequenced. From the neat row of palms to the wave-washed lighthouse, to the seabirds in the shallows, to the river-front flats and their washing-line balconies. All of it I can picture, right up to the ghoulish mannequins in the windows opposite my apartment door. Now I think back, the most memorable runs I’ve done are nearly all firsts. Like the forest path along the river Wharfe behind my sister-in-law’s new home, and the walls of Yorkshire stone that later saw me home. Or the blustery stretch along the riverfront in Copenhagen, where the icy rain stung my face. Or the winding uphill slog to the Mirador el Calvario above the Nicaraguan town of Matagalpa, dogs on my heels the whole way. Or the dawn outing along Delhi’s Rajpath, with the sun rising above India Gate. Not all took place in romantic destinations by any means. I vividly recall a recent run along a main road in Sheffield, mostly due to the sheer tarmacked drabness of it all. Or the laps of a small north London park that I once endured as an alternative to the terraced streets around my host’s home. Science has set out to explain the cognitive and sensory impact of running a new route in an unfamiliar landscape. The writer, academic and amateur runner Vybarr Cregan-Reid offers an erudite review of the latest literature on the subject in his excellent book Footnotes. At the crux of the first-run phenomenon is a process called neurogenesis: basically, the creation of extra brain cells while running. These new neurons occur in the hippocampus, the section of the brain involved in memory formation and spatial navigation. The result isn’t the acquisition of more knowledge or a higher IQ, says Cregan-Reid: “Rather, it gives you the mental equivalent of a sharpened pencil and a clean sheet of paper.” Neurogenesis remains contentious in scientific circles, with some arguing it can actually displace early memories. But I rather like a corroborating theory put forward by Cregan-Reid: that the sharp clarity of the first-run experience is actually evolutionary in origin. Early humans used to run down their larger prey, chasing them over many miles until they eventually ran out of steam (or, more accurately, overheated). But chasing your prey over long distances can easily lead the runner into unknown territory. So the brain goes into overdrive, recording landmarks and other visual clues to ensure the hunter finds his way home again. Heightened sensorial stimuli, meanwhile, fuse emotions to these mental markers, thus enhancing their memorability. (Which, incidentally, is why treadmill runs all blur into one: because they’re so dull and samey.) Because first runs are so joyous, it’s always tempting to repeat them. I can feel the banks of the Douro calling me back even now. In truth, most regular runners end up repeating the same three or four routes over and over again. It’s inevitable. Unless you live or work on the edge of a national park, your options from the front door are probably limited. Once that first run becomes the second or third or 10th or 15th, it inevitably looses its sparkle. Repetition and routine – the twin death knells of excitement – begin to kick in. Such runs begin to feel functional as well as (or instead of) fun. What results is not a wonderful unique one-off memory, but a tapestry-like amalgam built up from running the same route again and again. The sensation is not electrifying, for sure. More warm and cosy. So thinks Richard Askwith, at least. In his latest book, Running Free, he observes how picturing favourite old routes in your mind’s eye can take you back to the respective periods of your past when you used to run those routes. “[It’s] as if I were about to wake up from a strange dream about the future and re-enter the world that I lived in then,” he writes. It’s a lovely thought, plus it genuinely works (go on, try it). By definition, there can only be one first time. It’s unique and special and to be treasured, but it’s not the end of the road. I’ve since tried a few alternative routes in Porto. Yet that first was definitely the best. It’s won my heart. Cloud my memory as it may, I can no longer fight the temptation to go back for more. It’s simple: I’m smitten."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/28/tim-dowling-constance-motorway","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T04:59:49Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: Meet Constance.

I’m not allowed to write about her any more","bodyText":"My wife has decided to hire a car for a long-planned weekend away in the country. Our car has brake problems, she says, and anyway hiring a car is still cheaper than buying train tickets for everyone. This is perfectly true, until the oldest one decides he can’t go and the middle one says he’ll need to take a train from university anyway. “So it’s no longer cheaper,” I say, scrutinising the bill while we wait for someone to drive the hire car round from the back lot. “Never mind,” my wife says, as a gleaming white vehicle pulls up beside us. “Look, it’s lovely.” Back at home I am anxious to load up and leave before our hire car gets a parking ticket, and flying suddenly starts to make economic sense. “We’re just waiting for Constance,” my wife says. “Are we?” I say. “She’s coming with us,” she says. “I told you.” Twenty minutes later, Constance arrives and installs herself on the sofa. “Tim, you can’t write about me this weekend,” says Constance. “It doesn’t work that way,” I say. “You’re here.” “I’m leaving the column,” she says. “I’m afraid there’s no procedure for that,” I say. “Fine,” she says. “Then I just won’t speak to you the whole time.” “I’d be happy with that arrangement,” I say. “Why are you being like this?” she shouts. My wife walks in with a bag. “What are you doing?” she says. “Let’s go!” “I’m in the front,” says Constance. “No, you’re not,” I say. A few minutes later we set off, with my wife driving, me in the passenger seat navigating by phone, and the youngest one in the back, seated alongside a mystery person who no longer cares to be named. My wife pushes a button that causes a screen to display a warning about not looking at the screen while driving. “What’s that?” she says. “Don’t look at it,” I say. “Left ahead.” “Lovely seats,” she says. “Should we buy one of these?” “I wouldn’t be caught dead driving a white car,” says the mystery person. “Is this still Acton?” “Dunno,” I say. “I’ve never actually been this way before.” Soon we’re heading west along the M40. Traffic is heavy but brisk, and we are taking advice on our overall route from at least three sources, including the satnav that comes with the hire car. Once we’re past the M25, the traffic improves. Then it gets heavy again. Then it slows to a crawl. Then it stops. “What’s this?” my wife says. “Something must be going on,” I say, scrolling up the map on my phone. “Major delays,” says the youngest one. “Should we get off?” my wife says. “It’s between us and the next junction,” I say. “We can’t get off.” “My phone is saying an hour delay,” says the youngest one. “Mine says 90 minutes,” my wife says. “Christ.” “The M40 is currently closed westbound,” says the radio. “Closed?” says my wife. “Our ETA has now been pushed to midnight,” I say. “Two hours 10 minutes,” my wife says, turning off the ignition. “It goes up every time I look at it.” My wife texts the middle one, who is waiting for his train. Then she calls the oldest one at home. “It’s a parking lot,” she tells him. “People are getting out of their cars. They’re walking up and down the hard shoulder, with babies in their arms.” “Well, this sucks,” says the mystery person. “It’s possible that when we finally get off this motorway, we may just decide to come home,” my wife tells the oldest one. There is a pause. “I see,” she says. “Exactly how many people were you planning to have round?” I begin to feel the first faint stirrings of panic. I open the window and inhale a mouthful of cold air. The driver in the next lane looks at me. Perhaps I should introduce myself, I think; we may be spending the night side by side. As he glances along the flank of my car, I can read his thoughts precisely. He’s thinking: ugh, white."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
