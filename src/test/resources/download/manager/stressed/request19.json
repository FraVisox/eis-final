It’s time we listened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just how many powerful, impressive films does a woman need to make before she’s taken seriously? In Angelina Jolie’s case the answer is four, over a timespan of six years. Her most recent, First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, has just been announced as Cambodia’s official entry for the foreign language category at the Oscars, following a successful premiere at the Telluride Film Festival. Based on Loung Ung’s memoir, it stars Srey Moch as the young protagonist trying to survive the genocidal violence, forced child conscription and labour camps of the Khmer Rouge’s terrorisation of civilians in Cambodia in the 1970s. The reviews have been very good, although the wider world seems baffled as to why one of the most beautiful women on the planet would value politics, internationalism and human rights activism over prettiness, Hollywood privilege and American insularity; why she would want to speak and create rather than be gawped at. In Jolie’s case her commitment, lack of dilettantism and the evident political seriousness of her outlook have prevented her from being trashed outright – as Madonna was for her beautiful-looking, intelligent and delicate film WE, say – but her work has still been erased, ignored, talked down, picked apart in countless petty ways and ultimately dismissed. Two decades into her career, she is still not seen as a heavyweight. It’s disappointing, because in Jolie’s work both as a film director and a stateswoman she is propelled by the single most important impulse behind the global fight for women’s liberation: confronting endemic male violence against women, girls, boys and men. Her 2011 debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, is one of the best war films I’ve ever seen. Focusing on the Bosnian war of the 1990s, it shows conflict as ugly, nihilistic and unjust, riven with frenzied male sexual violence against women and macho abuse and one-upmanship even between men ostensibly on the same side. Jolie looks where other people refuse to, shooting scenes of men raping and brutalising women unflinchingly, realistically and with no titillation whatsoever. It’s a shocking, visceral, deeply feminist film, led by the actress Zana Marjanović who plays a prisoner of war who attains some sort of sick “special status” as the sexual possession of a soldier whom she knew before the war. Repulsively, the film is billed on Wikipedia as an “American romantic drama” and “a love story” when it is the precise opposite: a serious depiction of the way human connections are twisted by mental, political and physical violence. Of course most war films, whoever they are directed by, depict conflict as brutal, unjust, callous and grievously wasteful of human life. But relatively few include women as plentiful or significant characters or make the obvious gendered point that it is men, not women, who are the perpetrators of virtually all the world’s violence in “peacetime” as well as war; and that it is women and children who must suffer, unasked, through the acts and consequences of men’s violence. Jolie excels when she puts the experiences of women and girls in the spotlight. Her second film, Unbroken, in 2014, was a solid biopic of Louis Zamperini, the former Japanese prisoner of war who became an Olympic runner. It was well made, but stately and too worshipful of its subject. Unbroken was superseded by her much smaller film, By the Sea, in 2015. Based somewhat on Jolie’s parents’ marriage but also redolent of Gena Rowlands’ work with John Cassavetes, it tells the story of a couple pulled apart by grief after two miscarriages, which causes them to act out in various unflattering and perverse ways. Although this luxury arthouse work is anomalous in terms of Jolie’s much wider interests as a director, By the Sea marks her out as an auteur who can create stunningly beautiful work that balances sumptuous design with (particularly female) emotional torment. In one scene Jolie’s character Nessa tells her husband, played by Jolie’s then-husband Brad Pitt: “Maybe you shouldn’t have a drink today. It’ll be good for you.” Clearly Brad didn’t listen. And have you heard him speaking French, as he does throughout the film? Oof – it’s like overhearing an upstairs neighbour struggling to move heavy furniture. I love By the Sea, but it’s a gorgeous curio when set alongside the rest of her output. In returning to the bigger, more heavily political canvas of First They Killed My Father, Jolie reconnects with her prior body of work and looks afresh at the often disregarded collateral damage of male warfare: women and children. Let’s hope the world is ready to listen this time. • Bidisha is a journalist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/19/ryanairs-cost-cutting-at-the-travellers-expense","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T17:40:22Z","webTitle":"Ryanair’s cost-cutting at the traveller’s expense | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/19/ryanairs-cost-cutting-at-the-travellers-expense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/19/ryanairs-cost-cutting-at-the-travellers-expense","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair’s cost-cutting at the traveller’s expense","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ryanair’s cancellation of thousands of flights (Report, 19 September) doesn’t come as a surprise – it is a classic example of a budget airline cutting costs at the traveller’s expense.

I’m not sure we were quite aware how they would stick to us. In July I profiled the life of 15-year old Quamari Serunkuma Barnes who was stabbed to death outside his school in January. I spoke to his parents and followed the trial all the way through to the conviction of the 15-year-old boy who killed him. At the time I speculated about what broader systemic failures might help us understand the other side of this tragedy — how a 15 year old boy came to kill. Last week, after meeting the boy’s mother, and learning of her efforts to get help for her son whom she could see going off the rails, some of those failures became clear. From child mental health to social services, there were a range of interventions she sought to reduce the risk of her son either killing or getting killed himself. Her story is one that is rarely told, but, we think, important to be heard if we are going to find solutions to this problem. We published it today on theguardian.com, and you can read it here. We will be pursuing the themes raised by this piece and others over coming weeks. It’s been a cruel summer, with four teenagers killed by knives in England in just one week.

A “black legend” of Napoleon III in both Britain and France held that he was a Machiavellian adventurer who seized power by a military coup, ruled despotically and led France into a terrible defeat in 1870. But Liam’s work argued that, on the contrary, he secured democracy in France, introduced liberal reforms and restored the greatness of France as a thoroughly modern predecessor of the Fifth Republic. He published studies of Napoleon III in English in 1973 and a completely new version for Hachette in 1983, which he wrote in French. This was followed by a French biography of the Empress Eugénie in 1989, which won the Prix Napoléon, and a final study of the Bonaparte family in 2005. Liam was born in Coleraine in Northern Ireland, the son of Herbert, a solicitor, who lost the family fortune, and his wife, Jean (nee McSheffrey). After Queen’s University, Belfast, Liam served as a radio operator in the Royal Navy at the end of the second world war and then trained to become a Dominican priest before cutting that avenue short and opting for an academic career. Supervised at King’s College London by Charles Boxer, the historian of Portugal, he did his initial research on Anglo-Portuguese history in the 19th century, but then switched to the history of the French second empire. Something of an outsider, Liam was not only a Northern Ireland Catholic but a gay man at a time when it was illegal to live out his sexuality. He was fluent in languages that gave him another identity – Portuguese and Italian, but above all French. His first academic post was at the University of Singapore, where he spent three years before returning to the UK and teaching at Henry Thornton grammar school in Clapham, south London. He then took up a lectureship in history at Goldsmiths, University of London, in 1962, a post he held, apart from a short spell at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris (1979-80), until his retirement in 1985, by which time he was head of the history department. Outside work, Liam gave much time to helping with the preservation of Saint Michael’s Abbey in Farnborough, Hampshire, which was founded by Eugénie as a resting place for her husband and son, the Prince Imperial, and entrusted to Benedictine monks. He was also an informal adviser to the Bonaparte family, and was in regular contact with Alix, Princesse Napoléon, wife of the long-time pretender to the French throne, Louis, Prince Napoléon. In France Liam was made officier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2001. He was a second father to many, myself included."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/19/we-must-act-now-to-counter-ash-dieback","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T17:45:11Z","webTitle":"We must act now to counter ash dieback | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/19/we-must-act-now-to-counter-ash-dieback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/19/we-must-act-now-to-counter-ash-dieback","fields":{"headline":"We must act now to counter ash dieback","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s not just in North America where ash trees face extinction (Report, 15 September).

Now, a partially retired psychiatrist living in Waterloo, Ontario, as I look back over decades of reading the paper, I see that it does two things for me. First, it guarantees I am plugged in: plugged in to the scene – cultural, political, scientific, social – and plugged in to the intellectual ideas swirling around the world that are essential to know about. I regularly read articles in the paper on topics that, at first, seem obscure or esoteric. But, reading these articles keeps me ahead of the curve. Time and again, maybe a year later, these same topics will crop up on TV or in a conversation and I can lean back and think – ah, I know about that, I read it in the Guardian Weekly. Second, it has improved my writing. Every week I will suddenly pause while reading and marvel at the sheer aptness of a word or phrase. I’ve absorbed the style of its arresting first sentences and paragraphs. I’ve adopted its prose rhythms and punctuation style.

The national executive committee accepted a compromise deal on the so-called McDonnell amendment, named after the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who is in favour of reducing the number of MPs needed to nominate a leadership candidate. In a further strengthening of the left’s position, the party has also increased the number of NEC delegates from members and unions and authorised a further review of party rules to be conducted by Corbyn’s allies. The proposed changes have been described as “tectonic” by some commentators because they mean that the parliamentary party will find it harder to stop a leftwing successor to 68-year-old Corbyn. It could postpone indefinitely moves by some MPs who want to return Labour to policies pursued by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The proposed changes went through at an NEC meeting in the party’s headquarters in central London that lasted more than four hours. They will be voted upon at the party’s annual conference in Brighton, which will open on Sunday. Committee members approved a reduction of the threshold from 15% of MPs and MEPs to 10% in order to select candidates to be placed on a ballot for members, sources said. It does not go as far as the 5% demanded by some activists. McDonnell tried to stand for the leadership in 2007 when he was a backbencher but was thwarted by a lack of nominations from parliamentary colleagues. When Corbyn stood for the party leadership in 2015 he struggled to secure enough nominations, and only made it through to the membership ballot because some MPs said they would second him even though they disagreed with his views. The 35-strong committee also discussed whether to add more members to the ruling body to represent trade unions and the party’s membership. Sources said that the NEC agreed to add an additional three delegates to the current six to represent the party’s 600,000 members. Unions will be given an extra delegate. The committee is currently finely balanced between pro- and anti-Corbyn delegates. Key figures who have previously been seen as potential obstacles to reform by the leadership, such as the party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, and Corbyn-sceptic unions, did not block the changes. Some so-called moderates have been persuaded that the unexpectedly strong showing in the general election has given Corbyn the right to make changes to the party. Party sources said that a deal was thrashed out before the NEC meeting, which has enabled Corbyn to gain more influence over the party machine without driving his critics out. The committee has also authorised a review of the party’s structures that will open the way for further changes, such as to how the party selects MPs and forms policy. The former Labour MP Katy Clark, an ally of Corbyn who is now the Labour leader’s political secretary, will lead a “party democracy review” to make the case for major changes to how the party elects leaders, selects MPs and forms policy. Clark’s review will report directly to Corbyn and the party chair, Ian Lavery. The NEC also voted in favour of strengthening the party’s position on antisemitism, following claims that the party turned a blind eye to prejudices. Some on the left will be disappointed that the party has held back from pushing for mandatory re-selection, which could have forced MPs to reapply for their positions before an election. With the NEC’s backing, the changes are highly likely to pass a vote on the conference floor. Commenting on the changes, Emma Rees, Momentum’s national organiser, said: “We welcome the review, which is a promising first step towards a 21st-century Labour party that empowers its members and is able to win elections. “We’re glad that all wings of the party are finally recognising their invaluable contribution, and understand that it’s both right and strategic for members to have more of a say.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/hurricane-maria-irma-how-animals-birds-manage","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T11:48:26Z","webTitle":"How animals birds manage in hurricanes? | Notes and queries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/hurricane-maria-irma-how-animals-birds-manage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/hurricane-maria-irma-how-animals-birds-manage","fields":{"headline":"How do animals and birds manage in hurricanes?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After Harvey, Irma and now Maria, I wonder how wild animals and birds manage in hurricanes?

In an open letter to Amber Rudd, 13 women who had relationships with men they did not know were undercover officers criticise delays and raise concerns over the suitability of the new chair of the undercover policing inquiry, Sir John Mitting QC. Theresa May set up the inquiry in 2014 when she was home secretary, after a series of revelations about the activities of undercover officers who were sent to infiltrate political groups. The spies had deceived women into forming intimate relationships, collected information about grieving families such as the parents of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, and stolen the identities of dead children. In the letter, the women claim that, two years into the inquiry, the names of more than 1,000 groups they believe were spied on by political policing units, still have not been made public, nor have the cover names used by the officers. Without this crucial information, they claim, others will not be able to come forward and “it will not be possible to identify the true scale and nature of the abuses” and “women and children may be left unable to make sense of events in their lives”. The women claim since Mitting took over the inquiry chair in May “there has been a significant shift towards greater secrecy”. They point out he has a background as vice-president of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which hears complaints about the intelligence agencies, and claim he is in danger of turning the public inquiry into a secret one. The letter also claims Mitting is a member of the men-only Garrick club, and questions “how someone who accepts the principles of membership of such a club” is suited to investigating “sexist practices and making judgments on what we consider to be clear evidence of institutional sexism within the police and wider legal system”. The women say the Metropolitan police have been allowed to set the pace of the inquiry, with severe and ongoing delays and applications for secrecy. Police have argued that much of it should be held in secret to protect the identities of the undercover officers and the techniques they used. Public evidence is now not due to be heard until 2019, and the inquiry not completed before 2023, the women say. “The inquiry is an investigation into serious wrongdoing by the MPS yet this same body maintains control of much of the evidence,” the women say. “A secret inquiry is not what was announced. It’s not what we thought we were getting,” a woman using the pseudonym Lisa told the Guardian. The inquiry had “taken a disturbing turn”, she said. “It seems that the scales have tipped towards protecting the officers over protecting the public.” She added: “One side holds all the cards.” Mitting’s appointment, to replace Lord Justice Pitchford who retired on health grounds, had “horrified” the woman. “It seems to have changed the whole atmosphere. It is very, very upsetting and we are all quite angry about it.” The women wanted a face-to-face meeting with Rudd to discuss concerns, so that the inquiry did not become “a whitewash”, she said. Timing was crucial because Mitting was ruling on secrecy issues which would set the tone for the rest of the inquiry, said Kate Wilson, an environmental campaigner, who was the first to win her case against Scotland Yard. The home secretary had to step in now, she said. “It is becoming a farce.” The letter complains that in the recent two-year update produced by the public inquiry in June, the word “women” does not appear at all, there is no reference to the “long-term abuse of women” and a timeline in the document failed to include the public apology issued to the women by the Metropolitan police, which “acknowledged that we were subject to human rights abuses by undercover police officers”. These omissions made it clear the serious abuse the women suffered at the hands of the police ”were not taken seriously by the inquiry”, the letter states. A Home Office spokesperson said Mitting, an “extremely experienced” high court judge who “has demonstrated his fairness and independence throughout his career”, had the home secretary’s full support . “We are confident that the inquiry will provide both a deep understanding of historical failings and make robust recommendations to ensure unacceptable practices in undercover policing are not repeated,” the spokesperson said. It was an “extensive and complex” inquiry and it was important that it “proceeds swiftly and makes recommendations as soon as possible”. A spokesperson for the inquiry said: “The inquiry remains committed to discharging its terms of reference, which includes examination of the motivation for undercover police operations and their impact on individuals. There has been no change in its approach to anonymity. “Applications for anonymity are being considered on their individual merits, on a case-by-case basis.“The names of the main groups infiltrated by officers whose cover identities are being published will continue to be published as anonymity applications are decided.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/19/brazilian-teenager-held-on-suspicion-of-british-kayaker-murder-emma-kelty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T20:33:29Z","webTitle":"Three people held in Brazil on suspicion of British kayaker's murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/brazilian-teenager-held-on-suspicion-of-british-kayaker-murder-emma-kelty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/19/brazilian-teenager-held-on-suspicion-of-british-kayaker-murder-emma-kelty","fields":{"headline":"Three people held in Brazil on suspicion of British kayaker's murder","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three people have been arrested over the murder of a British woman who went missing in Brazil while kayaking alone from the source of the Amazon to the Atlantic. Emma Kelty, a 43-year-old primary school headteacher, was last heard from when she triggered a distress signal last Wednesday while in a notoriously dangerous area. In a statement, police in the state capital Manaus said they had arrested one 17-year-old male on Monday in Codajás, 150 miles (240km) away, and a second 17-year-old on Tuesday in Lauro Sodré, where Kelty was killed. That Amazon community lies two hours from the town of Coari, where police arrested the third man, who has been named as Erinei Ferreira da Silva. They are also seeking four other suspects. “People knew she had disappeared and indicated possible authors of her disappearance,” José Afonso Barradas Júnior, chief detective in Coari, told the Guardian. The first arrested teenager told police Kelty was camped on Boieiro Island, which faces Lauro Sodré, when two people approached her. Five others then arrived and the group stole her belongings. She was shot twice with a sawn-off, 20 calibre shotgun and her body thrown in the river. According to the teenager, the group then tried to sell her two mobile phones, a tablet computer and a GoPro camera in local communities. Residents of Lauro Sodré reported having seen Kelty sail past the community in her canoe while still alive. Fire officers and the Brazilian navy are continuing to search for her body and have searched the area where it was allegedly thrown. Kelty, from Finchley in north-west London, resigned as head of Knollmead primary school in Surbiton before going travelling and had kayaked on her own for 42 days of the 4,000-mile trip when she went missing. She is believed to have pitched her tent before she set off her emergency locator flare last Wednesday, alerting the Brazilian navy. A massive search operation involving 60 people, including expert deep divers scouring the riverbed, was launched. On Friday, her abandoned kayak and belongings were found between Coari and Codajás. River pirates are known to operate in the area. Local media reported two men were arrested in July after carrying out pirate attacks around Lauro Sodré and nearby communities. “This region is a problematic region for pirates,” Barradas Júnior said. “It is a region that has pirates, they do robberies, and it is a disputed region because there are a lot of drugs coming from Colombia.” He said pirates had been known to attack Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers, steal their supplies and throw their bodies in the river. A struggle between rival Brazilian drug gangs to control the lucrative drug trade flowing down the Solimões river was blamed for a massacre in which 56 people were murdered in a prison in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, on New Year’s Day. Dozens more were killed in reprisal attacks. The remote stretch of the Solimões where Kelty is thought to have gone missing is the same section where police chief Thyago Garcez disappeared in December last year, after he and other police officers got into a firefight with drugs traffickers. His body has never been found. The Foreign Office confirmed it was supporting the family of a woman who had died in Brazil and said it was in contact with the Brazilian authorities.The family of the adventurer said they were “extremely proud” of her, in a statement released by the Foreign Office. Kelty’s brothers Piers and Giles and her sister Natasha said their “active and determined sister” had recently challenged herself with adventures on the Pacific Coast Trail in the US, as well as in the South Pole and finally the Amazon river. “In a world that is today a much smaller place, the explorer in our sister found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable,” the statement said. “We are extremely proud of our sister who was dearly loved by us all and her strength will be sorely missed.” Posting on Facebook days before she disappeared, Kelty joked about a warning she had been given about the stretch of river she was about to enter. In the post written on 10 September, she said: “So in or near Coari [100km away] I will have my boat stolen and I will be killed too. Nice.” On 12 September she said she was “in the clear” followed by a smiley-face emoji. But a few hours later she posted a message about an encounter she had had on her journey: “Turned corner and found 50 guys in motor boats with arrows!!! My face must have been a picture!! (Town was uber quiet... too quiet!!) all go ... “OK 30 guys ... but either way ... that’s a lot of folks in one area in boats with arrow and rifles.” The British consulate provided the navy with details about the missing Briton last Thursday. Frigate captain of the 9th naval district, Paulo Veiga, added: “A distress flare was triggered by the British traveller, but we could not locate where it had been fired from via GPS. “Local people in the area where the sportswoman’s vessel was found said they saw a woman on the river but they couldn’t tell what direction she was going in. “We started our search last Thursday and there is no forecast end to how long we will look for the missing woman ... We are focusing on the Solimões river.” Olie Hunter Smart, an explorer who completed a similar route in 2015, met Kelty before her trip to help her plan for the journey. He said: “The Emma that I met was an incredibly brave and courageous person who lived life to the full. My thoughts go out to her close friends and family at this very sad time.” In 2010, British journalist Helen Skelton travelled more than 2,000 miles along the Amazon river in around six weeks. But she did not make the journey alone and was followed by a support boat for her safety. Kelty was no stranger to solo adventures. She had previously skied solo to the south pole, becoming only the sixth woman to achieve the feat and had also completed a 2,600-mile hike on her own across the US, among other challenges. In the blog she writes: “My outside adventures were the yang to my work but in so many ways it mirrored it too. “I always saw this as my sanctuary away from a very demanding and focused career that spanned across the education system from preschool to further education, special education, learning BSL and becoming a headteacher (another life dream).”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/20/jerry-seinfeld-netflix-back-and-hes-still-the-ultimate-laser-precision-joke-machine","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T10:00:19Z","webTitle":"Jerry Seinfeld is back – and he's still the ultimate laser-precision joke machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/20/jerry-seinfeld-netflix-back-and-hes-still-the-ultimate-laser-precision-joke-machine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/20/jerry-seinfeld-netflix-back-and-hes-still-the-ultimate-laser-precision-joke-machine","fields":{"headline":"Jerry Seinfeld is back – and he's still the ultimate laser-precision joke machine","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Netflix is now in the Jerry Seinfeld business, and then some. Earlier this year, the streaming service paid an astronomical $100m to buy two new standup specials plus Seinfeld’s web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. But the first fruits of this deal is the just-released Jerry Before Seinfeld special. Ostensibly, Jerry Before Seinfeld is the comedian’s version of 700 Sundays; a sepia-tinged nostalgia-fest about his childhood and adolescence and first steps into comedy. But that is derailed right from the word go because – for better or worse – Jerry Seinfeld is incapable of the self-examination required to pull something as personal as that. He starts by discussing growing up on Long Island. Only nobody ever says they’re in Long Island, he quickly points out. They’re always only on it. Immediately, his childhood memories are jettisoned in favour of a long, Seinfeldian look at preposition use. You can feel him stretch out as he does this, because it puts him right back in his comfort zone. This tract, it must be pointed out, is also a great deal funnier than his attempts at straight nostalgia. This pattern repeats itself again and again throughout the special. The blueprint for his jokes tends to be “In the past we did this, but now you have this and what’s the deal with this thing you all have now?”, which is no bad thing. Seinfeld is not Louis CK. Even under the heaviest scrutiny, he will not divulge much about the flaws and tics and squandered ambitions of his own life. What he is, though, is a joke machine. Jerry Seinfeld has always delighted in presenting immaculate, word-perfect gags – fired from a laboratory and guided by laser – that deal with the mundane details from everyday life. You may have previously wondered why the two main US parties are represented by a donkey and an elephant, for instance, but Jerry Seinfeld has done it far more meticulously, mining every last possible potential for humour from its carcass before moving on. So Jerry Before Seinfeld is basically a sleight of hand. Everything about it – the intimate setting, the brief documentary interludes, the conversations with other comedians – seems to suggest that this will all be new and revelatory. The fact that he even made these concessions to a new form show some effort on his part. Surely most people’s first impulse, given such a fortune from a streaming company, would be to go out and prove they’re worthy of the investment. They’d have turned in a gleaming Kevin Hart of a show, presenting themselves as a dot in a sprawling enormodome full of screaming fans, where all the jokes have to be screamed as unsubtly as possible to reach the back row. But that isn’t what Jerry Before Seinfeld is. The small room means that every word and pause and gesture hits like a mallet. He could go big – my assumption is that his next special will do exactly that – but Jerry Before Seinfeld serves as a neat reintroduction to the man. This is watching a craftsman at work. And forget all the nostalgia hoo-hah, that’s why anyone has ever watched Seinfeld the standup; to marvel at the craft of it all. Jerry Before Seinfeld is on Netflix now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/20/cynthia-payne-the-queen-and-offred-a-whos-who-of-london-fashion-week","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Cynthia Payne, the Queen and Offred: a who's who of London fashion week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/20/cynthia-payne-the-queen-and-offred-a-whos-who-of-london-fashion-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/20/cynthia-payne-the-queen-and-offred-a-whos-who-of-london-fashion-week","fields":{"headline":"Cynthia Payne, the Queen and Offred: a who's who of London fashion week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Who mattered this fashion week? British Vogue’s new editor, the reigning monarch and a shoe baron to name a few. Here are the personalities to know for SS18. Edward Enninful Forget celebrities, the most-watched spot on the front row at London fashion week was the seat next to Edward Enninful. The editor of British Vogue was in his inaugural season doing the shows and to be seated next to him spoke volumes. It meant you were nearly as important as him. At the Burberry show, Enninful sat next to his best gal pals, supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. Topshop, meanwhile, saw him between Moss and her 14-year-old daughter, Lila Grace, a Vogue contributor in waiting surely, and a teenager coming for Kaia Gerber’s most-important-daughter-of-a-supermodel crown. Other seat mates included stylists Kate Phelan and Venetia Scott – both Vogue staffers – and newly appointed fashion critic Anders Christian Madsen. At Emporio Armani, Enninful was sat with new Italian Vogue editor Emanuele Farneti and the long-established alpha US Vogue editor Anna Wintour. The best seat, of course, would have been behind them in the second row – a perfect place to earwig on the conversation in fashion’s corridor of power. The Queen The first series of The Crown went up to 1956 but it felt as if designer Erdem Moralioğlu had had a sneak preview of the second series – he partly based his collection on the Queen’s wardrobe in 1958 or, even more specifically, when she met jazz musician Duke Ellington in Leeds and he resolved to write a piece of music in her honour. In pictures, the queen was wearing a jacquard dress, white gloves and – obvs – a crown, a look that Erdem riffed on for his collection of midcentury-worthy gowns. Expect to see a similar look on Claire Foy in The Crown come December. Pet Shop Boys Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe had their fashion shtick down early on – Tennant was the smart one and Lowe wore the streetwear. The classic 80s band soundtracked key fashion shows at London fashion week – from Topshop to Burberry – and their look could also be seen getting a lot of love on editors in the front row. See Tennant-approved trench coats and Prince of Wales blazers, along with Lowe’s baseball caps. Cone hats, à la Can You Forgive Her, are yet to be spotted. Manolo Blahnik The latest subject of a fashion documentary? Shoe designer Manolo Blahnik with The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards. The premiere took place during fashion week and Blahnik – a British Vogue cover star, a collaborator with Rihanna, the favoured shoe brand of Anna Wintour, a man known throughout the industry by only his first name – was feted once again. As Naomi Campbell says in the film: “He is the king of shoes.” Dolly Parton The melancholy strains of Dolly Parton were on the soundtrack at shows including Emporio Armani and Marques Almeida this week – but Parton’s voice on a number of show soundtracks was not the only thing marking her in SS18. With a Western mood at Versus and loads of pretty pastels everywhere, from Roksanda Ilincic to Preen, her look was reworked for fashion. Parton famously quipped look that “it costs a lot of money to look this cheap”. With high fashion taking hold of her style this season, she would be right. Sidenote: the sight of Parton with Nine to Five co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda at the Emmys was everything. Cynthia Payne Otherwise known as Madam Cyn, the woman immortalised by Julie Walters in 1987’s Personal Services, brothel keeper Payne was previously better known for her role in serving the establishment than her fashion sense. Then Christopher Kane got involved. For his SS18 collection, the designer – whose previous muses have included Elvira and Frankenstein – namechecked Payne. Her brand of sleazy 80s powerdressing by way of an overstuffed living room was put on Kane’s creative spin cycle and – guess what? – it came out cool. Offred from The Handmaid’s Tale OK, so the outfit wasn’t the big takeaway from this year’s TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s novel. But, still, fashion found inspiration. In the Preen show, partly inspired by The Scarlet Letter, puritan-style robes also recalled the clothes worn by Offred and others at the Red Centre. Elsewhere, the red of her robes was seen on dresses that would definitely not be app-roved by the regime – striped chiffon at Marques Almeida, one-shouldered at Antonio Berardi, sequinned at David Koma. Wearing a red frock now? It is a kind of woke party dressing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/20/saboteurs-tory-hard-brexit-eu-boris-johnson-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"The real saboteurs are the Tory fantasists backing hard Brexit | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/20/saboteurs-tory-hard-brexit-eu-boris-johnson-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/20/saboteurs-tory-hard-brexit-eu-boris-johnson-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"The real saboteurs are the Tory fantasists backing hard Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everything in politics is harder than it looks. Theresa May is not the first person to reach high office, only to discover that the skills used for getting a job are insufficient for doing it well. Boris Johnson – unlike his boss in most ways – is in a similar bind. He is a more gifted performer than the prime minister, but loquacity isn’t competence. The foreign secretary’s talent for bombastic phraseology and self-aggrandising frivolity is the opposite of what is required of a chief diplomat. Johnson isn’t good at his current job and is bored with it. The proof is in the essay he published last week, setting out a personal account of what Brexit should mean. It can be interpreted only as a challenge to the prime minister, who is due to outline her own prospectus in a speech in Florence on Friday. Whatever she says will be parsed alongside the pre-emptive rival text. That reinforces the impression of a government unsure of what it wants from a process over which the clock ominously ticks. Spreading confusion this way can’t possibly strengthen Britain’s negotiating position. Johnson knows as much, and doesn’t care. He is concerned with a different position. In drafting her speech, the prime minister has in mind European leaders, who will decide next month whether talks on Britain’s divorce terms have progressed enough to permit the opening of a second phase covering future trade. Johnson’s dissertation has in mind those Tories who prefer not to dwell on the perspective of other EU leaders, since any honest appraisal of foreign interests spoils the story that Brexit is a marvellous gift that the British government can unilaterally bestow on its citizens. Johnson’s cheerleaders depict his intervention as a vision for the future, pointing to his breathless digressions on infrastructure and the wonders of science. In truth, Johnson is facing backwards – not in the nostalgic spirit of Ukip, memorialising empire and 1950s ethnic homogeneity, but in the spirit of 2016 and a leave campaign that dodged questions about the practicality of what it was advocating. No wonder he misses it, his ego’s finest hour. The mere fact of Boris endorsing Brexit led the news for days because a decision of paramount national importance had been subsumed into an internal Tory party drama – what Vince Cable acidly described at the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday as “public schoolboys reliving their dormitory pillow fights”. Johnson is still playing games. May is not. The standard account of cabinet tribes marks out “soft” and “hard” Brexiters. It pits those, such as Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd, who seek maximum continuity with existing structures, and are prepared to pay for it, against those, such as Liam Fox and Johnson, who countenance sudden rupture. The prime minister is depicted straddling the gap, thrown off balance by humiliation in the spring election. There is a better distinction. Some Tories have moved on from the question of what needs doing – the referendum answered that with the single word “leave” – and are applying themselves to the problem of how it might be done: how to protect industries that rely on the single market; how to organise the Irish border; how to support agriculture without EU subsidy. Others shrink from that challenge. They find comfort in the saccharine simplicity of restating the original cause. “Hard” Brexit is the place to which some Tories retreat to avoid getting their hands dirty with compromise. If things go wrong, they can blame the pragmatists for sullying the dream. The prime minister wasted a year indulging that tendency. One May loyalist describes frustration in cabinet committees when trying to get radical Brexit ministers to focus on detail. Every obstacle is belittled as a symptom of weak faith; every workaround is treated as a trap laid by unrepentant Europhiles seeking to abort the whole thing. No assurance by ex-remainers that they have accepted the referendum is trusted. This leads to a vicious cycle: the only people in government prepared to engage with the question of how Brexit might work are those who didn’t vote for it, which reinforces the zealots’ suspicion that the “softies” are closet saboteurs. David Davis presents a unique frustration. The Brexit secretary sounds supportive of the pragmatists in private, but dares not cross lines drawn by the fantasists in public. Like May, he has a job that demands solutions to hard problems but, like Johnson, his ambition requires concealment from a core Conservative audience of how difficult it all is. That tension partly explains a curious change in Whitehall personnel this week. Olly Robbins had been the top civil servant at the Brexit department under Davis, and also Downing Street’s EU point man, reporting to May. He now relinquishes the former cap to devote himself wholly to representing the prime minister. There are conflicting accounts of why this happened and at whose instigation. Robbins and Davis were not bosom companions but had a functional working relationship. A good explanation is that May feels control over Brexit bleeding away, and needs reassurance that her writ runs along the straightest line through Whitehall and into the Brussels negotiating chamber. She cannot have Robbins serving a second master. This is a small twist in a long tale, but it expresses that bigger tension between practice and theories of Brexit. Reality is coming on hard and fast. May’s true allies in confronting it are the people who warned all along that the impact would hurt. But she has a cabinet packed with people who insist that the collision is avoidable. You can tell them by the Johnsonian way they twist queries about how it is done into rehashed arguments about why it must be done. And she has a party that prefers a game of hunt-the-saboteur to the boring homework of negotiation. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that extricating the UK from EU membership is harder than advertised, but the obstacle to doing it safely is not those who said it shouldn’t be done. That battle was lost last year. The source of sabotage is those Tories who now prefer the idea of Brexit to the real thing. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/new-house-diy-are-you-ready-for-a-fixer-upper","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T13:29:42Z","webTitle":"New house DIY: are you ready for a fixer-upper?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/new-house-diy-are-you-ready-for-a-fixer-upper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/26/new-house-diy-are-you-ready-for-a-fixer-upper","fields":{"headline":"New house DIY: are you ready for a fixer-upper?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As first-time buyers, PR manager Robyn Morrison and her fiance had a choice to make. Should they find a one-bedroom flat they could move straight into but would outgrow quickly, or a bigger house that needed a lot of work? The latter was a daunting project for the DIY novices and, watching water pour through the kitchen ceiling a few months later, Morrison admits wondering if they’d made the right choice. “Living in rented accommodation, we’d never even put up a picture on a wall,” she says. “The closest we’d got [to DIY] was putting together Ikea furniture, and even that was hard work. I went into [the project] slightly with rose-tinted glasses, thinking all [the house] needed was a lick of paint and a new carpet. Actually there was quite a bit more.” Despite criticism that under-35s don’t have basic DIY skills, such as changing a lightbulb, fitting a toilet seat or putting up wallpaper, we’re still a nation of DIY enthusiasts as a whole. According to ONS, alterations and improvements to homes account for 14% of total housing costs on average and, driven by rising property prices and the cost of stamp duty, approximately 63% of homeowners would rather opt to improve their existing home. Michael Holmes, author of Renovating for Profit and property spokesperson for the Northern Homebuilding &amp; Renovation Show, says homebuyers are still willing to take on renovation projects, but “as to whether they’re keen to do the work themselves, I think there’s less DIY happening than a generation ago. I think we massively underestimate our capabilities. Contrary to what people might tell you, there is nothing in your house that you cannot [legally] do on a DIY basis if you are a competent person.” Holmes says buyers should be looking for “the worst house you can find on the best street you can afford” and consult a builder or structural engineer when putting a renovation budget together – although project managing the process yourself (ordering materials, liaising with the relevant trades and generally moving the project along) could save you 15-20% of the total cost. Space, layout and functionality will be highly prized by future buyers, as well as a well-designed kitchen and bathroom if they need replacing. Most importantly, he adds: “Leave money in the budget to make structural repairs, and to make sure [the property] is warm, dry and weather tight.” A home renovation done well can increase a property’s value between 5% and 30%, depending on the overall finish, says Sarah Beeny, TV presenter and founder of estate agent Tepilo. But a botched job can have the opposite effect. “My heart sinks when we get people who put their properties on the market where there’s some clear DIY errors, like trying to cover over cracks with woodchip wallpaper and paint. My advice would be to leave the bigger jobs to professionals. And do everything in the right order – for example, make sure your wiring and plumbing are sound before spending hours decorating.” She remembers her first renovation project with her brother and boyfriend, which cost £5,000. “We literally did everything ourselves … [but] you learn quickly when you have to. Every time something doesn’t quite go according to plan, you make sure it goes more smoothly the next time.” Research and practice are key for any DIY project, Mike Edwards, tradesman and founder of DIY Doctor, says. He started the website 20 years ago after more of his clients asked if they could save money by doing work themselves. The site now gets 1 million visitors a month. He believes there is still an appetite for DIY among homeowners, some of which has been caused by cowboy builders. DIY Doctor surveyed 2,000 of its users two years ago and found 26% would rather do a job themselves because they believed they could do it better than the last guy they employed. Unqualified builders are costing British homeowners an estimated £1.9bn a year, according to the government’s TrustMark scheme. “We run a building company alongside DIY Doctor and I would say 85% of our income comes from jobs we have to go in and put right,” Edwards says. “That’s 50/50 between cowboy builders having worked for them or them having done it themselves. “Anything you’re doing at home, don’t just go and get the tools and start drilling and hammering and banging. We have so many people who want to take the wall out between their kitchen and dining room and then they’re wondering why their bed is in their lounge. It’s not as easy as the pros make it look – they’ve been practising for years.” On finding the right builder, Edwards has written a free desired outcomes contract for homeowners to go through with tradesmen before work starts: “If they’re not genuine, you won’t see them again after page three,” he says. He also advocates getting two or three references for similar jobs (such as other bathrooms if you need a bathroom fitted), asking to inspect past work and talking to clients about what the builder was like to work with. You should always ask to see a public liability insurance certificate and call the broker to check the policy is still valid, he adds. Morrison and her partner spent three years and £20,000 renovating their house in Cheltenham. They did most of the work themselves, including knocking a doorway through a stud wall that a builder had quoted £2,000 to do, pulling up carpets and adding a false ceiling to hide the new wiring and plumbing, and now have a garage full of tools. But they sought professional help for the plastering, kitchen and bathroom fitting, the electrics and plumbing. “Now the house is eventually complete, you forget the months spent among chaos and dust,” she says, when asked if she’d do it again. “But we’ve been able to create the home we’ve always wanted … [and] we’ve learned all sorts of new skills along the way. If I’d known [how big a project it was going to be], I don’t think I would’ve taken it on, but I’m so glad we did.” It’s a sentiment Beeny thinks will encourage more homebuyers to have a go at DIY. “I think the tide is turning again, partly to do with the increasing cost of living, but also because people are starting to want to carry out tasks that give them a great sense of achievement. The truth is, there is nothing more satisfying than creating something with your own hands and standing back and looking at it. Earning all the money in the world and paying someone else to do it will never ever make you feel as good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/the-vampires-meet-lionel-loueke-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T17:45:24Z","webTitle":"The Vampires/Lionel Loueke: The Vampires Meet Lionel Loueke review – seductive, genre-hopping creativity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/the-vampires-meet-lionel-loueke-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/the-vampires-meet-lionel-loueke-review","fields":{"headline":"The Vampires/Lionel Loueke: The Vampires Meet Lionel Loueke review – seductive, genre-hopping creativity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lionel Loueke, the gifted Benin-born guitarist and singer endorsed by Herbie Hancock in the early noughties, hasn’t let American fame hamper his footloose instincts – he’s tweaked genres with little-known Belgian world-jazz saxophonist Nicholas Kummert, and here with the Vampires, a playfully eclectic, decade-old Australian quartet.

At the Environment Agency he was the man people turned to when flood risk management ran into conflict with conservation, and his work there was fundamental in establishing a solid scientific base for future investments in natural flood management. At the RSPB, and later with the Marine Conservation Society, he helped to pioneer the concept of an ecosystem-based approach to inshore fisheries management, and put forward his own practical model for coastal zone management. He promoted a key innovation in the 1995 Environment Act that gave Sea Fisheries Committees bylaw-making powers to control fishing for environmental reasons. He also developed a close working relationship with stakeholders at all levels, from bait-diggers to civil servants and industrialists – even government ministers (for these occasions he took out his earring). Duncan was born in Rochdale to David, a Baptist minister, and Sylvia (nee Clarkson), a teacher. He went to Lymm grammar school and Padgate Technical College, both near Warrington, then on to Leeds University, where he gained a first-class degree in ecology in 1986 and followed up with a PhD based on a thesis about the ecology of the pied flycatcher. Following his PhD he joined the RSPB, working his way through a number of part-time and temporary contracts working on estuary birds. His diligence and capacity for analysis was soon recognised and in 1991 he took a permanent role in the RSPB’s conservation policy department, where I was his manager. There he established himself as someone who could grapple successfully with the detail and complexity of wildlife law and learn the details of any economic sector that was thrown at him. He became a significant intellectual force behind many RSPB campaigns of the 1990s. In 2004 he left the RSPB to join the Environment Agency, where he helped to implement complex European Union environmental directives. He also took on the additional role of flood warning duty officer, learning the skills of flood prediction and analysis and their application in flood warning and emergency response. From 2005 to 2015 he was a trustee on the board of the Marine Conservation Society. Duncan’s zest for life away from work was equally great: motorbikes in bits on the kitchen table, a civil war re-enactment cannon under the stairs, rescue-dog taming and prodigious homemade wine production. In recent years he and his wife, Mandy, whom he had met in Leeds, had acquired a smallholding and this had become their long-term project.

It was a topic that gave me pause for thought during a recent vacation in Italy, while browsing the packed street-corner news kiosks. For a small paper the Weekly may punch above its weight in terms of global coverage, but is it making itself seen as well as heard? From last week’s microplastic global tap water pollution exclusive to the eurozone’s economic resurgence, a subject that features on the cover of our forthcoming edition, you’ll find the depth and scope of the Weekly’s reporting on the major issues every bit as serious and measured as you would expect. But in a crowded news market, it would also be great if the paper could catch the eye of newer readers as well as our loyal ones. It may not be a creative road we opt to go down every week – the fact is, some stories fit this approach much better than others – but I’d love to know what you think in general: do punchier covers on the Weekly delight or distract? Feel free to drop me an email and let me know. Inside the paper, our news coverage briefs you on political trends from Catalonia to Cambodia, uncovers deforestation in Ivory Coast caused by the cocoa industry, and exposes a food-quality scandal in eastern Europe. You’ll find election scene-setters from Germany and New Zealand, including an interview with the Labour leader Jacinda Ardern. And that’s only scratching the surface! I suspect more than a few readers will find this week’s Weekly Review lead to be of interest: a thoughtful and wide-ranging essay by regular columnist George Monbiot on how we need to rewrite the existing dominant political narrative if we truly want a better world. We often receive emails telling us how much you enjoy George’s writing, something he was delighted to hear when he paid a visit to our London offices recently. There’s a look at some of SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk’s futuristic public transport schemes, which could be moving towards fruition in the US. Also on the future theme, Discovery looks at how electrical implants could one day supersede drugs in the world of medicinal treatment. If that’s enough forward thinking for your tastes, the Book reviews will take you back to the start with a reappraisal of the book of Genesis. Culture has an interview with the architect Richard Rogers and a fond tribute to Peter Hall, a true legend of British theatre and founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, who died earlier this month. The Sports pages go slightly off-piste this week, profiling the sometimes euphoric, occasionally calamitous life of a professional sports gambler. (I won’t give too much away but fans of the All Blacks rugby team should look out for one anecdote in particular …) As I reflect upon another Guardian Weekly winging its way towards our print sites in London, Sydney and New Jersey, I think we’ve produced an edition with something for everyone. I hope you agree! Thank you for subscribing and do feel free to email me your thoughts on the Weekly.

Speaking at the UN general assembly in New York, she said the UK would end all engagement with the Burmese military until military action against civilians in Rakhine state had stopped. The prime minister has been under pressure to halt the programme since the country’s army was accused of driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into Bangladesh. “We are very concerned about what’s happening to the Rohingya people in Burma. The military action against them must stop,” May said. “We have seen too many vulnerable people having to flee for their lives. Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese government need to make it very clear that the military action should stop. “The British government is announcing today that we are going to stop all defence engagement and training of the Burmese military by the Ministry of Defence until this issue is resolved.” Asked if the action was coordinated with international allies, May said: “There has been very clear international concern about the issue of the Rohingya people and what is happening to them. “I was discussing this yesterday in Canada with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The British government believes we must show our concern, and that’s why we are going to stop all defence engagement and training of the Burmese military by the Ministry of Defence until this issue is satisfactorily resolved.” Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the top UN official on human rights, said earlier this month that Myanmar’s treatment of its Rohingya minority appeared to be a “textbook example” of ethnic cleansing. The UK programme in Myanmar does not include combat training but is aimed at educating soldiers in democracy, leadership and the English language at a cost of around £305,000 last year. Last week, Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, said the violence against Rohingya Muslims was “obviously unacceptable” but refused to confirm the programme was ending. “Our ambassador has made representations to that effect to the Burmese regime,” he said at the time. Earlier on Tuesday, Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace prize winner who leads Myanmar, broke her silence on the crisis but did not criticise the army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/amadou-and-mariam-la-confusion-review-new-songs","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T17:15:24Z","webTitle":"Amadou and Mariam: La Confusion review – distinctive new songs on patchily good release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/amadou-and-mariam-la-confusion-review-new-songs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/amadou-and-mariam-la-confusion-review-new-songs","fields":{"headline":"Amadou and Mariam: La Confusion review – distinctive new songs on patchily good release","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s 12 years now since Amadou and Mariam suddenly became celebrities, thanks largely to Manu Chao’s production work on the bestselling Dimanche à Bamako.

Now comes their first full set of new songs in five years, dominated by the input of French producer Adrien Durand. La Confusion includes some fine, distinctive work featuring powerful vocals from each of the duo, but they lose their edge thanks to the over-use of keyboards and electronica, with Amadou’s guitar sadly under-employed. The album is patchily impressive, from the driving, funky opening of Diarra, to the bluesy start of Massah Allah, but both ease off into more predictable, bland territory.

Guests, unperturbed by the rain drenching their outfits, are gathered for a regular rap, trap and R&amp;B club night. Inside, there is a welcome lack of posturing and posing; instead, dance-offs and school-disco snogging are scored by Big Sean, Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky and Fetty Wap. Three men in particular – one holding court on the dancefloor with his top off, the other two behind the decks – are orchestrating the mood of the club. Jessy Rose, Tony Konstone and Lilo Blues, otherwise known as Hare Squead, are a local group who are about to go global. Squead are pioneers of a creative boom taking place in Dublin. Their music is a very contemporary fusion of trap, rap, R&amp;B, pop, jazz and electronics; their song Zoo of the New was inspired by a Sylvia Plath poem, while Christian music is a big influence on their chords and harmonies. They have Ed Sheeran’s business savvy, compositional expertise , plus chiselled jaws and puppyish enthusiasm. So much so that, when we meet Rose, he tries to insist we go trampolining rather than do the interview. Before the club, we meet in a slot machine-filled, dimly lit pub in Tallaght, the suburb where Konstone and Blues grew up. Their childhoods weren’t always easy. “I could have easily sold drugs. I won’t even lie,” Konstone says. “That would have been quick money for me, especially where I’m living.” Rose first met his two childhood friends in Temple Bar Square in the centre of the city. He was drawn to them immediately, surprised to see two black kids with skateboards. He thought he was the only one. “There were a couple of black people around me [growing up], but they were different to the way I am because I was into Fall Out Boy and skating. I was comfortable being around white people, but they always saw me as goofy and different. I never really fitted into one group.” Forming in 2014, they put their song If I Ask – a bright, booming Tinie Tempah-like creation – on SoundCloud, and soon there was a lot of interest. They supported Nas and Joey Bada$$ and played with a six-piece band, appearing at a lot of indie festivals to ensure they weren’t restricted to rap events. They eventually signed to Columbia and have since seen their fanbase change from mostly men to “85%” women, perhaps due to 2016’s breakout hit Herside Story, a sugary, soulful love song that turned them into teen heartthrobs. During their tour supporting Dua Lipa last year, Rose would frequently forget that the first row of the audience were now very young girls who weren’t expecting a well-built 20-year-old man to crowdsurf. “I keep forgetting that our crowds aren’t what they used to be,” he says. The band’s burgeoning popularity has been instrumental in nudging the industry gaze towards the Irish capital. Driven by an independent, DIY spirit, artists such as Erica Cody, Simi Crowns, Jafaris, Charlotte Headon and the Neomadic crew, among others, are reconfiguring what it means to make Irish music – a term formerly associated with indie, folk, rock and bodhrán-thrumming ceilidhs. Dublin rapper Rejjie Snow has made a significant dent in the US in the past few years, and recent documentaries Broken Song and Irish Rappers Revealed have explored the northside of Dublin and its mostly white, working-class rap scene. But it’s Hare Squead’s accessible charm that has put Dublin – primarily multicultural Dublin – at the centre of future-facing mainstream music. Fachtna O Ceallaigh, Sinéad O’Connor’s former manager who now looks after Hare Squead, believes this new generation of musicians are a sign of Ireland’s evolving society. Not long ago, it was insular, “agricultural, rural and contentedly Catholic” – now it’s a bustling, “outward-looking” place. “I think that is what we’re beginning to experience here now, as manifested by Hare Squead, is music that mixes hip-hop and R&amp;B, an African feel and diverse influences like Nirvana, Panic at the Disco and Feist,” he says. “The end result is the beginnings of a style that’s not overly American and not dominated by whatever is current, but is beginning to forge an identity of its own.” Konstone, whose parents moved from Egypt to Dublin when he was two, also recognises the ways in which the merging communities of Dublin have impacted on the music. “We were the first generation of black kids going to school,” he explains. “It was different for the white kids and it was different for us as well – we hadn’t seen that many white kids before! It was a weird thing but we were growing into it, and as the years went on, cultures evolved and mixed together. You get creative. And people are vibing off each other’s [cultures]. It’s like Toronto in a sense in that people are friendly and accepting.” A key launchpad for this new creative energy – in addition to publications such as District magazine and the blog Nialler9 – is Diffusion Lab, a “collaborative hub” that functions as a label and studio, and enlists writers, musicians and in-house producers. Jafaris is one of its core acts: his song If You Love Me is a cavernous blast of emotion that Beyoncé might fall for. He was born in Zimbabwe but, like Blue and Konstone, now lives in Tallaght, a place he describes as “a mixture of the hood and the suburbs. I was kind of exposed to a lot of robbing, a lot of shooting, but I stayed away from all of that.” He says that, while indie acts have historically been dominant in most live venues, the climate is changing and nights are being overtaken by hip-hop. “There’s a lot of promoters shining light on underground artists; there’s this Straight Outta Dublin event that happens every month. It’s a movement.” Unlike fellow Irish exports who wear their heritage overtly – from the politically charged songs of U2, Boomtown Rats, Sinéad O’Connor or the region-specific rhymes of northside rappers such as Costello and Lethal Dialect – this new wave of artists are outward-looking and global-sounding. Comments on Hare Squead’s YouTube videos often raise the absence of their Irish accents in their vocals. This is something experimental pop songwriter Soulé, one of Diffusion Lab’s other excellent offerings, thinks is a narrow-minded criticism. “A lot of us, for example myself and Hare Squead, we are Irish to the core,” she says. “We went to an Irish school, but a lot of us are growing up in multicultural homes, with different accents in the home. Sometimes our parents will have an English-French accent, or an English-American accent because we watch American TV. I am an Irish singer-songwriter. Hare Squead are an Irish rap band. I don’t know what else we can say for people to accept that, even if we don’t use Irish slang in our songs.” It probably doesn’t help that often the Irish figures at the forefront of the mainstream media are still pub-dwelling, wisecracking cartoon figures, from Mrs Brown’s Boys to Sheeran’s Galway Girl. “I love Ed Sheeran’s music and I love the ideas and stuff, but it’s just painting a stereotype of Ireland. I don’t know any girls who play a fiddle in an Irish band. There probably are some, but I haven’t met one,” Blue says. “I’ll take you to Grafton Street – you won’t see one girl playing the fiddle,” adds Rose. “There’s not a Grafton Street in Galway! I don’t think that song helped,” Blue says. He leans in close to the voice recorder: “But I love your music, Ed, please don’t hate me.” Hopefully, such one-dimensional caricatures will soon be a thing of the past. There’s a change taking place that is writing a new chapter in Dublin’s musical history. Hare Squead are keen to explore the US – Rose says they want to be “bigger than the Beatles” and they are itching to take up offers from producers in LA – but they will leave behind a thriving scene and city. “People need to come to Dublin and see it’s multicultural and a melting pot of different nationalities,” says Soulé. “They need to educate themselves and come and have some fun with us. We love a good time.” If the raging crowds at 1am on Monday night at Hangar are anything to go by – extravagantly body-popping in a febrile, friendly riot – it’s impossible to disagree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/19/basquiat-review-boom-for-real-barbican-art-gallery-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T16:26:15Z","webTitle":"Basquiat review – the hungry chronicler of broken America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/19/basquiat-review-boom-for-real-barbican-art-gallery-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/19/basquiat-review-boom-for-real-barbican-art-gallery-london","fields":{"headline":"Basquiat review – the hungry chronicler of broken America","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the brilliantly promising artist whose paintings delight and dazzle the eye and mind in this retrospective were still alive, he’d be celebrating his 57th birthday come December. What kind of middle-aged artist might Jean-Michel Basquiat make? It’s hard to imagine him getting any older than 27, the age when drugs took his life. It is like trying to picture a Van Gogh who never shot himself, a Keats who recovered from tuberculosis and lived to be poet laureate. The young face of Basquiat looms large in this exhibition, in giant photographs and videos. He sits with Andy Warhol, who has his arm around his protege, in a clip from Warhol’s TV show. They talk about New York clubs, but what if the picture were reversed? Instead of an old Warhol embracing a young Basquiat, I’d like to see old man Basquiat dispensing advice to the young. More to the point, I think it might be good advice. For the Basquiat this exhibition reveals is so much greater than his myth – and had the potential to be greater still. All the exhilaration of his life and times can be savoured in a perfectly judged account of his rise, from spraypainting jokes and gnomic remarks in the streets of New York under the pseudonym SAMO© (Same Old Shit) with his collaborator Al Diaz, to dancing at the Mudd Club and being photographed by Warhol. Yet even as I enjoyed this vicarious trip to new wave Manhattan (the show starts with a wonderfully of-its-time 1980 group show called New York/ New Wave) I was starting to get upset as well as awed. Basquiat was just 17 when he made a splash as a graffiti artist. A year later, he was the talk of downtown. Did he have a chance? Did all those punk luminaries ever think to stop him taking drugs? On the contrary, taking drugs fitted the myth of a “raw” street genius. Untutored – he never went to art school – and naturally gifted, Basquiat was celebrated as some kind of spontaneous wild child. Even today, this curious and – to put it bluntly – racist filter distorts the way his art is seen. The label for his 1982 painting Jawbone of an Ass, in which he lists historical figures including Hannibal, Machiavelli, Savonarola, Sappho and Rameses II, feels the need to connect it with Thomas Harris’s character Hannibal Lecter, as if Basquiat can only be understood in terms of pop culture. Yet he mentions Hamilcar and Scipio as well as Hannibal, not to mention “the second and third Punic wars” in which these people played their parts. This is not a painting about pop culture. It is a vision of world history as a ceaseless round of wars. Cartoon monsters with savage teeth express the violence of the painting’s Biblical title. In the bottom right, a black boxer bashes a white opponent. The Punic wars were the last moment in ancient history that Africa challenged Europe for global power: the defeat of the Carthaginian general Hannibal by ancient Rome and Rome’s final obliteration of Carthage itself are moments full of symbolism in Basquiat’s painted history. Where does it all lead? At the bottom of his erudite painting we see a short history of America, including the fatal word: “Slaves.” When Cy Twombly scrawled stuff like this in his abstract expressionist graffiti paintings, everyone accepted it as a serious comment on history. Basquiat and Twombly should be shown together, for Basquiat is a great modern history painter as well. His collisions of word and image, eloquence and cartoon fun, capture the broken and tragic arc of American history. Like the novelists Thomas Pynchon and William Burroughs, he turns to collage to convey the epic chaos of history. One, created when he was just 19, satirises political cover-ups. Its establishment mouthpieces, spattered with blood-red paint, declare: “We have decided the bullet must have been going very fast.” Basquiat digs not only into America’s bloody history but the gory roots of art itself. His painting Leonardo da Vinci’s Greatest Hits is a hilarious graffiti version of a page from Leonardo’s notebook. But it’s more than a joke. The drawings of muscles and legs are cleverly observed. Basquiat pored over his volume of Leonardo’s works – it is in the exhibition – and his art is full of just such anatomical sketches. That obsession with anatomy is at its most unforgettable in his grinning and chomping visions of human skulls. They are the skulls of the dead generations under the sidewalks of America. Basquiat comes through as a very young man who wants to learn more, an artist with a huge imagination and curiosity. He is the artist America needs now. His vision of history’s mad drumbeat feels urgent. Had he lived, what would he see in Trump’s America? SAMO©. • Basquiat: Boom for Real is at Barbican Art Gallery, London, from 21 September to 28 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2017/sep/19/suburbia-slippers-tea-towel-london-fashion-week-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T17:07:56Z","webTitle":"Fluffy slippers and fancy Marigolds: how suburban style stole London fashion week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/19/suburbia-slippers-tea-towel-london-fashion-week-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/sep/19/suburbia-slippers-tea-towel-london-fashion-week-2017","fields":{"headline":"Fluffy slippers and fancy Marigolds: how suburban style stole London fashion week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A few snapshots from this London fashion week. Christopher Kane backstage after his show talking about the smell of bleach in his house that accompanies having a new French bulldog puppy, and the frills of the Royal Doulton figurines that his mum used to polish obsessively when he was growing up in Glasgow. Cindy Crawford’s model children, Kaia and Presley Gerber, catwalking at Burberry in check caps past a photography exhibit that included Martin Parr’s 1981 shot of Dubliners hunched under flimsy umbrellas as they battle rush-hour rain. (As an image of fashion in the rain, that shot is about as far from the romantic iconography of the raindrop-dappled, collar-popped Burberry trench as it is possible to imagine.) Plasticky bucket hats at Donatella Versace’s Versus show. The deadpan tones of Neil Tennant singing Pet Shop Boys’ West End Girls, a song that emerged as the unexpected theme tune for the season when it opened both the Burberry and Topshop shows. A skirt and a top made from rough linen tea towels at JW Anderson, frilly cushion-handbags at Mother of Pearl, a silver clutch bag moulded from the shape of a polystyrene kebab box at Anya Hindmarch. Designer Richard Malone cheerfully naming the bright colour palette of his dresses as a homage to supermarket carrier bags: Tesco blue, Co-op turquoise. This is street style, but not as fashion usually knows it. This is not the peacocking Insta-bait that has become the default uniform of London fashion week, all thousand-pound tracksuits and limited-edition bumbags. This is street as in ground-level, not street in the sense of being the coolest kids on the block. Actual real life, not a performative version of it. And this is different. Because from its beginnings as a breath-of-fresh-air backlash against the stuffiness of the catwalk, the street-style arm of fashion has over the past few years calcified into a bloodless beauty contest driven by cold, hard cash. One survey released on the eve of fashion week estimated that micro-influencers – those with about 10,000 social media followers – can command a fee of £3,000 a post, with many of these posts clustered around the venues and hashtags of fashion week. Fashion is bored with the pretentious modern incarnation of street style. But there is no appetite for a return to the snotty, unreconstructed public face of fashion that went before – identikit front-rowers inscrutable behind sunglasses. Instead, this fashion week reached for something less polished, and more human. Both Christopher Bailey and Donatella Versace, two of the grandest designers on the London schedule this week, talked about having models try on the collection at fittings and being interested in their views on how to put the pieces together. At Topshop, the inspirations were the gritty, radiators-and-all aesthetic of Corinne Day and “the days before Instagram; the fun behind closed doors and neon lights”. Anya Hindmarch built a 3D model of a house for models in housecoats and fluffy slippers – also seen in Muppet brights at Hannah Weiland’s Shrimps – to parade proudly around. After the show, she talked about “the joy in the repetitive beauty of suburbia, the idea that inside these cookie-cutter houses are the most beautiful individual dreams.” Christopher Kane called his muse for the season “a new kind of domestic goddess”. Kane has always loved the kitsch kick of the banal – lace dresses mimicked piped royal icing, this time around – but also celebrates, in every collection, romance and sex appeal as part of real-life experience rather than as fairytale. Pheromones pack just as much punch in the kebab shop and the minicab office as they do in any VIP room. Everyone knows that; this season, fashion is just telling it like it is. Even the icons of this season are faces recognisable from the TV in your aunt’s house, rather than in-the-know obscure references you have to posily pretend to be obsessed with. Princess Diana is still major (see Ryan Lo’s pussy-bow blouses), as is the Queen – the young version, as played by Claire Foy in The Crown season one – who was a muse to an Erdem show that got everyone even more excited about his forthcoming H&amp;M collaboration. At Christopher Kane, the Queen’s long gloves came in slick patent: half Her Majesty, half Marigold. The question now is what this real-talk means for our real-life wardrobes. Most hearteningly, it heralds a return to practicality. I can’t remember a fashion week when so many outfits – even party dresses – were styled for the catwalk with a sensible waterproof top layer. Transparent raincoats and practical outerwear, including baseball caps and bucket hats, were on almost every catwalk from Topshop and Burberry to Mary Katrantzou and Emporio Armani. Cardigans – totem of the popping-to-the-shops iconography of British dress – will continue to be a fashion statement next season. (At Erdem, they were worn looped around the shoulders in the manner of a silk scarf.) Molly Goddard, who said her muse for the season was off “to an art gallery, and then for a steak”, put Wellington-flat boots with her party dresses. Pastels are on the way back. There are two very different eras in play, but both come in mint and lemon and pink. There is a 1950s feather-duster femininity with a nod to the young Queen; but there is also a new soft spot for the unsophisticated late-1990s, early-2000s (Liam Gallagher in a Burberry check shirt, Paris Hilton in glittery mules). The former is likely to be big on the more grownup high street, the second will have the cult following. Both eras are big on pastels. After the urbane, self-conscious chic of top-to-toe greige, these have a cheery kind of charm. In fashion, however, being down-to-earth only stretches so far. The new suburban street style is sexier than fashion has been for several seasons, and bra tops are absolutely everywhere for next season. In other words, the vibe is real-life but with Hadid-level abs. The new skirt suit – a skirt with a matching bra top – came in rustic linen with a matching midi skirt at JW Anderson, or perky and miniskirted at Topshop. Slightly easier to wear is the leotard-tight top tucked into a long pencil skirt. Lingerie-influences – lace-edged camisoles and nightie-flimsy cocktail dresses – were everywhere, but best at Preen, where they came in chic chalky and creamy versions of this season’s pastels. I’m saving for one of those, already. And one of the fluid, easy dresses in coral or fuschia smocked silk at Roksanda – if I can afford it. “I feel like we live in a time overexposed to imagery of perfection,” designer Roksanda Ilincic said after the show. “I wanted to come back to real life, to clothes that look a little handmade, to a woman dressing to please herself. So I tried to navigate towards something more basic – but to make it beautiful, of course, so with incredible fabrics. So unfortunately, it’s not going to be cheap.” That’s fashion for you: still a fantasy, even when it gets real."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/25/hospitals-in-crisis-in-uganda-as-middle-eastern-countries-poach-medical-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T13:26:35Z","webTitle":"Hospitals in crisis in Uganda as Middle Eastern countries poach medical staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/25/hospitals-in-crisis-in-uganda-as-middle-eastern-countries-poach-medical-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/25/hospitals-in-crisis-in-uganda-as-middle-eastern-countries-poach-medical-staff","fields":{"headline":"Hospitals in crisis in Uganda as Middle Eastern countries poach medical staff","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The failure to stop a brain drain of almost 2,000 of its best doctors and nurses is exacerbating Uganda’s healthcare crisis, reflecting a growing problem across east Africa, say healthcare workers. At least 1,963 medics are being recruited to work at one hospital alone in Libya, as Middle Eastern countries turn to the region for highly qualified workers to fill their own vacancies, which have increased amid political instability and migration. Nurses, laboratory technicians and doctors in different fields are being recruited from public health facilities, private hospitals and the not-for-profit sector, with no clear government plan to mitigate the impact on the domestic health sector, medical workers say. “This one [Libyan] deal, if executed, will worsen the shortage of health workers, undermining service delivery and the investment by donors to the health sector,” said a statement from the Uganda Civil Society HIV Prevention Advocacy Coalition. The coalition, a group of workers and patients, wants a temporary halt to recruitment, to allow urgent discussions at government level. “This deal will make the health crisis worse in Uganda – actively facilitating export of critical cadres of health workers will accelerate suffering and death,” said Asia Russell, executive director of the Health Global Access Project (Health Gap). “The government is refusing to increase production, retention and motivation of health workers in order to save lives.”Dona Anyona, of the health system advocacy partnership at Amref Health Africa, said: “It’s not the right move, given the understaffing and its resultant impact on healthcare service provision. “Besides, it’s not a good return on investment, given the fact that training a health worker is a costly venture and most health workers are educated using public funds – and at the end of the day the citizens who meet the costs of this education do not benefit from their services.” Uganda continues to face a severe shortage of critical health workers, according to the health ministry. The national health system performs poorly and staff encounter challenges with accommodation and transport, not to mention months without pay. On top of that, health facilities lack adequate medicines and proper equipment. Just 69% of health posts are filled (pdf) according to figures for 2015. In 2013, the doctor-to-patient ratio was estimated at 1:24,725, with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:11,000. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one physician per 1,000 people. Although the Institute of Public Policy Research Uganda, a thinktank, sued the government in 2014 to stop the loss of 263 health workers to Trinidad and Tobago, that court case is still pending, and some 3,000 medics left the country between March and June this year alone, according to estimates from activists. The brain drain of health workers from east Africa is caused by local private recruitment agencies that broker deals mainly with Arab countries – arrangements it is difficult to prevent. “As a government, we can’t stop health workers from going to work abroad if they want to. Since we have free movement of labour in Uganda, there is no reason as to why we can stop them from going,” said health minister Sarah Achieng Opendi. “We also can’t absorb all [these workers] in our health government system because of the wage bill and [limits on staff levels]. We tried to put a system to bond health worker students who complete studies on government sponsorship. But it doesn’t work – they took us to court. The case is still pending.” Every year, at least 320 medical students graduate from Ugandan universities, more than in any east African nation. But public hospitals are very short staffed. “Uganda’s health worker crisis is caused by multiple factors. The government refuses to provide adequate pay, health workers are not deployed to the areas where they are most needed, and many lack the tools and support to do their jobs effectively,” said Russell. The medical brain drain is not restricted to Uganda – but common across sub-Saharan Africa. A 2011 study found, for example, that 77% of physicians who had trained in Liberia were working in the US. Meanwhile, HIV activists have criticised the labour ministry for allowing recruitment agencies to insist that applicants undergo an HIV test, which is against Ugandan law on the workplace. “Mandatory HIV testing deprives someone of their rights to privacy and dignity, and also those taken through the test and found HIV positive are denied the opportunity to work. Despite the fact that they meet the qualifications, their right to equal opportunity is denied,” said Dorah Kiconco, of the Uganda Network on Law, Ethics and HIV–Aids. “This is wrong on all fronts. HIV does not make someone incapable of doing what they can do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/24/virtual-reality-is-no-match-for-the-empathetic-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"VR is no match for the empathetic generation | Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/24/virtual-reality-is-no-match-for-the-empathetic-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/24/virtual-reality-is-no-match-for-the-empathetic-generation","fields":{"headline":"Virtual reality is no match for the empathetic generation","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This weekend an art show in support of End Violence Against Women (EVAW), a charity dedicated to doing what it says on the tin, is providing a virtual reality (VR) experience: stepping into the shoes of women experiencing sexism and street harassment. The idea is to “give men and women a visceral understanding of what it is really like to be attacked in the street or on public transport just because you are a woman”. Having only used VR once, but being suitably psyched by the intensity that I was left squealing like a child, I’m imagining it’s going to be pretty powerful. But the really interesting thing about EVAW’s VR, in my opinion, is that it feels emblematic of the millennial generation. I wholeheartedly refute the “special snowflake” label – daubed on us by miserable, greying baby boomers and sometimes, ironically, the alt-right. But I do believe certain sections of our generation, myself included, are hyperempathetic. We want everyone to acknowledge other people’s different struggles and work on ways to make their lives easier. And in some ways, I do wonder if VR of this kind is almost unnecessary for some of my peers, given how empathetic they are already? The hyperempathetic description was reiterated after reading a New York Times profile a few weeks ago, when journalist Jazmine Hughes interviewed the new editor of revamped, now-“woke” Teen Vogue, Elaine Welteroth – with the standfirst “reinventing the glossy magazine for a hyperempathetic generation”. In the piece, Welteroth commented that at the time she took on her role, “there was something shifting in the zeitgeist”, something that meant that topics such as feminism, intersectionality and trans issues needed to be covered with sensitivity. In other words, hyperempathy was becoming mainstream. What we’ve realised is that it’s not hard to minimise the hurt and damage you cause to other people by framing your language – attempting to learn how to pronounce and spell people’s names (looking at you, British Museum, who revealed on Twitter that it thinks Asian names are too “confusing” to read in full) and educating yourself on different pronouns. I’ve made mistakes, sure, but the point is to try. Because, as part of an ethnic minority which constantly puts up with “microaggressions” I know that a bit of effort could make someone else’s life so much easier. This goes beyond the individual; minority groups as a whole can benefit if empathy leads to education. But recognising that my generation of hyperempathetics will keep using VR, I have been imagining what it could be used for in the future. There was that video flying around the internet for a while with men trying out a device which mimicked what it feels like to give birth. Electrodes on their stomach simulated contractions. Women who have given birth cackled as the video showed pretty much every man who tried it begging for it to be removed after a few minutes. With VR you could take that to a whole new level. Pop on the device, then your headset and you could experience, like, seeing the baby come out of you! Maybe my peers and I will become hooked on empathy experiences. Like manic little empathy bunnies, we’ll gorge on slipping into other people’s worlds. It could become problematic – as it does in Jordan Peele’s film Get Out (spoiler alert), in which black people are auctioned off by a sadistic white family who then implant old white people’s minds into their bodies. The thing is, I can learn a lot from just speaking to another person, but I don’t always need to be looking at the world as they see it. So although a terrified part of me believes that in the future we’ll all just be sitting, Black Mirror style, drooling and hooked up to VRs – experiencing all of our emotions through a screen to gain the empathy that we crave – another part of me thinks that it could never happen; that only the wildest computer nerds will get so fully embroiled into other worlds in such a way. We don’t need VR to care about each other’s feelings – we just need to empathise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/21/india-v-australia-second-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T16:18:21Z","webTitle":"India beat Australia by 50 runs in second ODI – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/21/india-v-australia-second-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/21/india-v-australia-second-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"India beat Australia by 50 runs in second ODI – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Match report: Not a bad game of cricket, this. It won’t necessarily look like it with a raw scoreline of 252 to 202. But this was another reminder that there is something to be said about ODI cricket where bat and ball are more evenly balanced. Firstly, for the defeated Australians, Stoinis was impressive with an unbeaten 62. The big man has skills. Smith had it all going on as well for 59, before holing out in his 100th ODI. But it was his wicket, reducing Australia to 135-5, that brought Kuldeep into the game. The left-arm wrist spinner caught fire in the 33rd over, claiming a joyous hat-trick of Wade then Agar then Cummins. The final of those was one the best hat-trick balls I’ve ever seen, a picture-perfect wrong’un to win the edge, Dhoni doing the rest. This isn’t to overlook the work of Bhuvneshwar earlier. He was outstanding hooping the ball both ways; through Cartwright’s gate then knicking off Warner. Swing bowling of the highest standard. Australia had no answer until his initial bust was done. In the middle, it was Chahal - the second of India’s wrist-spinners - who did his bit, deceiving Maxwell and Head in quick succession, just at the time both men looked relatively set. All told, Australia’s last seven wickets fell for 96. It may be white ball cricket, but they have a real knack of collapsing in this part of the world. They are now one loss away from losing the series in straight sets, with more questions than answers for the world champs. They have lost ten of their last 11 ODIs, would you believe. Righto, that’ll do from me. On behalf of Sam Perry and myself, thanks for your company. We’ll do it all again on Sunday. Bye for now. Yep, that’s plum. Had to review, but crashing into leg stump. Only took Bhuvi one ball back into the attack to finish it off. Fine and powerful resistance from Stoinis, but ultimately had to be up the business end when the Indian talisman returned. He was too good for the number 11. India the winners. Some broader thoughts in a tic. IS IT OVER? IS RICHARDSON LBW? Bhuvi has won the decision from the umpire. Going upstairs to find out. 43rd over: Australia 202-9 (Stoinis 62, Richardson 0) Oh that’s so good from Stoinis! Brings up the 200 with the most gorgeous six over the square leg rope. So, three times in three overs he’s been happy to clear the rope when the time is right before chilling out. He’s on strike for the final ball. Needs to turn it over... but can’t. So, only the six from the over. Richarfson to face. 51 from 43 balls required. 42nd over: Australia 196-9 (Stoinis 56, Richardson 0) Same model as the previous over: takes a look then wallops a six! Brings up his half-century with the long, straight blow over Hardik’s head. 58 balls to get there. He’s done plenty tonight to suggest he really he a must-select in this Australian best ODI XI for the time being. Extraordinary to think he was left out of the Champions Trophy side the more you think about it. Anyway. A single to point get their seventh of the over. Richardson finds one too, but declines it. Happens again with a lovely stweet to third man. Poor Richo. So, two runs knocked back in order to get Stoinis another go next over. On balance, fair enough. 57 off 48 needed. Surely not. 41st over: Australia 189-9 (Stoinis 49, Richardson 0) Stonis waiting for his ball, not swinging from the outset. Does whack the third for six straight over Chahal’s head. Nice and clean. Lapping, he takes a single from the fourth ball. Boooooo! To 49 he moves. Richardson survives, a huge wrong’un to end it was so close to leg stump that the umpire didn’t signal a wide. Stoinis does keep the strike then, for what that is worth, after getting the seven he needed from the over. In theory, that’s fine. Right? 40th over: Australia 182-9 (Stoinis 42, Richardson 0) Richardson has two balls to see off to give Stonis another go. Both are close run things, the first a drive landing a metre infront of the catcher at extra cover. The second, a conventional outside edge landing a foot infront of slip. Marcus, it’s all you now. No singles. Go LARGE. Hardik Pandya a second wicket through the short ball. This the quicker variety, tempting NCN to pull across the line. But doesn’t go far, straight in the air. The bowler strolls around and does the rest. Great comeback from him after a ropey first spell. In doing so, he’s taken India to within a wicket of a two-nil series lead. 39th over: Australia 181-8 (Stoinis 41, Coulter-Nile 8) Stonis wasn’t out, but perhaps the close call prompted him to realise that he’s going to have to do a lot of this in boundaries. One comes straight away, with a hockey-style sweep, hit really well. Chahal misses down legside next. Seven from that. Seven an over to win now, too. 72 from 66. Bhuvi? NOT OUT. Lucky though. The bat did bobble a bit on the slide. HAS KOHLI RAN STONIS OUT? We will find out. 38th over: Australia 174-8 (Stoinis 37, Coulter-Nile 7) Hardik for a third spell. Really good over, two from it. Using his changes of pace well, the short ball too. 37th over: Australia 172-8 (Stoinis 36, Coulter-Nile 6) Okay, that rally I was talking about? A nice little lap from Stonis to the rope. Four. Next ball: a ripping drive through extra cover. Much like the shot he played before all the mayhem a quarter hour ago. A wide in there too, helping the cause. Ten from the over by the time it is done, leaving Australia 81 in 78 balls. I say it again: Stonis does have form. Remember this from January. Also, who knew about this? Found when youtubing the other clip. Must be how he got into the national squad from nowhere later that winter, on reflection. 36th over: Australia 162-8 (Stoinis 27, Coulter-Nile 6) Bumrah back for a bit of extra pace. Why not Bhuvi to hit some stumps? The pair score off four of the six balls. In my book, that constitutes a bit of a rally. Even if one of those, a Stonis hoick, nearly ends up in the lap of deep midwicket. Memo to Marc: don’t take on Jadeja in the deep. Anyone but him. Raymond Reardon returning to a favourite topic from the Australia v Bangladesh OBO: Larry Agar. This is his batting hat, Ray believes. I still haven’t seen the show. I still prefer talking about “Paris” Hilton “Bec” Cartwright. 35th over: Australia 157-8 (Stoinis 23, Coulter-Nile 5) If I say that Coulter-Nile can hold a bat does he fall next? Does it work that way if I call it beforehand? Do I have tickets to see Ink tonight and it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if this match finished vaguely on time rather than running the distance given the rain/heat delays of the first innings? Questions, questions. A big edge from NCN goes over the clips. Lucky he made contact when swinging, as I reckon that was going into his stumps otherwise. Stonis down the ground to the penultimate delivery, so he’ll get another go next over. Load up, Marcus. Do it the fun way. 34th over: Australia 152-8 (Stoinis 22, Coulter-Nile 2) Four singles to the sweepers off Chahal, who now takes a back seat to his wrist-spin twin. They all count, of course. But might require Stonis to pull off something like what he did in Auckland in January. Vinnie Schumacher on twitter chipping me for earlier saying Agar and Cummins are serious batsmen. Well, Cummins was done by a beauty, the perfect hat-trick ball. Agar just missed a straight one. Either way, golden ducks for both. Glad you enjoyed my standard mozz. It’s the reason Mitch Marsh’s batting average is about 20 below what it should be. 33rd over: Australia 148-8 (Stoinis 20, Coulter-Nile 0) From 148-5 coming off an over of nine where they again took the upper hand and looked in decent enough shape, to 148-8 and all but game over. A triple-wicket maiden. You don’t see that every day. What an over by Kuldeep. A hat-trick at Eden Gardens. The game ground Harbhajan did the same against Australia in March 2001. All watched from the non-strikers’ end by Stonis. Not his fault, but all up to him now. What bowling! The wrong’un perfectly pitched, spins hard across Cummins, collects the edge and taken expertly by Dhoni. What a moment in this young man’s career! He’s spun his country to the cusp of victory as well. Brilliant delivery! First ball! Kuldeep throws it right up and Agar misses trying to whip into the onside. No review despite having it available. In the space of two balls, this is all of a sudden India’s to lose. Fantastic from Kuldeep. On a hat-trick! Oh dear, that’s ugly. Wade deep in the crease, chopping back onto his stumps. He’s fought back into this tour so well with the gloves, but can’t buy a run. His international career hanging by the proverbial thread. Not that there is a bad time to get one, but the perfect moment for India to strike again following a good Australian over. 32nd over: Australia 148-5 (Stoinis 20, Wade 2) Not for nothing that Agar and Cummins the next two in. Both are serious batsmen. Stonis takes a single from this new Hardik over to begin, out to cover. Wade does likewise, off the mark to third man. Need exactly a run a ball from here. Hardik hitting the bat hard, high on the edge of Stonis for one to third man as well. Singles off four consecutive balls now. Much better batting. A wide in there too now. This is the pressure they want back on India with 109 runs left to collect. Punch it into double digits before long, a couple of big overs and they’re flying. Oh, this is one of those big overs now: Stoinis smashing a slower bouncer through midwicket along the ground to the rope. Nine from it. Good one. 31st over: Australia 139-5 (Stoinis 14, Wade 0) “In the 350 era we are getting a really good 250 game,” says Harsha Bhogle on the telly, and he’s right. “My batting versus your batting can be a bit one dimensional.” Michael Clarke also on the telly reflecting on Wade, the new man, and his two “tough hundreds” as a Test player. True. They were in 2012 and 2013 respectively though. He’s not been that player for some time. Did make a maiden ODI ton in January, mind. Only run here is Stonis down the ground. 1-for-18 over the last five overs. India right back on top as they grab a drink. Smith knows what he’s done, his head thrown back as soon as he mishits a pull shot from a Hardik short ball. Top edge out to midwicket, taken by Jadeja (sub fielding) and that’s the captain done for the night. From what looked to be a chase in relative control about 45 minutes ago, now they need to find the better part of half these runs from the lower order with the captain watching on. Game on. Excellent bouncer too, on reflection. Took the pace off it nicely. 30th over: Australia 138-5 (Stoinis 13, Wade 0) 29th over: Australia 133-4 (Smith 55, Stoinis 12) Chahal, the ever-reliable, back. And sure enough, conceding just the one. Stonis doesn’t look anywhere near as comfortable here. The only single from an edge. Seven overs he’s through now, the leggie, sporting the very handy figures of 2-for-16. 28th over: Australia 132-4 (Smith 55, Stoinis 11) Oh yes, just like that big Marc. Couple of singles exchanged off Kuldeep, but forget about those, it is the cover drive I need to tell you about. It is full outside the off-stump, but Stoinis has to beat a ring better stacked than the Labor Party branches in my part of Melbourne. Finds a way through with a lavish stroke. Away. Meanwhile, some information relevant to the Ashes from Lord’s. 27th over: Australia 125-4 (Smith 54, Stoinis 5) Not sure who the commentator on the TV is, but just said that Smith moves around a lot at the crease due to “something in his pants.” Sure. Couldn’t not reproduce that here. Smith cops a good one first up from Hardik, and a bit of variable bounce to contend with as well. Five dots mark a pretty slow period in this chase. But Smith doesn’t miss out when he gets one sprayed down leg, tickling with ease to the fine leg rope. 26th over: Australia 121-4 (Smith 50, Stoinis 5) Smith moves to 50 with a push down the ground. Looked the goods from the moment he walked out in his 100th ODI. Plenty of tough moments early on with Bhuvi doing as he pleased with the new ball, but the captain persevered then prospered. Job far from done, mind. Only that single from this over. 25th over: Australia 120-4 (Smith 49, Stoinis 5) Stonis’ turn to play himself in. Hardik the right man to allow for that, defending and leaving, before clipping a straight one to midwicket for four. Just under 5.5 an over needed, so he can take his time to feel his way through here. No rush at all. 24th over: Australia 116-4 (Smith 49, Stoinis 1) Smith does exactly what is required after the wicket, ticking the board over early in the Kuldeep over before stroking a delightful cover drive through the gap to the boundary. Another couple next ball required a big dive, but he makes his ground, transferring a bit more pressure onto the hosts. “These two spinners must surely be closing doors on Ravi Ashwin whose Test prowess has never really translated to wicket-taking ability in limited-overs cricket,” Devashish Fuloria emails in. “Ironic, because he came via good showing in the IPL.” To look at it another way: what depth! Maxwell’s face says it all! Down the legside, it clips the pad on the way through, but he’s miles out of his ground when Dhoni does the rest. Set up expertly. Already beaten outside the off-stump, then kept honest with a couple of straighter deliveries. It’s the one that doesn’t spin doing the eventual damage as well, Maxwell playing for turn that never came when well down the wicket. Looked to see him coming. Big moment. Chahal just brilliant. The crowd love it too, due to Dhoni’s involvement. He’s treated like a God at every ground he visits. Stonis beaten first ball too! Only had one to negotiate, straight past that outside edge. Wicket maiden. Has 2-for-15 from six so far, Chahal. Looking every bit a matchwinner, just as he was in Chennai. 23nd over: Australia 106-4 (Smith 40, Stoinis 0) 22nd over: Australia 105-3 (Smith 40, Maxwell 14) Bumrah back for a second go, getting through four with the new ball earlier. Two of those were class; two poor. It’s enough to see him go through Maxwell second ball! Oh that was so close to off-stump. And then thump into the right-handers’s thigh pad. Surely Kohli vaguely familiar with his record against wrist-spin (see previous over) and the ease he did it with against these two on Sunday. When Bumrah gets a go at Smith he maintains a tight line and throws a slower one in there. Only one from it. That’ll do. 21st over: Australia 105-3 (Smith 40, Maxwell 13) Real good from Chahal. Couldn’t care less that his teammate is going the distance up the other end, keeps throwing it up. Nearly strangles Smith off the glove down the legside to begin, but misses everything (and the umpire’s attention for a wide). Three singles all they get. 20th over: Australia 102-3 (Smith 39, Maxwell 12) BIG SHOW! Third ball he has faced, not yet off the mark. Kuldeep has it turning square. No worries! SIX, SIX! Both over midwicket/square leg with the back leg down. Remember when it was a real novelty for a sweep to go the whole way? What a guy. Kuldeep fights back with a couple of googlies. 100 up, just like that. 19th over: Australia 89-3 (Smith 38, Maxwell 0) Chahal throwing it waaaay up at Smith. It’s beautiful legspin bowling. The captain then has to contend with a quicker one, but he’s well forward. Lots going on here. His wrists flicked to get one out to midwicket in order to retain the strike. But that’s the only run from it. Looking forward to having a listen to this. With Anth Condon, who is a ripper. 18th over: Australia 88-3 (Smith 37, Maxwell 0) Righto, Big Show. Your turn. Not yet though, Smith to face. Oh and nearly gone to! Big inside edge saves him. Kuldeep generating massive turn here to Smith from over the wicket. Huge fan of this tandem wrist-spinner thing. Can’t recall a time in ODI cricket where it has been a regular (or even one-off?) occurance. Warne and Bevo, sure. But two specialists? Caught at midwicket! Catching practice after misjudging what looks to be an attempted topspinner. Completely against the flow of play. Chahal has got his side right back in this with something altogether unremarkable. Should clarify: it didn’t pitch. Head just misread the full toss. 17th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 34, Maxwell 0) 16th over: Australia 80-2 (Smith 32, Head 36) Yep, it is Kuldeep. Glad to see. Starts with a cracking wrong’un, that beats Head and brings an appeal. Well outside the line, mind. TV confirms they were right not to review the appeal in the previous over too - umpires call. Just. Smith batting in the Aussie baseball cap now. I know we’ve done this a bit on the OBO before, but this times like these we need to campaign hard for them to bring back the baggy gold. Four singles for the pair from the over, happy to keep going with their risk-free approach for now. Rightly so with this stand now worth 71 in 67 balls. 15th over: Australia 76-2 (Smith 29, Head 35) Game of two ends here. Chahal, and earlier Bhuvi, Australia cannot score - 15 runs from eight overs in that direction. Huge LBW shout from the spinner’s penultimate ball, pushing a quicker one through at Head. But outside the line? Seems the consensus from Kohli and Dhoni behind the stumps, deciding against sending it upstairs. That’s drinks for the lads. Nicely poised, as we say. “I fancy the aussies to pull this off,” writes Stuie Neale to me on the tweet. I tend to agree, because it is never wise to punt against Australia when Steve Smith is in. At any time. Head looking the goods too. But let’s see how Kuldeep goes. Spin to win, and all that. 14th over: Australia 73-2 (Smith 28, Head 33) Blimey, Travis Head is good at cricket, ay? Pandya slips onto middle stump and he clips him through midwicket with all the grace and timing of Mark Waugh. Was dropped at first slip while still in single digits. That Rohit mistake could very well end up the defining moment of this match. Nine more from it. Hardik has leaked 24 in three. Time for wrist spin at both ends? Finny going nuts at Lord’s. Has seven. Lancs look shot. See it through with Will. Speaking of, got to watch Sanga bring up his 64th First Class ton yesterday. Get in. 13th over: Australia 64-2 (Smith 26, Head 26) Chahal with his cagey leggies for the first time tonight. He was outstanding on Sunday at Chennai; mixed up his speed so well. And just the three singles from his first over here, out to the sweepers. Nothing silly required, only need five an over. Have consolidated well after the testing time early on. Time to capitalise. 12th over: Australia 61-2 (Smith 25, Head 24) Pandya back. TV has popped up the Dan Brettig stat on Smith, going 38 ODIs before reaching a half-century in the format. They claim he was a leggie through all of that stretch. He wasn’t. But let’s not let the truth get in the way of a lovely myth. What is true: the timing on a cover drive here, on the up and everything. That’s just lovely, Skip. Australia’s 50 up in the process. Oh, even better with an on-drive. That’s shot the day-night. I’m obviously covering this from London (the couch) and not the press box. But to give some insight to my colleagues who are. Being a day-night fixture they will be hanging for an obvious theme to emerge in this second innings so they can start writing well before the end of the game. A Steve Smith ton in his 100th ODI is absolutely perfect for that. Narrrrrrative. He gets four more to end the expensive over, worth 12. Leg byes actually, off the front pad rather than the inside edge according to the official. Meanwhile over at Lord’s... ADAM VOGES! 11th over: Australia 49-2 (Smith 17, Head 24) Bhuvi, Bhuvi, Bhuvi! Great man goes again. At Head initially, who steers behind point to give Smith a go. Leaving, pushing, stroking to cover. Finds a gap to keep the strike, square driving nicely. Looks set for this. 10th over: Australia 47-2 (Smith 16, Head 23) There is a change, Bumrah replaced by Hardik with his medium-fast (as opposed to fast-medium). Hits the bat hard to begin, but Head rocks back and crunches through midwicket. Field still up, only needs to pick the gap, does it with ease. Classy shot from the younger of the two Australians out there. Hardik does as all good bowlers must and pretends he dropped short due to slipping in his delivery stride. Pull the other one, mate. For full effect, he gets the BAIL OFF to scrape something from his boots. Matey. We get it. Back to your mark already. Head gets onto another, this time when Hardik overpitches. Your spikes again? Smith gets involved, sending him back to his mark when nearly at the delivery stride. Unclear why. Scrappy over. 9th over: Australia 40-2 (Smith 16, Head 16) Bhuvi beats Head again! Into his fifth over here. Gee, must be a temptation to keep him going? One for the ODI lovers of old: chuck on your most probing seamer and let him bowl his full set from the top of the innings. Good evening if you’re reading on, Adam Dale. Hi there, Terry Alderman. How’s it going, Mike Whitney? Conservatively played by both through the rest of the over. Wonderful analysis: 5-2-7-2. 8th over: Australia 39-2 (Smith 16, Head 15) Smith, in his 100th ODI, moving up the gears now. Bumrah let’s himself down twice in a row, too full on leg stump then too short way outside off stump. The captain doesn’t miss out on either occasion. But a great comeback too, landing a yorker. Oh, scrap that... four more! Byes this time? Smith shuffling waaaay across. Thought he might have got some of his bum on it? 12 from the over all the same. 7th over: Australia 27-2 (Smith 8, Head 15) Is that a dropped catch to end the over? I think it might be. Bhuvi has won the edge and yes, Rohit has put Head down. That’s a bad one too. About shin-height. Has to take that. Oh dear. Comes after the left-hander flicks with ease through midwicket to collect a second boundary. Can’t take your eyes off this at the moment. When will the ball stop swinging? Earlier in the set, Smith deployed the aggressive bat-waving leave we saw so much in his trio of Border-Gavaskar tons earlier in the year. Prompts the commentary team to talk about Glenn Maxwell’s genius video from the other. Say what you will about the Victorian, he’s the funniest cricketer we have. And so bloody clever. The Lara? The Langer? Trust me - watch this. 6th over: Australia 22-2 (Smith 7, Head 11) Head cut in half by Bumrah! What a clinic these two are putting on. Deserves to have his name in the book. But he won’t by changing the script, punished by Head when dropping short. Three more come from a push past forward square leg. Nice timing from the South Australian. But he plays and misses as well to end the over. What a great little session this is. You will rarely see better swing bowling than this in the modern game. Another magnificent over from Bhuvi rewarded with another wicket. He beat Warner to begin, then later got another to move so beautifully through the air to win the edge, landing safely in the hands of second slip. Gorgeous cricket. 5th over: Australia 10-2 (Smith 6, Head 0) 4th over: Australia 9-1 (Warner 1, Smith 6) Smith walking out for his 100th ODI. Dan Brettig crunched the numbers for Cricinfo on his ODI career to date. Didn’t pass 50 in his first 39 matches, has eight tons since, going at 54. Have that. Might need one tonight. Oh! Nearly edges behind in this first over at the crease, playing at missing after getting all the way across his stumps to Bumrah. Both these quicks making it dart around both ways. A joy to watch. He does find the edge of the Aussie captain, but it is wide of second slip and quickly down to the rope. Another penetrative over. Magnficent fast bowling! Through the gate with ample hoop, wide of the crease, crashing into the top of off-stump. There’s one for the Bhuvi highlight reel. Cartwright, who faced 15 balls for his one, never looked like it against a ball going both ways. End of a wicket maiden as well. 3rd over: Australia 2-1 (Warner 0, Smith 0) 2nd over: Australia 2-0 (Cartwright 1, Warner 0) Bumrah following Bhuvi’s lead. Cartwright really scrapping around here, leaving a ball that nearly clips his off-stump then wafting at the change-up, moving away. Just misses the edge. Kicks away a legbye then Warner gets a beauty, pushing and beaten outside the off-stump as well. Fantastic start to the Indian defence. Big finish coming up down the road at Lord’s. Finny on fire. Lancs need 71 with four wickets in hand. Middlesex need to win to makes sure they stay in the top flight. Join Will Macpherson on the other side to see how that finishes. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Cartwright 1, Warner 0) Cartwright hurried up from the get-go by the Indian attack-leader. Moves the ball away from the right-hander and then back in. On the money, as always. A quick single taken behind square to get off the mark. Warner safe even if it hit, by the looks of the replay. Warner happy to watch one dart away from his IPL teammate, then defend solidly the delivery back into his pads. That’s a quality over to begin. We’re away! Bhuvi has the ball, Cartwright on strike. Australia need 253. GO! Allo! Thank you to Sam Perry for steering the OBO for the better part of four and a half hours. Really great when ODIs drag on an hour longer than they should do, isn’t it? Anyway, let’s not get too down in the dumps. As long as we’re together, right? You can probably tell from the choice of song it’s Adam Collins here for the Australian chase. Pretty nicely set up, actually. Hot and wet (nurse!), track holding up enough to keep things interesting for the bowlers. Bit of pressure on Australia having won just once in their last ten ODI starts. Yeah. This’ll be good! Right on! Advantage Australia, but it’s probably not a significant one. From a start that saw India in control and players gasping and grimacing under the Kolkata humidity, to a chase that asks for five an over, this was a great fightback from Steve Smith’s side. India started the brighter, as Rahane and Kohli combined for a hundred-plus partnership that set the foundation and opened expectations for something over 300. The wicket seemed to support that thesis, for while the Australians extracted some bounce early, all swing was essentially negated after six or so overs, the batsmen leant on their drives easily, and India had themselves 180 runs and seven wickets in hand heading into the final 90 balls. But from there they lost seven wickets and made only seventy runs, both a tribute to tight Australian bowling and the emergence of a two-paced pitch that may not be as much of a paradise as was originally suggested. Each bowler hit their areas as India laboured its way to 252. Cummins was probably the pick, though Coulter-Nile and Richardson collected the lion’s share of the wickets with three apiece. A mention to Kohli, who oozed class on an increasingly tough wicket. He looked a little rusty early in his dig, as someone with 46 runs from his previous 6 outings against Australia might. But he felt his way into it, and left us with some excellent strokeplay. I haven’t seen a fuller bat face since the days of Tendulkar. A very intriguing chase awaits Australia. They start well, but can they handle India’s middle overs? The wrist spin that proved their undoing in Chennai is there waiting for them again. In the same way they corrected their bowling here in Kolkata, can they do the same with the bat? It will be Adam Collins to take you through it. For all those who stopped by, cheers, and enjoy the second innings. Another good over from Richardson, only one boundary from it, and India are all out. Richardson finishes with 3-55, an excellent finish after an ominous start. A few thoughts to follow... Chahal swings clumsily, misses, takes off, gets sent back, but Wade’s already rolled the ball in and hit the stumps. The hat-trick ball comes to nothing... Sorry to embolden that when the news was minimal. He goes with one from the back of the hand. It’s a full toss, and batted away easily by Chahal. Full toss to Pandya and he hits it straight down Warner’s throat! Hard not to think these little moments might eventually hand Australia the key advantage. Richardson’s on a hat-trick! 49th over: India 246-8 (Bumrah 5, Pandya 19) After the Cummins wicket, Bumrah comes out and swings wildly from another Cummins thunderbolt. The cleared front leg and big arc was always going to produce a dramatic result, and this time it’s in favour of the batsman. He gets a thick, thick edge and four runs. Pandya eventually comes on strike and finds a single to start himself on strike for the final six balls. What a catch by Wade! Cummins is full, wideish, and Kuldeep tries to steer him through the offside. It’s too quick, gets the edge, and Wade is full, full, stretch to his left, and takes it with the outstretched left hand. Great piece of skill. 48th over: India 239-7 (Kuldeep 0, Pandya 19) Crazy over from Richardson really. Double plays, umpire interventions, rain, a Smith dropped catch, then a wicket. Two overs to go, India slowing down. After being dropped by Smith the ball previous, Bhuvneshwar skies another high - but this time straight - and Maxwell makes so mistake. Another wicket for Richardson, and well deserved too. The covers are off... We can’t be too far away. Love when cricket throws up those little technicalities of law - so technical as to confound seasoned international players. Smith wanted the coveted pseudo double-play of a no-ball-catch-then-run-out, and thought he had it, until the umpires intervened. And they were completely correct, too, in a decision I’d imagine they express private pride in back in their dressing room. In the pantheon of umpire plays, overruling the Australian captain and being proved correct on a technicality would be cause for a dignified fist pump, in this correspondent’s view. Still waiting on word as to the rain situation here (Sky are playing ads so I’m presuming it’s still coming down). Adam Collins with some precedent... We’re off for rain here... It starts drizzling, but there’s chaos here in the preceding ball. Richardson delivers a waist-high full toss to Pandya, who skies it high on the off-side. Smith gets under it, takes it, and Pandya has begun to walk. Smith lobs the ball back to Stoinis, who takes the stumps. It then starts pelting down with rain. The umpire meanwhile has signalled no-ball, which in-turn prompts Smith to appeal for the run-out. The umpire, it seems, explains to Smith that when a batsman leaves the crease under the misapprehension that he’s dismissed, then the umpire shall call a dead ball. Smith, Warner and Handscomb (probably doesn’t need to be there) appear to argue the toss, but not overly vehemently. Apparently Law 27.7 proves the umpire correct. Strange stuff. Anyway, it was a passing shower. The covers are back off, and I think we’re starting soon. Anyone see this differently? 47th over: India 233-6 (Bhuvneshwar 15, Pandya 19) And now the batsmen swing a little. Fortune favours it, as they say, and Bhuvneshwar swings bravely, and lustily; the ball collects a thick outside edge and flies away for four, fine of third man. The next one’s a slower ball bouncer, and Bhuvneshwar is beaten by it - he gets bat to it and lobs it directly above him in the air. No one is in within cooee to catch it, somewhat comically. Next, Bhuvneshwar smashes one straight but it hits the non-striker Pandya in the helmet, leaving him rattled, but okay, on the deck for a while. Coulter-Nile is seen saying ‘oooh!’ in slow motion as it played out. Nasty stuff, but Pandya carries on. Another is smashed and fielded at long on, so there’s only one. 46th over: India 226-6 (Bhuvneshwar 10, Pandya 18) And only four from this one. Let’s call it for what it is: not so much a strategy from India as excellent bowling from Australia. Shorter length from Stoinis pays dividends for the former Victorian player. Nearly a mix-up midway through it too, a ‘yes-no’ giving Warner a chance to shy at the stumps. 45th over: India 222-6 (Bhuvneshwar 8, Pandya 16) dot, dot, one, dot, dot, one. Curious from both batsmen here. They’re scoring slowly, and not really attempting much either. Maybe it’s coming. Excellent yorkers from Coulter-Nile, and everything else is either glided or mis-timed. 44th over: India 220-6 (Bhuvneshwar 7, Pandya 15) Stoinis follows up the miserly theme with an economic offering of his own, this time only two from it. 30 balls remain, so 300 is largely out of the reckoning barring some burst of madness from Pandya, who’s moved to 15. He’d need to create a House of Fun, if you will. 43rd over: India 218-6 (Bhuvneshwar 5, Pandya 15) Pandya does have an answer for the short one. He menaces a forehand from Cummins through extra cover for four from his first delivery, and grabs the good batting single immediately afterward. The single is always more respected than the boundary, despite being a quarter of its value. There’s three more runs in the rest of the over; a better one for India. 42nd over: India 210-6 (Bhuvneshwar 4, Pandya 8) Match has swung hugely in Australia’s favour. Now only two from Richardson’s over, whose own figures are starting to gain their own respect (8-0-43-1). He’s hitting that back of a length region, and India are preserving wickets. Can Pandya counterpunch? Not too long to go now. 41st over: India 208-6 (Bhuvneshwar 3, Pandya 7) And only one from this over! Cummins has 0-19 from 8 overs, that is remarkable in the context of this match. I can’t remember a bowler being so effective yet so unrewarded in recent history. From the Indian test series, to Bangladesh, to now, the respect shown to him is worth noting. So, does Smith try to bowl India out here, or contain? Clarke says go for the jugular. Easy to say, I suppose, but he’s probably right. There are two slips to start Richardson’s next over, which demonstrates Smith’s thinking. 40th over: India 207-6 (Bhuvneshwar 2, Pandya 7) Richardson gets the wicket from the first ball, and Pandya edges desperately close to wide slip later on. The latter man becomes crucial in these final ten overs. Get him and Australia would be well on their way. Don’t, and 300 is still well and truly on. Because everything is binary like that. There’s no middle ground. Dhoni scoops Richardson to Smith at shortish cover and he takes it low to make it six down! Another hush around the crowd as another hero departs. Dhoni just reached for it fractionally and was too early on it. Smith’s hands safer than chances the Australian will commission another op-ed from Tony Abbott. What? 39th over: India 204-5 (Dhoni 5, Pandya 6) Only three from Cummins’ over here, memorable for Agar’s calf cramping mid-over and Pandya stealing two from Cummins’ final ball due to some sleepy Australian fielding. Another mini-resurgence from the visitors. 38th over: India 201-5 (Dhoni 4, Pandya 4) So Coulter-Nile gets the wicket and India now find themselves with two new batsmen at the crease. Pandya almost goes first ball, as Coulter-Nile finds another inside edge, but this one misses the stumps and careers away for four. These two took the game away from Australia in Chennai - can they do it again? Kohli chops on! Huge sigh from the crowd as Coulter-Nile gets one to just tail in a fraction, cramping Kohli’s attempted glide to third man, taking his inside edge and cannoning into the stumps. Thought Kohli was about to bash his stumps down afterwards, such was his annoyance. Excellent innings from the skipper, and he’s given a reception befitting of it. 37th over: India 195-4 (Dhoni 4, Kohli 90) Kohli into the nineties now, via another crisply timed off drive early on. Saw the bat makers name and all. He seemed a little out of touch at the beginning of his innings, but now he’s all bat angles and nips and tucks. He’s milking the strike and coming up with the big shot when he needs to. I think he’s got another level to go to here too. Still nearly 80 balls to go. 36th over: India 190-4 (Dhoni 4, Kohli 85) India’s two modern day legends at the crease now, and Dhoni whips up the crowd with a precision pull into the deep square boundary. He got inside the line of it very quickly and helped it on its way. Not the worst guy to come in right now, I’d venture. Similar to Jadhav’s six, but Coulter-Nile was a little tighter into Jadhav and he slapped it straight to Maxwell at point. He didn’t connect well with it at all, and Maxwell took it easily. The crowd goes nuts for Dhoni, who’s in next. 35th over: India 185-3 (Jadhav 24, Kohli 84) Stoinis drops short and wide early, and it allows Jadhav to prop, balance himself, and throw his hands at it. It sails over backward point all the way for six, the first of the match, and the crowd rises to a roar. The rest is fairly quiet but India have upped things here. I think they can go at close to ten an over. 34th over: India 176-3 (Jadhav 17, Kohli 82) Big over for India; I think there’ll be more of these. Early in the over Kohli squeezes Agar fine for four, but Agar’s towel fell out from his pants, so the umpire calls dead ball. Kohli’s not happy, Agar is laughing. Jadhav gets him back though, late in the over he goes inside out over cover for four, and follows up with a fine paddle for four to finish the over. 33rd over: India 165-3 (Jadhav 9, Kohli 79) Stoinis takes up the mantle now, as the crowd builds nicely. He starts with dots before an off-side wide spoils his start. Then a strange moment. Jadhav is beaten by a Stoinis slower ball, and the ensuing bounce hits the strained, kneeling Wade on the wrist, before settling on the turf. Wade grimaces, drops his head, and Kohli takes off from the non-strikers end to get a single. Stoinis and Wade aren’t happy, believing that the ball was dead. It technically wasn’t. Smith looks fairly unperturbed by it all. Was cheeky from Kohli, personally thought Wade’s dropped head to tend to his pain signalled dead ball enough, but Kohli’s position was arguable, so it will stand. Of course, it brought him on strike and he smashed the next ball for four - a brutal square drive. There’ll be verbal handbags in between overs, no doubt. 32nd over: India 158-3 (Jadhav 9, Kohli 74) Tidy again from Agar. Only three from it. India remaining patient. Post drinks normally heralds the final sprint, but taking them at 31 overs means there’s many, many balls to go. 114, in fact. I think India can score well over 150 from those. PredictViz, below, disagrees. 31st over: India 154-3 (Jhadav 7, Kohli 72) Still just ticking over here, as the camera pans to a muscular Dhoni waiting to come in. The crowd roars. Lots more coming through the on-side now, as Kohli flicks, pulls, and pushes his way to five of his own runs from the over, while Jhadav grabs one. We’ll have another drink. 30th over: India 148-3 (Jhadav 6, Kohli 68) Both batsmen work Agar to the on-side now, just allowing the ball to slide into their pads - waiting on it well. One of these results in a wild shy at the stumps that results in not only an overthrow, but a Border-esque teapot stance and grumpy head shake from Smith. Huge candidate to get grumpy as his career goes on. Should make for some good viewing. It goes 1,1,1,2,1,1. 29th over: India 141-3 (Jadhav 2, Kohli 65) Early boundary from Kohli’s bat gets him off to a winning start here, as he shuffles across the stumps to whip Richardson through the on-side for four. ‘Practice wickets!’ shouts commentator Harsha Bhogle, referring to the tendency for the ball to speed into the ropes once they hit those wickets, like a moving walkway at the airport. Richardson contains him thereafter. 28th over: India 134-3 (Jadhav 1, Kohli 59) Another breakthrough for Australia; it brings Kedar Jadhav to the crease. Only three from Agar’s over too, giving him figures of 1-32 from his 6 overs. Kohli looms as the threat now, though if I were India I wouldn’t be too concerned. They bat very deep, and if they can get to the final ten or so overs with enough wickets in hand, they can go big, as they say. Vision here of the run out earlier: Bowled! Agar beats Pandey with a quickish, flatter one that slides past Pandey’s chopped attempt at a cut. It actually went outside his bat, when normally those one’s beat the bat on the inside. He gave himself too much room. It’s another sad end to a stuttering innings, and gives Australia a brief sniff at holding India back a fraction longer. 27th over: India 131-2 (Pandey 3, Kohli 58) Wide slip back in for Coulter-Nile, is Smith still trying to find his edge? I think they’re three or four overs away from launching again. At one point Kohli effectively flicks a straight drive past Coulter-Nile but it hammers into the non-striker’s stumps, preventing a run. Coulter-Nile is otherwise tight. Only two from it. Mini-fightback from Australia here, it should be said. 25th over: India 129-2 (Pandey 2, Kohli 57) A one, a two, a wide, a one. Head, even when delivering extra balls in the over, takes about 53 seconds to get it done. India will rebuild here, before launching again. 300+ still very much in the offing, probably more. 24th over: India 124-2 (Pandey 1, Kohli 54) Coulter-Nile comes back into the attack. Interesting, given ex-captain Clarke lightly criticised Smith’s decision to go with his middle-over bowlers in Chennai when wickets were possibly on offer. Alternatively, maybe it’s so hot Smith’s simply rotating. He finds some bounce immediately, clocking in at late 130s. He’s tight too, as Australia’s off side ring all of a sudden finds themselves magnetised to the ball. There’s a wide late due to a misdirected bouncer, but he doesn’t pay for it. Only three from it. On the run out... Kohli wanted two, Rahane wanted one. Kohli was going to the danger end, and by rights had the call. Rahane suffered for his initially slow first run. As judge, I blame Rahane. When it comes to run-outs, someone needs blaming. It’s part of cricket’s unofficial Dismissal Grieving Process. Nice piece of fielding from Hilton Cartwright to effect the run out there. It brings Pandey to the crease, and momentarily breaks India’s gradual momentum. Review! Possible run-out Rahane could be in trouble here. Great throw from the boundary by Cartwright. Wade took the bails. Looks close... 23rd over: India 115-1 (Rahane 50, Kohli 52) Cummins seems to be mixing slower balls with back of a length bowling. From his second ball he nearly has Kohli run out. They sprinted side by side toward the striker end, and Cummins’ side-footed attempt (on his left) would have had the India captain if better directed. Brett Lee goes on to say that Australia’s Ashley Noffke snapped his angle in an Australian practice match playing soccer, thus ending his career. Very grim thought. In keeping with the world game, football does seem to be the warm-up game of choice among international teams. Does that ring true at the lower levels? In other news, Rahane brings up his own fifty (x62 balls) via a single. The partnership’s nearly at 100 and it could start getting fairly damaging soon. 22nd over: India 111-1 (Rahane 48, Kohli 50) We’re well and truly on the singles carousel now. It continues predictably with batsmen hitting the square sweeper, long off and long on, before an Agar wide combined with sloppiness from Wade brings some bonus runs for the home side. Kohli then brings up his fifty (x60 balls) with another single to long on, to the great joy of the Kolkata crowd. Brett Lee seizes the moment by saying “And there it is!” It’s a phrase I would have thought reserved for a hundred, though such milestones are celebrated as feverishly in India, so it’s fair enough. 21st over: India 104-1 (Rahane 46, Kohli 47) Is Cummins Australia’s talisman now? It’s been a meteoric rise if so. He returns to the attack, and concedes three. As I type, Sky have packaged up a montage of Australian players sweating, panting, keeling over, set to dramatic orchestral music. Matt Wade’s spitting in slow motion. Fantastic stuff. Some correspondence. “Dear Sam,” writes Anod. “So Ajinkya plays well today. Dhawan returns. In keeping with the policy of this India team, Ajinkya sits out. Any vacancies in the English middle order, eh? Ha Ha.” England’s top order, certainly. 20th over: India 101-1 (Rahane 45, Kohli 45) India moving into singles-with-well-timed-boundary mode now. They milk Agar before Kohli pounces on a fractionally short Agar delivery, late-cutting him deftly fine of the man protecting that area for four. India ready to kick on, I feel. Both batsmen now 45 from 53 balls. 19th over: India 91-1 (Rahane 41, Kohli 39) The Agar-Stoinis axis is serving Australia well enough, though Stoinis is pulled for four from his first ball. It caught high on Kohli’s bat - he was beaten for pace - but the ball found the practice wickets and skipped into the rope. Travis Head slid in vain, and I wondered whether his spikes would puncture the covers sitting on the perimeter of the boundary. A run-out attempt from a quick single mid on results in a misfield from the man attempting to back up the throw, and there’s an overthrow: the natural result of a hot day, poor decisions, and being in the field. Cummins does well to stop the overthrows going for four. 18th over: India 83-1 (Rahane 41, Kohli 31) Only one from Agar’s over here, and early on he’s diving full stretch to cut off a Kohli single to long-off - fully airborne and all. Finds some spin later too. He’s settled into his spell well. Really like this from Nagarjun, in response to Phil’s tweet earlier; 17th over: India 82-1 (Rahane 41, Kohli 30) Close-ups of Wade spitting now. Not pretty. Who’d keep if he had to go? Handscomb’s not playing. Could be some novelty to be had here. Stoinis has returned and, early wide aside, is bowling excellently. He targets a few well-directed yorkers into Kohli and broadly keeps both batsmen quiet. Maxwell dives vigorously at point to save some runs from the last ball as Australia fight grimly. I’d like to keep talking about who’s spent the most minutes, hours, days, years, playing international cricket. 16th over: India 77-1 (Rahane 38, Kohli 29) Five from Agar’s over. He looks like he belongs here. Just singles and two’s. Most people seem concerned about the heat. Kohli and Rahane on their knees at drinks getting checked by ex-Aussie physio, now India’s physio, Pat Farhart. Wade’s hunched over his knees. While player’s barely cope with the humidity, there’s also this to ponder. I really like this conversation. Often think about players who’ve played over 100 Tests. It’s at least a year of your life playing Test cricket. 15th over: India 72-1 (Rahane 34, Kohli 28) Richardson is bowling almost exclusively cross-seam now, and he’s found his range. He’s cramping both Kohli and Rahane, who are content to pick up a single each. That’s drinks. 14th over: India 70-1 (Rahane 33, Kohli 27) Agar’s into the attack now, spearing the ball in. The over feels quiet because there are no boundaries, just consistent singles and a two. Long on coming into play now. Six from it, India starting to cruise. Bit of a delay here.. Play comes to a halt as about half the team seem to simultaneously succumb to the aching humidity of Kolkata. There’s about a five minute delay as each of Wade, Richardson, Cartwright and others are tended to with wet towels, water, and whatever else. The next 36 overs might be painful. 13th over: India 63-1 (Rahane 30, Kohli 23) Richardson in a bit of trouble here. He labours back to his mark, head bowed, and in the background you can see Wade standing with his hands on his knees. He concedes a few singles before the full face of Kohli’s bat consumes the entire wide-screen I’m watching on, driving fiercely through the off-side for four. The crowd scream ‘Kohli! Kohli! Kohli!’ in unison. Seven from the over. 12th over: India 56-1 (Rahane 29, Kohli 17) Richardson being looked at by the physio on the boundary; Clarke suggesting that his last-ball bouncer might have caused it. Meanwhile, one’s and two’s from this Stoinis over. It’s Australia’s bowling powerplay so sweepers abound, and they’re found at cover chiefly, where the majority of runs seem to be coming from today. 11th over: India 50-1 (Rahane 28, Kohli 12) A better over for Richardson, until Kohli pulls one from his head for a boundary from the concluding ball of the over. How many times do we see that? Interestingly, Kohli was 8 from 22 heading into that ball, and there’s some fevered talk from Michael Clarke on TV about commonly-understood plans for getting Kohli out. It involves cutting his runs down on the off-side and bouncing him, essentially. Kohli’s warming into it. 10th over: India 44-1 (Rahane 27, Kohli 7) Stoinis replaces Coulter-Nile and puts the handbrake on proceedings. Smith has removed a slip and packed the off-side, and the fielding change saves a boundary straight away. Commentators are talking about “a glint in Kohli’s eye” today. I guess he’s due runs, so it’s a fair bet. Stoinis’ medium pace has the desired effect - it’s harder to climb into him and he leaves the over with only one run to his, and Australia’s name. 9th over: India 43-1 (Rahane 27, Kohli 6) Kane Richardson comes on for Cummins, and Smith retains two slips. He has very snappy arms and legs on release, and his front leg splays out to point on delivery. ‘Okay, Brett Lee,’ I can hear you saying. Anyway, Kohli fairly walks into Richardson’s second offering, punching him through the covers for four. Richardson finds some bounce later on, and Kohli sort of windscreen wipes it - a half-leave, half-cut - down to third one. It brings Rahane back on strike and he shows us how to do it: a sumptuous, technically perfect cut shot for four that races to the boundary. The runs starting to pile on now. Looks about 35 degrees out there too. 8th over: India 34-1 (Rahane 23, Kohli 1) Another boundary to start Coulter-Nile’s over. Australia’s ‘number 6’ (also worn by ME Waugh) is too full and Rahane is elegant again, this time driving a little straighter between mid-off and cover. The timing is exquisite. He has a curious delivery stride, Coulter-Nile. In an age where players think of everything in straight lines - ‘when bowling, imagine running in a narrow corridor of wet paint’ - Coulter-Nile seems to jump out towards third man before delivering. At release, he’s effectively wide of the crease. Everything works for him this over, until Rahane duplicates the over’s beginning. It’s another gloriously stroked (not ‘struck’) off drive. It means 8 from the over. Coulter-Nile looks very tired. 7th over: India 26-1 (Rahane 15, Kohli 1) A maiden from Cummins here, keeping India shackled-enough. It allows Kohli a good look at six balls, all directed at fourth or fifth stump, around 150km/hr. Cummins leaves the field afterwards. Will follow that one. 6th over: India 26-1 (Rahane 15, Kohli 1) So the wicket came, bringing captain Kohli to the crease. Coulter-Nile almost has him two balls in, too - he delivers a wide one that the skipper chases. It finds a thickish edge that flies wide of second slip and to rolls to the relative safety of third man. It brings Rahane back on strike, and the Indian opener finishes the over with a caressed cover drive for four. This one wasn’t as brutal as his earlier iteration, but the result is four. Gone! From almost nowhere, Sharma scoops a full ball from Coulter-Nile straight back to the bowler, and the big quick is able to snaffle it. His catch wasn’t of the straight reflex variety, but he was sufficiently off-balance to make it a good piece of skill. Sharma ‘toed’ it, and Coulter-Nile was aware enough to pop it up with his right hand before grabbing it with both. Australia are away. 5th over: India 19-0 (Rahane 11, Sharma 7) Cummins strikes Rahane on the pad early in the over - it brings a sizeable shout from the cordon, but it’s turned down. Smith thinks about reviewing but indicates that it was missing leg. Replays confirm that. Next ball, Cummins flies in then all of a sudden the ball flies out the back of his hand, lobbing itself to mid on. It slipped from the back of his hand, Cummins tumbled, leaving everyone flummoxed, then laughing. The Penrith clubman responds by delivering a ripsnorting bouncer that whistles past Rahane nose; it seamed from the wicket and was zeroing in on the batsman before he swayed out of the way. Rahane predictably prods one and takes off next ball, but Sharma sends him back. Impressive stuff again from Cummins. 4th over: India 18-0 (Rahane 11, Sharma 6) Another cover-drive for four, this time from Rahane, from Coulter-Nile’s first ball. He follows with a wide, and then Rahane leans on a checked-square drive, just steering it between backward and cover point. Nine from (effectively) two balls. Smith has two slips - understandable this early on, because wickets are very helpful. I think he’ll remove one soon though. Rahane slashes late in the over but Coulter-Nile’s bounce is too much. It’s a play-and-miss and Coulter-Nile throws his head back, but really Rahane just missed out on a boundary. 3rd over: India 9-0 (Rahane 3, Sharma 6) A quiet start to the over before Rohit Sharma absolutely laces a cover drive for four. It hurtled at warp speed to the boundary; an absolutely copybook execution of the shot too. The sort of shot that makes you think ‘hmm, this is a good wicket.’ Calling 300+ already. Courageous, isn’t it. No other runs from the over Meanwhile, Brett Lee argues on TV that it was unfair to label Pat Cummins as “injury prone”... I’d respectfully disagree. 2nd over: India 5-0 (Rahane 3, Sharma 2) It’s Coulter-Nile from the other end, and he’s sporting a shaved head; very much in keeping with the late-90s, early 2000s style in these Asian parts. Whereas Cummins is whippy and all fast-arm action, Coulter-Nile bustles and muscles in, using girthy shoulders to propel a heavy ball down the wicket. On Sunday he bowled very full and searched for swing. Here he hits the wicket hard, back of a length, and tight enough to restrict Rahane and Sharma to a single each via glides to third man. 1st over: India 3-0 (Rahane 2, Sharma 1) Cummins needs no loosener, the ball carrying through to Wade’s head from the off. Rahane brings the first roar of the day, moving onto his tippy toes to glide Cummins down to third man to bring the first run of the day. “He just wants to get to the other end,” says Brett Lee. Sharma finds a quick single to the on-side, before Cummins nearly beats the inside of Rahane’s bat - an inside edge coupled with rooted feet giving Cummins cause to throw his hands up in the air in exasperation. Rahane gets one for it all the same. Cummins always seems to start well. Anthems are done The crowd is fairly sparse, apparently a function of the local Pujo festival. Thought they’re expected to flock in later. In less culturally sophisticated news, Nathan Coulter-Nile is wearing the gold floppy. He joins Pat Cummins, who’ll start things off. A look at the wicket There was some suggestion that the rain might leave a green tinge on the wicket. Admittedly, I’m red-green colour blind so I’d struggle to see it anyway, but this looks especially hard and decidedly not-green. Teams: Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Hilton Cartwright, Steven Smith(c), Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade(w), Ashton Agar, Kane Richardson, Pat Cummins, Nathan Coulter-Nile India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli(c), Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni(w), Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah For Australia, that’s Zampa and Faulkner out - they’re replaced by Agar and Richardson respectively. India are unchanged Smith on his 100th ODI “Taken me 7 years to get there, excited to play my 100th at Eden. Would have batted first too. Hopefully we can bowl well early and put the pressure on. Two changes; Richardson in for Faulkner, and Agar in for Zampa.” Nice piece from Dan Brettig on Smith’s century of matches if you follow the tweet here: undefined Forget Brett Lee’s comments, Kohli wants to set a total. “We’re going to bat. Looks a nice and hard wicket, doesn’t have a lot of moisture in it. Tends to do a lot more in the night than the day and we have two wrist-spinners too. Was a lot of talk in last few months about the top order but middle and lower order have done the job for us in the last few games. Last game gave us confidence as a side and lifted us.” Good morning, afternoon and evening to you all, and welcome to our OBO coverage of this, the second ODI between India and Australia being played at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The home side have a one-nil lead, courtesy of a comfortable-enough win in Chennai at the weekend, but whether that provides the riveting context you crave, or not, is really up to you. In an age of isolated contest after isolated contest, it may surprise you to learn that India have one seven ODIs on the bounce, and that the World Champions, Australia, have won just one from their last ten. All roads point towards advantage India. But does that matter anyway? Ed Cowan, speaking on Fox Sports this week, posed that question in a roundabout way. He pondered whether this Australian side resembled a ‘development squad’ rather than a Best XI, pointing to the inclusion of Hilton Cartwright as an opener. Cartwright averages 16 in domestic fifty-over cricket. Cowan may have a point. I’m told there’s been a fair bit of rain around Kolkata, so much so that a delayed start was predicted as late as this morning. However it seems to have abated, and moreover had little impact on the wicket. Says Brett Lee: “It looks like a very good pitch. Last season, the pitch had a two-pace quality to it. This one may not have that. Last few games over here have produced more than 300 runs. With the rains around, teams might want to field. Absolute beautiful pitch here at Eden Gardens.” Great pitch. May want to field. That confuses me. Then again, many things do. Next I’ll bring you reports from the toss, and the respective playing XIs of both teams. As ever, it would be great to hear from you.

So why now, at the beginning of the 21st century, after prohibiting euthanasia for thousands of years and when we can do so much more to relieve suffering than in the past, do we suddenly think that legalising it is a good idea? I propose a major cause is a catastrophic failure of collective human memory and collective human imagination. Let‘s look at the approaches taken on each side of the debate. If euthanasia were a stone thrown into a pond, pro-euthanasia advocates see only the stone and the immediate splash, not the stone’s antecedents or the widespread ripples it sets off. These blind spots constitute, respectively, a failure of human memory and of human imagination. The pro-euthanasia case is straightforward and easy to make. (I will use the word euthanasia to include physician-assisted suicide (PAS). It focuses on a suffering, competent, adult individual who wants to die and gives informed consent to euthanasia. Proponents argue that the person’s right to autonomy overrides other considerations, concerns and values, and that denying them euthanasia is cruelty and providing it kindness. Pro-euthanasia advocates reject history – especially any reference to the Nazi atrocities - as having anything, or at least anything valuable, to teach us regarding euthanasia. Nobody believes legalising euthanasia will result in a Holocaust, but the justifications for the Third Reich’s early 1930’s euthanasia program for people with disabilities – “lives not worth living” – are eerily similar to present justifications for euthanasia. As Catherine Frazee, a Canadian professor of disability studies has said, “The Nazi ... euthanasia program is part of my history as a disabled person.” Pro-euthanasia advocates also deny the reality of the slippery slopes it’s opened up in the Netherlands and Belgium. The “logical slippery slope” – the expansion of the situations where euthanasia is allowed – has constantly enlarged. In the Netherlands, euthanasia is no longer restricted to competent adults with unbearable suffering able to provide informed consent. It’s now available to children, newborn babies with serious disabilities, and people with dementia and mental illness, such as depression, without physical illness. There are movements to legalise access to inflicted death for people “over 70 and tired of life” or who feel they have a “completed life”. Likewise, after just over a year of legalised euthanasia in Quebec, there are calls for it to be extended to “euthanasia on demand”, that is, that there should be no requirements for access by a competent person. Instances of the “practical slippery slope” – euthanasia not in compliance with the law allowing it – are legion. Safeguards are ineffective to prevent slippery slopes. As British moral philosopher Dame Mary Warnock has put it in another context, “you cannot successfully block a slippery slope except by a fixed and invariable obstacle”. In governing dying and death that obstacle is the rule that we must not intentionally kill another human being. In short, once euthanasia becomes normalised slippery slopes are unavoidable and the number of deaths resulting from euthanasia constantly substantially increases. In Flanders in 2013, 4.6% of all deaths were by euthanasia and an additional 1.7% (approximately 1000 deaths) were without request. Unreported deaths were not included in these statistics. The case against euthanasia is much more complex. As well as looking at what individuals want and need in the present, because the past is an important source of understanding in tackling complicated problems, such as whether to legalise euthanasia, it also looks to the past to take into account the warnings that “human memory” can provide. As Margaret MacMillan, the distinguished Canadian historian, has said, “…history, through its cautionary tales and analogues, is a rich vein of ‘right questions’.” The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have taught us to speak of Elders past and present and to revere their wisdom and what that can teach us. Some First Nations people express this as the need to look back seven generations through human memory and look forward seven generations through imagination, when making important societal decisions. We need to do just that with respect to euthanasia. We should use our imaginations to look to the future and ask questions such as “How will our great great grandchildren die if we legalise euthanasia?” What kind of society will we have left to them? Will it be one in which no reasonable person would want to live? A failure of human memory and human imagination results in a focus just on individuals and locates the discussion of whether or not to legalise euthanasia just in the present, which means we fail to consider what protection of the “common good” requires that we not do. To decide we must assess the risks and harms of legalising euthanasia. First, euthanasia puts the lives of individuals, especially vulnerable people, such as those with disabilities, at risk. As Liz Carr, a lesbian atheist British comedian who has serious disabilities and opposes euthanasia, has pointed out, there is a very fine line between being a terminally ill person and a person with a disability. The fragile elderly are also at serious risk. 4 to 14% of elderly Australians are abused, often through “early inheritance syndrome” – a person, usually a child of the elderly person, uses a power of attorney to access the elderly person’s financial assets for their own benefit. The combination of the abuse of elderly persons and euthanasia, would be a lethal cocktail. “Early inheritance syndrome” will morph into “early death syndrome”. While only about 5% of people mention pain as a reason for wanting euthanasia, around 48% of people give “feeling a burden on others” as such a reason. This provides an argument against legalising euthanasia, as that reason is eliminated if euthanasia is not available. Dying and death have been depersonalised, dehumanised, medicalised, technologised, professionalised, institutionalised and certainly de-spiritualised. For the dying person this can result in what psychoanalyst and Yale law professor the late Dr Jay Katz called “intense pre-mortem loneliness” to which asking for euthanasia can be a response. We all have a role to play, especially as doctors, lawyers and politicians, in being voices in establishing approaches that will help to avoid or remedy this loneliness. In short, a powerful antidote to a reality of intense loneliness at the end of life is to provide easily accessible, good palliative medicine and care. In secular societies, such as Australia, law and medicine are the two main institutions carrying the value of respect for life for society as a whole. This value must be upheld at two levels: respect for the life of every individual person and in society in general. Euthanasia seriously harms law’s and medicine’s capacity to carry this value, because it involves changing the law to allow intentional killing and authorising doctors to undertake that. Damage to medicine also includes abandoning the nearly 2,500 year history of the Hippocratic oath’s guidance – cure where possible, care always, never kill. The risks and harms to society include damage to the shared values that bond us as a society and to our society’s “ethical tone”. We can’t judge the ethical tone of a society by how it treats its strongest, most privileged, most powerful members, but by how it treats its weakest, most vulnerable and most in need. Dying people belong to the latter group. With euthanasia we offer them death instead of loving care. Risks to both individuals and society include harming suicide prevention programs and suicide contagion; suicide is the leading cause of death in young people under 35 years old – a public health crisis. Also it’s not an uncommon cause of death in the elderly. We must bring to bear our individual and collective human memories and imaginations and speak of what they tell us. I am confident that if we did this open-mindedly, we would decide against legalising physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. We must kill the pain and suffering, not the person with pain and suffering.

On Wednesday the premier, Daniel Andrews; the health minister, Jill Hennessy; and the attorney general, Martin Pakula, were due to introduce to parliament the bill to legalise voluntary assisted dying. The bill was two years in the making and included extensive consultation with disability workers, palliative care specialists and legal experts. Andrews, Pakula and Hennessy all emphasised to reporters outside Parliament House that the legislation was the most conservative of all the assisted dying laws around the world. It includes 66 safeguards to prevent abuse of the laws. “This will be – because we’ve listened to the experts – the most conservative model in the world, with many safeguards, to give people the choice they’ve been denied far too long,” Andrews said. “We think we can get this balance right, and give to people a choice for them to be empowered, for them to have control over the last stage of their life. This is the most cautious, the safest, scheme for assisted dying anywhere in the world.” Pakula said although existing laws included penalties that would apply to a person or a doctor who inappropriately assisted someone to die, new penalties would be introduced so that prosecutors would not have to “retrofit new types of behaviour to old offences”. Under the Victorian legislation patients will have to administer lethal medication themselves except in exceptional circumstances. Anyone who abused their permit and assisted someone to die or encouraged them to die would face life imprisonment and significant fines, Pakula said. “This is a regime fundamentally about administration, and assisted administration is allowed in very limited circumstances.” A parliamentary debate on the bill will be held in October. As Victoria introduced the bill the head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, wrote an opinion piece for the Huffington Post referencing an AMA member survey which found those doctors mostly likely to support voluntary dying were “younger doctors and those who rarely treat dying patients”. About one-sixth of doctors are AMA members. “Exactly how and when euthanasia became a progressive left issue is difficult to understand,” Gannon wrote. “A societal change that threatens the most vulnerable people, those without a voice, while prioritising the rights of the individual, might appear to be ideologically closer to the right. “The way we look after our elderly is simply not good enough. It is a stain on our society that we do not invest in aged care like we invest in, and celebrate, technological advances in medical procedures and new pharmaceuticals.” NSW will introduce its own legislation to parliament on Thursday. The Victorian and NSW proposals are similar in that both would allow a patient to be prescribed drugs to take their own life if they are terminally ill and expected to die within 12 months. Victoria adds that the illness must be “causing suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that is tolerable to the person” while the NSW scheme says a person must be “experiencing severe pain, suffering or physical incapacity to an extent unacceptable to the patient”. In NSW, a person would have to be at least 25 years old, while in Victoria the cut-off is 18. The key difference is that the NSW law is a private member’s bill, where Victoria’s is government legislation, which gives it extra standing and a guaranteed debate in parliament. Go Gentle Australia’s campaign director, Paul Price, said the group, which advocates for assisted dying laws, was focusing its resources on Victoria because “the process has been much stronger than anywhere”. “The risk in NSW is that it follows the paths of so many private member’s bills that have failed in history, more than 30 have failed, [while] this is a government bill.” He said the Victorian bill was “spot on” in terms of its clarity and safeguards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/i-pray-shes-already-dead-chaos-as-mexico-city-block-collapses-after-quake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T03:05:19Z","webTitle":"'I pray she's already dead': chaos as Mexico City block collapses after quake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/i-pray-shes-already-dead-chaos-as-mexico-city-block-collapses-after-quake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/i-pray-shes-already-dead-chaos-as-mexico-city-block-collapses-after-quake","fields":{"headline":"'I pray she's already dead': chaos as Mexico City block collapses after quake","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Casandra Hidalgo ran outside when the earthquake struck just in time to see the seven-storey apartment building opposite the café where she works tumble into a heap. “It fell to the ground in front of our eyes, people were running everywhere around it, but we’ve been standing here since and no one has come out of the building,” Hidalgo, 18, told the Guardian as she stood in front of the enormous pile of dusty rubble in the Mexico City’s leafy La Condesa neighbourhood. At least 217 people are dead after the 7.1 earthquake struck at about 1pm on Tuesday causing widespread destruction in Mexico City and neighbouring states – exactly 32 years since a 1985 tremor devastated the city. The epicentre of the tremor was close to the town of Raboso in the state of Puebla, 120km (75 miles) from the capital. The quake devastated La Condesa, one of the city’s most prosperous neighbourhoods, flattening several buildings and leaving scores more damaged and unstable. The collapsed apartment block on the circular boulevard Amsterdam Avenue was instantly cloaked by clouds of white dust as a strong smell of gas filled the air. The building comprises three apartments on each floor – no one knows how many people were inside when the earthquake hit. Monica Saavdera’s 87-year-old mother was among the residents at home when the earthquake hit. “I pray that she’s already dead, that she’s not trapped underneath alive,” Saavdera said, comforting her mother’s sobbing domestic worker who survived because she had popped out to run some errands when the quake struck. The first to arrive on the scene, minutes after the building collapsed, was a group of construction workers who had been working a couple of blocks away. Within minutes, they took control and started trying to lift the rubble by hand until neighbours arrived with shovels, saws, wheelbarrows and plastic buckets to help. Within a couple of hours there were hundreds of people trying to assist but no authorities to take charge. Every few minutes there were shouts of “silence, silence” as the volunteers on top of the rubble struggled to listen for survivors from deep beneath the ruins. “It’s chaos, people want to help but civil protection should be here and in charge, there are too many people on top of the debris it is dangerous for everyone” said Israel Belmonte, an education ministry worker who is also part of the health and safety brigade. Dozens of civilians, some wearing cycle helmets and garden gloves for protection, were scattered across the metres-tall rubble heap. Doctors and nurses who live nearby were also on the scene and had set up a makeshift medical centre even before the first ambulances arrived more than two hours later. The first firefighters took even longer to arrive. Hundreds of people formed human chains and cleared debris by hand in order to allow the emergency services through, passing broken concrete slabs, fallen trees and sharp metal poles from person to person out of the way. Plastic crates and shopping trolleys from a nearby supermarket were used to move the heavier debris. Several civilians needed medical treatment after being hit by debris. One frustrated man shouted at a group of police officers. “Don’t just stand there, help, everyone has to help, why aren’t you doing anything?” Donations of water and medicines started flooding in, but volunteers urgently called for more supplies. “We need batteries, torches, blankets, another megaphone, more tools, please bring us what we need,” one man said. At about 5pm, as the authorities and machinery started to arrive , one of the volunteers shouted out that help was needed a few blocks away where another building had collapsed. Dozens of people started running in that direction, where truckloads of navy and army officers were also converging. There, riot police held signs with lists of medicines needed included antibiotics and painkillers. Away from Amsterdam Avenue, there were smashed-up cars, broken windows, cracked walls and partially collapsed buildings in every direction. Mayte Ferriero and her daughter Yeziel, 22, lived on the fifth floor of the collapsed Amsterdam Avenue building. They were out having a late breakfast when the earthquake struck, but their domestic worker was inside. “She’s in there, so is the security guard, who knows how many others,” said Ferriero"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/20/a-clean-energy-target-is-not-unconscionable-tony-abbott-wrecking-climate-policy-is","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T02:10:04Z","webTitle":"A clean energy target is not 'unconscionable', Tony Abbott.

Wrecking climate policy is","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tony Abbott has been an implacable force against rational climate action in this country for the best part of a decade, and nothing has changed. Having destroyed one set of energy policies designed to achieve orderly economic transformation and emissions reduction, and created a monumental policy botch-up as a consequence, he’s determined to destroy another. After warming his vocal cords for months, Abbott now says it would be “unconscionable” for Malcolm Turnbull to “go further down the renewables path”. By this he means implement a clean energy target. Let’s be very clear about this. What is actually unconscionable, and I don’t invoke the word lightly, is Abbott’s own behaviour. Let’s also be very clear about what is happening right now. Abbott wants to lead an insurgency with the aim of sinking Malcolm Turnbull’s climate and energy policy, which is now, and has always been, a proxy for his leadership. Like an armchair general summoning a militia, using his favoured media proxies as loud hailers, the former prime minister has seeded a story that he might cross the floor. If he does cross the floor (as opposed to threatening to, in order to pressure Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg into producing the most coal-friendly energy policy imaginable over the next few weeks), with a posse of sharpshooters (Craig Kelly, potentially; George Christensen, who is already on the record as a no vote; a handful of others) it doesn’t mean the policy is dead. The government could still wrangle an energy policy through the parliament with Labor’s support, if it manages to produce a policy framework which Labor can live with (a big if, on current indications, but not impossible). But there’s still a poison pill. If Turnbull does the rational thing and tries to end the climate wars – an outcome which business, the energy sector, climate groups, state governments and many Australian voters are now desperately looking for – then Abbott will characterise this as a fundamental betrayal of conservative values. Turnbull will be signing up with Labor and the Greens, and conspiring in the de-industrialisation of Australia. Being constructive is considered a mortal sin in Australia’s hyperpartisan, knock-down clown politics. Being constructive makes some of the current crop of parliamentarians – now hardwired for a permanent war which is diminishing them and diminishing the country – nervous. So in Abbott’s brutal calculation, it’s heads I win, tails I win. Damage is the ultimate objective. Now before we get to conviction, or the lack thereof, let’s look again at what Abbott has done when he’s had power and opportunity, as opposed to the expression of feelings during his second career delivering careless whispers in Ray Hadley’s locker room, or during staff reunion night on Sky News After Dark. I’ve already pointed out in some detail that Abbott is actually the primary architect of the problem Turnbull is now trying to fix in energy policy. Abbott scrapped the investment mechanism which was legislated to drive orderly transformation in the energy sector and the economy, and left in place the pull-forward mechanism for renewable energy investment, albeit with a lower target. If investment in energy infrastructure is now lopsided, as Abbott contends, we can start by interrogating his own clustercuss. Abbott also agreed Australia would sign up to the Paris international climate accord, which is one of the reasons Australia needs renewable technologies to generate low-emissions electricity. Cause, meet effect. In September 2015, Abbott certainly sounded like he meant to sign up, that this wasn’t some random accident: “Unlike some other countries which make these pledges and don’t deliver, Australia does deliver when we make a pledge.” These are just facts. They are inconvenient facts for Abbott now, which is why he fudges and disavows them, and blames others – but facts they remain. Having reviewed the Abbott record, and noted a gap between present statements and past actions, now let’s consider conviction. Abbott’s behaviour would still be muddle-headed, vengeful, negative and destructive, regardless of his motives – but the most disconcerting thing, from my perch, appears to be the lack of intrinsic values behind the pugilism and the flip-flops. Unburdening himself in Ray’s locker room on Tuesday, Abbott told the 2GB host the government needed to drop the clean energy target, obviously, to make coal great again, that being the preferred virtue-signalling du jour of the reactionary right, which is otherwise completely post-materialist – but also to create a partisan point of difference with Labor at the next election. Let that last point just settle on your mind for a moment. It might take a moment to absorb the vacancy of that statement, because if you absorb its true meaning, you grasp that the person making it is in pure expediency territory. If you are a political leader, you can drop the clean energy target because it is third or fourth worst policy (which is my own view). You certainly can drop it because you’ve got a better idea, and you’ve got a hope of getting your better idea through the parliament. You can certainly shape your policies to work with the politics of the day. But to say let’s drop it to win the next election means you need to be prepared to forget what the country needs, forget what the chief scientist recommends, forget the fact business is now becoming desperate for certainty, forget the fact voters think politics is little better than a stinking carcass – you need to be in a headspace where cheap intra-day political argument triumphs over everything. Forget the substance. More about the wedge. More about me. Onwards, to self-indulgence, to the great unreason, to policy oblivion.

Parker, the creator of Napster and an early president of Facebook, took a shot at Silicon Valley when he was asked about tech entrepreneurs who may still believe that social networks are one of the most potent forces for positive change in the world. They are guilty “of a level of naïveté”, he told a conference on social justice and activism in New York organized by Global Citizen, a nonprofit focused on ending extreme poverty. “If you’ve made a few billion dollars from your startup you are entitled to be a bit arrogant, but it turns out maybe you are better at getting 14-year-old girls to put on things than you are at fomenting revolution,” he said. He added that social media has “splintered” the traditional ways of organizing movements and connecting people. “The social fabric of the world is changing because of social media. We have to rebuild it to get things done. We are living in perilous times, populism, nativism, is not necessarily left or right, it’s mob rule and it almost inevitably leads to tyranny. This is not the normal ebb and flow, something much darker and more frightening is afoot,” Parker said. Parker told Global Citizen co-founder Hugh Evans, in a discussion panel at the event held at New York University on Tuesday, that many activist groups were mobilizing online these days, but: “We have got to get this online group-forming behavior to translate into the offline world.” Parker has been spending more time in Washington DC in recent times, especially since he became more active in the cause of civic engagement, via his startup app Brigade and now his philanthropic foundation. He called on people to “target members of Congress” through phone calls and even personal visits to the US Capitol to press their causes, which he prioritized as keeping the US engaged in the United Nations and Nato. “If the US withdraws, other nations will follow,” he said. Parker was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in the 2010 feature film about the founding of Facebook, The Social Network. Global Citizen Week is a series of events and concerts intended to coincide with the United Nations annual convening of leaders in New York. Tuesday’s event, in which the Guardian was a partner, was titled Movement Makers and focused on the the most effective ways to mobilize grassroots activism and combat the rise of extremism. Echoing Sean Parker, in another panel on creating activist movements, California Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee, who was a volunteer with the Black Panther party in Oakland in her youth, said social media can be “dehumanizing”. “In the 60s and 70s we didn’t have social media, of course, we got to know each other face to face and had conversations and debates that way – we have to become more interactive on the human level as the best way of reducing biases and tension,” she said. Fellow panel member Bob Bland, one of the founders of the Women’s March on Washington, which took place in January 2017, the day after Trump was inaugurated as president, said that real-life interaction was essential, but that the internet had been crucial in getting the idea for the march off the ground so quickly and effectively. “You can have an idea and find out immediately who has the same idea even if they are thousands of miles away,” she said. She said that, even though in just a few weeks the concept of the Women’s March spawned 673 “sister” marches around the world, “it was a moment, an action”, not an overnight movement and was built on the foundations of movements such as Occupy and Black Lives Matter. Lois Beckett, a senior reporter at the Guardian, moderated a panel on reducing extremism, and has written about the common ground inhabited by some extremists at opposite ends of the political or religious spectrum. Panelists agreed that young people with a wide variety of individual grievances, whether they are highly formally educated or not, can be all too susceptible to extremist propaganda promulgated online. Theo Wilson, an arts activist who, as an African American, posed as a white supremacist online in order to have conversations with neo-Nazis, said that he was shocked to see how vulnerable or unhappy people, especially those who feel marginalized or excluded, are so easily influenced by messages of hate online. “I realized: there but for the grace of God go I. If I had come out of a mother of a different color and had some of those common grievances, I might have become radicalized,” he said. He said it was vital for the history of racial politics to be fully and accurately taught in US schools. “If you don’t find out about your roots, these white supremacists will find them for you,” he said. Muslim activist and author Yassmin Abdel-Magied said that she kept encountering situations where those who are the targets of hate speech are expected not only to cope with that gracefully but also to educate those expressing racist views at them. “I have to go out into the world every day and be an ambassador … it’s exhausting,” she said. She called for the positive forces of the education system, the internet, individual activism and grassroots activism all to play their part in reversing the divisions now rending US society."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/10/american-trucker-automation-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T11:00:46Z","webTitle":"End of the road: will automation put an end to the American trucker?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/10/american-trucker-automation-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/10/american-trucker-automation-jobs","fields":{"headline":"End of the road: will automation put an end to the American trucker?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeff Baxter’s sunflower-yellow Kenworth truck shines as bright and almost as big as the sun. Four men clean the glistening cab in the hangar-like truck wash at Iowa 80, the world’s largest truck stop. Baxter has made a pitstop at Iowa 80 before picking up a 116ft-long wind turbine blade that he’s driving down to Texas, 900 miles away. Baxter, 48, is one of the 1.8 million Americans, mainly men, who drive heavy trucks for a living, the single most common job in many US states. Driving is one of the biggest occupations in the world. Another 1.7 million people drive taxis, buses and delivery vehicles in the US alone. But for how long? Having “disrupted” industries including manufacturing, music, journalism and retail, Silicon Valley has its eyes on trucking. Google, Uber, Tesla and the major truck manufacturers are looking to a future in which people like Baxter will be replaced – or at the very least downgraded to co-pilots – by automated vehicles that will save billions but will cost millions of jobs. It will be one of the biggest changes to the jobs market since the invention of the automated loom – challenging the livelihoods of millions across the world. “I’m scared to death of that,” says Baxter, an impish man with bad teeth that he hides behind his hand as he laughs. “I can’t operate a pocket calculator!” But Baxter is in the minority. Iowa 80 is a great place to check the pulse of the trucking community. Interstate 80 – the second longest in the country – runs from downtown San Francisco to the edge of New York City. The truck stop, about 40 miles east of Iowa City, serves 5,000 customers each day, offering everything they could need from shops and restaurants to a cinema, chiropractor, dentist, barber and a chapel. Every week, a major tech company seems to announce some new development in automated trucking. Next month, the Tesla founder, Elon Musk, will unveil an electric-powered semi that is likely to be semi-autonomous. But most of the truckers I spoke to were not concerned by the rise of the robots. “I don’t think a robot could do my job,” says Ray Rodriguez, 38, who has driven up a batch of cars from Tennessee. “Twenty years from now, maybe.” Nor do the managers of the Iowa 80 see their jobs changing any time soon. “The infrastructure just isn’t there,” says Heather DeBaillie, marketing manager of Iowa 80. Nor does she think that people are ready for autonomous trucks. “Think about the airplane. They could automate an airplane now. So why don’t they have airplanes without pilots?” She also argues that the politics of laying off so many people will not pass muster in Washington. The family-run Iowa 80 has been serving truckers for 53 years, and is so confident about its future that it is expanding to secure its claim to being the world’s biggest truck stop, adding more restaurants and shopping space to the “Disneyland of truckers”. But not everyone is so confident that truck stops will survive the age of the algorithm. Finn Murphy, author of The Long Haul, the story of his life as a long-distance truck driver, says the days of the truck driver as we know him are coming to an end. Trucking is a $700bn industry, in which a third of costs go to compensating drivers, and, he says, if the tech firms can grab a slice of that, they will. “The only human beings left in the modern supply chain are truck drivers. If you go to a modern warehouse now, say Amazon or Walmart, the trucks are unloaded by machines, the trucks are loaded by machines, they are put into the warehouse by machines. Then there is a guy, probably making $10 an hour, with a load of screens watching these machines. Then what you have is a truckers’ lounge with 20 or 30 guys standing around getting paid. And that drives the supply chain people nuts,” he says. The goal, he believes, is to get rid of the drivers and “have ultimate efficiency”. “I think this is imminent. Five years or so. This is a space race – the race to get the first driverless vehicle that is viable,” says Murphy. “My fellow drivers don’t appear to be particularly concerned about this. They think it’s way off into the future. All the people I have talked to on this book tour, nobody thinks this is imminent except for me. Me and Elon Musk, I guess.” The future is coming. Arguably it is already here. Several states have already laid the groundwork for a future with fewer truckers. California, Florida, Michigan and Utah have passed laws allowing trucks to drive autonomously in “platoons”, where two or more big rigs drive together and synchronize their movements. The stage has been set for a battle between the forces of labor and the tech titans. In July, the powerful Teamsters union successfully pushed Congress to slow legislation for states looking to broaden the use of autonomous vehicles. After arm-twisting by the union, the US House of Representatives energy and commerce committee exempted vehicles over 10,000lb from new rules meant to speed the development of autonomous cars. Many truckers came into the industry after being displaced by automation in other industries, and the transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has said she is “very concerned” about the impact of self-driving cars on US jobs. But Ryan Petersen sees the Teamsters’ move as a speed bump at best. Petersen, the founder of Flexport, a tech-savvy freight logistics company, says fully operational self-driving trucks will start replacing jobs within the next year, and will probably become commonplace within 10. “Labor accounts for 75% of the cost of transporting shipments by truck, so adopters can begin to realize those savings. Beyond that, while truckers are prohibited from driving more than 11 hours per day without taking an eight-hour break, a driverless truck can drive for the entire day. This effectively doubles the output of the trucking network at a quarter of the cost. That’s an eight-times increase in productivity, without taking into account other benefits gained by automation,” he says. Larger trucks making highway trips, like those occupying the 900-truck parking spots at Iowa 90, are the lowest-hanging fruit and will be automated first, Petersen says. Last year, Otto, a self-driving truck company owned by Uber, successfully delivered 45,000 cans of Budweiser in a truck that drove the 130-odd miles from Fort Collins, Colorado, to Colorado Springs. A semi-automated platoon of trucks crossed Europe last year in an experiment coordinated by DAF, Daimler, Iveco, MAN, Scania and Volvo. But the automation that seems to most concern drivers at Iowa 80 concerns their log books. Truck firms are shifting drivers over to computerized logs – and they hate it. The new system adds another layer of oversight to an industry that is already heavily regulated, and will limit where and when drivers can stop. A driver looking to add an extra 30 minutes to his ride in order to make it to the truck stop rather than rest up in a layby might find that option gone, under a system that is centrally controlled rather than filled in by him in the log books that occupy a long shelf in Iowa 80’s giant trucker store. The trucker holds a special place in American mythology: sometimes a symbol of freedom and the open road, sometimes a threat. Truckers entered popular culture from all directions, from the existential horror of Spielberg’s Duel, to Convoy, the bizarre trucker protest song that became a global hit and introduced the world to CB radio slang – “Let them truckers roll, 10-4!” In the 1970s, Hollywood’s he-men wanted to be truckers: Kris Kristofferson in Convoy, inspired by the song; Burt Reynolds CB-slanging his way through Smokey and the Bandit I and II. Thelma and Louise took their revenge on a cat-calling trucker in 1991. Hollywood, presciently, had a cyborg drive a big rig in Terminator 2, and went full robot with Optimus Prime in the Transformers franchise. At the turn of the 21st century, the ever nostalgic hipsters’ love of trucker hats and T-shirts revived America’s fetishization of the long-distance driver. But it’s a nostalgia out of sync with a reality of declining wages, thanks in part to declining union powers, restricted freedoms, and a job under mortal threat from technology, says Murphy. Truckers made an average of $38,618 a year in 1980. If wages had just kept pace with inflation, that would be over $114,722 today – but last year the average wage was $41,340. “The myth is that the long-haul truck driver is the cultural evolution of the free-range cowboy from the 19th century,” says Murphy. “In fact, trucking is one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Every move the trucker makes is tracked by a computer. We have logs we need to keep every time we stop, pull over, take a leak. The truck’s speed, braking, acceleration is all recorded. This is not a cowboy on the open range. This is more like 1984 than 1894.” Douglas Barry has been driving trucks since 1990. A wiry firecracker of a man, Barry says those pushing for automation are failing to see the bigger picture. The general public is just not ready to see 80,000lb of 18-wheeler flying down the highway with no one at the wheel. “That big old rig could blow sky-high, slam into a school. It needs a human being. There isn’t a machine that can equal a human being,” he says. “Artificial intelligence can be hacked ... Who is ready for that? I wouldn’t want my family going down the road next to a truck that’s computer-operated.” He says the involvement of the tech companies has stopped people from looking for more holistic solutions to transportation problems. The answer is better roads, more delivery points for trains, streamlining the supply system – not just looking for ways of cutting manpower. “A lot of these people at Google and so forth are very intelligent. But in a lot of ways they are out of touch with reality,” Barry says. Yet computers don’t get tired, don’t drink or take drugs, and don’t get distracted or get road rage. Murphy, the author, says the argument that people are better than machines will not hold for long – especially as more and more people get used to autonomous cars. “The assumption is that we are living in some kind of driver utopia now and machines are going to destroy that,” he says. “The fact is that we have 41,000 highway deaths in America every year. If we piled those bodies up, that would be a public health crisis. But we are so used to the 41,000 deaths that we don’t even think about it.” Virtually all those deaths are from driver error, he says. “What if we took that number down to 200? Here’s how it looks to me. Thirty years from now my grandchildren are going to say to me: ‘You people had pedals on machines that you slowed down and sped up with? You had a wheel to turn it? And everybody had their own? And you were killing 41,000 people a year? You people were savages!’ “They are going to look at driver-operated vehicles the way people now look at a pregnant woman smoking,” he says. “It’ll be the absolute epitome of barbarism.” It will also be a change in the workplace of historic proportions. “I watch a lot of Star Trek,” says Baxter, as he prepares to get back on the road. “The inventions of an innovative mind can accomplish a lot of things. I just don’t want to see automated trucks coming down the road in my lifetime.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/20/for-love-money-review-northern-broadsides-barrie-rutter-viaduct-halifax-blake-morrison","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T14:20:57Z","webTitle":"For Love or Money review – Northern Broadsides strike comedy gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/20/for-love-money-review-northern-broadsides-barrie-rutter-viaduct-halifax-blake-morrison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/20/for-love-money-review-northern-broadsides-barrie-rutter-viaduct-halifax-blake-morrison","fields":{"headline":"For Love or Money review – Northern Broadsides strike comedy gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Northern Broadsides have made a habit of giving European classics a Yorkshire setting. So it seems fitting that Barrie Rutter’s farewell, at least on home soil, to the company he founded should be a version by Blake Morrison of Alain-René Lesage’s Turcaret. Even if Morrison’s adaptation is unlikely to cause the offence that the original did in France in 1709, it remains a lively satire on capitalist corruption. Morrison shifts the action from Louis XIV’s Paris to a Yorkshire town in the 1920s, but the characters are still propelled by greed. Rose, a young war widow, milks a besotted bank manager, Algy, for all she can while herself being conned by a money-grubbing cousin. But loot is to this play what sex is to La Ronde, in that it forms an endless daisy chain. Just as the supposedly upright banker is guilty of embezzlement, so the cozening cousin has a fly servant who is also out to line his pockets. Virtually the only honest character is Rose’s housekeeper who is promptly dismissed for her plain speaking. It seems a touch harsh to single out 1920s Yorkshire as uniquely covetous and there are times when you feel that Morrison may be too much in thrall to his source: I couldn’t believe he invented a duff scene where an antiques dealer tries to take advantage of Rose’s hardship. But the play works because, in the honourable tradition of Jonson or Molière, it uses farce to point up human fallibility. Morrison’s text also has a constant verbal vivacity – so that Algy’s claim that he runs “a tight ship” is spoonerishly inverted to “a shite tip” – and makes rich use of Yorkshire dialect in which “a cup of tea” becomes “chatter-watter”. Rutter directs and, by having characters introduce themselves with a 20s dance, suggests we are watching a piece of poison-tipped frivolity. Sarah-Jane Potts as the pageboy-haired Rose hits the right note of demure calculation and both Jordan Metcalfe as a wily servant and Kat Rose-Martin as his cleaner girlfriend, whom he introduces as “the best scrubber in town”, make a decisive mark. Rutter himself is also excellent as the bumptious bank manager who is bent as a hairpin. When he claims “I was trained in London – they taught me everything I know,” the actor half turns to the audience as if to get his own revenge on the arts apparatchiks who have denied him the funding he desperately needs. • At West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, from 26 to 30 September.

But it appears even more pointless for pumpkin toadlets after scientists discovered that females have lost the ability to hear the sound of male mating calls. An international team from Brazil, Denmark and the UK has discovered that the males of two species of tiny orange frogs continue to make high-pitched calls despite neither females nor males being able to hear them. It is believed to be the first case in the animal kingdom of a communication signal enduring even after its target audience has lost the ability to detect it. Field studies began in Brazil’s Atlantic forest by playing frog calls to determine how these species, which possess a middle ear, could hear their own calls. Lead researcher Dr Sandra Goutte at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, São Paulo, was surprised to find the frogs refused to respond to her playback communication, didn’t change their calling behaviour and didn’t even orient themselves towards the sounds. “I thought I would find the sound transmission pathway from the outside to the middle ear,” she said. “We didn’t think it would be possible that they would not be able to hear their own calls.” Laboratory tests of the frogs’ hearing abilities were then undertaken by Associate Professor Jakob Christensen-Dalsgaard at University of Southern Denmark. Tiny electrodes were attached to the frog’s nostril and under skin by its ear to measure its hearing sensitivity, in much the same way as human hearing is tested. Christensen-Dalsgaard’s findings were confirmed by anatomical studies at Cambridge University, which revealed that the part of the ear responsible for high-frequency hearing is vestigial in these species. Scientists would expect that if a communication signal is not perceived then it would rapidly be lost through evolution. Goutte, who is now based in Paris and studies the evolution of communication systems in frogs, said: “I guess they have lost the ability to hear the calls quite recently. The call is quite soft so maybe it has already decreased in function.” Such calls to attract the opposite sex could not only be pointless but costly if they attracted predators or parasites. According to Goutte, though, the brightly-coloured pumpkin toadlets are highly toxic and have no known predators. But although their futile calling poses no apparent predation risk, it still uses energy and time. Goutte believes that the calling continues because it may actually be a visual signal. “The predation risk is low but they are expending energy so we think maybe the behaviour is kept because of a visual signal, with the movement of the throat.” The frogs are diurnal and are known to use other visual signals: when threatened, they wave their arms and gape with their mouths. If the movement of the throat is a mating signal then the call itself might represent a byproduct of the true signalling behaviour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/sep/21/love-hate-public-art-sculpture-whiteread-council-funding-controversy","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T06:09:26Z","webTitle":"Love it, hate it - or just don't get it: share your pictures of public art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/sep/21/love-hate-public-art-sculpture-whiteread-council-funding-controversy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/sep/21/love-hate-public-art-sculpture-whiteread-council-funding-controversy","fields":{"headline":"Love it, hate it - or just don't get it: share your pictures of public art","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Turner prize winner Rachel Whiteread is not a fan of ‘plop art’: public sculptures plonked somewhere in an apparently random and inconspicuous fashion. “Art has gotten extremely popular, which is great for many reasons but I think a lot of public sculpture is ill-thought-out and put in places it shouldn’t necessarily be. It then becomes something that is sort of invisible,” the artist said, speaking ahead of a major retrospective of her work at Tate Britain. She added that London was “completely full of sculptures which no one bears a blind bit of attention to” – although she declined to name the offending pieces. Then there are the public artworks that people most certainly do pay attention to. Unremarkable is not a word you’d use to describe Bradford’s droid Baby of the North sculpture, for example - or the big blue cock Katharina Fritsch installed on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square. Meanwhile bemusement and wonder has greeted the giant Sean Henry sculptures in Woking town centre, put there in the summer by the Lightbox gallery and museum to pique interest in an exhibition of the artist’s work.

According to the latest report on gender indicators, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) this week, women spend, on average, two hours and 52 minutes of their day on domestic work and 59 minutes on childcare. In contrast, men spend one hour and 37 minutes on domestic work and 22 minutes on childcare. In May, this concept of women undertaking the bulk of household work – not just in doing menial chores but in organising and effectively managing the home – was the subject of a viral illustration by the French comic book artist Emma. The pattern begins early: according to the ABS, 95% of non-public sector employees who took parental leave as the primary carer in 2014-15 were women. Men made up 96% of the employees who took secondary parental leave. The report notes “primary parental leave is the type of leave most likely to affect people’s career trajectories”. Men in managerial positions were more likely to take paternity leave than those on a lower rung, particularly if they happened to work in the finance or insurance industry. Women in the mining industry had the highest uptake of maternity leave, while retail workers had the lowest. Seniority was also a factor in women taking maternity leave: one in 15 female managers accessed some form of parental leave in 2015-16 compared with one in 25 non-managers. In total, 84,886 women and 33,306 men took some form of parental leave in 2015-16. Single mothers were the least likely of all parents with dependent children to have a casual job, meaning they had no paid leave entitlements. Twenty-six per cent of single mothers had no leave entitlements, compared with 21% of single dads, 19% of coupled mothers and 17% of coupled fathers. Women aged 24 to 44, the age where they are most likely to have dependent children at home, are 2.5 times more likely to be out of the workforce than men of the same age. The gap is widest between the ages of 30 and 34. The outcome of this and other employment gaps is a 56% difference in superannuation upon retirement. The average super balance of men aged 55 to 64 in 2013-14 was $321,993, compared with $180,013 for women of the same age. Women earned $0.89 in the dollar to men, an average wage gap that has been steady for a decade. The median wage gap was slightly smaller, with the median wage for women returning $0.92 in the dollar to the median wage for men. This was true even in when men and women had achieved the same qualification in the same field. The starting salary for female undergraduates with a bachelor degree in the architecture and building field was $50,000, compared to $59,000 for male undergraduates. The gap evened out for engineers. Women made up less than 1% of all engineering graduates but they earned an average starting salary of $62,300, only marginally behind the average starting salary for men of $62,600. Across all fields, the gap in starting salaries was 6%, with male graduates starting on $60,000 and females on $56,400. Women were in general more educated. Forty per cent of women aged in their late 20s had a bachelor degree or above, compared to 31% of men. Of university educated women, 28% had a qualification in business, management, or commerce. The most common university degree for men was engineering, which accounted for 30% of male graduates. Women were three times more likely to have qualifications in a health field and 4% more likely to have education qualifications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/sep/20/county-cricket-middlesex-v-lancashire-surrey-v-somerset-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T17:31:11Z","webTitle":"Middlesex and Lancashire thriller nears climax as Sangakkara scores eighth century","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/sep/20/county-cricket-middlesex-v-lancashire-surrey-v-somerset-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/sep/20/county-cricket-middlesex-v-lancashire-surrey-v-somerset-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Middlesex and Lancashire thriller nears climax as Sangakkara scores eighth century","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At this stage of the summer every day is a defining day but Thursday looks gargantuan, and thrilling: there will be a result at Lord’s, and Middlesex will have been mighty careless if they are on the wrong end of it. Across London, thanks to Kumar Sangakkara’s eighth Championship century of a special summer, Surrey have Somerset, Middlesex’s opponents next week, on the back foot, 59 ahead in their first innings with four wickets still remaining. In NW8, after 15 day-one wickets, 16 followed on the second. To win, Middlesex need nine more, but Lancashire need only 175 runs, and have the batting to do it. Middlesex are without Toby Roland‑Jones, who will take no further part in the match due to a back injury. Following an inconclusive scan, he batted in their second innings and will undergo further tests on Thursday – no doubt with England hovering – but the injury is not considered serious. Given 50 minutes to bowl on the second evening, Middlesex missed him badly and, despite Steven Finn trapping Alex Davies lbw, were poor, with boundary balls aplenty. Even such a helpful surface as this cannot do all the work for them. It is certainly misbehaving. Before lunch, a ball spat up and pinned Stevie Eskinazi on the hand. After an early tea, every second ball – like the one that trapped James Harris in front – seemed to be staying low. Middlesex’s approach, reasonably enough, was to shelve timidity. That saw Sam Robson out hooking and John Simpson caught at cover, both brilliantly taken by Kyle Jarvis off Tom Bailey, who ended with five in each innings and figures of 10 for 98. He had never taken more than six in a match before. His style, demanding a stroke and nagging of length, was just what was required. Middlesex were 68 ahead on first innings, having bowled well to pick up the final five Lancashire wickets in 90 minutes on the second morning. Tim Murtagh had Steven Croft, swinging, and Jordan Clark, prodding a lifter, caught behind, then Bailey was taken at second slip off James Harris. Ollie Rayner finished things off, thanks partly to a superb diving catch at mid-on from Finn to dismiss Ryan McLaren. Robson and Simpson’s efforts saw a lead of 68 become a very testing target of 221, even though they lost their last six for 37. Skittled for 76 by Hampshire, for whom Kyle Abbott took six for 20, and forced to follow on 178 behind, Essex then showed the mettle of champions, reaching stumps 30 in front for the loss of their top three. The impressive Dan Lawrence, 20, has 78. Yorkshire are in the mire at Headingley but lead Warwickshire, who are one down in their second innings, by 28 runs. Yorkshire, though, may yet rue being bowled out for 296, four shy of a vital third batting point. So to SE11, where Sangakkara’s final appearance at The Oval – he insists, frustratingly, that he must retire – yielded yet another century; in only 13 innings, he now has one against every Championship team he has played against this summer, and only Hampshire have been spared his brilliance. His closest challenger in the Division One charts is Mark Stoneman, who passed 1,000 Championship runs for the fifth successive season in the course of his 51. He is a mere 350 runs behind, and has half as many tons. His efforts, particularly in sharing 109 with Ollie Pope (who is two decades younger and made 50), put Surrey 59 ahead with four first-innings wickets in hand. He now has the chance to bat Somerset out of the game, and Middlesex, against whom he scored twin tons at Lord’s, will have an eye on his progress. A pivotal day also awaits in Division Two. Rory Kleinveldt has 11 of the 12 Nottinghamshire wickets to fall (including nine for 65 in the first innings), and Northamptonshire are on the verge of an upset that would throw open the promotion race. Notts were bowled out for 151 by Kleinveldt, and trailed by 43 on first innings, which became a target of 314 after a 93-ball century from Richard Levi (not to mention a hard-hitting 48 from Kleinveldt, who had made 43 in the first innings). By stumps, the meaty South African had bowled Steven Mullaney and had Billy Root caught in the gully. Notts need 281 more. Well, then. Tomorrow is a big day in the Championship. Can Middlesex skittle Lancashire? Can Northants do the same to Notts? Division One: Lancashire 165 &amp; 46-1 v Middlesex 233 &amp; 152 Surrey 328-6 v Somerset 269 Warwickshire 219 &amp; 49-1 v Yorkshire 296 Essex 76 &amp; 208-3 v Hampshire 254 Division Two: Notts 151 &amp; 33-2 v Northants 194 &amp; 270 Gloucestershire 161-1 v Glamorgan 442 Durham 321-6 v Sussex 346 No play yet between Derbyshire and Kent Speak in the morning, bright and early! That’ll be stumps, I’m sure. Thrilling final day awaits. Still five overs to go here, but the umpires conferring ... and off we go. Lancashire 46 for one, needing 175 to win. Middlesex very poor this evening. Stumps at Trent Bridge too, where Notts are 33 for two chasing 281, and Rory Kleinvedlt has 11 wickets to go with 91 runs in the match. And stumps at the Ageas, where Essex are effectively 30 for three. Stumps at the Oval. Surrey lead by 59, four down. Sangakkara still there. Wicket! Lancashire one down! Davies gone for one, to Finn. Roland-Jones’s scan has proved inconclusive. He will have more tests tomorrow and won’t play any further part in this game. Murtagh bowling poorly here, and Lancashire are 17 for noine, with three nice off-side boundaries from Hameed. Every team he has played against, he has a ton against. Mad. 14 overs left here. And they are back on at the Oval too. The sun has poked through again. Surely we are coming back out. Notts two down! And it’s Kleinveldt again! Stumps at Headingley, where Warwickshire are one down (Sibley) and 28 behind. Off at the Oval too. Surrey 317 for six, lead by 48. So, off at Lord’s for bad light. Suits both sides, I’d say. Last thing Middlesex want is to waste the new ball using the wrong bowlers. Last thing Lancashire want to do is lose one while it’s gloomy. Scurran out! He’s nicked to first slip cutting. 317 for six, and a second bowling point for Somerset. Trego with his third. And we are off! Having a look at the light here... Off for bad light at the Ageas! Essex, following on, lead by 30 with seven wickets in hand. Here we go then. It’s a bit dark, and Lancashire need 221 to win. Murtagh to Davies. After moving to 99 with a straight drive, Sanga sits there for an age. Meanwhile, Scurran is smashing boundaries. And there he is! Makes it with a cut for four. 165 balls, 15 fours and a six. That’s his eighth of the summer! 21 overs remain tonight, theoretically. Murtagh’s hilarious cameo comes to an end as he’s bowled by Jarvis. Another 15 wicket day already. Lancashire need 221 to win, and that will be very tough, I reckon. Wicket! Ten-fer for Tom Bailey! Rayner is lbw for five. Well bowled that man. 147 for nine, lead still 215. Wicket! Rojo nails Jarvis straight to cover! Eight down, the lead is 215. Duckett absent injured so at 270 for nine, Northants are all out. Notts need 314 to win. Great effort from Northants. Sanga on to 97... Northants seven down, leading by 308... Kleinveldt gone for 48. Sanga into the 90s with a five! Ollie Robinson is bowling spin again! I remember well when he swapped mid-over here at Lord’s two years ago. My hunch here is that Middlesex might as well not muck about. The ball is up and down, and the target is already over 200. Might as well dart as many more as they can rather than waiting for the ball with their name on it. Pope made 50, but he’s out. Caught behind off Tim Groenewald! 278 for five, and a lead of 9. Sanga has 88. Essex lead! 130 for seven now. Jarvis has Harris lbw with a scooter. Didn’t get above ankle height. Wicket! Simpson was just starting to tick, but he’s slapped Bailey to cover, where Jarvis has taken another cracking catch. 130 for six, lead is 198. Here comes Rojo! Surrey lead by 5! 50 for Dan Lawrence! 164 for three following on are Essex, and they trail by 14. And the new ball has been taken. Ollie Pope has 42. Sanga has 86. New balls due at the Oval with Surrey one behind. Levi is out! He made 115 off 104 but has been bowled by Hutton! Northants five down, lead by 250. Sanga has 83... Yorkshire all out for 296! Is that a big batting point to miss? They lead by 77. Bailey, by the way, has eight wickets. What a catch! Robson had played very nicely for 58, but has gone hooking. Diving catch from Jarvis at deep backward-square. Middlesex are 115 for five, lead of 183. Very well placed I reckon. Bit of an audacious shot from Robson but reckon he’s already thinking that there’s a ball with his name on it. Scenes. All run four for Simpson. 108 for four. Starting again shortly at the Oval too. 50 for Sam Robson! Pinched single through the covers. 87 balls, six fours. Yorkshire nine down, 11 short of a third batting point. Players are coming back out! 41 overs left. Middlesex 94 for four. A 92-ball ton for Richard Levi! 14 fours, four sixes. Can play. Lead is 215. Not content with nine wickets, Rory Kleinvedlt has ambled out to bat at No6! Northants’ lead is 206, and Levi is nearing a ton. Off for bad light at the Oval: Surrey 249 for four, 20 behind. Sanga has 77. And off for bad light here too! Robson has 49, and Middlesex are 94 for four. That’s a lead of 162, which I reckon is vast. Northants have lost two in an over to Hitman Hutton! Two Robs, Newton then Keogh. 151 for three, still 194 in front. At tea, Yorkshire are 46 ahead, with two wickets in hand. Northants have moved to 151 for four. Levi has 90, and their lead is 194. Good game for Notts to win from here. Sanga has just nailed Bess down the ground for six. Tea at the Ageas: Essex 118 for three. Lawrence has 37, and they are still 60 behind. Paul McIntyre is confused by Somerset. “Leach and Bess have bowled 8 out of 65 overs in the Surrey innings,” he writes. :Abell is bowling himself rather than his wicket-takers. What is going on out there?!” New ball is nine away, and Surrey are four down just 39 behind. One of the game’s greatest batsman is 59 not out. Probably not the time to be bowling part-timers. So this game continues to move on rapidly. Middlesex are 79 for four, but they lead by 147. Voges just went, caught well by McLaren in the gully. It was McLaren who got Malan too, lbw the first ball after the resumption. 44 overs left in the day. Who knows where the game will be? Tea time - be back shortly. Yorkshire lead six down! Bressie getting into the groove. Durham four down suddenly, and still 153 behind. Hearing tea at 2.40 here, with an inspection at 2.55. Might be slightly lighter now than it was 10 ago, but not by much. Westley out! Caught and bowled Dawson ... Essex 81 for three. They are still 97 behind. And they are off for light at the Oval too. Surrey 187 for four, 82 behind. Sanga’s into the 40s... Levi is smashing it, and Northants are 65 for one! That’s a lead of 108, just one down. We are going off for light. Middlesex 54 for two. Bit dark at Lord’s now. Middlesex have had a good half-hour, and lead by 121, two down. Yorkshire have a batting point and are 202 for six, 17 behind. 12 dots to Dan Lawrence, then off the mark with a six. What a guy. 68 for two, 110 behind. Foakes is out! Surrey 169 for four, 100 behind. He’s been caught behind off Trego. Stuck on 50-odd with Sanga, who has 28. That is immensely out. No sooner do I say that (don’t start) and Browne is out! Lbw to Dawson, and Essex are 54 for two. Browne and Westley have 24 each, and Essex are 54 for one, 124 behind. Apparently a big do in Cardiff for this today! Yorkshire are 180 for six ... still 39 behind. Your Surrey stream is here! Paul McIntyre is in my inbox, raising a good point: “Odd that Somerset’s top bowler has yet to feature in the Surrey innings. Is he ill/injured?” It is indeed odd that he hasn’t figured until now ... but here he comes! It might be because Surrey’s top four is all left-handed. He’s on at 144 for three. Stumps were called at Chesterfield a while ago. Sorry I missed that. Shambles. Northants news: Interesting... they are 4 for 1 (Murphy out), and lead by 47. Roland-Jones is going round to the nets for a bat. Yorkshire are 158 for five ... Ballance gone to Jeets! Still 61 behind. Wicket! Eskinazi has been bowled by Bailey, and he has seven, more than he’s ever taken in a match before. 16 for two, leading by 84. Reckon 84 is quite a lot on this deck. Here you go. I’m off for a chat on the radio! Division One: Middlesex 14-1 &amp; 233 v Lancashire 165 Surrey 122-3 v Somerset 269 Essex 76 &amp; 22-1 v Hampshire 246 Yorkshire 153-4 v Warwickshire 219 Division Two: Northants 194 &amp; 2-0 v Nottinghamshire 151 Gloucestershire 12-0 v Glamorgan 442 Durham 120-1 v Sussex 346 No play yet between Enjoy your sarnies! That’s lunch! Middlesex 14 for one, both Eskinazi and Robson have 2. Delay here at Lord’s because Bailey has got a lifter to pin Eskinazi on the hand. He’s getting some treatment. Middlesex are one down! A beauty from Tom Bailey is feathered behind by Compo. 12 for one, lead by 80. My word! What a man. Northants lead by 43 on first innings! Ryan Patel gone at the Oval now! He’s gone to Groenewald and Somerset have two new batsmen at the crease. It’s 114 for three. Burns has had his stumps rearranged by Trego! He made 43. That brings Sanga out. What a way to get off your pair! Pulled for four. Glamorgan 442 all out! Well batted Kiran Carlson. Well here come the Middlesex openers for round two then. 25 minutes til lunch, and they lead by 68. Compo is on a pair. Essex are one down following on. Should they have picked Alastair Cook? Rayner gets Parkinson lbw sweeping and that’s a quality performance from Middlesex this morning. They have a lead of 68. Notts are 130 for nine! And Big Rory has eight for! Very good find... What a catch! Finny has taken a worldie at mid-on to get rid of McLaren. Diving like a six foot seven salmon, he took one low to his left. Rayner the bowler. 161 for nine. Big Rory has seven! Matthew Doherty writes with a very fine point. “I think this Essex team are secret Australians losing the dead rubbers!” he writes! They haven’t lost yet... So the champions are following on at the Ageas. Yorkshire 115 for four! Lyth gone to Big Boyd! And a wicket at the Oval! Trego gets Stoneman for 51, caught behind. A wicket here! Harris gets Bailey edging to second slip. Rayner takes the catch, because that is what he does. 150 for eight. Relegate them! 50 for Mark Stoneman! As per.... Essex are nine down as Wagner goes first ball! Abbott on a hat-trick. Any one know if Essex can be dragged into the relegation battle? Essex are 75 for eight! Five for Kyle Abbott...! Tendo and Harmer gone. Warwickshire have a third! Yorkshire 98 for three as Lees goes to Wright. G-Ballz is in. There was a wicket here! Murtagh got Clark out, another caught behind. Bit of a beauty, just tickled through to Simpson. 123 for seven. I’ll be doing this at lunch. Listen in! So, Roland-Jones update: off for a precautionary scan, won’t bowl today but they are happy for him to bat. He was milling around perfectly happily this morning and isn’t in any great discomfort. Brilliant celebrappeal! This as well Wicket! Dial M for Murtagh! That’s no way to go, and Croft is spewing with himself. Ugly heave at Murtagh and he’s gawn! Caught behind. Well bowled. Morning Stuie! Need three more wickets... The champions are 40 for six! Lawrence gone, bowled by Abbott! Notts have also already lost a wicket! Billy Root. He made 11 before being caught at first gripper off Big Rory. 83 for six. A wicket already at Headingley, but it’s only the nightwatchman Patterson. 62 for two. And here’s confirmation. Bad news for the Middle Saxons. Looks to me like Paul Stirling is fielding in Roland-Jones’s place. There’s the five minute bell! Saggers and Mallender on the way out. Well we are about 12 minutes away from tee off here at Lord’s. No sense of whether we’ll see Rojo from the start yet. No news tends to be good news in this situation. Oh dear, oh dear. Kent might as well head south now and save on hotels for the next two nights. Wednesday, then. The week is half up! Sort of. This round of Championship matches has a run a mere quarter of its course. Again, sort of, because were I a betting man - ACSU, if you’re reading (I know you’re not), I am no betting man - I’d be backing some three day finishes this week. I mean, there were 51 wickets across four Division One games yesterday! Things are moving on fast. I’m Will Macpherson, I’m at Lord’s and I’m here to guide you through these fast-moving things. One of those three day finishes is likely to be here at Lord’s. Lancashire bowled out Middlesex, but not as cheaply as they should have because of Rojo and The Great Ollie Rayner. Middlesex then half bowled Lancashire out. They need to finish that job, but Roland-Jones hobbled off a bit hurt at the end, which has to be a concern. What of elsewhere, I hear you cry? Surrey had the best of things against Somerset at the Oval, which produced the shock of the week with the fall of 10 whole wickets. All of those were Somerset wickets, despite the efforts of Tres and Steve Davies. At Headingley there were 11 more. Yorkshire, you sense, will be looking to bat once, and bat big. Down in Hampshire, Essex have a right job on their hands to keep their unbeaten record. The only game that really matters in Division Two is at Northampton. Notts are in a touch of first innings strife, but Northants only made 194. Bubbling nicely. Up at Durham, Jennings didn’t make it to stumps after Sussex batted pretty well. Luke Wells loves playing them, doesn’t he? Worth saying well done to Kiran Carlson on a ton for Glamorgan against the Glosters, and worth wondering if we will get any play at Chesterfield. Outground cricket in September gets me chuntering. Here’s the scores: Division One: Lancashire 113-5 v Middlesex 233 Surrey 42-0 v Somerset 269 Yorkshire 62-1 v Warwickshire 219 Essex 33-5 v Hampshire 254 Division Two: Nottinghamshire 80-5 v Northants 194 Glamorgan 342-7 v Gloucestershire Durham 8-1 v Sussex 346 No play yet between Derbyshire and Kent Yesterday’s report is here, and I really suggest you read it. You can contact me! Here’s how: Below The Line (play nicely) By email: will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On twitter: @willis_macp I look forward to hearing from you. Let’s finish the season strongly on that front. And all that leaves me to say, as ever, is enjoy the cricket.

(See 3pm.) Phil Hogan, the Irish European commissioner for agriculture, has accused Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, of “behaving and acting and speaking strangely” and of being “completely out of the loop” in relation to UK government Brexit policy. (See 12.05pm.) Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament lead Brexit spokesman, has said the government’s plan to avoid the need for border controls between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit is not workable. On a visit to Belfast he said the government would have to propose a workable solution before Brexit talks could proceed to the next stage, covering the future trade relationship. He also floated the prospect of Northern Ireland staying in the customs union while the rest of the UK left as one possible solution. (See 10.18am.) Diane Dodds, a DUP MEP, said this would be unacceptable. After meeting Verfhofstadt with other DUP figures, Dodds said: We would not countenance and indeed it would be calamitous for the economy in Northern Ireland if there were barriers to trade with our largest partner which is the rest of the United Kingdom. Facebook has conceded that technology companies could do more to counter online extremism after Theresa May and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, proposed fining firms that move too slowly to remove extremist content being shared by terrorist groups. Ukip faces the real prospect of a split or even gradual extinction following a leadership election that could result in the party lurching towards a hard-right brand of populism, senior insiders have warned. Refuse collectors fighting for jobs in following a dispute that has led to piles of rubbish being left in Birmingham streets have won a high court battle. That’s all from me for today. I’m wrapping up early because I have a meeting. Thanks for the comments. Tony Blair has said he thinks there is a 30% chance of Brexit being reversed. He made the assessment in an interview on Bloomberg TV yesterday. Asked what were the chances of Brexit not happening, he replied: It’s really difficult to say. Most people would tell you, and I should say to you I think it is likely it happens. On the other hand, I still have some difficulty seeing how after the general election, which produced a hung parliament in the UK, this government is going to get its form of Brexit through. Because I think there are a lot of Labour MPs who will oppose it, and a lot of Conservative MPs who will oppose a hard Brexit. So there’s maybe, I sometimes say, a roundabout 30% chance that it’s changed. But the truth is a lot will depend on how the debate develops over this year. Darren Murphy, who was one of Blair’s advisers in Downing Street, went even further when speaking at a London event hosted by Dods Group. As PoliticsHome reports, he said he did not think Brexit would happen because he did not think the government had the votes to get it through. George Osborne has been tweeting out a picture of the Evening Standard front page, splashing on the interview with Phil Hogan, the Irish European commissioner for agriculture, denouncing Boris Johnson. (See 12.05pm.) Osborne’s paper has also published an editorial strongly critical of the government’s Brexit policy. Here’s an extract. This week the whole world has been treated to the shambolic spectacle of the cabinet negotiating with itself in public. Britain’s diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York looks like something that Alan Ayckbourn could have written: the dishevelled foreign secretary who gives a press conference trapped in a hotel lift; the prime minister who’d rather have a meeting with Ivanka Trump than with Boris Johnson. The truth is that more than a year after the referendum and the creation of the May government, there is still no agreement on what we are asking the Europeans for — and the arrogant assumption is that once we finally decide among ourselves, the Europeans will give it us. Once again in the Brexit talks it is worth listening to the actual words of the EU. It makes it very clear that if Britain wants a transition agreement after we leave in 2019 — and it is universally agreed across Whitehall that we do — then we will have to accept an existing, off-the-shelf arrangement. If we want to remain trading in the single market and customs union, then we will have to make annual financial contributions, accept free movement of people and acknowledge the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. That is what Mrs May was sensibly shaping up to offer in Florence, until Mr Johnson suddenly realised it would run counter to all the promises he made a year ago. The long-running Birmingham bin strike has been suspended after trade union leaders won a High Court battle over council redundancy notices, the Press Association reports. Unite said it had agreed to call off industrial action by bin workers for the time being, pending a trial later this year. The announcement followed a ruling in London in favour of the union, following a two-day hearing. Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union, brought a court action to block redundancy notices, issued by Labour-controlled Birmingham city council, while the local authority opposed the move. But Mr Justice Fraser granted an interim injunction, pending a trial ruling on the underlying legal dispute over the local authority’s planned waste collection service shake-up. Earlier this week Unite’s members voted strongly in favour of extending almost 12 weeks of strikes until Christmas. The Press Association also says the judge spoke of an “extraordinary” and “astonishing” state of affairs at Birmingham city council in the wake of the dispute over plans to save money by reorganising rubbish collections. Mr Justice Fraser said large amounts of rubbish had accumulated on the streets of Birmingham after refuse collectors took industrial action. He said the dispute had led to the creation of a “schism” between councillors and council officers who, he said, were “positively working against one another” at times. The judge raised concern as he ruled on the latest stage of a High Court fight between the council and leaders of the Unite union which has developed in the wake of reorganisation proposals. He said plans to make binmen redundant should be shelved until the case has been analysed at a trial scheduled for November. Lord Tebbit, the veteran Conservative former party chairman, has told Radio 5 Live that one of the problems the government has on Brexit is that it has not agreed a policy. He said: What is wrong is that there was not an agreed line which had been endorsed at the cabinet, having been fully discussed in a cabinet committee, on what people should be saying. If there is a songsheet, then you expect everyone to sing from it. But if there is not a songsheet, then people sing their own songs. I think that the leadership is not well-organised, that’s the thing. But Tebbit also dismissed the prospect of Boris Johnson taking over from Theresa May any time soon. Does anybody seriously want to overthrow the prime minister - in the Conservative Party that is - and have another period when the leadership is in doubt -- who’s going to get it and all the rest of it? No they don’t. Suppose [Johnson] were to bring down the prime minister, and suppose he were to get into Number 10, what would his position be? He couldn’t demand loyalty from his colleagues. Peter Foster, the Telegraph’s Europe editor, has a good Twitter thread on the the reports that Theresa May will offer the EU at least €20bn. (See 11.12am.) The FT’s Alex Barker set out his €60bn figure for the total “Brexit bill” in this report. John Springford at the Centre for European Reform thinks the UK is being asked to pay between €82bn and €113bn. Guntram Wolff is director of the Bruegel thinktank that has estimated the cost of the “Brexit bill” at somewhere between €25.4bn and €65.1bn. Open Britain, the group campaigning for a “soft” Brexit, has put out this statement about the OECD forecasting low growth in the UK next year. (See 12.08pm.) It is from the Labour MP Wes Streeting and it blames Brexit. The hard Brexit enthusiasts at the heart of government seem determined to reclaim Britain’s title as the ‘sick man of Europe’. A combination of falling real wages, stalled investment and the prospect of new trade barriers between the UK and our largest market, is clearly taking its toll. And at the heart of this is the uncertainty and anxiety caused by the Government’s flawed Brexit strategy. The Prime Minister could begin to address these challenges on Friday, by committing to long-term membership of the single market and customs union. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has also put out his own statement about the figures. McDonnell is relatively pro-Brexit, in Labour terms, and his response did not even mention Brexit. Instead he blamed Conservative economic policies for growth slowing. He said This report exposes Philip Hammond’s failed approach that has resulted in our economy growing slower than our European neighbours, and with the OECD predicting that 2018 looks set to see slow economic growth continue unless the government changes direction. Previously, the OECD has been supportive of the government’s policy but today they reveal that productivity and wages continues to lag, and the report further highlights that despite the economic crash of 10 years ago our economy is still at risk of a bubble in the housing market. Only Labour has a plan to protect working families from rising prices, while providing the serious infrastructure investment our country needs, underpinned by our fiscal credibility rule, to build the high wage, high skill economy of the future for the many not the few. Italy, France and Germany will grow faster than Britain next year as Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on consumer confidence and deter much-needed business investment, according to the latest economic forecasts by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, my colleague Phillip Inman reports. George Osborne, the pro-remain former Tory chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, isn’t fond of Boris Johnson. He has also just appointed a new Brussels correspondent, Sarah Collins. Collins (who on the basis of her understanding of internal newsroom politics is clearly destined to go far) has secured an interview with Phil Hogan, the Irish European commissioner for agriculture and rural development. Happily for all concerned, he’s used it to slag off Johnson. Hogan told the Standard: Clearly, [Johnson] is not directly involved in the negotiations on behalf of the British government with the EU. He certainly has made very strange statements that are completely contradictory, and completely at odds with his own government’s position as well as the possibility of being reasonable with the EU in finalising a deal. So it strikes me that he is completely out of the loop in relation to the type of concrete proposals that are required and that are being considered by the UK government ... Mr Johnson is behaving and acting and speaking strangely. It’s clear that his reputation is not good and he is a diminished figure in the government. Hogan is right about one of Johnson’s claims being at odds with government policy. The Institute for Fiscal Studies explained why yesterday. Hogan also complained that Johnson’s Telegraph article about Brexit last week failed to address the issue of the Irish border. It’s amazing that the UK’s foreign secretary can publish a 4,000-word article about the UK’s Brexit future and not mention the Irish border. You’d think that the foreign secretary would have ideas about how to manage the UK’s main land border with the European Union, but obviously not. And he said it would be worrying if Theresa May is equally vague on the subject of Ireland in her speech on Friday. So if Mrs May is as vague on the three questions as Mr Johnson was in her speech in Florence then the signs will not be good. Theresa May will give a speech to the UN general assembly later, focusing on issues like internet extremism and modern slavery. On Sky’s All Out Politics Lord Malloch-Brown, a former UN deputy secretary general and a foreign office minister in the last Labour government, delivered a withering verdict. Asked what the UN would make of her raising issues like this, he replied: Second tier powers tend to talk about these kind of issues. This is a speech a Norwegian prime minister might give. But we have to cut our suit to our new status ... This is all about trying to find some props for the claim there’s a big British role post Europe. Malloch-Brown also said that increasingly France was being seen as a more important power than the UK at the UN HQ in New York. France and the UK are both permanent members of the UN security council. But “France de facto speaks for that broader European power bloc in the security council going forward,” he said. Here are some of the most interesting stories and comment around this morning about Theresa May’s forthcoming Brexit speech and Boris Johnson’s manoeuvring. George Parker and Alex Barker in the Financial Times (subscription) say Theresa May is willing to pay at least €20bn to the EU during the transition period. Germany’s Angela Merkel has been told by the British government to expect Theresa May this week to offer to fill a post-Brexit EU budget hole of at least €20bn, the first attempt by London to meet European demands to settle its divorce bill. Olly Robbins, the prime minister’s top EU adviser, has contacted his counterparts in several European capitals to reassure them Mrs May’s Friday speech in Florence would include the financial offer, according to officials briefed on the discussions. Mrs May’s team is hoping the offer will break a three-month deadlock in Brexit talks with Brussels and allow them to move to a second phase of negotiations that would open discussions about a future trading relationship between the EU and the UK. UK officials have indicated Britain would ensure no member state would have to pay more into the EU budget or receive less money from it until 2020, the end of EU’s current long-term budget planning period. The expected hole in those two years after Brexit would be at least €20bn when payments the UK receives back from Brussels are excluded. The FT also says May’s initial offer will not be enough. It reports: “We will at least have something to talk about,” said one EU diplomat involved in Brexit. “But it is not where the landing zone is.” Downing Street has described the FT story as “pure speculation” - which is often Whitehall code for “true”. The Daily Telegraph (paywall) says that Johnson may have backed down partly because grassroots Tories were opposed to his antics. There was evidence that Mr Johnson may have been forced to back down after facing a grassroots revolt within his party. Constituency chairmen contacted by The Telegraph accused him of “damaging” the party, with more than half of those spoken to saying his article was wrong or unhelpful. Some described him as an “oaf” or a “buffoon” while others said they wished he would “keep quiet”. Bernard Bateman, chairman of the Skipton and Ripon Conservative Association in North Yorkshire, said that public interventions by ministers over Brexit were “losing us support in the country” ... Chris Howorth, chairman of Mr Hammond’s Runnymede &amp; Weybridge Association in Surrey, said: “There are specific people who are meant to be leading our negotiations. The Telegraph article added to the noise in a way that doesn’t seem particularly helpful.” Only seven out of 24 chairmen who spoke to The Telegraph said they supported Mr Johnson. The Telegraph also says May will say in her speech that she is not planning to turn the UK into a low-regulation tax haven after Brexit. The Telegraph understands that Mrs May’s speech will repeat recent broad assurances to the EU that the UK is not seeking to become a Singapore-style low-regulation tax haven. The payment of around £10 billion a year during the transition period would not settle all of the UK’s accounts in Brussels’ eyes, but would be a gesture of Britain’s commitment to pay its dues, with the intention that the final amount would be negotiated alongside a trade deal. The Times (paywall) says May’s speech will not go into much detail about the final Brexit outcome she would like. Friends of the foreign secretary had suggested that he could quit the cabinet before the end of the week if Mrs May pursued a soft Brexit. The Times understands that her speech will avoid talking in detail about the shape of the final relationship, though, if anything, it is expected to lean more towards Mr Johnson’s vision of a Brexit endpoint. It will concentrate on ensuring that EU-UK trade talks can begin this autumn. One source claimed Mrs May was never wedded to the prospect of a Swiss-style deal and was never likely to spell out the final EU-UK relationship. This left Mr Johnson open to the charge that he had backed down without a meaningful concession. The prime minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who accompanied her to New York, is being credited with pulling the foreign secretary back from resignation. He has been carrying out “shuttle diplomacy” with secretaries of state before the speech. After resignation hints from Mr Johnson’s camp on Monday, Mr Barwell is thought to have intervened. In its inside write-through (paywall), the Times also says that Johnson’s allies claim Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, is mobilising against him. To add spice to this narrative some around Mr Johnson even blame Sir Jeremy for the attack by Sir David Norgrove, head of the UK Statistics Authority, who questioned the renewed use of the £350 million figure that Brexiteers claim would return to Britain after leaving the EU. “It’s got Heywood’s fingerprints all over it,” one ally said. Another said: “Boris is at war with Jeremy Heywood.” Sir Jeremy, Britain’s most senior civil servant, issued a formal denial of his involvement last night. “David Norgrove, as chairman of the National Statistics Authority, is independent of government. The cabinet secretary was not involved in this letter in any way,” a Cabinet Office spokesman said. Robert Peston, ITV’s political editor, says in a Facebook post that he does not think Johnson has been engaged in a covert leadership bid. First, it is not at all obvious that Tory MPs want him to lead them - and he is no longer the darling of the 150,000 mostly older people who are Tory members and will have the final say on who eventually replaces May. Or to put it another way, a leadership battle any time soon would almost certainly see him embarrassed - which he presumably knows. Peston also thinks Johnson could end up resigning because he is not enjoying his job. When I saw him this morning in the lobby of his New York hotel, sweaty after his morning run, he was unwontedly diffident. His normal bombast was not quite there. He had shadows under his eyes. Maybe the burdens and cares of office have caught up with him, implausible as that my seem. He looks like someone who is not enjoying his current life. I cannot shake off the notion that his recent behaviour is that of someone who just wants out - and perhaps even he does not quite know why. Matt Chorley in his Times Red Box morning briefing says there was something familiar about Johnson’s behaviour yesterday. It is party conference season. Boris Johnson’s leader has backed a policy, but unable to resist the lure of publicity, he publicly opposes it. There is a media scrum in which Johnson claims to not know what all the fuss is about. “If I was in charge,” the blond bombsite declared. “I would get rid of Jamie Oliver and tell people to eat what they like.” It was an early prototype of his “have your cake and eat it” philosophy and flew in the face of David Cameron’s praise for the TV chef’s war on Turkey Twizzlers. Back in 2006 Johnson knew how to make news. Having stirred up the row at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth, the junior shadow minister kept a typically low profile by walking straight into the press room, surrounded by a huge crowd of journalists, photographers and TV cameras, before confecting surprise at the hullabaloo: “What is the story?” I was reminded of this pattern – act of rebellion, “accidentally” meeting journalists, claiming to be baffled by a media storm, before falling into line – when I watched the foreign secretary’s behaviour in New York. Tom McTague says in the Politico Europe morning briefing that Johnson has made a significant concession. For all the sound and fury at Johnson for claiming £350 million a week will be available for the U.K. to spend after Brexit, the foreign secretary also used his Telegraph piece to accept the money would only be available ‘once we have settled our accounts’ with the EU. Aides close to Johnson made clear over the weekend that the foreign secretary accepts the idea of continuing payments to the EU during a transition period — a major concession which clears much of the ground in the way of a potential interim deal. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief Brexit spokesman, has dismissed the UK’s post-Brexit proposals for Northern Ireland as unworkable. In interviews at the start of a two-day visit to Northern Ireland and Ireland, he said: For the moment we don’t see a workable solution being put forward by the UK government. Verhofstadt was referring to proposals - dubbed “technology and trust” by some critics - set out in the government’s paper (pdf) about how border controls could operate between Northern Ireland and Ireland after Brexit. Britain, Ireland and the EU all want to avoid the return of a hard border, but if the UK leaves the EU customs unions, some sort of customs controls would be inevitable. Verhofstadt said one solution might be for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union even if the rest of the UK left. But it was up to the UK to come up with an answer to the problem, he said. There are possibilities, for example you could imagine one proposal on the table that Northern Ireland continued to be part of the customs union and even of the single market. The point is it is the UK government that has to come forward with such unique solutions. Since we’re talking about Ireland and Brexit, Fintan O’Toole’s essay in the New York Review of Books, Brexit’s Irish Question, is a brilliant read on this topic. Here’s an excerpt. For at its heart, this is not really a technocratic problem of borders and customs, of tariffs and passports. Running beneath it is a problem of national identity—how it is to be conceived and expressed, how it is to be given political and institutional form. It is not a problem on which the two sides in the negotiations can simply set their masters and mistresses of the arcana and minutiae of the laws of trade. It is a large-scale conceptual clash. To put it bluntly, Ireland has evolved a complex and fluid sense of what it means to have a national identity while England has reverted to a simplistic and static one. This fault line opens a crack into which the whole Brexit project may stumble. Aslef, the train drivers’ union, has announced that it is backing Richard Leonard for next Scottish Labour leader. Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, said: Richard shares our values and we’re proud to support his campaign. He’s a committed trade unionist and recognises that the people of Scotland are hungry for change. I know that under Richard’s leadership, train drivers will have a robust voice in Scotland. Downing Street has tentatively announced the end of the 1% cap on public sector pay increases. Earlier this month it said that the police and prison officers would get pay rises worth more than 1%, but what is going to happen to other public sectors is as yet unresolved, and we are not expecting clarity until the November budget. Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a briefing paper that will strengthen the hand of those saying the cap should be lifted across the board. It is relatively understated (it is headlined “Public sector pay: still time for restraint?”) and it acknowledges that lifting the cap could cost around £6bn a year by the end of the decade. But it does say that retaining the pay cap could harm public services. Here is the IFS summary. Here is the 11-page report (pdf). And here is an extract from the summary. If the government maintains the 1% pay restraint for most or all public sector workers, the difference between public and private sector pay would be likely to fall further. This would likely increase recruitment, retention and motivation problems in the public sector, and risk leading to lower-quality public services. Increases in line with prices (the Consumer Prices Index) or private sector earnings would be likely to mitigate some of these problems. If pay restraint does continue, we might expect the recruitment problems to be particularly severe in areas where the equivalent pay in the private sector is now relatively higher. That is particularly the case for highly educated professionals and those in London and the South East. If these are the areas where recruitment problems are most severe, a government interested in public service quality should target any pay rises towards these areas. And this is from Jonathan Cribb, the IFS senior research economist who wrote the report. The government is considering lifting the public sector pay cap for at least some workers. If it decides to maintain the 1% cap, we should expect increasing difficulties in recruiting, retaining and motivating high quality public sector staff, reducing the quality and quantity of public services. But increasing pay for these workers implies substantial extra costs to public sector employers. The Treasury could provide extra funds for this by raising taxes, cutting other spending or borrowing more. Asking the NHS, for example, to fund higher pay increases from within existing budgets would be very challenging. I will post more from the report later. The Boris Johnson ‘will he, won’t he?’ resignation pantomime seems to have resolved itself, as the Guardian reports this morning, but there is a lot of analysis of that in the papers and I will be taking a look at that later. And, of course, Brexit is going to come up. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research publishes a briefing on financial services. 10am: Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, holds talks with political leaders in Northern Ireland. Later he will visit the border. Theresa May is still in New York. She is giving a speech to the UN general assembly and holding a meeting with tech companies including Google, Microsoft and Facebook, but both of those will after 6pm UK time, which will be out of my time. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary before I wrap up mid-afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Twenty-nine refugees from the ethnic and religious minority face deportation to Vietnam, despite the UN’s refugee agency offering to take the group out of Cambodia and protect them while a permanent third-country resettlement is found. The group faced “almost certain arrest and persecution” upon return, the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN) said, and “the Australian government has an ethical obligation to do everything in its power to stop such action”. Asked on Wednesday about Cambodia’s treatment of refugees in its territory, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, defended his government’s Cambodia arrangement for resettling refugees from the Australian-run offshore detention islands in the south-east Asian country. Twenty-nine of a group of 36 Montagnard refugees in Cambodia have had their claims for protection rejected by the Cambodian government, the APRRN said. But rights groups and the UN’s refugee agency believes the group faces persecution if refouled to Vietnam. “Their case is considered so strong that the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) had previously assisted in brokering a deal that would have seen the group removed from Cambodia in preparation for resettlement to a third country,” APRRN said. “Despite this generous offer, the Cambodian government has denied exit permits and has reaffirmed its intention to return the group to Vietnam.” The UNHCR “at the highest levels, has written to the government of Cambodia, at the highest levels, to request that these individuals be allowed to leave Cambodia”. It remains “hopeful” the request will be accepted. The Montagnard – also known as Degar – ethnic minority are the people indigenous to Vietnam’s central highlands. They face systematic and often violent political and religious persecution at the hands of the state. Over decades, many have fled the country, often over the land border to Cambodia. Vietnam’s treatment of the Montagnard has been condemned on the floor of the Australian parliament. Since 2014, Australia has had a resettlement arrangement with Cambodia, under which refugees from the Australian-run offshore detention islands of Manus and Nauru can choose to be resettled there. The deal has attracted criticism over Cambodia’s poor human rights record and for its disproportionate cost given the protection offered. Australia has given an additional $40m in aid to Cambodia in return for the agreement, and pledged to pay up to $15m in resettlement costs but only seven refugees have chosen to go, and, of those, four have abandoned their protection claims and returned to their countries of origin. But the deal gives Australia influence with the Cambodian government, the APRRN argues, and has urged the Australian government to intervene with Cambodian minister of the interior, Sar Kheng, to halt the imminent deportation of the Montagnard refugees. Evan Jones, programme coordinator at APRRN, said if Cambodia returned the Montagnards to Vietnam it would clearly be in breach of the refugee convention principle of non-refoulement: that refugees must not be returned to danger. Paul Power, the chief executive of the Refugee Council of Australia, said Australia had consistently used Cambodia’s status as a party to the refugee convention to argue in favour of its resettlement deal, “so it must act when Cambodia’s adherence to the refugee convention is clearly under threat”. “The forced return of the Montagnards would not only undermine Cambodia’s reputation for respecting international law but would inflict further damage on Australia’s credibility on refugee protection.” Turnbull confirmed on Wednesday that the Cambodia deal remained current, but that his government continued to seek other “third-country” resettlement options. “We have an arrangement with Cambodia, and we’ll always look at other options … we’ll continue to seek opportunities for resettlement. But I want to be very, very clear that the people on Nauru and in PNG will not be settled in Australia.” Cambodia’s government faces an election next year and the country has been subjected to brutal, occasionally violent, anti-democratic measures, as the prime minister and former Khmer Rouge commander, Hun Sen, seeks to maintain his three-decade-long grip on power. The opposition leader, Kem Sokha, has been charged with treason, independent media have been shut down, and organisations defending human rights attacked or silenced. Asked about Cambodia’s human rights record and whether the country was an appropriate place to send refugees, Turnbull said: “I’m focused on ensuring that we keep our borders secure. We have an arrangement with the US which, as we’ve just described, is seeing a number of people being resettled there. We welcome that and we thank the United States government for their support.” Australia’s other resettlement deal, with the US, accepted its first 50 refugees for resettlement on Wednesday. About 1,600 of the 1,700 refugees on Australia’s offshore islands have expressed an interest in going to the US but it is not known how many more will be accepted or when they might go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/21/un-complaint-parenting-payment-melbourne-cuts-human-rights-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T23:38:05Z","webTitle":"Melbourne woman complains to UN, saying parenting cuts are human rights abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/un-complaint-parenting-payment-melbourne-cuts-human-rights-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/21/un-complaint-parenting-payment-melbourne-cuts-human-rights-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne woman complains to UN, saying parenting cuts are human rights abuse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Melbourne single mother has lodged a complaint with the United Nations, labelling changes to Australia’s parenting payment scheme discrimination and a human rights abuse. Mother-of-three Juanita McLaren and the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children have lodged a complaint, officially known as a communication, with the UN over cuts and changes to the parenting payment. The complaint asks the UN to determine whether Australia has violated its international human rights obligations. Supporters hope the complaint will hold the government accountable for its cuts. The decision to complain to the UN was not made lightly, McLaren said. But she said she could no longer be silent and allow what she called blatant discrimination against single parents, most likely to be women, to go unnoticed. “It is outrageous the way in which my personal agency and financial security was effectively controlled by the government as some sort of punitive measure because I was a single mum,” she said. “I am seen as an unemployed worker before I am seen as a mother and, because my parenting doesn’t have a dollar value, it is seen as completely some sort of lark.” McLaren’s life changed when she was left to raise three children alone. It changed again when changes to the welfare system in 2006 by the Coalition government moved people off the parenting payment when their youngest child turned eight, forcing them on to Newstart. That was compounded by the Labor government decision in 2012 to scrap the grandfather provisions, which saw a further 100,000 people forcibly moved on to Newstart. The differences are stark – McLaren’s payment went from $748.10 per fortnight to $579.30. Where previously she could earn an additional $237.80 during the payments period before her supplement was affected, she could now earn only $104. The gross income threshold was also slashed, from $2,088.85 to $1,576, while she lost the concession card. The cuts were exacerbated by other changes to the welfare scheme, including the scrapping of the schoolkids bonus, freezing the family tax benefit and forcing parents to wait a week between paid work and applying for benefits, which affects those able to obtain only contract work. McLaren was forced to abandon the studies she had almost completed to better secure her long-term future employment and the work she was able to do was hampered by a lack of childcare options. “Why on earth is it eight years old?” McLaren asked, referring to the cutoff point for the parenting payment. “Why not wait until they are in high school? In year 7, when they are a bit more independent? The cutoff date for my youngest turning eight – that was it. “There was no negotiation. They turn eight, you get moved to Newstart, which you have to apply for yourself and then you get $100 less a fortnight. Just because that child was born on that date.” Terese Edwards, the chief executive of the single mothers lobby group, said the move “condemned women who head up a single-parent family to a life of hardship as they contend with housing stress, deprivation, skip meals and forgo medical treatment”. “Denying access to a parenting payment when a single parent’s youngest child turns eight years old is a violation of human rights, as defined by the core United Nations treaties including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,” she said. Edwards said the group – which has found 40% of sole-parent households are living below the poverty line in Australia – had been inundated by distressed mothers who slide into greater financial hardship when they are forced from a modest parenting payment to an unemployment benefit. “This includes women who have escaped domestic violence,” she said. “We know of women who return to place of abuse and to the hands of the abuser because of the lack of assistance.” Australia signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women optional protocol in 2008. Beth Goldblatt, an associate professor at the University Of Technology Sydney’s faculty of law, said lodging a complaint with the UN was an option available to Australian women “if they think their rights under the international convention have been violated”. “This becomes necessary when a person has tried every other means within the country to have their complaint considered,” Goldblatt said. “Juanita argues that single parents, most of whom are women, have consistently had their social security cut by consecutive governments in this country, leaving them and their children to face poverty in a country with the means to support people who are struggling. “She argues that this violates her rights to social security, family benefits and non-discrimination. She can show that the organisations supporting her cause have made representations to parliament and raised the issue on all available platforms without success.” Goldblatt said that because Australia does not have a bill of rights it is not an option to approach the courts over the issue. McLaren said she did not expect a sudden turnaround in attitude from the government – or even a solution. “The government is not going to look at this and say ‘wow you are telling us something we didn’t know’ they know this stuff already,” she said. “If anything, I am hoping it will get [to] women who are so downtrodden or have belief that they do deserve to be treated like this because somehow they are not good enough, or they asked for their circumstances – because you do start to believe that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/20/have-you-been-affected-by-the-earthquake-in-mexico","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T07:00:23Z","webTitle":"Have you been affected by the earthquake in Mexico?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/20/have-you-been-affected-by-the-earthquake-in-mexico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/20/have-you-been-affected-by-the-earthquake-in-mexico","fields":{"headline":"Have you been affected by the earthquake in Mexico?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At least 224 have been killed by a powerful earthquake in central Mexico.

The research – compiled for Guardian Australia by media analysts Isentia Research and Insights – shows Shelton has been mentioned 2,506 times across radio, television, print and online news outlets in the past two weeks. Three prominent yes campaigners – Alex Greenwich, Tiernan Brady and Sally Rugg – have together had 2,052 mentions in the same period. Shelton’s name has been mentioned in broadcast media 1,372 times, in print 76 times and in online news outlets 1,058 times since the high court ruled the postal survey valid on 7 September. Greenwich is likely the most prominent yes campaigner. He was mentioned in broadcast media 714 times, print 12 times and in online news sites 519 times. The data belies the claim that the no campaign is being silenced in the media. The ACL was contacted for comment, but did not respond. A spokesman for the equality campaign said the yes camp, contrary to some perceptions, was the underdog. “We are the underdog in this campaign and always have been,” he said. “We are up against a powerful machine, we’ve always known that. We encourage our supporters, we know we’ve got supporters right across the nation, get out and vote.” The yes campaign had been working hard on the ground, he said, and had run positive inclusive messaging, which sat in stark contrast to the no camp. “We know the overwhelming number of Australians believe in a fair go and that’s why we will continue to run a positive, inclusive campaign, while opponents of equality continue to run daily red herrings, which have nothing to do with marriage,” he said. The data also corroborates a similar analysis, conducted for BuzzFeed News, which found the no campaign’s key messages were in the media four times more than the yes campaign between 10 September and 17 September. Research from an advertising analytics firm suggested opponents of marriage equality had outspent the yes campaign on television advertising five to one in the first weeks of the campaign.

It has been 12 months since South Australia’s state-wide “system black” (AKA blackout) thrust energy politics onto the front page, where it has been a fixture all year. While the network operators gained important experience from the tornado induced blackout, politics and the media embraced the adage “never waste a good crisis”. The Minerals Council embarked on a year-long campaign to sell us so called “high efficiency, low emissions (HELE)” coal technology – poorly named as the expensive plants are not especially efficient and at best only 10-20% less polluting than regular coal power plants (Should we call them “slightly lower intensity, more expensive’, or SLIME for short?). The media has sensationalised every piece of energy news. When Aemo released a report earlier this month explaining that if we don’t take any of the measures we’re already taking, the Victorian grid might, in a high demand scenario, be only 99.99775% reliable (a graph on page of the report indicates “unserved energy” for Victoria this summer of 0.00225%, which translates to 99.99775%), two senior ABC journalists reported “we’re going to have blackouts” and that we have a “very real crisis”. This despite the chair of the Energy Security Board Dr Kerry Schott’s reassurance: “I don’t see it as a crisis.” In retrospect energy minister Josh Frydenberg probably wishes he never commissioned chief scientist professor Alan Finkel to conduct the most wide-ranging review of our power system since the formation of the national electricity market (NEM) in 1998. Despite Finkel’s superhuman efforts to be sensitive to the politics and Frydenberg’s adroit sales job to the Coalition’s “broad church” – I’ve never seen a better PowerPoint deck from an MP – the tribal instincts of the backbench just couldn’t swallow any plan that doesn’t taste like coal. If you hold the Finkel report at arm’s length, you’d be hard pressed to spot the difference between the business as usual (BAU) and the clean energy target (CET) scenarios. Both show a withdrawal of ageing coal capacity over the next 20 years, and both show it being replaced by renewables, simply because renewable energy is now cheaper than both gas and new coal. Had backbenchers read the report, they would have understood Finkel’s very careful argument that the CET provides a mechanism to make the transition at a lower cost and with more stability than BAU. With the Finkel review, the Coalition picked a scab, and the conflict between tribal ideology and reality refuses to let it heal. The festering wound is weeping bad ideas. Propping up decrepit coal power stations is not an answer. WA’s Muja AB coal power station will shut this month, only two years since WA’s Barnett government spent $300m on a refurbishment. A federal lifeline to Liddell would no doubt repeat that colossal waste. Building new coal power in Queensland is not an answer – the state is a net power exporter, has the youngest generation fleet and is building a mass of new renewables capacity. Investing in carbon capture and storage plants is not an answer – there are only two such plants in the world, and they’re both tiny yet horrendously expensive. No energy utility anywhere, including the owners of the two demonstration plants, intends to build another CCS plant. Building new coal (HELE, SLIME or otherwise) is not an answer – the power is too expensive and the emissions are too high. But does it matter that the government is flying like the mythical oozlum bird in ever decreasing circles and that the media is scaring the wits out of half the population? Not as much as you might think – we’ve had silly national debates on energy before, but this time it’s different. Previously, when conservative governments have turned their attention to renewable energy, the whole sector has downed tools, waiting with bated breath for the death sentence. In 2006-7, when prime minister John Howard disregarded the recommendations of the Tambling review, the ensuing uncertainty resulted in the closure of wind turbine factories in Wynyard, Tasmania and Portland, Victoria. If it wasn’t for the Victorian government’s renewable energy targets (VRET), the sector would have packed it in. In 2014 prime minister Tony Abbott did his best to kill the renewables industry by commissioning a review from climate-science denier and former oil-man Dick Warburton. The renewables sector went into a torpor – no consideration for the thousands who lost their jobs. This time, however, industry hasn’t skipped a beat. More than $8bn has been committed to renewables so far this year, and hardly a week goes by without a new project announcement or a new price record being shattered. Aemo and Arena will soon trial Demand Response, a technology that allow large users of energy to be rewarded for shifting their demand away from peaks. Both the SA and Victorian governments are investing in batteries to provide grid stability services. SA has leased a fleet of fast-response turbine generators in case its grid is caught short this summer - think of it as insurance. But what would we do if the federal government wasn’t hamstrung by ideologues? We’d go hard on prime minister Turnbull’s plan to add more pumped-hydro storage capacity to the Snowy and Tasmanian hydro schemes. The upgraded hydro schemes would have a reduced dependency on rainfall and would simplify and lower the costs of balancing the grid. We should be looking now to improve the interconnections between the states. Once built, the stronger connections would improve system security and bring down prices through competition. A second major cable from Tasmania to Victoria would make best use of upgraded hydro and the phenomenally valuable Roaring Forties wind energy resource. Business plans for additional transmission lines strengthening the connections between SA, NSW and Queensland have been sitting on shelves for years. We need to push through regulations that are keeping grid stabilising batteries out of the market and put an end to blatant market gaming that’s driving up prices. As coal generators leave the market, we lose the benefit of the huge rotating masses that provide valuable inertia that maintains system frequency – valuable, but not valued. Other technologies – including wind, solar and batteries – can provide inertia, but won’t until either regulation compels or a market encourages. We should be regulating or building these markets now. Aemo has clearly stated that we need more dispatchable power, and ordinarily the high price signals would bring this into the market. Our energy policy mess has weakened these signals. A series of modest technology-agnostic auctions for dispatchables, open to those without large market share, may be required to bring in much needed competition. Among all the noise, it’s worth noting that SA has long moved beyond talk and is implementing an “all of the above” strategy. With decreasing price volatility and more competition, future federal governments will show off (rather than denigrate) the pioneering state. The prescription at the federal level is simple. Industry has been nothing if not consistent and unified in its advice to government – set the ground rules and get out of the way. The current energy debate has exposed us to the “energy trilemma” – the concept that it is handwringly difficult to provide power that is reliable, affordable and that fulfils our commitments to both the Paris agreement and future generations. It’s actually not that hard. New technologies, dramatic cost reductions and our world-leading markets, institutions and expertise provide us with a path. The vast array of participants in the energy sector are getting on with the task at hand – but it would so much easier if it wasn’t happening in spite of our leaders.

Turnbull’s sideswipe at Abbott followed the former prime minister declaring in an interview with his former staffer Peta Credlin, and the Sydney shock jock Alan Jones, that it would be “unconscionable ... to go further down the renewables path” by implementing a clean energy target. Campaigning in Brisbane amid speculation the Labor government in Queensland will shortly call a state election, and facing sustained questioning about Abbott leading a backbench revolt against energy policy, Turnbull said he did not intend to run a commentary on other people’s remarks. But he said the renewable energy target “was amended and legislated in 2015, while Tony was prime minister”. “So, it’s part of the law and we are committed to that.” Turnbull said the government’s current internal deliberations went to energy policy after 2020 and the new policy would ensure “affordable and reliable energy, and, of course ... meet our emissions reduction obligations under the Paris agreement”. Earlier in the day, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, warned Abbott to pull his head in, arguing the ultimate outcome of government dysfunction on energy policy would be a Labor government. But far from pulling his head in, Abbott told 2GB on Wednesday afternoon he could not “and won’t” support a clean energy target if the government moved to legislate it. But while confirming he would cross the floor, Abbott then backtracked, suggesting it probably would not come to that because “on this issue, I think the backbench will end up saving the government from itself”. Noting that all wisdom did not reside in the executive wing, Abbott claimed the prime minister and ministers had begun to have second thoughts about the clean energy target when the idea encountered first backbench resistance after the Finkel report was published. “I’m confident the government will see the sense of these arguments,” Abbott said. East coast gas market ‘dysfunctional’: Sims The renewed government infighting came as the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Wednesday characterised the east coast gas market as “dysfunctional” and said the LNG industry was “largely” still not supporting the domestic gas market despite heavy-handed government intervention. In a significant speech at the National Press Club, the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, issued a public warning to the Turnbull government to tread carefully with its new energy policy, given Australian consumers and businesses were already paying far too much for power. He said there were no silver bullets to reduce power prices, greenhouse gas emissions and make the grid more reliable. Sims said the drivers of electricity price increases were network prices (41%), then higher retail costs and margins (24%), and generation costs (19%) – with green scheme costs contributing 16%. With network reliability a major focus of the government’s thinking, Sims said the government needed to “weigh very carefully” its policy interventions, because, ultimately, consumers would bear the costs. With the government mulling a new clean energy target that passes the costs of emissions reductions through to consumers, Sims urged the government to “be very careful with new or enhanced ideas that incur costs that are to be smeared across all electricity users”. He noted that governments had implemented “some stunningly generous green schemes”, such as solar feed-in tariffs, and the costs of those schemes were borne by consumers. “Many people think there is no cost but there is a cost and consumers are paying it,” the ACCC chairman said. Sims said the government needed to separate an objective to make energy prices more affordable from other policy objectives to lower greenhouse gas emissions and make the grid more secure – and avoid “silver bullets that are said to address all three objectives.” He said new regulations imposed on retailers could have unintended consequences and any move to re-regulate energy prices “would see many consumers paying more, sometimes a lot more than they are now”. Sims said the government also needed to bear in mind that a lack of competition in electricity retailing and generation was contributing to higher prices paid by consumers. He was sharply critical of LNG producers selling excess gas on the international spot market rather than selling it back into the domestic market, and the competition boss contradicted recent upbeat assessments by ministers that the threat of being hit with export controls had already made more gas available for domestic consumption. Sims said none of the recent activity by gas producers had made “any serious inroads into the gas supply problem”. His stark assessment contrasts with bullish comments last week from the deputy prime minister, who told reporters gas companies had already responded to the government’s proposed export control mechanism by making more product available. After declaring things had improved, Joyce then appeared to argue he had not pulled the trigger on the gas mechanism because it wouldn’t deliver the desired result. “If we pulled the trigger on this some time ago then would that gas we brought on to the market be there? No,” Joyce told reporters last week. Sims has been previously critical of the gas export mechanism but the picture he painted at the press club was the government was now in the worst of all possible worlds and had very little choice but to intervene. The ACCC will shortly hand two reports to the Turnbull government: one on electricity and another on gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/932","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T23:00:06Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 932","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/932","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/932","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 932","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/19/toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us-and-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T07:35:55Z","webTitle":"Toys R Us files for bankruptcy in US and Canada","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/19/toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us-and-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/19/toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us-and-canada","fields":{"headline":"Toys R Us files for bankruptcy in US and Canada","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada after running up $5bn (£3.7bn) of debts and struggling to compete in the age of internet shopping. The world’s largest toy store chain said it had filed for Chapter 11 to restructure its debts and work out a sustainable path for its finances that would allow it to invest in long-term growth. The New Jersey-based company, which employs 64,000, said the vast majority of its 1,600 stores around the world were profitable, adding that its businesses outside North America, including the UK, were not affected. The group’s history dates to the 1950s in the US. It arrived in the UK, where it employs more than 2,500 people, in 1985. It has 110 stores in Britain as well as a website launched in 1996. The group confirmed it was opening further shops in the UK, with four planned before Christmas in High Wycombe, Sunderland, Blackburn and Craigleith in Scotland. It is also revamping its flagship shops in Bristol and Brent Cross shopping centre in north London. “Today marks the dawn of a new era at Toys R Us, where we expect that the financial constraints that have held us back will be addressed in a lasting and effective way,” said Dave Brandon, the chairman and chief executive. “Together with our investors, our objective is to work with our debtholders and other creditors to restructure the $5bn of long-term debt on our balance sheet, which will provide us with greater financial flexibility to invest in our business, continue to improve the customer experience in our physical stores and online, and strengthen our competitive position in an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide.” The 60-year-old company, which faces about $400m of debt repayments in 2018, said it had secured about $3bn of financing from various lenders, including a JP Morgan-led bank syndicate, to keep its stores open as usual as it approaches its key Christmas selling period. Brandon said: “As the holiday season ramps up, our physical and web stores are open for business, and our team members around the world look forward to continuing to put huge smiles on children’s faces. We thank our vendors for their ongoing support through this important season and beyond.” Analysts say the company’s large network of shops are an expensive burden at a time when online giants Amazon and Walmart are discounting toys to steal their shoppers. “The demise of Toys R Us in North America will come as little surprise in an environment where bricks and mortar retail is continuing to struggle with high debt levels and the havoc being wreaked by e-commerce,” said Jon Copestake, chief retail and consumer goods analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Toys R Us has proven to be particularly vulnerable to online competition which offers greater choice and convenience, often at a better price. “There is room in physical retail for toy stores as the queues outside Hamleys and Lego stores will testify but success is now more likely to come from stores that reinvent themselves as destinations offering experiences or as niche outlets for hardcore collectors. The ‘pile them high’ big box approach is simply no longer relevant.” Toys R Us said that as part of its proceedings it had sought approval to continue paying staff wages and benefits, honour customer programmes, and pay suppliers as usual."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/sep/19/world-markets-new-peaks-eurozone-confidence-zew-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T16:51:59Z","webTitle":"World markets at new highs; UK zero-hours contracts fall - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/19/world-markets-new-peaks-eurozone-confidence-zew-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/sep/19/world-markets-new-peaks-eurozone-confidence-zew-business-live","fields":{"headline":"World markets at new highs; UK zero-hours contracts fall - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"World markets are continuing their record runs, unperturbed by Donald Trump’s rhetoric against North Korea at the UN and despite some caution ahead of the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday. The MSCI All Country World Index, a broad measure of global shares, reached a new peak of 487.48, while the Nikkei closed just under 2% higher. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both hit new peaks, while European shares managed to edge higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 21.97 points or 0.3% higher at 7275.25 Germany’s Dax edged up 0.02% to 12,561.79 France’s Cac climbed 0.16% to 5237.44 Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.27% to 22,425.42 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.39% at 10,378.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.27% to 762.86 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.2% at 22,378, and on track for yet another record close. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The pound has had an uncertain day. Initially sterling slipped back in the wake of Bank of England governor Mark Carney’s comments on Monday that any rate rises would be gradual and limited. But a report that Boris Johnson could resign as foreign secretary before the weekend if his demands over Brexit were not met - although denied - saw the pound jump half a cent to $1.3535. But as the day progressed the currency drifted back from its best levels and is currently up just 0.01% at $1.3495. President Trump’s speech to the UN had a few hair raising moments, including the threat that the US might have to “totally destroy North Korea.” But markets seem to be fairly unmoved by this and all of Trump’s other state of the world comments. Wall Street is off its best levels but still up around 16 points and close to its all time highs. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Wall Street opened this morning at a record high and, despite a few concerns over the contents of his speech, Donald Trump’s maiden address to the United Nations hasn’t upset the applecart too much. While the President continued his hard-line stance on North Korea, the threat of war seems less likely than it did a couple of weeks ago. More importantly for traders, Trump again reiterated his desire to again put America first – continuing the run of confidence in the US market. The next big milestone for traders is the Fed meeting tomorrow to discuss raising interest rates. While a hike doesn’t seem on the cards until December, any indication that that might be brought forward could see the bullishness of the markets quickly shaken off. The outlook for global growth is positive, says ratings agency Fitch, but this could be tempered by the withdrawal of central banks’ stimulus measure. In its latest global credit outlook report, Fitch says: Global rating outlooks remain on an improving trend and are on balance less negative that at the start of the year across most rating sectors.... However the improving outlook for global credit quality is underpinned by years of loose central bank monetary policy, including quantitative easing, as well as what are now the strongest world growth conditions since 2010. “Looking ahead in the rating cycle, the most benign credit market conditions in modern history will gradually begin to normalise as central bank assistance is withdrawn and world growth peaks in 2018. This could begin to temper the otherwise upbeat rating outlook trend,” said Monica Insoll, managing director in Fitch’s credit market research team. Unwinding QE will pose challenges to both borrowers and lenders, including the many sovereigns with post-2000 high government debt-to-GDP levels. With a number of markets appearing to be approaching cyclical peaks, it may also expose potential asset bubbles, including those in buoyant housing markets such as Australia, Canada and some Nordic countries. The US Federal Reserve has already begun raising interest rates and at this week’s meeting, it is expected to set out plans to unwind its balance sheet and begin selling bonds bought as part of QE. The European Central Bank is also likely to set out plans to move away from QE before too long, while the Bank of England has recently been hinting at the prospect of a rate rise as early as November. Ahead of Wednesday’s decision from the US Federal Reserve on interest rates and the future of its monetary policy, Wall Street has opened at yet new heights. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.15% at a record 22,366 while the S&amp;P has edged up 0.12% to a new high. Apart from the Fed meeting, the other main event exercising investors’ minds is President Trump’s speech at the United Nations. Some disappointing data from the US, just as the Federal Reserve deliberates on interest rates and monetary policy. The current account deficit - the difference between goods and services flowing into and out of the country - rose from $113.5bn in the first quarter to $123.1bn in the second three months of the year compared to expectations of a figure of $115.1bn. The first quarter figure was revised down from $116.8bn. Import prices jumped by 0.6% in August, up from 0.1% in the previous month, as the cost of petrol jumped and the dollar weakened. And housing starts fell for the second month in a row, down 0.8% in August. Following the Guardian’s reports on the debt time bomb, with huge borrowings being racked up by Britain’s most vulnerable consumers, there are calls for an independent inquiry. Phillip Inman and Jill Treanor write: The chairs of two powerful parliamentary committees have urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the £200bn of credit amassed by households, as Britain’s debt crisis raises alarm among senior MPs. The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households. “Debt is a huge emotional burden for people,” said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee. She added that “unstable personal finances” often emerged as problems raised by her constituents in Loughborough. The £200bn of debt amassed on credit cards, personal loans and car deals is now at the same levels it reached before the 2008 financial crisis and there are fears that rises in interest rates could put more households under pressure. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned on Monday that interest rates were likely to rise in response to rising inflation and skills shortages brought on by Brexit that will increase pressure on wages. Their full report is here: And here are more reports in our series: Sterling has edged higher following a report that Boris Johnson might resign by the weekend if the prime minister does not change her Brexit stance. It is now up 0.25% at $1.3526, after an initial dip. The Foreign Office has no immediate comment on the Telegraph story, and Johnson told the paper he will not resign. But the ripple in the market shows investors are nervous about the whole Brexit situation. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB, said: The rise in sterling since the news is modest compared to recent rallies but it shows nonetheless that the markets are closely watching the latest political developments with a keen eye. Recently economic data and monetary policy have usurped politics in driving the pound, but the latest news is a timely reminder that the political situation can quickly become front and centre once more after what has been, since the Brexit vote at least, a relatively prolonged period on the back-burner. European stock markets are hovering around six-week highs today, as the City awaits tomorrow’s Federal Reserve meeting. Britain’s FTSE 100 is up around 0.2%, while Germany’s DAX is down a smidgen. City economists are still expecting the Fed to leave US interest rates on hold, perhaps until December. The Fed will also probably outline how it will unwind its huge bond-buying programme. Jack Flaherty, investment director at asset manager GAM explains: The Fed finally looks set to announce the normalisation of its balance sheet and we think the necessary reinvestment tapering will begin in October. It is not likely to change its growth and employment forecasts significantly, though with inflation on the low side of expectations, some of the base line numbers may be adjusted downwards. A rate hike is still on the cards for this year, unless inflation comes in even further below target. I missed this earlier, but German investor confidence has bounced back in August. The ZEW Institute’s monthly barometer of financial morale jumped to 17 this month, up from 10 back in August, and much higher than expected. ZEW president Achim Wambach credited: ““Solid growth in the second quarter, recent big increases in banks’ lending business and growing investment from firms and the state”. The survey also shows that German investors are concerned about Britain’s economic prospects: In other news, a new survey has shown that Europe’s builders cracked on in July. Construction sector production in the EU rose by 0.5% per month in July, and by 0.2% in the eurozone, Eurostat reports. It was driven by an increase in building production (such as building new houses), while civil engineering output dropped. That suggests that construction will provide a positive impact on European growth over the summer, says Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macro. Over the last year, Europe’s construction output has risen by 3.6%. Britain, though, is lagging behind, as the uncertainty created by Brexit weighs on the economy. Eurostat says: Among Member States for which data are available, the highest increases in production in construction were recorded in Hungary (+22.6%), Sweden (+21.2%), Poland (+19.8%) and Slovakia (+14.7%). Decreases were observed in the United Kingdom (-1.1%) and Italy (-0.4%). Zero-hours contracts are a particular issue for young workers. One third of people on “zero-hours contracts” are aged 16 to 24, compared with 11.4% for all people in employment. Dr Carole Easton OBE, chief executive of the Young Women’s Trust, says this creates insecurity and financial problems for young people, leading to anxiety and mental health issues. Dr Easton explains: Budgeting, paying your bills and planning ahead can be impossible when you don’t know how many hours you will be working or how much money you will have coming in each month. For some, an inability to balance precarious shifts with childcare can make working impossible. Here’s Richard Partington’s news story on today’s data: The storm of controversy over zero-hours contracts in recent years has forced some employers to ditch them. Instead, people are being hired on contracts that only guarantee a small number of hours each week - which can then be increased as needed. Alan Price, employment law director at Peninsula (a HR and employment law firm), explains: Zero hours contracts have received mass negative publicity regarding their use and the unfair treatment of staff working under these contracts. Large companies, such as McDonalds, have been seeking a move away from these contracts by giving staff the opportunity to request a contract with guaranteed hours, calculated as an average of the hours worked under their previous zero hours contracts. It is likely many other companies are recruiting on similar contracts containing a small number of guaranteed hours and then requesting staff to work extra hours as and when to meet business demands. Moving away from the name ‘zero hours contracts’ removes the negative connotations associated with these contracts and improves public perception of the company. It can also make recruitment easier by defining available positions as flexible and guaranteed hours, rather than zero hours. On average, someone on a “zero-hours contract” usually works 26 hours a week, today’s report shows. They’re also more likely to be female. The ONS says: People on “zero-hours contracts” are more likely to be young, part-time, women or in full-time education when compared with other people in employment. The TUC have welcomed the drop in zero-hours contracts, but also wants more action. General Secretary Frances O’Grady says: “1.4 million zero-hour contracts is 1.4 million too many. “While it’s good that some employers have ditched them as a result of union campaigning, let’s not pretend that life at the sharp end has become easier overnight. “One in ten UK workers remain in insecure jobs. The spread of low-paid self-employment, agency work and short-hours contracts mean millions are struggling to get by The Labour Party says the drop in zero-hours contracts isn’t enough - it wants them banned altogether. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, says all workers deserve to have guaranteed hours: “It is a national scandal that there are 1.4 million contracts that don’t guarantee minimum hours, with people stuck in limbo in insecure work, not knowing how much they’ll earn from week to week, unable to budget for basic necessities and unsure if they can even pay the rent. The Government urgently needs to get a grip on the broken labour market which is rigged against workers and adopt Labour’s policy to ban zero hour contracts.” This chart from today’s report shows how the number of people on zero-hours contracts appears to have peaked.... ..this chart shows that administration, food, accommodation and healthcare companies use them the most... ..and crucially, this charts shows that people on zero-hours contracts are more likely to want more work than other workers. The number of people on zero hours contracts has fallen to its lowest level since 2014, suggesting demand for these contracts may have peaked. A new report from the Office for National Statistics shows that there were 1.4 million contracts which didn’t guarantee any actual work, down from 1.7m a year earlier. In addition, the number of people working these contracts fell to 883,000 in the three months to June, a drop of 20,000 (as we reported last month). This could be a significant moment, following criticism of the way that some companies use zero-hours contracts. Senior ONS statistician David Freeman says: In May this year there were 1.4m employment contracts in use that didn’t guarantee minimum hours, down from a peak of 2.1m two years previously. Coupled with figures we’ve already seen from the Labour Force Survey showing a small fall in the number of people who say they’re on zero-hours contracts, it seems possible that the trend towards this type of work has begun to unwind. More to follow.... It’s a dark morning for Toys R Us. The world’s biggest toy retailer has been forced to seek bankruptcy protection this morning, in an attempt to tackle its $5bn debt mountain. Analysts are blaming the move towards online shopping and electronic gadgets, which means fewer families trek to their local toy store for a new board game, ball or bike. Back in the 90s, every child with a working TV would regularly be told about the delights of Toys R US; a “magical place’ with millions of toys all under one roof. Happy memories.... There are plenty of issues for investors to watch closely this week, from interest rate decisions to Hurricane Maria as it heads towards the British Virgin Islands. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, explains: With President Trump expected to talk tough on North Korea and Iran during his first U.N. speech today, investors will be keeping a close eye on any repercussions further out. That we also have two Central Bank meetings [in America and Japan] and the all-important Brexit speech from Theresa May to come this week, means economic data is likely to be less pressing for investors. There are mixed feelings over the FOMC meeting too, despite high expectations of balance sheet reduction. Investors are aware that Trump has the potential to change the make-up of the Fed over the coming months, which could potentially pour cold water on any plans unveiled this week. So investors are likely bracing themselves for potential political risk around a central bank which is meant to be politically independent. Britain’s accountancy watchdog has ended its probe into KPMG over its auditing of HBOS, the bank which failed during the financial crisis almost a decade ago. The Financial Reporting Council has concluded there isn’t a realistic prospect that a Tribunal would make an Adverse Finding against KPMG. KPMG had been criticised for signing off HBOS’s accounts in early 2008, just eight months before the bank had to be rescued by Lloyds. Subsequently, HBOS was heavily criticised for its reckless lending policies, which led to billions of toxic loans which sank the bank when the economy weakened. The FRC has concluded that KPMG’s work “did not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of the audit”. The FRC explains. In early 2008 HBOS concluded that its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 should be prepared on a “going concern” basis. HBOSdid not expect market conditions to worsen and judged that it would be able to fund itself. The auditor considered and accepted this conclusion. HBOS published its audited financial statements in February 2008 on that basis. The evidence of market conditions at that time did not show this decision of HBOS or the auditor’s assessment of it to be unreasonable at the time. KPMG has insisted that it challenged HBOS over its optimistic assumptions, and pushed the bank’s top management to take larger provisions against bad loans (not large enough, though, it turned out) The pound is rallying this morning, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney dropped another hint that interest rates will rise soon. Sterling is up 0.3% against both the euro at €1.199, and the dollar at $1.354. Yesterday, Carney told an audience in Washington DC that “some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months”. That makes it even more likely that the BoE will act in November. Although, as economist Sean Richards tweets, Carney has talked the talk before, but not delivered... MSCI’s All Country World Index, a broad measure of global shares, has hit a new record today. It struck 486.95 for the first time, thanks to the Nikkei’s rally and last night’s Wall Street action. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are nudging new all-time highs todays, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of puff. Last night, America’s man stocks closed at new records, again, as investors prepared for Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones ended at new highs, driven by financial stocks. The rally comes ahead of tomorrow’s Fed meeting, where the US central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it plots a path to unwind its stimulus measures without upsetting the markets. Japan has now joined the rally too. After Monday’s holiday, the Nikkei surged by almost 2% today. Easing geopolitical worries are pulling down the yen (which is good for Japanese exports and will be welcomed in Tokyo). Speculation that Japanese prime minister Abe might be planning to call a snap election also boosted confidence (not that snap elections always go as planned...). Abe’s popularity has risen in recent months, so he could strengthen his grip on parliament. Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities, says: “Investors were worried about ‘Abexit’ before, but if he calls a snap election and his ruling party wins, it would strengthen the foundations of his once-weak government base.” [No, I’m not sure about Abexit either...] European markets are expected to cling onto yesterday’s six week highs. CMC Market’s Michael Hewson explains that investors around the globe are waiting to see what the Fed announces, and says, tomorrow: US stock markets also continued where they left off on Friday posting new record highs as investors geared up for tomorrows Federal Reserve rate meeting and press conference, with the US central bank expected to embark on the first baby steps on the paring down of its balance sheet. Despite recent poor US economic data there still seems to be a belief amongst some in the markets that we could see one more rate hike this year, something that may well be borne out by tomorrow’s rate dot plot projections. Whether the projections survive their exposure to the real world of the hurricane clear up of Harvey and Irma is another matter, not to mention the prospect of further hurricanes with the latest in the form of Maria as it moves towards Puerto Rico. The latest geopolitical situation appears to have settled down for now but with President Trump set to speak at the United Nations later today it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if North Korea decided to send him a message so to speak, perhaps in the form of another missile test. While the rhetoric appears to have settled down a touch it probably wouldn’t take much to set it all off again. Here’s our liveblog on Hurricane Maria, which has just battered Dominica: Traders will also be watching the latest eurozone economic data, to see if Europe’s recover remains on track.

On Saturday, a coalition of environmental groups held a screening of the documentary Guarding the Galilee at Federation Square, attended by about 300 people. The film is about the fight to stop Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, which would be the biggest coalmine ever built in Australia and one of the biggest in the world. In the week before the event, Federation Square demanded to see the slideshow that would be presented before the screening and then demanded much of it be removed. In email correspondence a Federation Square representative told the event organisers they “cannot permit any slides with protest messaging, slogans or memes together with slides that show pictures of politicians, newspaper headlines or any explicitly political messaging”. The operators objected to any content that was “negative and inflammatory” and demanded the majority of the slides be removed or significantly altered. That included removing all pictures of newspaper headlines, politicians, political memes, protests or pictures of the Great Barrier Reef with “inflammatory messaging”. Federation square also demanded that the “stop Adani” logo be changed to black and white, and that it not take up a whole slide. “I would recommend putting together a slideshow that focuses more on the environmental aspect of the reef without the protest messaging,” the Federation Square representative said. Federation Square is managed by Fed Square Pty Ltd and owned by the state government of Victoria. The demands surprised the organisers, since Federation Square had approved the screening of the Guarding the Galilee, which included footage of protests, criticisms of the federal government, images of politicians presented in a negative light as well as explicit protest messaging. As part of the agreement for hiring the venue, the organisers were told the material must be “G or PG rated” and the written agreement stated: “The hirer understands that Fed Square reserves the right to reject material that is deemed unacceptable or inappropriate for public exhibition in terms of quality, format type or content.” Federation Square had told the organisers over the phone that “politically partisan” slides would not be allowed but the organisers said they were told that related to messaging related to political parties. When challenged by the organisers over email, Federation Square said: “Although not associated specifically with a political party, the content is certainly political in nature and partisan in its opposition/protest to the current governments and their policies.” In order to ensure the meeting went ahead, the organisers removed more than half the slides. Odette Joannidis, a Stop Adani volunteer and co-organiser of the event, said the debacle revealed Federation Square was not “a friend of the people”. “The management had us over a barrel, threatening to pull the plug on our event unless we obeyed their crazy request to cut the most benign of images from being shown,” she said. “It felt like being in an Orwellian nightmare, not Melbourne. “It’s disturbing that in 2017, in an era of climate change, executives at Fed Square would actively censor photos of mums, dads and grandparents engaged in peaceful actions and suggest they were ‘inflammatory’ images.” Because Federation Square refused to tell the organisers exactly which slides were causing the problem, and discussion was occurring just days before the event, the organisers removed anything they thought might be considered partisan, negative or inflammatory. “We asked for guidance from Fed Square on a slide-by-slide basis so we could better understand what exactly it was they objected to,” said Pablo Brait from Market Forces, who also organised the event. “However, Fed Square refused to give us this guidance and instead issued an ultimatum that the next version of the slideshow had to be acceptable to them, or else there would be no slideshow at all.” Federation Square refused to answer a series of questions from the Guardian asking which sort of material was and wasn’t allowed and why. Instead, a spokeswoman sent through the following statement. Fed Square was delighted to approve the screening of an important environmental documentary, Guarding the Galilee. The event organiser subsequently requested to present a large PowerPoint presentation, which Fed Square did not approve. Fed Square’s venue hire agreement states that Fed Square can refuse the right to play or remove from display any screen content considered offensive or inappropriate for any reason whatsoever. This was communicated to the event organiser and a mutual agreement was reached. The event was organised by groups including Bayside Climate Change Action Group, StopAdani Eltham, Crochet for Coral not Coal, Darebin Climate Action Now, GetUp Melbourne East, AYCC Victoria, Melbourne Ports Stop Adani Group and Market Forces. The groups crowdfunded the event and major sponsors included the National Tertiary Education Union and Melbourne builders Jenkinson Building."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/19/bhp-agrees-to-rethink-its-links-to-minerals-council-of-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T06:54:19Z","webTitle":"BHP agrees to rethink its links to Minerals Council of Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/19/bhp-agrees-to-rethink-its-links-to-minerals-council-of-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/19/bhp-agrees-to-rethink-its-links-to-minerals-council-of-australia","fields":{"headline":"BHP agrees to rethink its links to Minerals Council of Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The giant Anglo-Australian miner BHP has agreed to reconsider its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia, as well as other industry groups, and to clarify how BHP’s position on climate and energy policy differs from those bodies. The move comes as BHP faces a shareholder resolution urging the company to terminate membership of bodies that demonstrate a pattern of advocacy on policy issues at odds with the company’s positions since 2012. The resolution was moved by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility on behalf of more than 120 shareholders of BHP. “The last decade or longer of Australian climate and energy policy has been characterised by short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies, or no policy at all,” the ACCR said on behalf of about the shareholders in a supporting statement. The statement called for BHP to review membership of industry bodies, and singled out the Minerals Council of Australia, noting its activities have “diminished the federal government’s ability to resolve a national policy issue of material relevance to our company and the stability of its operations”. “The MCA’s activities undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an ‘effective policy framework’ should include: a complementary set of measures including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technologies, energy efficiency and measures to build resilience,” the statement said. “Over time, these activities have the potential to undermine shareholder value, given our company’s exposure to climate-related risk and energy instability.” In 2016 AGL, Australia’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, left the MCA, citing material differences in their positions on climate change and energy. “AGL’s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, and AGL has elected not to renew its membership of these organisations,” the company said. In recent months BHP has expressed public displeasure at some of the MCA’s lobbying activities. The CSIRO has come under fire for its membership of the MCA. In a statement uploaded to the BHP website on Monday, the miner said it would review its membership of industry bodies, specifically mentioning the Minerals Council of Australia. It also committed to publishing statements on how its positions differ from industry groups on climate change. “In the past, we have always sought to make our position on significant public issues clear,” BHP said. “However, we will further our efforts to ensure that material differences with industry associations on key issues are clearly understood. “To that end, we will make public, by 31 December 2017, a list of the material differences between the positions we hold on climate and energy policy, and the advocacy positions on climate and energy policy taken by industry associations to which we belong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/19/agl-says-keeping-liddell-power-station-open-beyond-2022-could-cost-900m","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T06:05:02Z","webTitle":"AGL says keeping Liddell power station open beyond 2022 could cost $900m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/agl-says-keeping-liddell-power-station-open-beyond-2022-could-cost-900m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/19/agl-says-keeping-liddell-power-station-open-beyond-2022-could-cost-900m","fields":{"headline":"AGL says keeping Liddell power station open beyond 2022 could cost $900m","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Keeping the Liddell coal-fired power station open beyond 2022, as Malcolm Turnbull has urged, could cost more than $900m, AGL says, with representatives of the energy company saying the station should be shut. In a tour for journalists, in which AGL spoke about the problems facing the ageing power station, the company revealed an independent study conducted in 2013 estimated it would cost $900m to extend its life until 2032. Kate Coates, the general manager of Liddell power station, said that figure was in addition to another $150m AGL was investing in the plant, just to get it to last until 2022. She said that figure was calculated in 2013 dollars, which would now be about $950m, adjusted for inflation. Coates said the report was commissioned by the NSW government when the station was in public hands and it was conducted by the energy consultants WorleyParsons. She said the report was not very detailed and was just a “desktop study”. “We sort of sanity checked that and it sounds about right,” Coates said. AGL was not able to provide the report and the Guardian has approached the New South Wales government for a copy. An earlier report in the Australian suggested an engineering study said the power station could be extended to 2032, arguing that would save consumers money. But that report did not describe the cost of doing so. In response to a report by the Australian Energy Market Operator calling for “new approaches” to securing Australia’s energy supply, Turnbull announced he was seeking to extend the life of Liddell power station – the country’s oldest operating large coal power station. AGL has insisted it will not extend the life of the plant but its chief executive, Andy Vesey, reluctantly agreed to take Turnbull’s proposal to the board for consideration. In a press tour of Liddell on Tuesday, Coates also outlined a long list of problems that beset the plant, describing an overall picture of a plant that was due for retirement. At present, two of the four generators at Liddell are not operational, with one undergoing planned maintenance and the other one offline due to “stability issues” that have not yet been diagnosed. Coates said she did not think the plant should be extended beyond 2022 and also said she did not think new coal power stations made sense. AGL’s chief economist, Tim Nelson, said it was very rare for power stations to be used beyond 50 years and noted that there was 4000MW of renewable generation in the pipeline, which could make up for the lost energy from Liddell. He said that, as the energy system evolved, coal would play a smaller and smaller part in the energy mix, as it was replaced by renewables and firming capacity provided by gas, hydro and batteries. Coates said Vesey had given a lot of certainty to staff at the plant and that giving seven years notice about the closure left a lot of time for plans to be made about retirement, retraining or redeployment. “Many of them had committed their entire careers to this power station and to see it close is a stressful thing in itself. But at least we had certainty,” Coates said. “They no longer feel that certainty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/20/young-aboriginal-lgbti-people-are-killing-themselves-we-need-to-protect-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Young Aboriginal LGBTI people are killing themselves.

We need to protect them","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The small township of Bourke in far western New South Wales is a small speck of dust swimming in a vast ocean of ruby red dirt and is home to the Barkindji people since time immemorial. Every summer a wave of heat unfurls over the region, coming in from a flat scrub thick with twisted saltbush and gum trees. I was born and bred on this magnificent country, and summertime is one of my most cherished memories. The other memory that I hold from my childhood is not as endearing. Often it’s a nightmare that still wakes me in a cold sweat in the dead of night. It’s the memory of feeling like an alien in the country that my ancestors have been caretakers of for millennia. Of not feeling like a man, or what I thought an Aboriginal man was supposed to be. I vividly remember starting to be attracted to other boys when I was around 12 years old. It was a feeling that made my blood run cold. I often thought of death through my teenage years. The thought of being gay was almost too much to bear. I used to imagine all the ways I could kill myself, every conceivable scenario, what I would write on my suicide note. There was a dark jungle of confusion inside me and I couldn’t see my way clear of it. I stood alone, frozen with fear, for a very long time at the intersection of racism and homophobia. “Abo, faggot, poofter, coon, half-caste.” I was singled out by all and still carry scars left by volleys of verbal shots levelled at me by angry boys and men throughout those years. Even now, as I write this, a tear balloons in the corner of my eye. It wasn’t until I moved to Sydney that I found freedom among the concrete towers and in the loving embrace of older staunch gay black men, women and sistergirls. They taught me I was exactly how I was meant to be, that we have existed in our beautiful culture since the very beginning. Many of them have since passed, gone too young and without social acceptance. They were giants in my eyes, and I stand on their shoulders, but the pain was too much for them. I miss them dearly. I have survived, my community and family have embraced me and I am loved. It would be an injustice if I didn’t raise my voice. Young Aboriginal people struggling with their sexuality are in unimaginable pain, they are our brothers, sisters, cousins, nieces and nephews. They bear the burden of being the most vulnerable group of people in the country. They are killing themselves, it’s a fact. We have pulled together as a community for decades for civil rights. We have marched down streets arm in arm, chanting in unison as the police gas canisters, batons and fists rained down upon us. We have walked away from indentured slavery on remote outstations and sat on the land and refused to move until we got justice. We are a strong people. We are survivors. Now, as a community we need to raise a fist for our young people who are struggling with their sexuality. We need to draw on that spirit and stand up to the homophobia in our community, a concept that was delivered to us through sermons by missionaries that stole us from our families and forced us to believe our own culture was sinful. Do not let our black voice be muffled in this same-sex marriage debate; we know how to fight for what’s right. We have the ability to survive against all odds. There are young people looking to you to do the right thing – it’s not just about voting yes, it’s about showing that you believe they are a cherished and an important part of our Aboriginal community. It’s an acknowledgment that could have saved countless brothers and sisters who could not see their way out of the darkness. Vote yes for our dignity and because it’s the right thing to do.

The former prime minister made the frank remark in response to an observation by the 2GB radio host Ray Hadley on Tuesday that “punters on ... the street, up the pub, up the club that I go to” think the power policies between the major political parties are identical. Abbott empathised with Hadley’s point, arguing there was very little difference between a clean energy target of 42% and a renewable energy target from Labor of 50%. He said that, “to his credit”, Malcolm Turnbull had begun to get the political rhetoric right, by referring to the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, as “blackout Bill” but he said the government needed to back up the rhetoric with policy. “This is an opportunity for us to sharpen the difference with Labor on a issue which is of deep concern to the public, on a hip-pocket issue, where we can be on the side of voters and Labor is on the side of green extremists,” Abbott told Hadley. “We’ve got to change the debate. “Let Labor be the party of renewable energy and us the party of reliable energy”. After wresting the Liberal party leadership from Turnbull during an internal battle over emissions trading in 2009, Abbott ran a successful political campaign against the Gillard government’s clean energy scheme, which contributed to the Coalition winning the 2013 election. His chief of staff, Peta Credlin, later admitted the Coalition had transformed a carbon pricing mechanism into a “carbon tax” in a bit of “brutal retail politics”. “Along comes a carbon tax. It wasn’t a carbon tax, as you know. It was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax,” Credlin told Sky News in February 2017. “We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment. That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and, when he cut through, Gillard was gone.” In the same interview, Credlin also questioned Turnbull’s capacity to sell a complex policy such as a renewable energy target to the public. Abbott has been front-running the government’s fraught internal debate about energy policy for months, amplifying concerns some government MPs have about the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. He contends Australia risks de-industrialising our country “in our obsession to drive down emissions”. On Tuesday he was asked by Hadley whether he regretted not being “stronger” as prime minister in resisting policy moves to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Abbott was prime minister when Australia signed up to the Paris international climate agreement and he kept the renewable energy target, albeit at a lower level. Abbott told Hadley his government was the only government in recent history to lower power prices when it repealed Labor’s carbon price. He said he would have like to scrap the RET altogether “but I had to deal with the Senate and I had to deal within a cabinet and, when you are the party leader, as opposed to a backbencher, you are inevitably a little more constrained.” Later in the day, in a separate radio interview, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull emphasised the fact the RET had been settled during Abbott’s prime ministership. “We have a renewable energy target that was actually put in place by Tony Abbott in 2015, it is legislated. And that is in place until 2020”. Turnbull said the government was not proposing to disturb what Abbott had put in place, but was considering what policy to put in place beyond 2020. Labor’s current policy is not a hard renewable energy target, as Abbott suggests, but a “goal” that 50% of Australia’s electricity be sourced from renewables by 2030. Finkel did not recommend a 42% clean energy target. The chief scientist did not set hard parameters for the clean energy target but his report modelled a scheme with an emissions reduction target of 28% on 2005 levels by 2030, with a linear trajectory to zero emissions by 2070. Modelling undertaken with the Finkel review indicates that either a clean energy target or an emissions intensity trading scheme – which is a form of carbon trading – would see renewable energy make up 42% of Australia’s power generation mix by 2030. The Turnbull government has continued over the past fortnight to pivot away from the specific clean energy target modelled in the Finkel review and lay the groundwork for a new energy investment mechanism that will be friendly to coal-fired power. The Australian Energy Market Operator has made it clear it wants an overhaul of current market rules to create a day-ahead market, which allows better planning to ensure sufficient quantities of dispatchable energy are available in the system. There is also talk around the government of a shift to a capacity market, which exists in Western Australia. The toxic, decade-long climate wars have contributed to a strike in new investment in base load power and a range of groups – business associations, the energy sector, climate groups and state governments – have called on Turnbull to use the Finkel review to settle the conflict. Some interest groups issued a pointed warning last week that it was time to stow the partisan politics and get a durable outcome on climate and energy. The Ai Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said last week the business community was “pretty much appalled by what they are seeing and hearing” in the current energy policy debate and he put the Turnbull government on notice that business saw the Finkel review of the national electricity market as “a way out of a dark tunnel”. The Clean Energy Council also warned the government that walking away from the Finkel recommendation of a clean energy target would be “a clear step in the wrong direction”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/18/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book-tour-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T05:48:21Z","webTitle":"Clinton takes on Trump, Putin and misogyny as fans flock to book tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book-tour-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/hillary-clinton-what-happened-book-tour-trump","fields":{"headline":"Clinton takes on Trump, Putin and misogyny as fans flock to book tour","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Half a mile from the White House, where Hillary Clinton expected to return in January, she slouched into an olive green armchair for another round of what she has likened to “therapy”. Had it not been for her stunning loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 election, she would be taking her place this week with world leaders at the United Nations general assembly. Instead, Clinton was speaking at the Warner Theatre at the start of a 15-city book tour to promote What Happened, a 469-page memoir that dissects her doomed presidential campaign. As Trump, the first president with no previous political or military experience, sat around a table with US allies in Manhattan, the former secretary of state pointedly refused to say if she preferred her former opponent to Vladimir Putin. “I have to take that under advisement,” she said when asked to choose between Trump and the Russian president, before stating matter-of-factly: “I ran against both of them.” The crowd erupted into supportive applause, as it did several times when Clinton skewered Russian interference in the election – a cloud that has loomed over Washington amid investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. While discussing the hacking of emails of both the Democratic National Committee and her former campaign chairman, John Podesta, Clinton declared: “I hate the word ‘hacked’. They were stolen – they were stolen by the Russians.” Tickets for Clinton’s event sold out within a matter of minutes, bringing the theater to its full capacity of 1,847 seats amid chandeliers, ornate gold panels and velvet curtains. Loyal supporters were in a jubilant mood as they lined up more than an hour before the event’s start time. Many were the young women who had pinned their hopes on Clinton at long last breaking what she referred to, in her 2008 concession speech, as “that highest, hardest glass ceiling”. One young woman at the lobby bar, who donned a Clinton campaign shirt that read “A woman’s place is in the White House”, said: “I think I’ll order a prosecco. This is a celebration.” Clinton entered the room to a standing ovation from the audience, which included some of her campaign staff. She smiled broadly and waved. The event was the biggest ever sponsored by the local Politics and Prose bookstore, whose co-owner Lissa Muscatine served as Clinton’s chief speechwriter at the state department and the White House. Friendly in its overall tone, the discussion centered on many of the thematic elements of Clinton’s book, from the proliferation of fake news and Russia to sexism and the media’s focus on style over substance. “I ended up not censoring my thoughts,” Clinton said. “I will admit I censored some of my original language.” As with Clinton’s book, the mood wavered from lighthearted to serious, blending candid confessions from the campaign trail with lessons learned “to make sure that ‘what happened’ doesn’t happen again”. “If we don’t get people to vote … we’re not going to turn this around,” Clinton said, while advising the Democratic party to embrace a platform of “both economic justice and social justice”. “I don’t buy this false dichotomy: you can only be for the economy [or] you can only be for civil rights.” Clinton has previously criticized her top rival in the Democratic primary, Senator Bernie Sanders, for making unrealistic economic promises. She made no reference to Sanders on Monday night, but when Muscatine mentioned his name, some members of the audience booed and hissed. Clinton also reflected on the extent to which misogyny swayed the election, a topic she largely avoided as a candidate but has been far more vocal about since her defeat in November. Republicans “just have a hard time thinking about a woman in the White House”, she said, while noting success made men more likable but by contrast made women more unlikable. “When a woman runs, she has to work extra hard to convince other women she can do the job she is running for,” Clinton said. Expressing concern that Trump’s victory had given rise to bigotry and prejudice, Clinton urged the audience to “be the kind of rebuke to those that want to divide us and undermine us”. “I view this book as much about resilience as running for president,” she said. “It’s critical that people have a sustained commitment to taking our country back.” The US capital, where Clinton won more than 90% of the vote, was always guaranteed to offer a warm welcome. Danielle Guessford, 28, a government contractor, said afterwards: “She’s awesome, still trying to fight and stand up for what’s right.” Asked if Clinton should run again in 2020, Guessford replied: “Of course. But I’d like Barack Obama even better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/18/manchester-united-urged-to-stop-their-fans-singing-song-about-romelu-lukaku-manhood-kick-it-out","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T22:57:07Z","webTitle":"Manchester United urged to stop their fans singing song about Romelu Lukaku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/18/manchester-united-urged-to-stop-their-fans-singing-song-about-romelu-lukaku-manhood-kick-it-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/18/manchester-united-urged-to-stop-their-fans-singing-song-about-romelu-lukaku-manhood-kick-it-out","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United urged to stop their fans singing song about Romelu Lukaku","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester United have been urged to stop their supporters singing a song about Romelu Lukaku that makes reference to the size of the striker’s penis on the basis that it reinforces racist stereotypes.

Meeting France’s President Emmanuel Macron on the fringes of the UN general assembly, Trump said he had asked his White House chief of staff, retired Marine Corps general John Kelly, to look into the possibility of holding such a display of US military might. Trump said he marvelled at the French parade that he saw with Macron on France’s 14 July national holiday. In typical Trump fashion, the president said he wants the parade to be bigger and better than the one he saw in France. “It was one of the greatest parades I have ever seen,” Trump said. “It was two hours on the button, and was military might, and I think a tremendous thing for France and the spirit of France.” “And to a large extent, because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on July 4th in Washington, down Pennsylvania Avenue,” Trump said. “We’re going to have to try and top it.” He noted that France’s parade featured representatives from different wars and armed forces wearing different uniforms. “It was really so well done,” he said. “So we’re actually thinking about 4th of July, Pennsylvania Avenue, having a really great parade to show our military strength,” Trump added. Trump has often displayed an enthusiasm for military pageantry and had reportedly hoped for some kind of parade at his own inauguration. Trump watched enthusiastically from a reviewing stand on 14 July as the French military showcased its tanks and fighter jets, including many US-made planes, along the famed Champs-Élysées. The occasion also marked the 100th anniversary of the US entrance into world war one. Trump said he has discussed the parade idea with his chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired marine general. The president, who has recruited three current and retired generals for his senior leadership team, also noted that the US spends $700bn on the military. Washington already holds quite a few parades, including some with military participation that are held on Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. But those patriotic processions typically involve marching bands and uniformed elements, not the grand display of military hardware that Trump envisions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/18/ryanair-flight-cancellation-passengers-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T09:49:59Z","webTitle":"Ryanair to tell 400,000 passengers of cancelled flights after roster 'mess-up'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/ryanair-flight-cancellation-passengers-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/18/ryanair-flight-cancellation-passengers-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair to tell 400,000 passengers of cancelled flights after roster 'mess-up'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ryanair has written to 400,000 passengers to tell them that their flight has been cancelled after it admitted to a “mess-up” on pilot rostering that left 18 million ticket holders wondering if their holiday plans would be ruined. In a hastily arranged press conference in Dublin on Monday afternoon amid a passenger revolt and a slump in the company’s share price, the normally combative chief executive Michael O’Leary apologised “unreservedly” for “a mess of our own making”. O’Leary blamed a one-off holiday pilot rostering issue, which if not tackled immediately would send the airline’s on-time punctuality below 50%, adding that it will cost Ryanair about €25m (£22m) in compensation payouts and other costs. But in a flash of the arrogance for which he is better known, O’Leary said that travellers vowing never to fly Ryanair again will almost certainly return to the airline because its prices are lower. “Our booking engine is full of passengers who have sworn they will never fly with us again,” he said. Ryanair will cancel 40 to 50 flights every day until 31 October, with the airline promising to focus the cuts on routes where alternative flights are more easily available. For example, it will cancel one flight a day on its Stansted to Dublin route, which operates 12 a day. O’Leary said customers whose flights have been cancelled would receive an email by Monday evening. He said that 75% to 80% of passengers will be re-routed free of charge within a day of their expected departure date, and that compensation of €240 to €400 (£212 to £354) will be paid, depending on the length of the journey. But that will leave as many as 100,000 ticket holders seriously delayed, with possible weekend getaways wrecked. O’Leary said consequential losses, caused when travellers cancel hire cars or hotels, will not be covered by Ryanair. He added that the airline will not book passengers on to rival airlines to get them to their destination on time. “We will not pay for flights on other airlines,” he said. “We cannot afford to pay the high costs of our competitors.” But he admitted the way Ryanair issued its first cancellation warning on Friday had unnecessarily left millions of travellers in the dark. “We did not focus on the concern we were causing to the 18 million passengers flying with us over the next six weeks,” O’Leary said. “I say sorry to them.” Many Ryanair customers took to Twitter to express their disgust over how Ryanair was handling passengers who could not know if they were to be cancelled. One user said she feared for her wedding, with 30 Ryanair flights booked for her party, while others said that even if their outbound flight was not cancelled they could not be sure if their inbound flight would be. Initially, Ryanair was making available only lists of cancelled flights up to Wednesday 20 September. Ryanair rejected allegations that the real reason for the cancellations is a shortage of pilots. There have been claims that Ryanair has been haemorrhaging pilots to rival airlines. Norwegian, which is building a new hub in Ryanair’s home airport, Dublin, said: “We can confirm that 140 pilots have joined Norwegian from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also under way for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year.” O’Leary disputed Norwegian’s figures - but admitted that Ryanair has begun offering pilots at captain level a €10,000 “signing-on bonus” to join. He also struggled to explain why Ryanair was not aware earlier of rostering problems ahead. “There were some overoptimistic briefings coming from rostering,” he said. He rejected any suggestion he should resign. “This is clearly a mess-up,” he admitted. “But it is my mess-up, and a mess I have to clear up.” Shares in the airline fell by 3% in early trading, knocking more than £500m off its £18bn stock market valuation, although losses were pared back later in the day. O’Leary said he expected to face a compensation bill of €20m plus €5m in operational costs. Analysts at Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers said the final bill was likely to be €34.5m as they marked down Ryanair’s full-year profit forecast by 2.3%. Investor groups said that while Ryanair usually brushes off poor publicity, in this case it could seriously hit the airline. “Ryanair is notorious for not caring about what sort of headlines they get, working on the basis that all publicity is good publicity – but not this time,” said Rebecca O’Keefe of Interactive Investor. “Previously, the carrier was happy to suggest that you get what you pay for and despite negative press lots of flyers embraced the fact that they knew the score and were happy to fly without the frills. “However, the current situation is truly damaging, with flyers left high and dry with last-minute cancellations or apprehensive that they might be affected.” O’Keefe said it was unclear whether the delays were caused by poor planning or a shortage of pilots. “If the former, then it suggests some truly poor processes. If the latter, then we may see wages rise to fill the gaps. Either way, it’s not good news for Ryanair.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/24/lubaina-himid-turner-prize-2017-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T08:00:39Z","webTitle":"Lubaina Himid: the Turner prize nominee making black lives visible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/lubaina-himid-turner-prize-2017-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/24/lubaina-himid-turner-prize-2017-interview","fields":{"headline":"Lubaina Himid: the Turner prize nominee making black lives visible","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I n a tranquil corner of Preston, Lancashire, there is a modest Georgian terrace with a handsome park below it and a river – the Ribble – running alongside it. It is here that the artist Lubaina Himid has lived for more than 20 years. She is, at 63, being celebrated as the oldest Turner prize nominee since the prize, in a belatedly sensible move, changed its rules – the cut-off point used to be 50. But age, it will turn out, is the least interesting thing about Himid – whose work has originality, political drive and youthful verve. And besides, in a year of cosmopolitan Turner prize nominees, with artists with roots in Palestine, Germany and the Caribbean, she is not the only artist over 50. What is far more significant is that she has been, art critics seem to agree, inexplicably undervalued throughout her career. Now, for what it is worth, she is also the bookies’ favourite to win. It would seem that her moment has – at last – come and I can’t wait to meet her, having fallen in love with the work I have already seen. On either side of the front path, topiaried box shapes stand guard, leading to a pale yellow front door. This is a long way from Zanzibar, I reflect, where she was born. I ring the bell and Himid appears at the front door with a lovely, welcoming smile: mannishly dressed with chic specs and with just the tiniest touch of Mrs Tiggy Winkle about the intensity of her stance, although her clothes are cooler: caramel coloured brogues, gorgeous blue shirt, smart trousers. She is professor of contemporary art at the University of Central Lancashire and, while making tea, explains how much she loves her job, learning something new, every day, from her students – living proof that teaching need not inhibit creativity. She is a Preston devotee, too, singing the praises of its art gallery and green spaces, although, at one point, she volunteers that Preston, as a city, is “not quite sure of itself”. The lack of sureness – the absence of swank – is not unlike Himid herself. She brims with ideas but is never pushy in expressing them. And beyond the small talk, her feelings about the city count, if only because one of the greatest preoccupations of her work is what it means to belong. I was bowled over, I tell her, by her show Warp and Weft (ends 1 October) at Colchester’s Firstsite gallery – a selection of work from Invisible Strategies at Modern Art Oxford, and Navigation Charts at Spike Island in Bristol, the shows that earned her the Turner prize nomination. You walk into the exhibition space – and stop short. The room is full of people, a painted crowd. You stroll among her figures as you might between trees. The piece is Naming the Money (2004) and the figures taller than I am (I’m 5ft 5in), painted on flat wood like exuberant scenery. Turbaned, dressed in glorious colours, they have a splendour that’s complicated for these are slaves from the royal courts of 18th-century Europe. Each figure, imagined by Himid, has two names – a birth name and a name imposed by an 18th-century slave-owner. They form five groups: herbalists, artists, musicians, dog-trainers and map-makers. She has made 100 of them (70 lodge in Colchester). What is striking is the contrast between their animation and their perfect stillness in the moment Himid has made for them – one has a dog, in harlequin costume jumping up, another a yellow pail of paint brushes ready for use, another is poised to play a drum. As you consider them, you listen to a soundtrack, in Himid’s gentle speaking voice, an account of who each person was and who they have become, a repeated transformation of each renamed slave – a mix of melancholy, idiosyncrasy and pride. “My name is Penda They call me Polly I used to paint the shields Now I wash the floors But I have the patterns.” Having the patterns is essential to Himid’s work. I look at a slave, in a double-breasted jacket with little yellow swirls down his left side and asymmetrical tights – the patterning jauntily indestructible. “I made the figures, wrote the texts, then matched text to figures.” Match-making? “Absolutely – my work is about brokering.” It is unusual, I say, to see slavery approached in such a festive way – I find the affirmation moving. Why such exuberance? “If you walk through the markets of Accra, or south London, you’ll be walking among hundreds of exuberant people of the world, yet many are descendants of slaves. You go to a Jewish wedding and the people survive, understand, carry their history. They are stronger than history, that is the point. My figures say: ‘You tell me your story, I’ll tell you mine.’” Each figure “makes the most enormous effort, as most of us probably do – women more than men – to make the very best of where we find ourselves”. She made the piece at a time when, in her own life, she was starting to understand how “useful and enriching it was, every day, to try to make that day work”. “I’m not in the business of making work where I repeat the trauma. My work is about attempting to belong, about understanding who we are as black people in the diaspora, how much we have contributed across Europe in terms of culture, building, the wealth of the European machine. Never mind the American machine, that’s a whole other story. My work is a kind of handbook – I think of it as a sort of car manual – to deal with the ghosts of what has happened.” Himid belongs to what Felix Petty in i-D magazine recently described as the “generation of émigrés, immigrants and refugees” who have formed a “vital part of Britain’s multicultural postwar story; leaving an indelible mark upon our island”. In a recent interview, she touched on the subject of refugees in connection with her work – could she expand on this? “We have an easy, lazy way of saying ‘refugees’. I think about people being actual people – each one born out of someone’s womb. So if you were to say, off the boat today came Mohammed or David or John and then added that, before they left, they were a carpenter, a doctor, a teacher… it is then they would start to breathe.” She sees “refugees” as a lifeless term: “We must not do this distancing – we are none of us more important than others.” In the 80s, Himid was one of the pioneers of the British black arts movement. How much has changed since then? “What has changed radically is that in terms of the media, television, advertisements, films, newspapers and magazines, black people, in the 80s, were totally invisible. The only way you could see yourself was by looking in the mirror. So making ourselves visible was the purpose of our work.” At Battersea Arts Centre, she organised the work of other black artists and aimed to show young people that being creative was powerful. She also wanted “everyone we knew to understand that, if you paid your taxes, you owned everything in the damned museum. Lots of people still don’t understand that. We wanted to encourage conversations, about politics, beauty, expertise, in places that were as free as being in the street. Black people want to have those conversations too.” A piece made during this period, to be included in the Turner prize show, is a cut-out pastiche of Hogarth’s satirical series of paintings about a dissolute English upper class, Marriage A-la-Mode (1743). A Fashionable Marriage (1986) dramatises racial politics: “It is the countess’s morning levee after she has slept with her lover, the lawyer. She has a castrato singing, her hairdresser, a young girl and two black servants listening. They are all disguising the fact she is making another arrangement to see her lover while the count is away. In my cut-out installation, she is Mrs Thatcher, her lover Ronald Reagan, the people are mostly from the art world: the critic, the dealer, 1980s artists, eager feminists…” A virtuoso piece, it is brazen in its details. Not far from the bride is written: “The white of a plot.” It is not that Himid now thinks black invisibility is a non-issue. Far from it. But she says: “What I am trying to do now is tell more subtle stories about what it means to have ghosts and traces of crimes coursing through every day and to show it is somehow possible to make a decent life nonetheless.” Her newest work, which will be displayed in the Turner prize show, is Le Rodeur: The Lock. “Rodeur” (“stalker”) is the name of a slave ship that set sail for Guadeloupe from the Bight of Biafra in 1819, carrying 22 crew and 162 slaves. Her work is about the “traces of a terrible incident” in which everybody, with one exception, went blind (an eye disease that spread like fire). The captain, in hope of insurance compensation, threw 36 stricken slaves overboard. The story is taken from an economic historian’s report. “When they arrived in Guadeloupe, indigenous people offered them herbs. Some got their sight back but many Africans were lost.” What moments do her paintings describe? “They don’t – that’s the point, they’re about how the drama courses through this room. Even telling this story now, you and I will be seeing different things.” I look at images on Himid’s iPad: surreal, contemporary, tense – there is no slavish (if the adjective passes in the context) illustration, these paintings are an unnerving extrapolation, they are about memory and responsibility. The story is about blindness, the work about vision. It is crammed with hints: a woman trying to get up in blind panic from a yellow couch; an unappeasable grey sea through a cabin window; the shocked features of the man in the purple gilet standing by; and a lock, a conspicuous, disturbing, surreal motif – the spanner in the works. Himid’s uncanny gift is to investigate the afterlife of history, to see how it pervades each of us like a dye. In her imaginatively ambitious work Cotton.com (2002), a long brass plaque (it extends across a gallery wall) is engraved as follows: “He said I looked like a painting by Murillo as I carried water for the gang just because I balanced the bucket on my head.” She found a version of this sentence in Manchester’s Portico library: “The book was a plantation inspector’s report, an Englishman sent to Carolina. This extraordinary phrase jumped out at me. I couldn’t leave it with him, I had to give her agency.” The brass plaque focuses on art’s uneasy relationship to suffering – looking like a Murillo does not lighten the weight of the woman’s water bucket. But where Himid takes a huge imaginative leap is in turning text by Lancashire mill workers and enslaved Africans into patterns. Cotton.com is a detailed, infinitely varied, wordless dialogue in black and white – nothing crudely polarised. “All my work is saying: let’s put this on the table, communicate, negotiate, see what is the same about us, glory in the differences.” The Turner prize show will reintroduce her splendidly shocking piece, entitled with sombre humour, Swallow hard: the Lancaster Dinner Service (2007). “Service” takes on a sinister hue as English ceramics become hosts to images of slavery. A traditional serving dish in blue-and-white, with dainty gold handles, has a portrait of a black woman on its lid: her expression is unhappy and watchful, another world in her gaze. Himid understands the power of the hybrid intimately. To what extent might this stem from being mixed race herself? Himid’s father was from Zanzibar, her mother Lancastrian. “The thing about having a white English mother and black father is you can see life in two ways. You can see it as a place where you can’t belong. There have been times, places, spaces where that’s been true. I don’t think this subject has been discussed enough. For some people it [being mixed race] is very difficult. But if you put your mind to it, attempt to understand what being human is, you can have many more insights into how things work and experiences that are a privilege. For me, there will always be a struggle with belonging, although the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.” Himid’s father and mother met and fell in love in London in the early 50s. Her father was studying education at London university, her mother was at the Royal College of Art. “They’d go to wild parties with African students…” When her father returned to Zanzibar, he “sent for” her mother. Did her mother ever talk about how she felt about moving to Zanzibar? “It was a massive thing to do then,” says Himid, “but she is a rather pragmatic, cool woman.” Lubaina was born in 1954, named after “one of the numerous handmaidens of Mohammed – a lesser one, not up there with Fatima”. Her mother had been in Zanzibar only two years when her father fell ill. “My father would get malaria every year but one year he got it and was dead within the week. My mother couldn’t go home at once. She agreed to do the traditional 40 days and 40 nights [of mourning] alone. She could have stayed. Or she could have left me behind – the family would have brought me up.” Was it painful for her father’s family to let her go? “I think so – losing him first, then me. He died in early November. By Christmas Eve I was in Blackpool, where my English grandmother lived.” Lubaina was four months old. Does she wonder what her life would have been like if she had stayed in Zanzibar? “I absolutely do. But I think I have tried to do whatever it is I would have done. I would have taught. I’d have always wanted to teach.” Her mother, she explains, was a fabric designer. African-inspired textiles? “No – paisleys and stripes for Marks &amp; Spencer. Lots of her textiles appeared on the high street. I might have done what I do in a lot of my paintings and design kangas [sarongs].” Has she been back to Zanzibar? “For many years I didn’t go. It took me so long. I was worried about returning, but when I got there in 1997 it was like being in Manchester – familiar and easy to belong. Everybody in the street looked the same and different as I do. It is a place of many crossroads, although there were more sets of people there when I was born… the whole gamut of people in a place that is about trade.” She grew up in north London, went to Maida Vale high school for girls, studied theatre design at Wimbledon College of Arts (graduating in 1976) and went on to the Royal College (getting her master’s in 1984). Her work is indebted to theatre. She rejoices in the memory of Peter Brook’s work and the thrill of going to Blackpool Tower circus with its blue, pink and green fountains and its trapeze artists. Audience matters to her. “When people come to see my work, I want them to bring their own story to the space because I’ve attempted to bring mine and other people’s – big political debates and simple stories about love and loss. I want the gallery – or even Folkestone beach, where I have a public art piece (a jelly mould pavilion) – to be where those conversations begin.” Growing up, she appreciated the “Europeanness” of London but has discovered over the years that “belonging is not about geographical place”. It is about “particular friends, mostly women, mostly artists with whom I belong”. She adds: “I belong in making places too: studios, workshops, kitchens and sheds.” We go up to her studio, a first-floor room with three sash windows and sunlight pouring in. And I finally get round to asking – a measure of how much else there has been to talk about – how she feels about being nominated for the Turner prize, and about being the oldest nominee. “I’m sure this is true of everybody of 63 but I feel 45. It keeps surprising me. I feel a bit of a fraud but, clearly, I am 63. I’m aware of more years behind me than in front and that’s sobering because there are a lot of paintings I still want to make. I’ve always been in a bit of a hurry. I’ve made a lot of work. Death was in my mind from an early age.” No need to unpack that remark. So death is a spur? “Yes, come on, come on – make some more!” And is being a nominee galvanising or stressful? “I find it a little stressful because I do want to make a beautiful show.” In terms of galvanising, she says the nomination has brought with it opportunities to work with people that might otherwise have been slow to materialise “and that is really nice”. Does she feel competitive? “I’m classically uncompetitive – to my chagrin. I once did this walk, which is meant to be 36 miles from Keswick, to Barrow. At 30 miles, I thought: ‘Do you know something? I’ve had enough.’” She laughs: “My life is not about winning in that way.” The Turner Prize Exhibition is at the Ferens gallery, Hull, from 26 September - 7 January, 2018. The winner will be announced on 5 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/19/trump-tower-daca-protest-congress-democrats-arrests","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T19:42:19Z","webTitle":"Three Democratic congressmen arrested at Trump tower Daca protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/19/trump-tower-daca-protest-congress-democrats-arrests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/19/trump-tower-daca-protest-congress-democrats-arrests","fields":{"headline":"Three Democratic congressmen arrested at Trump tower Daca protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three Democratic members of Congress were arrested outside Trump Tower on Tuesday, at a protest against the president’s cancellation of protections for so-called Dreamers, undocumented migrants brought to the US as children. Representatives Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, Luis Gutiérrez of Illinois and Adriano Espaillat of New York were among a small group of demonstrators who sat down in the street on Fifth Avenue and refused to move. The Democratic speaker of New York’s city council, Melissa Mark-Viverito, was also handcuffed and led away. An aide to Gutiérrez said there were 10 arrests in total. In a statement, Gutiérrez said: “We’re taking the necessary steps to make it clear to President Trump, the Republicans and the Democrats that we will continue this peaceful fight for Dreamers and immigrants as long as it takes to enact legislation and put Dreamers in a safe place.” The protesters were demanding that Congress pass legislation to protect thousands of young immigrants from deportation. Trump announced on 5 September that he would end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a controversial Obama-era program, in March 2018. The president made the move in order to forestall a lawsuit from attorneys general opposing the program. Attorneys general from 15 states and Washington DC subsequently sued the federal government over Trump’s decision, with California pursuing its own suit. Obama called Trump’s decision “cruel and wrong”. Democratic leaders subsequently indicated that they were close to a deal with Trump to protect from possible deportation the 690,000 people covered by the program. Organizers of the Tuesday protest had said the lawmakers had planned to get arrested. “A few congressmen and elected officials gathering in front of Trump Tower doesn’t mean much,” Gutiérrez said, “if it is not backed up by the grassroots and allies, and today we are standing with diverse allies to make sure Congress and the president do more than just talk about solutions: they actually follow through with action.” Gutiérrez, a 24-year-veteran of Congress from the South Side of Chicago, was arrested in August after a similar protest outside the White House. Donald Trump delivered an address at the United Nations earlier. He was scheduled to stay at Trump Tower overnight but was not present for the protest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/19/hurricane-maria-caribbean-oecd-aid-rules-assistance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T19:07:38Z","webTitle":"Our hurricane-hit islands deserve aid.

The rules that block it are wrong","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a manner reminiscent of Stephen King’s Bazaar of Bad Dreams, dark clouds of despair and destruction hover yet again over the Caribbean with the passage of Hurricane Maria. The most recent version of our recurring ecological nightmare included Hurricane Harvey followed by Hurricane Irma, the latter setting a new record of three consecutive days as a category 5 storm with maximum wind speeds of 185mph, and leaving a trail of devastation British foreign secretary Boris Johnson described as “absolutely hellish”. Maria’s full fury is yet to be revealed but social media posts from Dominica’s prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, and acting high commissioner for Dominica to the UK, Janet Charles, early on Tuesday morning described the destruction, the latter posting on Facebook: “Dominica has been brutalised by the hurricane. Please let the world know. We need help!” Communications with Dominica have since been lost. The London-based high commissions from the Caribbean, while outside the hurricane’s path, are not immune from its wrath. We’re currently contacting loved ones at home, planning yet another round of appeals for assistance, and continuing our prayers for protection from the ravages of this cycle of bad weather and failing that, the strength to resist until the close of the Atlantic hurricane season at the end of November. The Caribbean now finds itself fighting on two fronts. First, against nature’s fury, second, against public opinion that questions whether the hurricane-ravaged islands are deserving of international aid. Britain’s call for urgent changes to international rules on aid to allow UK development assistance budgets to be used to help victims of these hurricanes has unbelievably been met with resistance. Many in the Caribbean share Theresa May’s frustration with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) development assistance committee (DAC) rules that exclude countries such as St Kitts and Nevis and British Overseas Territories including Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos from receiving much-needed official development assistance from international aid budgets. However, the response to the UK’s call for an update to these rules established 40 years ago has been disheartening. The prevailing view of the international donor community is that the gross national income per capita of these islands is too high for them to have access to aid budgets designed to relieve poverty, a perspective shared by the international NGO community. As people in hurricane-struck islands struggle to find any kind of footing, the international development charity Christian Aid argued: “The [UK] overseas aid budget is quite rightly subject to serious scrutiny and a set of rules which ringfence overseas aid spending to ensure it goes to the poorest people in the poorest countries. Overseas Territories are not among the world’s poorest countries. In fact, the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, has a higher GDP per capita than the UK.” The statement concluded with the stony suggestion that: “The companies and investors that use tax havens like some of the British Overseas Territories, all have a role to play in rebuilding those communities.” This perspective is premised on two misconceptions. First, the egregious notion that “tax havens” exist in the Caribbean. While the Caribbean contains low tax jurisdictions, they form part of a wider strategy to diversify Caribbean economies. Moreover, the development of international business and financial centres mirrors the practice of many developed countries as shown by a report published by Oxfam last December, in which Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are ranked among the world’s 10 lowest-tax jurisdictions. The second fallacy is the limited way in which the deserving poor are identified. DAC rules restrict overseas aid to low- and middle-income countries based on GNI per capita as computed by the World Bank. This classification by economic data alone is both dated and myopic. It ignores the acute vulnerability of small countries, particularly those island states in the Caribbean and Pacific vulnerable to catastrophic storms. For over four decades, the Commonwealth of Nations, the recognised champion of small states in terms of policy research and global advocacy, has demonstrated that small states face a unique set of development challenges because of their size, limited range of products and exports, scarce financial resources and susceptibility to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Through the Commonwealth vulnerability index, the international donor community was offered an additional criterion to determine the classification of developing countries. This is yet to become a reality. In the blink of an eye, small islands states can be hurled from seeming prosperity to absolute poverty, lacking the basic human needs: water, food, clothing, shelter and sanitation. As Roosevelt Skerrit wrote following the passage of Hurricane Maria: “Initial reports are of widespread devastation. So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace. My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains … We will need help, my friends, we will need help of all kinds.” And ironically, although Antigua and Barbuda was pummelled by Irma, as it recently exceeded the DAC country income threshold, it may be deemed ineligible for official development assistance at this year’s review. Unlike those in the US threatened by Harvey, Irma and possibly Maria, there is nowhere to run to on Caribbean islands. And there is no pool of resources domestically to mobilise afterwards. As depicted in the media recently following Irma, it is almost like game over; nothing left but hardship and faith. And in the midst of the efforts to rebuild – for Caribbean people are formidable – the provision of essential needs is thwarted by DAC rules. It is not as if the OECD, the club of the world’s wealthiest countries, is being asked to set a precedent, for this has already been done by the European Union through the European Development Fund (EDF). In 2013, when the 11th EDF, the EU’s main instrument for providing development aid to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and to overseas countries and territories, was concluded, the main modification was to ensure more flexibility and faster reactions in the case of unexpected events. A new shock-absorbing scheme was created to help countries to mitigate the short-term effects of exogenous shocks such as natural disasters. I hope that the UN and the Commonwealth will discuss the vulnerability of small island developing states in New York this week as the international community gathers for the United Nations general assembly, the Commonwealth foreign affairs ministers meeting and the UK-hosted pre-2018 Commonwealth summit reception. On Tuesday, as St Kitts and Nevis braces in anticipation of Hurricane Maria, it also marks its 34th anniversary of independence. We pray that it has cause for thanksgiving and, if it comes to the worst, that the Commonwealth will demonstrate duty of care and the international community will follow in doing what is right and just and come to its aid. Like every island ravaged by hurricane, it deserves it. • Guy Hewitt is Barbados high commissioner"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-trump-at-the-un-bluster-and-belligerence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:02:25Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Trump at the UN: bluster and belligerence | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-trump-at-the-un-bluster-and-belligerence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-trump-at-the-un-bluster-and-belligerence","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Trump at the UN: bluster and belligerence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Whatever its difficulties, the United Nations must surely be cherished. Founded in 1945 under US leadership after the defeat of Nazism and imperial Japan, the UN remains the central pillar of the global order. At its core has stood the ambition that peace, international security and human rights would be better protected than they were by the 1930s League of Nations (whose founding treaty the US Senate refused to ratify). The UN is the only existing forum where the representatives of all nation states can be brought together to try to address crises and common challenges. Donald Trump’s first address to the organisation’s annual general assembly was anticipated with dread by many – and rightly so. This US president is after all the first in history to have made heaping scorn on the UN something of a pastime. His views on the subject have ranged from crude hostility to abject ignorance. The speech he delivered was scripted – not the ramblings of a maverick whose taste for rash tweets and cheap provocations have become an almost daily routine. It was deeply worrying all the same. Unlike his eloquent predecessor, President Trump trades in crass belligerence. His speech will be remembered for its ominous language. On North Korea he mocked its young leader Kim Jong-un, saying that “rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime”. He threatened that “if [the US] is forced to defend itself and its allies, it will have no other choice but to destroy North Korea”. Iran, he said, was “a corrupt dictatorship” whose “chief export is violence, bloodshed and chaos”. Trump called the 2015 nuclear deal “the worse transaction ever” – a sign perhaps he may be getting ready to pull out of it, or ensuring Iran is provoked enough to do so itself. What the White House could have done is appeal to the Iranian people directly, offering a “new beginning” in the relationship between the two nations. But the US president has not displayed the slightest interest in fundamental democratic values. His speech carried enough of a whiff of “regime change” to make Tehran think hard over nuclear compliance. As last week’s UN security council vote on sanctioning North Korea has shown, there is an international consensus on the dangers presented by Pyongyang’s behaviour. But on Iran, President Trump risks finding himself in stark isolation, with European allies already making clear they want to preserve the 2015 agreement, not tear it up. The US president no doubt speaks to his base as much as he does to an international audience. But the nationalist ideology he espouses was yet again made clear, not least with the emphasis he put on “strong, sovereign, independent nations”, rather than on the body of universal values that the UN is meant to uphold. President Trump wants the UN to put pressure on North Korea and Iran, but he’s brought little clarity as to the wider strategy he contemplates. Threats and grandstanding are just bluster, not policy. Crises require a deftness the Trump administration has failed to demonstrate. He wants allies to back him, but seems oblivious that his lack of personal credibility is an obstacle to international cooperation. An “America First” approach runs counter to the UN’s multilateralism. His credo could be summed up by his claim that nations acting in their own self-interest create a more stable world. The question is what rules would states operate under? Not the UN’s, Trump’s response appeared to suggest. The president may want to speak of “principled realism”, but he is a reckless and dangerous leader, sitting, alas, in a most powerful position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/20/millennials-spend-three-times-more-of-income-on-housing-than-grandparents","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T23:01:30Z","webTitle":"Millennials spend three times more of income on housing than grandparents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/20/millennials-spend-three-times-more-of-income-on-housing-than-grandparents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/20/millennials-spend-three-times-more-of-income-on-housing-than-grandparents","fields":{"headline":"Millennials spend three times more of income on housing than grandparents","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Millennials are spending three times more of their income on housing than their grandparents yet are often living in worse accommodation, says a study launched by former Conservative minister David Willetts that warns of a “housing catastrophe”. The generation currently aged 18-36 are typically spending over a third of their post-tax income on rent or about 12% on mortgages, compared with 5%-10% of income spent by their grandparents in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite spending more, young people today are more likely to live in overcrowded and smaller spaces, and face longer journeys to work – commuting for the equivalent of three days a year more than their parents. The research by Willetts’ intergenerational commission at the Resolution Foundation thinktank also reveals that today’s 30-year-olds are only half as likely to own their own home as their baby boomer parents. They are four times as likely to rent privately than two generations ago, a sector which has the worst record for housing quality, the report claims. The report’s authors argue that the housing crisis is a huge part of public anxiety about the country’s direction, a factor in the result of the EU referendum last year and in the general election in June. A young family today has to save for 19 years on average to afford a typical deposit compared with three years for the previous generation, the report states. “This is the biggest problem facing the younger generation,” said Willetts. “It depresses their living standards and quality of life. It is very important for the Tory party to open up the route to home ownership again. A lot of twentysomethings also have horror stories of bad landlords and we need to help them as well.” By highlighting intergenerational inequality, Willetts hopes to break down public opposition to mass housebuilding – not least from parents who despair at the difficulty their children face in finding good housing. He is arguing for a new towns programme in which the government buys land that does not have planning consent to create large new communities of homes for sale. The report came as the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, also announced a wholesale review of social housing policy in the wake of the fatal fire at Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey block in north Kensington which combined council housing and a small number of private rented homes. Speaking to the National Housing Federation conference in Birmingham, Javid said: “In one of the richest, most privileged corners of the UK – the world, even – would a fire like this have happened in a privately owned block of luxury flats? If you believe that the answer is no, even if you think it was simply less likely, then it’s clear that we need a fundamental rethink of social housing in this country.” He said a social housing green paper would propose reforms to the overall quality of social homes, the rights of tenants and will address what can be done to ensure their complaints are taken seriously and dealt with properly. Grenfell residents claim they raised concerns about fire safety at the block on several occasions but were not heeded. The Resolution Foundation report found that almost a third of 25-to-34-year-olds living in private rented flats live in properties which fail the decent homes standard. Responding to the Resolution Foundation report, Dan Wilson Craw, director of campaign group Generation Rent, said: “Young adults have been hit with a double whammy of rising house prices which make ownership unaffordable, and rising rents which they cannot escape. The chorus of demands on the government to act decisively is getting louder, but it’s important not to neglect the growing numbers of older renters. Because getting a mortgage becomes harder beyond the age of 40, many face a lifetime of renting. “Millions of people, young and old, are stuck renting for the foreseeable future and they need much greater security than the market currently provides, with protection from eviction and rising rents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/19/scottish-and-welsh-leaders-seek-to-ward-off-westminster-hijack-of-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:02:15Z","webTitle":"Scottish and Welsh leaders seek to ward off Westminster 'hijack' of powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/19/scottish-and-welsh-leaders-seek-to-ward-off-westminster-hijack-of-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/19/scottish-and-welsh-leaders-seek-to-ward-off-westminster-hijack-of-powers","fields":{"headline":"Scottish and Welsh leaders seek to ward off Westminster 'hijack' of powers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Scottish and Welsh first ministers have attempted to increase the pressure on the UK government over Brexit by jointly publishing a series of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones are working together to try to fight off what they see as a bid by Westminster to grab powers that will be returning following Brexit. The pair jointly tabled 38 amendments to the withdrawal bill and wrote to Theresa May insisting that, while they wanted to work with the UK government, they would do so only if their suggested changes were accepted. Jones accused the Tory government of trying to “hijack” powers that ought to go to Cardiff while the Scottish government released a list of 111 examples of policy areas that it claimed the UK wanted to centralise including railway ownership, GM foods, pesticides regulation, the sharing of criminal data, protected food names, state aid, EU citizens’ voting rights and fracking. In their letter to the prime minister, Sturgeon and Jones called on the UK government to work with – not against – the devolved nations. The two leaders said: “The Scottish and Welsh governments recognise our responsibility to prepare our laws for the upheaval of EU withdrawal. We stand ready to work in a cooperative and coordinated way with others to prepare for Brexit. But the approach of the UK government to devolution in the ... bill is preventing this essential cooperation and coordination.” The letter said the governments had begun to consider preparing alternative continuity bills if their amendments were ignored – but this was not their preferred way forward. They added: “We want a [bill] that can be made to work with, not against, devolution. The current bill will need to be substantially amended.” The pair said they hoped the amendments would be received “as a constructive contribution by the devolved administrations”. Explaining his government’s approach, Jones, who is also Labour leader in Wales, said: “Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon and I all have very different political positions, but an issue as important as Brexit requires us to put our political differences aside and work together to provide stability for the sake of our economy, jobs and public services. One government cannot simply hijack powers from the other two.” The Scottish and Welsh governments say all EU powers over devolved competencies should be repatriated directly to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. But in clause 11 of the EU withdrawal bill, the UK government states many new powers will be devolved – but only after they first return to Westminster. Scotland’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, who is about to start talks with the Scottish Tories about striking a deal on the amendments and powers, said in a letter to MSPs at Holyrood: “The restrictions in clause 11 of the bill apply to many areas of Scottish devolved responsibility vital to the success of our country, such as agriculture, the environment, fisheries, forestry. The restrictions have the effect that the Scottish parliament would have no say over what is done with these important policy areas after EU withdrawal.” Russell acknowledged many EU powers will need to be shared at UK level in joint frameworks; Scotland’s farmers, food industry leaders and businesses also want UK-level laws over devolved competencies. The Scottish government is likely to give way on many topics in the list of 111 but will battle hard over others, such as fracking, GM foods, rail franchises, EU citizens’ voting rights – because that could affect a future Scottish independence referendum – and economic investment. Damian Green, the UK government’s first secretary of state, said that ultimately more powers would go to the devolved governments after Brexit. But he said: “The important thing now is to work our way through these lists and find the areas where we will need to maintain a common UK or GB approach, as well as those areas where it will make sense to transfer powers direct to the devolved governments. When it is better to devolve then that is what we will do, as we have done for the last 20 years.” He said the UK government would listen to those who offered improvements to the bill but would do nothing that risked harm to the UK. “Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast will receive more decision-making powers as a result of this process. But the UK government will not risk our internal UK market, or make life more difficult or more expensive for UK companies, workers or consumers. “We all observe the same broad EU rules now. Doing things four different ways – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – will not be the best way if it adds costs to companies and customers across the UK. I hope and expect that we can make progress in the talks that are planned for the coming week.” The Westminster government gave examples where it said a common approach across the UK could help companies and customers across the four nations. For example if there was no common approach to food labelling – currently controlled by EU law – companies might have to produce different labels for Scotland and England. The Scottish Conservatives said the SNP was trying to use Brexit as a way of furthering its own independence agenda. The Scottish Conservative deputy leader, Jackson Carlaw, said Russell’s list simply set out the policy areas currently controlled by the EU that were coming back to the UK. He said: “The test is simple. Let’s devolve what we can, but keep UK rules where necessary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2017/sep/23/knowledge-and-nonsense-in-the-studio-with-guardian-football-weekly","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T08:00:11Z","webTitle":"Knowledge and nonsense – in the studio with Guardian Football Weekly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/sep/23/knowledge-and-nonsense-in-the-studio-with-guardian-football-weekly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2017/sep/23/knowledge-and-nonsense-in-the-studio-with-guardian-football-weekly","fields":{"headline":"Knowledge and nonsense – in the studio with Guardian Football Weekly","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Monday and Thursday mornings, at around 11 o’clock, I wander into an airless room with four microphones. Three other people walk in. We all say hello, and then we talk about football for about an hour or so. Some smart people edit out all the mistakes, and stick the results up on iTunes that afternoon. And that is how we make the Guardian Football Weekly. It isn’t complicated, it isn’t scripted, and that’s probably why it works. If you have never listened to Football Weekly before, the show ranges from proper analysis of what has happened on the pitch in the UK and around Europe, to commentary about serious issues off it, balanced with some complete nonsense. I took over as presenter of the podcast – produced twice a week, despite the name – from James Richardson at the start of this football season. I would often cover for him when he was hosting World’s Strongest Man or on holiday, so I knew my way around.In the past couple of weeks, we’ve covered all the football and the weekly crisis merry-go-round – Chelsea to Arsenal to Liverpool so far, with Crystal Palace a constant. We’ve also discussed the racism allegations surrounding the England women’s football team, and the latest Fifa controversy. (Well, the latest at the point of writing; there will be another one tomorrow.) But we’ve also discussed a Spaniard missing a game because of an infected spot and a Scottish player drinking too much and falling in a river on his birthday. I like the nonsense. Fortunately there are producers there to keep me focused, at least part of the time. Every week about half a million people listen to Football Weekly, which the Guardian has been making for 11 years. There are buckets of football podcasts around, so the competition is pretty tough. Where we’re lucky is that the Guardian has an amazing set of sports writers, most of whom are keen to come on the pod and are as good speaking out loud as they are on the page. I’m just there to ask them questions. Those questions begin in the form of a document shared by our producer, Jonathan Fisher. This will be on a Friday for the Monday Football Weekly pod, or a Tuesday for Thursday’s edition. We will just dip into it whenever something happens and start adding in notes. If I’m not doing anything on a Saturday night, for example, I can stick a load of stuff in there after the games have happened. The night before we record, I’ll write an intro. By then we will know which of the contributors are on, and which games they’ve been to, so we can think about what to ask whom. But we don’t really want to script too much: it’s better for me, and the listeners, if they just chat away and I sit there listening. I also work for Sky Sports, doing a predictions show with Paul Merson, and present a radio show on TalkSport. I like all of them to be as unscripted as possible. That’s rarer in television, and it’s of course riskier, but it’s also way more fun – you get more highs and lows than something that has been scripted within an inch of its life. Fortunately there are always people on Twitter ready to let you know when you have hit a low point. On a day we’re recording, I arrive at the office around 9.30am. Jason Phipps, the Guardian’s head of audio, will hopefully have made a cafetiere. Jonathan will be complaining about his sore foot. And I’ll proceed to be a bit too noisy for other staff working around me. I like to try to make Jonathan do all the stories from Europe. It’s a shortcoming; for a decade now, I’ve been immersed in the Premier League for work and in the lower leagues and amateur football as a fan and as a player – so I haven’t spent a lot of time watching La Liga and Serie A. I try to keep across it – it is my job now, after all – but there is a lot of football to watch, and you can’t know everything. I’m lucky that Football Weekly contributors such as Paolo Bandini (on Italy) and Philippe Auclair (on France) are so ridiculously knowledgeable. When it comes to the panel, we try to find a balance between continuity for the listener, and introducing them to lots of different points of view. We have a lot of regular contributors who have featured on the show for years: Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson, Barney Ronay, Paul MacInnes, Jacob Steinberg, Amy Lawrence, Sid Lowe – apologies to those I’ve missed. But we’re also trying to bring in other Guardian sports writers who have been less of a fixture on the show – it has been great to bring Paul Doyle back into the fold, for example. We’re also looking to bring some interesting current and ex professionals on to the panel, along with some voices from outside the Guardian, but I’m very conscious that Football Weekly changing its presenter is already a massive deal for the show, so we’re not trying to rush through any other change. So everyone arrives for the recording. Jonathan Wilson is late because he has been to the gym. The panel will have been sent a loose running order so they know what to expect, but not a script. We all have a glass of water and maybe a coffee in front of us, everyone says what they have had for breakfast to make sure their microphone is working, and then we start recording. We might stop occasionally just to ring Sid up, and people can stop mid-sentence if they like and re-record a bit, but I would rather just let it flow. When we’re recording, I try to do the show “as live” – ie, if we need to go back and edit it for clarity, we can, but I tend not to stop and start it too much, or re-do segments. It’s an approach that I like because it means people are really concentrating and focused. The knowledge that we can edit, however, means I’m happier to let conversations run on a bit in case we go off on a brilliant tangent, safe in the knowledge that it can be cut.When I got a call from the Guardian asking me to host Football Weekly and Football Weekly Extra, as a Guardian reader and someone who shares a lot of the Guardian’s principles – and as someone who does the G2 crossword every morning – I genuinely felt honoured. And I love doing it. It doesn’t take football too seriously – which is a relief, as so many places do. And I feel the listeners want the balance of knowledge and analysis with news of Sid’s dog, whether Philippe will learn to drive, how Jonathan’s new orthopaedic shoes are, or just Barry’s life in general. I’m just waiting for the right moment to tell everyone about the time I borrowed Trevor Nelson’s microwave … Catch up with Football Weekly episodes here, or subscribe via iTunes"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/20/why-are-children-so-annoying-google","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T07:00:40Z","webTitle":"Why are children so annoying?

As a father (of one) and a stepfather (of two) here are the first 60 reasons that spring to mind. There are many, many more, and I’ve limited myself to the years between toddlerdom and adolescence. Got your own suggestions? The comments are open … 1. Because they won’t shut up. From the second they wake to that blissful moment when they close their eyes, their lips are flapping. They’ll tell you about their favourite toy, their new best friend, the bogey they’ve just fished out of their nose. Everything gets a running commentary. 2. Because they insist on a reaction. “Really?” and “Oh yes?” will only cut it for a couple of minutes. 3. Because when they’re not telling you stuff, they’re asking you stuff. Usually stupid things like, “What’s your favourite colour?” 4. Because they won’t accept your replies. Your favourite colour can’t be yellow, because yellow is yucky. 5. Because if there is more than one child in the room, the second will pay just enough attention to know that a question has been asked, but not what it was or how you answered it. He or she will then insist that you repeat it all. 6. Because they are always suffering. If they’re not losing teeth (not really their fault, to be fair), they’re stubbing their toes, or scraping their knees, or falling into nettles. And they’re such drama queens. “It’s like a knife in my mouth!” is how your typical nine-year-old describes an itchy gum. 7. Because they have no patience. If they need a tissue, they need it now. They’re never hungry but starving; never thirsty but dying of thirst. 8. Because they make you listen to Fun Kids (it’s a radio station). 9. Because they claim to believe in Father Christmas, the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy. 10. Because all of these cost you money. 11. Because they need your help. With scissors, with Sellotape, with buttons, shoe laces, ties … 12. Because they insist they don’t need your help. 13. Because they want to eat cereal without milk. 14. Because they won’t eat their crusts. 15. Because they want you to cut up their apples. 16. Because they put on “shows”. 17. Because they want you to play with them. 18. Because they will not leave you alone in the bathroom. Five seconds after that door shuts, they’re “desperate for a wee”, or a chat, or something. There’s always something. 19. Because they sometimes are desperate for a wee. Make them wait and you’ll need to get the mop out. 20. Because they can’t live in the present. No sooner has one birthday passed than they’re planning the next one, or Easter, or Halloween, or Christmas. And you’re going to hear about it all. 21. Because they won’t just put it in an email. 22. Because they’re obsessed with “potions” and “perfumes”. 23. Because these are actually flowers rotting in a glass of water. 24. Because they can’t see a glass of water without knocking it over. 25. Because they collect shoe boxes, which they call treasure chests. 26. Because that “treasure” is plastic tat. 27. Because they’re such terrible liars. As in, they do it all the time. 28. Because they’re such terrible liars. As in, they do it really badly. 29. Because they won’t let you throw anything out, whether it’s the building blocks they’ve had since their first birthday or the stick they picked up walking back from school. 30. Because it’s not just a stick. It’s “Mr Sticky”. 31. Because no, actually, it’s not “Mr Sticky.” It’s just “Sticky”. No – it’s “My little brother, Sticky McStickington”. 32. And because once it has a name, it has to have clothes, and a bed, and a place at the table, and everything you already begrudge providing for a living, breathing child. 33. Because every lid that needs to be on, they leave off. 34. Because they can’t wipe their bottoms properly. 35. Because they never, ever put their filthy underwear in the laundry basket. 36. Because if there’s more than one of them, not a day will go by without one punching, kicking, pinching or slapping the other(s). 37. Because the culprit will insist it was an accident. 38. Because they make you post letters to pop stars and TV presenters. 39. Because they can’t walk down the road without tripping over the one loose paving stone. 40. Because they try to tell you how the world works. 41. Because whenever you turn on the TV, it’s showing My Little Pony. 42. Because however tired they were last night, they still wake up too early. 43. Because they bring you cold toast and an orange and call it breakfast in bed. 44. Because they can’t find anything or anyone on their own. If they are at home and need their mother, for example, they will immediately approach someone who is not their mother and ask them where their mother is. It will never occur to them to look. 45. Because when they do find their mother, they will immediately ask her what she is doing – even when it’s something obvious like reading a book or making a cup of tea. 46. Because they want a phone. 47. Because they claim all their friends already have phones. 48. Because you can’t have sex till they’re asleep. 49. Because they want to stay up till midnight. 50. Because whenever you ask them to do something, the first word out of their mouths is, “Wait!” 51. Because the second word is, “Why?” 52. Because when you walk down the street with two or more of them, they will all insist on talking at you. And every single one will end up in tears because the other(s) “won’t let me speak”. 53. Because when you tell them you wish you could send them to boarding school, they think you’re joking. 54. Because every remark, even when it’s just you and them in the room, starts with your title, or your name. “Mummy …”, “Papa …”, “Phillo …” whatever. Every. Single. Remark. All. Day Long. 55. Because they can’t just eat their food. They have to play with it, dissect it, moan about it, complain it’s too hot when it’s not, theatrically blow on it and, most of all, reject it, because it’s got onions in it (what kind of weirdo doesn’t like onions?), or it’s green, or it’s got “bits” in it. 56. Because they can’t even sit down properly to eat it. If they’re not balancing on one buttock, they’re standing up, or actually running round the table. 57. Because they don’t cry when you tell them off. 58. Because they do cry when you brush their hair. 59. Because they turn you into a horrible, bitter grump. 60. And because when, eventually, they stop being such noisy, needy pains in the arse, they decide that they hate you and would rather die than have anything to do with you. And for some reason, even though that’s what you’ve been praying for for the past decade, that feels even worse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/24/various-echoes-of-land-and-sea-review-maria-marchant-piano","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T06:59:38Z","webTitle":"Various: Echoes of Land & Sea CD review – a fine selection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/24/various-echoes-of-land-and-sea-review-maria-marchant-piano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/24/various-echoes-of-land-and-sea-review-maria-marchant-piano","fields":{"headline":"Various: Echoes of Land & Sea CD review – a fine selection","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This neatly opens and closes with two works produced in the same year – but each utterly different.

After admitting the previous week had been his most frustrating since he took over at Anfield, the Liverpool manager endured more of the same as Leicester City exposed the brittle confidence in a team who are no closer to working out how to defend. Klopp sounded exasperated as he digested the fallout from a game that highlighted familiar failings, with both Leicester goals originating from set pieces. Shinji Okazaki, who came off the bench to such telling effect, scored the first following a half-cleared corner and Islam Slimani added a brilliant second after Liverpool were slow to react to a throw-in. “That we concede like this makes me really, really sick,” Klopp said. By that stage in the press conference Klopp had ruefully reflected on the numerous opportunities Liverpool squandered in a first half they totally dominated, enjoying 76% of possession and registering 13 shots to Leicester’s three. Yet Klopp knows those statistics count for nothing if Liverpool continue to crack at the first sign of pressure. It is now four matches without a win for them and, with no evidence of any improvement in defence despite all the work on the training ground, it is hard to escape the feeling some of the players are not good enough. Klopp’s decision to withdraw Philippe Coutinho at the interval certainly did not help Liverpool’s cause. The manager explained he had made up his mind before the game that the Brazilian, who was the best player by a distance in the first half, would play for only 45 minutes as he continues to build up his fitness. Whatever anyone thinks of Klopp’s thinking on that front, the departure of one player is surely no reason for a team to totally lose their way. Before the interval it had seemed a matter of when, not if, Liverpool would score. Klopp had made eight changes to the side held to a 1-1 draw at home against Burnley – Craig Shakespeare made seven to his Leicester team – and there was no hint of what was to come as Liverpool played with confidence and fluency. They created chance after chance, the majority of them arriving down their left flank, where Andrew Robertson was having a field day up against Daniel Amartey, Leicester’s makeshift right-back. It was Robertson’s cross that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, making his first Liverpool start, would have converted in the sixth minute but for Ben Chilwell’s timely intervention. Coutinho, twisting and turning on the edge of the penalty area, saw his shot parried by Ben Hamer six minutes later. Then Robertson delivered another centre from the left that Dominic Solanke, slightly off balance as he stretched to reach the ball, volleyed over when he probably should have scored. Unable to keep the ball and looking disjointed with Leonardo Ulloa playing up front alongside Slimani, Leicester were a team under siege. Coutinho fed Solanke, whose blocked shot ran into the path of Robertson just outside the six-yard box. With the angle against him, the left-back tried to steer the ball into the far corner with the outside of a boot but his effort deflected behind. Then Solanke, from another Coutinho pass, lifted the ball on to the roof of the net on the stroke of half-time. “We lived a charmed life in the first half,” said Shakespeare, who was delighted Coutinho failed to emerge after the interval. Okazaki turned out to be the game-changer. A replacement for Ulloa in the 52nd minute, the Japan international brought Leicester to life with his dynamic running as he scored the first goal and created the second. Liverpool never properly cleared their lines for the opener, which came following Marc Albrighton’s corner. Chilwell’s deep cross picked out Wes Morgan, who won the first header. Vicente Iborra, making his Leicester debut, then intelligently nodded the ball down for Okazaki, whose shot took a deflection off Robertson and beat Danny Ward. Liverpool never looked like recovering from that blow and any faint hopes they had of forcing extra time were extinguished when Slimani added a second. Running on to Okazaki’s pass following a throw-in on the Leicester right, the Algerian swept a glorious left-foot shot into the top right corner. “It’s all about the result,” Shakespeare said. “And we really showed a lot of resilience and character to come back the way we did in the second half.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/22/college-free-speech-violence-survey-junk-science","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T10:00:44Z","webTitle":"'Junk science': experts cast doubt on widely cited college free speech survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/college-free-speech-violence-survey-junk-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/college-free-speech-violence-survey-junk-science","fields":{"headline":"'Junk science': experts cast doubt on widely cited college free speech survey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Polling experts are raising concerns about a new survey that found nearly 20% of American college students believe it’s appropriate to use violence to silence offensive speech. The results of the survey have been widely cited in conservative media outlets, including by the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, and were written up by an opinion columnist for the Washington Post. The way the survey results have been presented are “malpractice” and “junk science” and “it should never have appeared in the press”, according to Cliff Zukin, a former president of the American Association of Public Opinion Polling, which sets ethical and transparency standards for polling. John Villasenor, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California Los Angeles, defended his survey as an important window into what he had called a troubling atmosphere on American campuses in which “freedom of expression is deeply imperiled”. Villasenor, a cybersecurity expert, said this was the first public opinion survey he had conducted. However, his survey was not administered to a randomly selected group of college students nationwide, what statisticians call a “probability sample”. Instead, it was given to an opt-in online panel of people who identified as current college students. “If it’s not a probability sample, it’s not a sample of anyone, it’s just 1,500 college students who happen to respond,” Zukin said, calling it “junk science”. “It’s an interesting piece of data,” Michael Traugott, a polling expert at the University of Michigan’s Center for Political Studies, said. “Whether it represents the proportion of all college students who believe this is unknown.” Villasenor said his survey had been inspired by the “increasing trend towards censorship on college campuses in recent years”, which included outright censorship and “self-censorship”. Like many other academics, Villasenor has remained concerned that university campuses are not sufficiently open to “reasonable perspectives”.He secured funding from the conservative Charles Koch Foundation to survey students this August about their views on free speech. Rather than write an academic paper, he posted some of his results online this week, arguing that given “the timeliness of the topic, I believe it is important to get some of the key results out into the public sphere immediately”. “A surprisingly large fraction of students believe it is acceptable to act – including resorting to violence – to shut down expression they consider offensive,” he wrote. His survey also found that college students had deep misunderstandings about the scope of the first amendment’s free speech protections. Some journalists and activists greeted his findings with shock, labeling them “chilling” and a call to arms. “Faculty have failed them,” a Yale professor tweeted of America’s “illiberal” college students. Villasenor’s results had gone through no peer review process. The methodology section of his online post was vague, prompting several polling experts to question how reliable the survey’s conclusions might be. Villasenor wrote in an email that he was reluctant to give a yes or no “sound bite” answer to the question of whether the students he surveyed were nationally representative of college students or not. By some measures, Villasenor wrote, the 1,500 respondents to his survey had seemed to reflect the rough demographic makeup of American college students. By others, they might not. Villasenor had calculated a margin of error for his survey results and included it in the public writeup of his report, even though the sample of students he had surveyed was not random. Public polling experts said this was inappropriate and a basic error. Zukin called it “very misleading” and “malpractice”. By including a margin of error, the author appears to be “trying to overstate the quality of his survey”, said Chris Jackson, the vice-president of Ipsos Public Affairs, a public opinion firm. Timothy Johnson, the current president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, called it “really not appropriate”. Villasenor said he disagreed that including a margin of error was any kind of “malpractice”, noting that he had included a caveat in his online post, warning that a margin of error was relevant “to the extent” that his survey respondents were actually representative of US college undergraduates. Some journalists writing up his results, including at the Washington Post, made no mention of his caveat, Villasenor noted. He said they should have: “The caveat was there.” His results “do say something useful about the national on-campus climate in relation to free expression,” he said, noting that the survey included respondents from 49 states. His survey had posed the question about violence and speech to students in late August, in the days immediately after neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched through the university town of Charlottesville, Virginia, leading to the murder of one young woman. This was “purely coincidental”, he said. “It wasn’t planned that way.” Jackson, the Ipsos Public Affairs vice-president, said the post-Charlottesville moment would certainly have affected students’ responses to a question about whether it was appropriate for a student group to use violence to prevent the speech of a “very controversial speaker” who is “known for making offensive and hurtful statements”. “If someone asks you that two days after Charlottesville, who do you think of immediately? You think of neo-Nazis,” Jackson said. If the survey question had explicitly asked college students about neo-Nazis, and “19% of college students said it’s okay to use violence against neo-Nazis on campus ... I think people would find that more palatable.” Last year, a different, more nationally representative survey of American college student opinions on free speech on campus found strikingly different results from Villasenor’s survey. Villasenor’s survey asked students if it was more important for colleges to create an “open learning environment where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints, even if it means allowing speech that is offensive or biased against certain groups of people” or “a positive learning environment for all students by prohibiting certain speech or expression of viewpoints that are offensive or biased against certain groups of people”. He found that 53% of his respondents said they supported the “positive learning environment” that required “prohibiting certain speech”, a result Villasenor called proof that “students appear to prefer an environment in which their institution is expected to create an environment that shelters them from offensive views”. The 2016 Gallup survey of more than 3,000 college students, who had been selected in a carefully randomized process from a nationally representative group of colleges, had asked students the same question. It found that 78% of students said colleges should create an “open learning environment”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/20/uk-growth-italy-france-germany-oecd-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"UK growth will trail Italy, France and Germany next year, says OECD","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/20/uk-growth-italy-france-germany-oecd-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/20/uk-growth-italy-france-germany-oecd-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK growth will trail Italy, France and Germany next year, says OECD","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Italy, France and Germany will grow faster than Britain next year as Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on consumer confidence and deter much-needed business investment, according to the latest economic forecasts by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The UK’s GDP growth will drop from 1.6% this year to 1% next year, in line with the OECD’s previous forecast, but Italy’s national income will grow by 1.2% in 2018, up 0.4 percentage points from the forecast in the June. Germany and France were already on course to beat the UK with growth rates of 2.1% and 1.6% respectively in line with a bounce-back in activity across the eurozone. The OECD said: “In the United Kingdom, GDP growth has continued to slow with an easing of consumption and investment growth. A further slowing is expected in 2018, while uncertainty remains over the outcome of negotiations around Brexit.” The forecasts put pressure on the chancellor Philip Hammond to lift the economy with a spending boost in his autumn budget on 22 November. Ministers are understood to be lobbying the Treasury for extra cash to offset planned cuts to services and to cover a wage rise for public sector workers. MPs are also concerned that private sector investment will be mothballed while Brexit talks continue, damaging the economy’s long-term growth rate. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, who chairs parliament’s treasury select committee, said: “We have been hearing for some time that business investment has been slowing down and today’s OECD report bears that out and crystallises the fears that many of us had about Brexit dragging down our economy.” Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: “Brexit is set to turn Britain into the sick man of Europe again.” Shadow chancellor John McDonnell urged the government to change course on the economy to prevent a slump in investment. He also highlighted the OECD warning that a bubble in the housing market remained a threat to the UK’s financial stability, especially with an increase in interest rates by the Bank of England possible before the end of the year. The OECD said: “Britain’s labour market remained robust after a fall in unemployment to below 4.5% and record level of employment. But weak productivity and real wage growth persist. “The depreciation of the sterling has modestly improved export prospects but also pushed up inflation, dampening purchasing power and private consumption.” It added: “In the United Kingdom, house prices are elevated relative to rents, raising financial stability risks if rising interest rates were to trigger a housing market correction.” Japan, which has suffered from one of the slowest growth rates in the G7 for the past 25 years, will also see its GDP growth rate accelerate to a higher level than the UK’s in 2018 after the Paris-based club for the world’s richest countries revised its economic outlook for next year. The US and Canada will also enjoy strong growth in 2018, leaving the UK to sit at the bottom of the G7 growth league. Economists at the OECD were among many forecasters to predict a slump in Britain’s fortunes following the referendum, but were forced to revise their thinking following a strong recovery in the second half of last year that sent the growth rate for 2016 to 1.8%. A slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 to 0.2% and 0.3% in the second appears to show that the slowdown was delayed. Global GDP growth is projected to increase to about 3.5% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018 from 3% in 2016, slightly improved since the organisation’s last economic outlook. It said: “The recovery of business investment and trade remains weaker than needed to sustain healthy productivity growth. Wage growth has been disappointing, keeping inflation at low levels. Strong future growth in emerging market economies will depend on deeper reform. A Treasury spokesman said: “Our economy has grown continuously for four years and a record number of people are in work. “This is a strong record but we are not complacent. We must continue our focus on restoring productivity growth which is the only sustainable way to deliver higher wages and higher living standards for people across the country.” The OECD said: “The upturn has become more synchronised across countries. Investment, employment and trade are expanding.” However, it warned that “strong and sustained medium-term global growth is not yet secured”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/22/neil-gorsuch-abortion-rights-supreme-court-planned-parenthood-missouri","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-22T20:24:02Z","webTitle":"Neil Gorsuch's views on abortion to be tested by supreme court filing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/22/neil-gorsuch-abortion-rights-supreme-court-planned-parenthood-missouri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/22/neil-gorsuch-abortion-rights-supreme-court-planned-parenthood-missouri","fields":{"headline":"Neil Gorsuch's views on abortion to be tested by supreme court filing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An urgent appeal to the supreme court by Planned Parenthood has created an unexpected early test of Justice Neil Gorsuch’s views on abortion restrictions. The court’s newest member has never spoken publicly in any significant detail on one of the most divisive issues he will deal with as a justice, and he gave evasive answers about abortion during his confirmation hearing before the Senate. But on Friday, Planned Parenthood challenged abortion restrictions before the court for the first time since Gorsuch joined the bench, effectively compelling him to weigh in. At issue is whether a law preventing three Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri from performing abortions should remain in effect while the group challenges the restriction in federal court. Planned Parenthood previously convinced a district judge to suspend the law, but on 15 September, the eighth circuit court of appeals stayed the judge’s decision. Planned Parenthood has appealed the matter to the supreme court. The court’s decision, and Gorsuch’s position, is expected to be published in a matter of weeks – if Gorsuch doesn’t first weigh in by himself. Because procedural issues like this one are overseen by an individual justice, and Gorsuch is the justice with jurisdiction over the eighth circuit, the power to block Missouri’s law, leave it in place, or refer the matter to all nine justices initially belongs to him. The final ruling should offer the first clue on how far to the right Gorsuch swings on abortion. Before nominating Gorsuch to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to name justices who would overturn Roe v Wade, the seminal case on abortion rights. Few doubt that Gorsuch opposes Roe just as deeply as his predecessor. But he has never, in the 10 years he spent as an appeals court justice, ruled on an abortion rights case. And his silence on the matter has made it difficult to determine how his opposition will manifest while Roe is still the law of the land. Answering Planned Parenthood’s appeal will not be as a simple as applying his legal beliefs about Roe, because the supreme court has already struck down an abortion restriction nearly identical to Missouri’s. “I don’t think it’s hyperbolic or an exaggeration to say this could be the first time we hear from Gorsuch on abortion rights,” said Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project. Should Gorsuch rule against Planned Parenthood, the group has the ability to appeal before the full supreme court. But whatever the court decides will shape abortion access in a part of the country where it is highly restricted. For years, Missouri’s restrictions prevented all but one abortion provider, a Planned Parenthood clinic in St Louis, from operating. Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit has recently enabled a second clinic to offer the procedure in Kansas City. But tens of thousands of women are still without ready access. Blocking the law would allow the Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, a college town in the center of the state, to resume performing abortions in a matter of weeks. Planned Parenthood clinics in Springfield and Joplin, which are not as far along in the licensing process, would offer abortion in the coming months. All three clinics would be able to stay open during the trial to determine the law’s fate. The law is very similar to a Texas restriction the supreme court struck down in 2016. It requires abortion facilities to meet the same requirements as the hospital-like buildings where doctors perform outpatient surgery, and it requires abortion providers to have staff privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. Missouri claims the law is a safety measure. But Planned Parenthood argues the law is designed to make abortion inaccessible with medically unnecessary restrictions. “Patients shouldn’t have to drive hundreds of miles across the state, and risk their jobs and financial well-being in order to access abortion,” said Aaron Samulcek, the interim president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. That’s what happened to Ally, 25, when she was an undergraduate at the University of Missouri. “It was so stressful trying to not only get this procedure but also planning to get there,” she told the Guardian this week. Because Missouri also requires women to wait 72 hours between an initial appointment and the abortion itself, Ally and her partner made the trip twice. She skipped three days of classes and several shifts at her retail job, leaving her with $50 in her bank account. She cut back on groceries for weeks afterward. “I wouldn’t have had to make those financial decisions” if she had been allowed to have her abortion in Columbia, Ally said. At the time, she was also writing her senior thesis. “I would have had more time to focus on school, myself, my life.” Gorsuch’s doctoral dissertation, on assisted suicide, is a thundering denunciation of “the intentional taking of human life”. And he is an adherent of originalism, the idea that courts should interpret the constitution according to the meaning it had when it was enacted. “A conservative who believes in originalism thinks Roe v Wade is one of the worst decisions ever decided,” David Cohen, a Drexel University law professor and board member of the Abortion Care Network, told the Guardian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/20/hpv-screening-better-at-detecting-cervical-cancer-than-pap-smear-trial-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T23:42:02Z","webTitle":"HPV screening better at detecting cervical cancer than pap smear, trial shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/20/hpv-screening-better-at-detecting-cervical-cancer-than-pap-smear-trial-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/20/hpv-screening-better-at-detecting-cervical-cancer-than-pap-smear-trial-shows","fields":{"headline":"HPV screening better at detecting cervical cancer than pap smear, trial shows","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s new national cervical cancer screening program has received a boost, with a large clinical trial showing screening for the human papillomavirus is significantly better at detecting potential precancerous cells than the traditional pap smear. “We found that the HPV test was substantially more effective at picking up high-grade abnormalities compared to the pap test,” said Prof Karen Canfell, director of research at Cancer Council New South Wales. The results, published in the international journal PLOS Medicine, have been released less than three months before the transition to the new national cervical cancer screening program that eliminates the need for women to have a pap smear every two years. From 1 December, women from the age of 25, instead of 18, will be required to have a five-yearly HPV test, replacing the two-yearly pap test. Previous estimates have suggested the new screening program would lower cervical cancer incidence and mortality by at least 20% owing to the more accurate test. But until now it had not been tested among women with a high uptake of the HPV vaccine. To examine its effectives, researchers at Cancer Council NSW and the Victorian Cytology Service compared the detection rates of high-grade cervical abnormalities with the pap test among 5,000 women aged 25 to 64. The women attended a routine screening at 47 participating clinics in Victoria. They were randomly assigned to either have a five-yearly HPV screening test or a 2.5-yearly liquid-based cytology screening (pap test). The study found that compared with the Pap test, HPV screening “significantly” increased detection of high-grade precancerous cervical lesions among those who had been vaccinated. The overall detection rate was 0.1% versus 2.7%, respectively. “These findings provide initial support for the implementation of primary HPV screening in vaccinated populations,” the authors wrote. Canfell says increased detection means greater longer-term protection against the development of invasive cancer. “This adds to existing evidence about how much more accurate and effective HPV screening is,” she said. “We now have a superior method for detecting not just the virus that causes cervical cancer, but also high-grade abnormalities.” The second phase of the Compass trial is recruiting and hopes to have more than 120,000 participants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/19/kevin-durant-admits-twitter-childish-warriors","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T21:38:20Z","webTitle":"Kevin Durant admits to 'childish' and 'idiotic' tweets ripping former team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/19/kevin-durant-admits-twitter-childish-warriors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/19/kevin-durant-admits-twitter-childish-warriors","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Durant admits to 'childish' and 'idiotic' tweets ripping former team","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant admitted on Tuesday to posting comments on Twitter that were critical of his former team and coach. The eight-time NBA All-Star sent the tweets on Sunday in response to a fan who asked for “one legitimate reason” for Durant’s decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Warriors in July 2016. Writing in the third person, Durant responded by saying “he didn’t like the organization or playing for Billy Donovan” and that “his roster wasn’t that good, it was just him and [Russell Westbrook].” Eagle-eyed users on the social networking platform quickly noticed the responses came from Durant’s verified feed and not, as likely intended, from an anonymous burner account. “I use Twitter to engage with fans,” Durant said on Tuesday during a panel at the TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco. “I think it’s a great way to engage with basketball fans. I happened to take it a little too far. That’s what happens sometimes when I get into these basketball debates about what I really love, to play basketball. “I don’t regret clapping back at anybody or talking to my fans on Twitter. I do regret using my former coach’s name and the former organization I played for. That was childish. That was idiotic, all those type of words. I apologize for that.” Durant departed the Thunder in free agency after a season that saw Oklahoma City win 55 games and come with one win of the NBA finals only to surrender a three-games-to-one lead in their best-of-seven Western Conference finals series with the Warriors.

Roy Hodgson ended the night as the second manager within a few weeks to have secured the first win of his tenure at the club in this competition, courtesy of an anxious squeeze beyond Huddersfield Town, on an occasion when the locals revelled less in progress and more in the return of Pape Souaré. The hope is that Hodgson builds on this to enjoy a more productive and protracted spell in charge than the sacked Frank de Boer. Souaré, recovered from the horrific car crash that had threatened his career, emerged for the second half here and made fine blocks to repel dangerous centres from Aaron Mooy and Scott Malone as the home side rather clung to the slender lead chiselled out back when they had been dominant. Not that Hodgson, Souaré or any of the first-team squad will care. After the dismal start they have endured in the Premier League, any kind of win will do. “You don’t repair the kind of damage we’ve suffered overnight,” said Hodgson. “It’s going to be a longish and hard process. But I know there’s light at the end of the tunnel and I started to see some shards of that today.” There were plenty of reasons to be optimistic, even as Palace heaved to retain their advantage. Mamadou Sakho managed 70 minutes on his first appearance since making a £26m move from Liverpool, oozing authority and repelling Huddersfield with everything he had before the fatigue crept in. Jaïro Riedewald, the only other permanent signing of De Boer’s brief spell in charge, looked far more assured in central midfield where his distribution was crisp and, at times, even clever. There was a first clean sheet since mid-May and even a goal to cherish – this team have yet to experience that in five Premier League matches – scored by a makeshift striker on a relatively rare appearance. Bakary Sako, whose spell in south London has been wrecked by hamstring injuries, had not registered reward since a win at Chelsea back in the late summer of 2015. That seems an age ago. Yet here he was, unmarked at Andros Townsend’s early corner, to guide a simple header across Joel Coleman and into the top corner. “That first half was not good enough,” said Huddersfield’s manager David Wagner. “We were poor in possession, not quick enough, took too many touches and I’m very angry about the situation before the set piece, where we were very sloppy.” Had Townsend, Jeffrey Schlupp or Patrick van Aanholt made more of presentable opportunities before the interval then this win might have felt comfortable. Yet Palace’s fragile confidence was never likely to earn them that luxury. Instead, as Souaré found his feet and the home side’s rejigged back-line attempted to readjust, Huddersfield rallied. They had created little other than Tom Ince’s low first-half drive but with Philip Billing and Abdelhamid Sabiri driving them forward, local anxiety set in. Mooy injected more quality and Julián Speroni was forced to smother attempts deep into stoppage time only for Palace to cling on, with Souaré’s contribution ultimately key. The left-back had started shakily, understandably, but those blocks ended up being critical. “Two important challenges coming across from the left,” said Hodgson. “I threw him in at the deep end and he came out swimming.” So, too, must Palace. Manchester City will hardly be quaking in their boots at the prospect of confronting them on Saturday but for the former England manager, this was at least a start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/19/tottenham-barnsley-carabao-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T20:58:09Z","webTitle":"Tottenham thankful for Dele Alli winner to see off Barnsley at quiet Wembley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/19/tottenham-barnsley-carabao-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/19/tottenham-barnsley-carabao-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham thankful for Dele Alli winner to see off Barnsley at quiet Wembley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was an unusual vibe, with the stadium containing 23,926 supporters, and Mauricio Pochettino having made it plain the Carabao Cup was a long way down his trophy wishlist. But Tottenham Hotspur will continue in the competition after Dele Alli found a way to break Barnsley’s resistance midway through the second half. There is seemingly no way to keep the 21-year-old out of the limelight, whether for good or, sometimes, bad and he was on hand to shoot low past Adam Davies from close range for his third goal of the campaign. Barnsley played a full part in a decent enough tie, with fierce backing from their fans in one enclosure of this great bowl, and the club that occupies 20th place in the Championship will wonder how it might have turned out if Ike Ugbo had converted a wonderful chance at the beginning of the second half. Tottenham, though, deserved to win and they might have added to Alli’s goal with the substitute George-Kevin Nkoudou, Alli and Son Heung-min, twice, going close. Tottenham called the tune in territorial terms but Barnsley were set up to fight in their compact 4-3-3 formation. Spurs needed to be patient while also remaining alive to Barnsley’s threat on the counter. It came principally through Ugbo, the on-loan Chelsea striker who impressed with his mixture of deftness and brawn. Ugbo embarrassed Jan Vertonghen with one glorious flick and burst on halfway in the 43rd minute while he had earlier put Harvey Barnes away for a break. Vertonghen got back to tackle. Barnsley’s big chance of the first half came from Ryan Hedges’s corner on 41 minutes, when Liam Lindsay nodded wide when well placed. Glory had beckoned. Ugbo would have an even bigger one in the 46th minute. Clean through with only Michel Vorm to beat, his shot was too close to the goalkeeper. “That save kept us alive,” Pochettino said. Tottenham’s first-half threat had been limited to set pieces. The debutant centre-half, Juan Foyth, who had a few wobbles but showed his promise, flashed an early header wide from Kieran Trippier’s corner with what was his first meaningful touch in English football and only Fernando Llorente knows how he did not open the scoring midway through the period. He rose all alone to meet another Trippier corner but from close range he was horribly off target. There was no getting away from the weirdness of seeing the stadium this empty. The top tier was shut while the middle one was sparsely populated. “Wembley’s about finals for me,” Paul Heckingbottom, the Barnsley manager, said. “It was like a different stadium tonight.” Spurs had done their best to encourage fans to attend by starting adult tickets at £10 and children’s at £5. It ought to be remembered that they attracted 26,244 for the Gillingham tie at White Hart Lane for this stage of the competition last season. The tempo was higher in the second half, the shackles looser. Alli watched a low shot deflect wide while Harry Winks shot straight at Davies following an Trippier incursion. The Tottenham breakthrough felt as though it was coming and it did so when Trippier zipped around the back and scraped over a low cross, having almost overrun the ball. Alli was in the right place to finish. “We had possession but it was difficult to find ways to create chances,” Pochettino said. “That we had our first shot on target after 60 minutes speaks well of our opponents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/19/british-bobsleigh-women-funding-winter-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T21:11:00Z","webTitle":"British women’s bobsleigh team loses funding ahead of 2018 Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/19/british-bobsleigh-women-funding-winter-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/19/british-bobsleigh-women-funding-winter-olympics","fields":{"headline":"British women’s bobsleigh team loses funding ahead of 2018 Winter Olympics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The crisis at British Bobsleigh has worsened with news that the women’s team is to be stripped of all funding five months before the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Already beset by allegations of bullying, racism and harassment, the sport’s governing body now faces being accused of sexism in the way it allocates its funding. The support of three men’s teams is set to continue while the top female driver has been forced to plead for money on a crowdfunding website to keep her Olympic dream alive. Mica McNeill, a world junior champion, claimed “mismanagement” at British Bobsleigh had forced her to take drastic action after it apparently ran out of money. British Bobsleigh has admitted it is struggling to finance the women’s team competing at eight World Cup events that serve as a ranking competition for Pyeongchang 2018. The latest damaging revelation comes after Britain’s best-funded winter sport announced both the performance director, Gary Anderson, and the head coach, Dominik Scherrer, have stood down. UK Sport also cut public funding by £50,000 in the summer after athletes complained of a “toxic atmosphere” in the sport. Neither Anderson nor Scherrer are directly implicated in the allegations but their departures have left the elite programme in disarray. “Due to the mismanagement of British Bobsleigh there is no longer any funding available for a women’s programme to compete in the Olympics,” McNeill wrote on the GoFundMe website where she has raised more than £1,000 of a £30,000 target. “I now must self-fund my winter season and I am asking for funding and sponsorship so that I am able to compete on the World Cup circuit this winter to secure my place in the next Olympics. “I have worked incredibly hard and made many sacrifices. I have even bought my own bobsleigh so that I can achieve my dreams and due to circumstances out of my control, I’m now looking to raise the £30,000 so Team McNeill can represent GB this winter.” McNeill, from County Durham, cannot understand the disparity in funding between the men’s and women’s teams. With the bobsleigh season beginning in November the women’s team face a race against time to make South Korea. “It’s really disappointing because we’re left with a month before we’d look to be on ice and get the experience we need,” McNeill told the BBC. “The federation said they’re struggling with funding at the moment. I was really unhappy and thought, ‘That’s not a good enough explanation.’ I said: ‘Why are we in this situation?’ – there’s been an overspend on the budget, and there’s nothing left over for us women. “I know that bobsleigh is an expensive sport but I just am really disappointed it has come to this. They tried to tell us it was because we weren’t medal potential but I said: ‘You’re funding three men’s crews. Why don’t you just be honest and say you’re not funding us because there’s no money?’ And they said, ‘Yes, it’s because there’s no money – if there was we’d be funding you.’” In a statement, the BBSA said: “The GB Bobsleigh programme is focusing resources on winning medals in Pyeongchang. We are actively seeking commercial funding to further support our world-class programme and we will continue to do so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/19/mcconvilles-three-year-doping-ban-cheltenham-anseanachai-cliste","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T18:48:03Z","webTitle":"McConvilles given three-year bans after injecting horse at Cheltenham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/19/mcconvilles-three-year-doping-ban-cheltenham-anseanachai-cliste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/19/mcconvilles-three-year-doping-ban-cheltenham-anseanachai-cliste","fields":{"headline":"McConvilles given three-year bans after injecting horse at Cheltenham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A father and son who injected what they hoped would be performance-enhancing drugs into their runner before the Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham on Gold Cup day in March were banned from racing for three years at a British Horseracing Authority disciplinary hearing in London. Stephen McConville, the trainer of Anseanachai Cliste, and his son Michael, who was due to ride the 33-1 outsider at Cheltenham, injected the horse with Hemo 15, a compound containing the banned substance cobalt, and also adrenaline, about seven hours before Anseanachai Cliste was due to line up for the Foxhunter on 17 March. However, the gelding was scratched from the race on the orders of the stewards after bloodied syringes and empty medication bottles were found during a random search of their bag by BHA integrity officers. Anseanachai Cliste won a valuable race at Down Royal in Northern Ireland, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Irish Turf Club, nine days after his enforced withdrawal at Cheltenham. A dope test after that success was negative but within days a positive result for cobalt was confirmed from a sample taken on 17 March. The details of the case which emerged at Tuesday’s hearing revealed a crude and ultimately futile attempt to improve Anseanachai Cliste’s performance at Cheltenham. The gelding was the first horse in Britain to test positive for the element cobalt, a substance that has led to a series of high-profile disciplinary cases in Australia, but the disciplinary panel accepted that neither man knew it was present in Hemo 15, and that a single dose would not have had any positive effect on Anseanachai Cliste’s performance. The McConvilles administered adrenaline via the drug Adrenal Cortex. It is described as “a potent anti-inflammatory providing some analgesia along with a sense of euphoria” to a horse, but its “duration of action is very short” and any effect would have worn off long before Anseanachai Cliste reached the start. Stephen and Michael McConville were at the hearing but did not give oral evidence, depending instead on written submissions which largely admitted their breach of the anti-doping rules. In mitigation, both men said that they had not been seeking to boost Anseanachai Cliste’s performance but had administered what they hoped would be a “vitamin boost” after their horse had a difficult journey to Cheltenham. However, Tim Naylor, presenting the case on behalf of the BHA, said the McConvilles had acted with the intention of improving their horse’s chance, using drugs that had been prescribed several weeks earlier for a different horse in their yard. Naylor also highlighted the chance that Anseanachai Cliste’s welfare would be compromised by the clandestine administration of a drug that had not been prescribed for the horse by a vet, and without full knowledge of what it contained. Tim Charlton, the panel’s chairman, told the McConvilles that while they “did not have any real understanding” of the substances they were injecting, they “did have a genuine belief these would be beneficial to their horse in a race due to be run in seven hours”. Charlton continued: “The real vice of what they did was to act in a deliberate and planned way on a race day with the administration of substances and the welfare risks. There was an element of premeditation in that they brought from Northern Ireland [drugs] prescribed for another horse three months earlier, with the intention, or option, of using them.” In a statement issued after the hearing, the BHA said: “While research surveys and regulatory analysis carried out in recent years were reassuring that there was no endemic issue with the use of cobalt at the time, it is an integrity and welfare threat that we are taking seriously and which is forming an important part of our anti-doping strategy.” Robin Mounsey, the BHA’s head of media, also addressed the possibility that adrenaline could be administered to a horse in a racecourse stable shortly before it competes. “At the major festivals, most trainers will have their bags and boxes searched,” Mounsey said. “At routine race meetings, the target is one in six trainers having bags and boxes searched but in reality we are probably searching much more than that.” In a joint statement after the hearing, Stephen and Michael McConville said: “We apologise for what has happened, which was of our own doing due to lack of knowledge. However, this is no excuse for what happened at Cheltenham. “The horse was administered the tonic, Hemo 15, which is a widely used nutritional supplement which, unknown to us, contained cobalt. We now just wish to put this unfortunate matter behind us as it has caused a lot of stress to all members of our family as the horses and point-to-pointing is purely a hobby for the family.” Dr Lynn Hillyer, the Irish Turf Club’s chief veterinary officer and head of anti-doping, said on Tuesday evening that Hemo 15 is “a vitamin treatment which is not necessarily regarded as a medicine. It does have cobalt in it [but] there’s not much in it at all and as with all these things, it is about the dose that you give the horse and the timing of that administration. If you give a small amount very close to a race, then it risks exceeding the threshold. “When we put the thresholds in earlier this year in April, we accompanied it with an advice note to trainers to try to make this clear. A lot of supplements that are given can contain cobalt, so the small print has to be checked, and sometimes the estimations of cobalt given on the outside can be misleading. “It really is a question of trainers checking with their vets, looking at the label carefully and being very aware of what they’re giving. A lot of these things will have a label on which says ‘Jockey Club approved’ or ‘Turf Club approved’ or whatever else, and no regulatory authority approves any of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/19/musics-million-sellers-club-updated-to-include-streaming","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T19:02:26Z","webTitle":"Music's 'million sellers club' updated to include streaming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/19/musics-million-sellers-club-updated-to-include-streaming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/19/musics-million-sellers-club-updated-to-include-streaming","fields":{"headline":"Music's 'million sellers club' updated to include streaming","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The “million sellers club”, the elite ranks of musicians who have sold more than a million copies of their singles, has been given a modernising shake-up by incorporating streaming for the first time. The Official Charts Company (OCC) has brought together streaming and traditional sales in Britain for the first time to reveal which records have been the most popular, ensuring the likes of Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran are now rated alongside Elton John and Queen. With the shifting patterns of music consumption, from physical sales and downloads to streaming, it has been difficult in the past to compare the popularity of musicians through the ages. The new system uses the same methodology used in the weekly music charts, where 100 streams equate to a single song sale. The rise in popularity of streaming as the favoured way to access music has meant a decline in sales, even though more people than ever are consuming music, where in the last year 98m singles have been sold in the UK and music fans have generated 44bn audio streams. But now selling a million copies is almost unheard of in the UK charts, while racking up a million streams is increasingly the norm for big artists. The Official Charts Company chief executive, Martin Talbot, said: “Clearly sales today are not what they were even last year or the year before, because people are moving to this new form of consumption, so it’s going to be increasingly difficult for tracks to physically sell a million copies; we may never see that again. “But if you count streams, it allows us to properly examine who are the iconic and big artists of today.” In 2015, streaming was incorporated into the official charts for the first time and it proved such a dominating force that this year the rules had to be changed so that artists could only have three of their most popular tracks featuring in the chart. The two artists who top the revamped music millionaires list do so on the back of traditional sales figures that would be impossible to achieve today. Elton John’s Something About The Way You Look Tonight has long been one of the biggest selling records of all time, having shifted almost 5m copies when it was released in 1997, while Band Aid’s 1984 song Do they Know It’s Christmas sold 3.8m. Yet it is the sheer force of streaming that got Ed Sheeran to No 3 in the new OCC chart, with 2.1m streams and the same for artists such as Justin Bieber and Drake, whose One Dance track sold just 553,973 copies but gained an equivalent of 1.8m sales through streaming. The shift in consumption is also marked in the fact that No 16, Justin Bieber’s track Love Yourself, has had 1.3m equivalent streams, while No 17, Boney M’s 1978 track Rivers of Babylon, has had just 6,164 equivalent streams. “Doing this chart is really capturing a unique moment in time,” said Talbot. “This industry is really in a moment of change, when people are both buying and selling music in decent numbers, but there will come a time when sales will decline and most people will consume their music through streaming. “It really highlights how significant streaming has become and how engaged and seduced music fans have become by streaming. “It’s already incredibly popular but even now it’s only being accessed by about 1% of the global population, which gives you an indicator of how massive it could be in a few years. “I’m almost certain that a time will come when something will have been streamed so many times that it will overtake Candle in the Wind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/19/france-rugby-world-cup-2023","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T21:00:28Z","webTitle":"France promises to prevent ‘death of rugby’ if awarded 2023 World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/19/france-rugby-world-cup-2023","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/19/france-rugby-world-cup-2023","fields":{"headline":"France promises to prevent ‘death of rugby’ if awarded 2023 World Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"France has promised to prevent the “death of international rugby” if it is awarded the 2023 World Cup and has claimed a successful bid would help in attempts to stop its Top 14 clubs luring southern hemisphere players to Europe. France, whose bid includes a guarantee to World Rugby of nearly £500m, is vying with Ireland and South Africa to host the 2023 tournament and each will make presentations to the voting unions next Monday before a final decision is revealed on 15 November. Outlining a proposal he believes would provide World Rugby with £350m for reinvestment, the bid leader, Claude Atcher, also revealed plans to address the international landscape that has left France and England as the dominant economic forces. “If we don’t do anything, in five to 10 years you will have two, three to four teams on the same level and that’s all, and I think rugby will die,” said Atcher. “If you are looking at New Zealand, the best team in the world, their financial report in June showed they lost €3m [£2.65m]. South Africa, they lost €2m. Australia, they have a lot of issues with structure, teams, players and financially. “Italy’s financial report in June showed that they lost £2m. Scotland, Wales and Ireland are not losing money but they are balanced in terms of budget. The only unions with a profit are England and France. “We are not World Rugby and do not want to fight with them, they are a key body. But to develop rugby we need some new teams, a strong team in the USA, Russia and China, and emerging countries, to increase the capacity of rugby and to involve more people around the world.” Atcher also acknowledged how nations such as South Africa – thrashed 57-0 by New Zealand last Saturday – are afflicted by the cash-rich Top 14 clubs, who lure their players on lucrative contracts. Atcher believes that being awarded the World Cup would be a powerful bargaining tool with the French league, with negotiations due to begin in November. “If we are awarded the World Cup it will accelerate our political changes with the professional championship in France,” he added. “If we don’t change the rules in five years or 10 years, all South African, Australian and New Zealand players will play in France, in England. “The best players are not playing for the national team so the results are not as expected by the unions, so it’s very damaging. If you look at the English Premier League in football, it’s exactly the same situation. All clubs are using foreign players and the results of England’s national team are the same as the French rugby team and we have to change that.” With the Rugby World Cup tournament director, Alan Gilpin, revealing over the weekend that organisers of Japan 2019 have “not progressed as much as we would expect”, Atcher took the opportunity to emphasise the financial strength of France’s bid and their experience in hosting major sporting events. “In the bid you have to prove that your stadiums are at the level of international competition,” he said. “I think that’s a big strength for our bid. We don’t need one euro to invest. If we wanted to host the World Cup in six months, we are totally ready.” The host nation must pay World Rugby £120m to stage a World Cup but France has taken the unusual step of guaranteeing £150m, which is underwritten by the government, as well as €236m for the operational costs of organising the tournament thanks to an agreement with the financial group Société Générale. Additionally, France intends to buy the commercial rights for hospitality and marketing from World Rugby for €112m with ticketing revenue forecast at €377m and a further €90m in government support secured. Ireland meanwhile, has put expansion into the United States at the forefront of its bid. “If the rugby community is genuine about wanting to expand the sport, if they want to inspire people from other countries as potential hosts, then we believe we’ve made it easy for them to do that,” said the Irish Rugby Football Union chief executive, Philip Browne. “What we’d see as a tripartite partnership has to be put in place, between Ireland 2023 if we win the bid, World Rugby and US Rugby. It’s about what can we do to increase the footprint of rugby in North America.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/28/you-will-be-sexually-harassed-just-one-of-the-perils-of-working-for-213-an-hour","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"'You will be sexually harassed': just one of the perils of working for tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/you-will-be-sexually-harassed-just-one-of-the-perils-of-working-for-213-an-hour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/you-will-be-sexually-harassed-just-one-of-the-perils-of-working-for-213-an-hour","fields":{"headline":"'You will be sexually harassed': just one of the perils of working for tips","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“How are you doing today, sir? Dining in, or placing a to-go?” asks a cheery waitress. “Eating in,” a man in his late 20s replies. We are in a casual dining restaurant off a highway in eastern Michigan, Friday, mid-afternoon. Above him, televisions blare; behind him, squeaky-looking booths are starting to fill up. The man places his order – a burger, some sides – and looks back at his phone, slouching on the leather bar chair. A few moments later, the bartender returns with a beer, which he drinks quickly. After he leaves, from the other end of the empty bar, I squint my eyes as hard as I can to see what he has left behind for her. It’s a measly one-dollar bill. Here in Michigan, the sub-minimum tipped wage is $3.38 an hour. It is expected, by law, that the remaining $5.52 needed to reach the state’s minimum wage of $8.90 should be procured through tips provided by customers. However measly the money is, though, it could be worse. In 18 American states, it’s just $2.13 an hour. The rate hasn’t changed since 1991. Restaurant-goers across the US are required to not just cover the cost of their food; they are also expected to add on a significant percentage to their final check to subsidize the restaurant’s wage bill. Convention dictates a loose 15-20% should be added if service was satisfactory. To non-Americans, the practice seems absurd. For starters, why is there a second minimum wage, well below the minimum – isn’t that an oxymoron? Why is the employer not paying for their own employees’ full salaries? And what happens if customers aren’t feeling generous? But tipping has seeped deep into American culture. And a closer look raises issues that go beyond cultural curiosity: tipped workers are twice as likely to be living in poverty than other workers, and are mostly female. Dianne Avery, a professor at the University of Buffalo, reflects on what a tipping system reveals of American society. “In a country where we believe we have done away with master-servant relations, the existence of tipped workers show us this is far from the case. Because what tipped workers represent for the moment of that exchange [with a customer] is an intimate master-servant relation,” says Avery, who taught labor and employment law for decades. * * * Chasity Pulford, a 33-year-old Michigan server who has worked in restaurants for 18 years, rarely lets a smile slip from her face. “What can I talk to you about today?” she asks me, slightly surreally, as we sit down to talk. She is polite and bubbly, but never over-familiar. She tells me she enjoys her work, and plans to remain in the industry. As a young mother, she was too busy working and providing for her child to ever think of going to college. Besides, she has seen people work their way through expensive degrees only to return to serving. Jobs are far from lacking. The restaurant industry is worth $799bn a year and employs 10% of Americans. In 2014, for the first time since the federal government started tracking it, Americans spent more eating out than buying groceries for the home. This trend continues. “I am a really good server,” Pulford says. “Some people want to be spoken to, others want to be left alone. You have to be able to read your customers.” Being able to do this helps you get tips. (One of her male colleagues, one of the few in the restaurant, tells me he strives to be best friends with his customers by the end of the meal.) “The work is very hard. It’s difficult,” Pulford adds, still grinning.Pulford has developed carpal tunnel syndrome in her arms and hands, and arthritis in her knees and feet. At 33, she still has three decades of work ahead of her. The money tipped restaurant workers make can be good, she tells me, but it varies hugely, not just across restaurant locations and types, but within the same establishment. One server working exactly the same number of shifts as another could be making half the amount. You need to pursue the good shifts end of the week, get the busy sections, and be trusted to “close”. “When I get to a new place, I know I’m at the bottom, and I need to get to the top fast. That takes me about six months,” she says. Pulford says working six days a week in a place like this – a casual, modestly priced midwest dining establishment with pretty steady business – you can expect to make $300-$400 a week. Once you get privileges, the right sections and shifts, you can hope for up to $600-$800 a week, although sometimes there’s no avoiding $400. If it’s slow, it’s slow – however hard you smile. ‘We have to jeopardize our integrity on a daily basis to pay rent’ In Texas, Tiffany Kirk, 27, has been a bartender since her early 20s, and in the industry since she was 16. Kirk is paid $2.13 an hour when she bartends. The Texas sub-minimum wage is the same as the federal one. Because the IRS considers tips a form of income, Kirk says her base wage generally goes in taxes, which means that all of her wages come from tips. On bad weeks, her take-home pay is $200. At home, she has a six-year-old to feed. The inconsistency of the money is the toughest part. It makes it difficult to plan or save. I spoke to her during Hurricane Harvey. Her shifts were canceled because the weather and its damage, and she was scrambling to figure out how to make her September rent on time. According to the 2014 ROC study, women working in states with a $2.13 sub-minimum tipped wage were twice as likely to report experiencing sexual harassment than women where the minimum wage is the same for tipped and non-tipped workers. “We have to jeopardize our integrity on a daily basis to pay rent. That is an extremely psychologically damaging position to get in,” Kirk says. Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley explains that the tipped sub-minimum wage system “is a way that employers pass the wage bill on to someone else in order to not have to pay their workers”. “That’s not a tip, that’s a part of the worker’s wage bill,” she says. Because very few establishments provide benefits, the tips collected must also cover the cost of health insurance, and time off like sick days, holidays and family days. The people doing the smiling – the “emotion work” associated with good waitressing – are largely female. At a national level, two-thirds of the tipped workers are women. In Michigan, three-quarters of them are. Julie Vogtman of the National Women’s Law Center, says anyone concerned with the gender pay gap should be paying attention to tipped workers’ struggles. Of the top five jobs expected to add the most positions over the next decade, all are women-dominated industries, but four out of five of them are low wage, she points out. These jobs “put women and their families at a higher risk of poverty”. ‘Some men come in and they act like they want a strip show’ When tipping first came to America in the 19th century from Europe (which has since largely erased it) Americans were not taken by the practice, finding it “dehumanizing, demeaning and de-professionalising”, says Saru Jayaraman, the co-director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United. At the time, it seemed contrary to American democratic ideals. “They rejected it as the vestiges of a feudal system. They thought you should get good service regardless of how much you are able to tip,” she says. But railway companies and restaurant owners fought successfully to have the practice allowed. While train workers unionized and abolished the system, servers never did. Today, Jayaraman and other allies are fighting for the full abolition of the tipped sub-minimum wage under a campaign called “One Fair Wage”. They are not however – yet – calling for the abolition of tipping as a practice. However much Pulford knows she needs the money, there are times when she doesn’t mind receiving less. “If you’re good to me, I don’t care how much you tip.” I ask her to explain what she means. “They can be demeaning, look down on you like you’re a college dropout. Like they don’t think you’re working a real job. Sometimes they don’t treat you like you’re a human being. Sometimes they treat you like a whore.” “Who’s they?” “The customers,” she responds, matter-of-factly. And just like that the shocking stories commence. The time she had a hot steak thrown at her, and had to go and hide so no one would see her tears. That time she quit her job because the owner was coming on to staff, including girls who were underage. And the many times she felt like she was treated like a sex worker. In 2014, a study that surveyed 688 restaurant workers found that a staggering 80% of women experienced sexual harassment from customers, two-thirds from managers, and half from co-workers. (Male restaurant workers also suffered sexual harassment, but to a lesser degree.) The atmosphere of sexual harassment was endemic. No one puts it as succinctly as Alison Baker, 34, who works as a server in a Mexican restaurant in Chicago. “When you are hired as a waitress, it might as well be a part of the manual. You will be sexually harassed. You are relying on this person for your wage, so you can’t say anything,” she says. “It can be scary. You’re so vulnerable.” Baker had a barista friend of hers die when she was younger, killed by one of her regulars. Acquiring stalkers is pretty standard, she tells me, but however much she hates it, when she dresses up and wears makeup, the truth is, the tips are better. “I think the notion of a young attractive female waitress as a sex object has entered as a cultural norm,” says Avery, the law professor. She points out the emergence and popularity of “breastaurants” like Hooters, starting in the 1980s, where attractive waitresses are expected to wear form fitting clothes and flirt to get tips. But she goes back even further. In 19th-century America, women who worked in food establishments were often assumed to be prostitutes. “Women only really entered the workforce during the second world war. Before that women’s place was considered to be in the home. So the thought was, well, if they are leaving the home, then what are they doing it for? “It goes with the territory. Some men come in and they act like they want a strip show. Sometimes I think maybe I should work in a strip club. I feel like at least I might make more money”, says Baker.. * * * My bartender is back, wiping down my section. She wears her blonde hair high above her head, a couple of flower clips to the front. Her black T-shirt tucked into dark blue jeans. Sometimes she calls me hun, sometimes sweetheart. I note all the men get called sir. I don’t really mind. I feel taken care of. “How you doing there, sweetheart? You need anything else?” The construction along the highway has been hurting business, I am told. But, being so close to the border, she’s had quite a few Canadians in the past few weeks, which has helped lift the spirits. “Do they understand about tipping?” I ask. “Not as much,” she says. “I think they pay servers full wages up there in Canada, so they don’t need to tip as much. Some of them know, others don’t. “They’re real nice, though.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-conference-keeping-calm-and-carrying-on","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T17:59:04Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Lib Dem conference: keeping calm and carrying on | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-conference-keeping-calm-and-carrying-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-conference-keeping-calm-and-carrying-on","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Lib Dem conference: keeping calm and carrying on","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For a party so badly scorched by its experience of power, and with only a fifth of the seats it held three years ago, the Liberal Democrats had some cause for optimism as they gathered in Bournemouth this week. In Vince Cable they have a new yet experienced and well-respected leader. The vote for Brexit gave them a renewed sense of purpose and encouraged a surge in members, taking their numbers to over 100,000. Despite their poor showing in this year’s general election, they boast a markedly stronger parliamentary team, including Sir Vince, his deputy Jo Swinson and newcomer Layla Moran. The leader highlighted their two opportunities in his speech on Tuesday. Labour’s divisions over the EU created the Liberal Democrats’ opportunity with remainers; but the more recent evolution of its policy gives them hope that a hard Brexit can be avoided if “political adults” work together. Though Sir Vince has pledged that his party will not be “Ukip in reverse”, he hopes its pro-European stance will place it on the right side of history, as opposition to the Iraq war did. Secondly, the party believes that the radicalism of left and right have left a space which it can capitalise upon when enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn fades: “What hope cannot do is make 2+2=7,” Sir Vince warned. But it will take more than an offer of “hope and realism” to detoxify his party for those who remember the compromises of coalition. Reclaiming the party’s record in government, as he sought to do, will not be easy – one reason his predecessor Tim Farron did not try. The Lib Dems understand they cannot make the political weather: instead, they are holding their nerve and hoping the clouds will soon part. Sir Vince made the obligatory declaration that the time for waiting is over. But he acknowledged that his long career within and without politics has taught him the importance of endurance. He will need it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/05/alarming-rise-in-queensland-tree-clearing-as-400000-hectares-stripped","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T06:12:53Z","webTitle":"'Alarming' rise in Queensland tree clearing as 400,000 hectares stripped","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/alarming-rise-in-queensland-tree-clearing-as-400000-hectares-stripped","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/05/alarming-rise-in-queensland-tree-clearing-as-400000-hectares-stripped","fields":{"headline":"'Alarming' rise in Queensland tree clearing as 400,000 hectares stripped","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Queensland underwent a dramatic surge in tree clearing – with the heaviest losses in Great Barrier Reef catchments – in the year leading up to the Palaszczuk government’s thwarted bid to restore protections. Figures released on Thursday showed a 33% rise in clearing to almost 400,000 hectares in 2015-16, meaning Queensland now has two-thirds the annual rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The latest Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) report showed a 45% jump in clearing in reef catchments, where 40% of all clearing took place. The deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said the rise of 100,000 hectares to 395,000 hectares cleared was “incredibly alarming”. “We know that the current rates of land clearing in Queensland are unsustainable. Australia has become one of the deforestation hotspots in the world – the only advanced economy to be named in the 12 deforestation hotspots in the world. “[It’s] because Queensland has returned to the bad old days of bulldozing hundreds of thousands of hectares of woody and remnant vegetations in order to make way particularly for pasture for cows,” she said. Rates of clearing surged when Campbell Newman promised to scrap restrictions, which his Liberal National party (LNP) government did in December 2013. Rates then reached a plateau of about 300,000 hectares for several years. The minority Labor government tried to reverse the legislation last year, but was blocked at the 11th hour in August 2016 when its former MP turned crossbencher Billy Gordon sided with the LNP. The Newman changes included wiping out protections for high conservation value regrowth, which made up about a third of clearing in 2015-16. The resurgence of clearing shown in the latest figures raises concerns about a fresh bout of “panic clearing” by rural landholders – primarily graziers – in anticipation of Labor’s changes going through. Labor has promised to push through protections if returned to office with a majority at the upcoming election, while the LNP and One Nation – which could hold the balance of power – have said they will scotch reforms. The environment minister, Steven Miles, said the latest report was “nothing short of devastating” because of the effects on wildlife, reef waters and coral, and Australia’s carbon emissions. “It’s even worse than my worst fears for this next round of land clearing data,” he said. Miles said that “most concerningly” 35% of clearing was of remnant bushland, “138kha of old growth native forest, the most important habitat for native species”. “We know that each year in Queensland 900,000 mammals lose their lives due to this loss of habitat.” Miles said 40% of clearing was driving “more sediment into the Great Barrier Reef, literally suffocating our coral”. “That’s not to mention the 45m tonnes of additional greenhouse gas emissions caused by this clearing.” Deforestation in Queensland represents a hurdle not only to Australia’s priority goal of lifting water quality for the ailing reef but also its Paris climate commitments because it represents about 90% of the nation’s carbon emissions from land use. Recent clearing for suburban development in the state’s south-east has also been linked to escalating pressure on koala populations from habitat destruction. “We need a parliament in Queensland that recognises this is an unsustainable problem that needs urgent redress,” Trad said. Tree protections in Queensland were the critical factor in Australia meeting its Kyoto commitments on emissions cuts before the LNP wound them back after years of disquiet in the state’s rural areas. Previous protections had brought clearing rates down from 500,000 hectares a year to 50,000. But Trad said they had subsequently “quadrupled” since the year before the Newman LNP government took office. Conservation groups said the renewed surge belied claims from the LNP and the farm lobby that opposition to deregulation amounted to scaremongering. Gemma Plesman, from the Wilderness Society Queensland, said the “shocking” figures showed a “hidden environmental crisis” that put Queensland “up there with the world’s worst offenders for forest destruction”. Queensland Conservation Council coordinator Tim Seelig said the state’s “tree clearing crisis just got a whole load worse”. He called it “a catastrophe for wildlife and a catastrophe for the reef”. Miles said the figures showed the state was “still suffering the devastating effects of decisions made by [LNP leader] Tim Nicholls and the LNP both when in government and since then in opposition, blocking our responsible legislation”. He said the federal government had stalled after initially launching investigations into allegations of illegal clearing in north Queensland, and the National party had responded “so violently”. He stated: “The Turnbull government since then have failed to have any interest in assisting Queensland to protect our forests [or] to implement our long term sustainability plan for the Great Barrier Reef, which of course is incredibly disappointing.” Miles said clearing statewide was the “single biggest threat” to koala populations and that a ban on developer donations, promised by Labor on the recommendation of the corruption watchdog, would help conservation efforts. According to deputy premier Trad, most land cleared statewide was for pastoral land, with a spike in “fodder harvesting” and “tree thinning”. Protections would remove landholders’ scope for “self-assessment” and apply the “rigour of science” to clearing applications, she said, and the surge in clearing ahead of Labor’s touted reforms last year showed it was “landholders doing the wrong thing”. Asked if a tree clearing ban was a “vote-winner” in rural Queensland, Trad replied: “This is the right thing to do, whether it’s in the bush or whether it’s in the southeast Queensland corner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/05/abc-axes-lateline-as-part-of-current-affairs-journalism-overhaul","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T01:42:36Z","webTitle":"ABC axes Lateline as part of current affairs journalism overhaul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/05/abc-axes-lateline-as-part-of-current-affairs-journalism-overhaul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/05/abc-axes-lateline-as-part-of-current-affairs-journalism-overhaul","fields":{"headline":"ABC axes Lateline as part of current affairs journalism overhaul","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The ABC has announced an overhaul of its current affairs journalism including the axing of its flagship show Lateline and the creation of investigative and specialist reporting teams. The new teams of reporters and producers will work across television, radio and online to boost the broadcaster’s daily news and current affairs output. Hosted by Emma Alberici, Lateline first aired in 1990, with Kerry O’Brien in the chair until 1995, and has been fronted over its 27 years by some of the ABC’s biggest names including Maxine McKew, Virginia Trioli, Leigh Sales and Tony Jones. The late-night news program survived the axe in 2014 after a public campaign swayed the ABC board but had its budget cut by 25% and was moved to the ABC News channel. Sources told Guardian Australia it is still an expensive program, with a budget running into the millions, but only attracts an average metro audience of 185,000 viewers across two channels. It plays on the ABC News channel first at 9.30pm on weeknights and then on the main channel at 10.30pm. The size of the audience has made it difficult to argue to keep Lateline in the schedule as it has lost much of the impact it once had under O’Brien in the early days and under Jones when it had more investigative resources. In his six years on the program O’Brien conducted lengthy interviews with international guests via satellite, which became the program’s signature. It also made the green pen he held in his hand an icon. Lateline’s 2006 coverage of sexual violence in remote Northern Territory Aboriginal communities led to the Little Children Are Sacred report and has been named by Jones as among the program’s most important work. Alberici will become the ABC’s chief economics correspondent, the broadcaster said in a statement. The investigative team will be led by the 7.30 executive producer, Jo Puccini, and the Lateline executive producer, Lisa Whitby, will be in charge of the team of specialist reporters who will cover arts, business, courts, industrial relations, entertainment and health, many of the areas abandoned by broadsheet newspapers in recent years. The new recruit John Lyons, who has been appointed head of investigative and in-depth journalism, will have overall responsibility for the specialist and investigative teams. The restructure of current affairs has been undertaken to better share resources between radio, television, digital and news divisions and is expected to result in two or three redundancies after a consultation period with the unions. Next month the corporation is expected to unveil a major restructure of the content divisions of the ABC along genre lines rather than divisions. Originally scheduled for early October, it has been pushed back to as late as November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/05/forza-motorsport-7-review-racing-game-franchise-drive","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:34:17Z","webTitle":"Forza Motorsport 7 review: another expertly engineered and polished drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/forza-motorsport-7-review-racing-game-franchise-drive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/05/forza-motorsport-7-review-racing-game-franchise-drive","fields":{"headline":"Forza Motorsport 7 review: another expertly engineered and polished drive","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are some driving games so convincing and enthralling that, after an intense play session, you find yourself instinctively straight-lining the local mini roundabout in order to nestle into the slipstream of a septuagenarian’s Toyota Aygo during your weekend supermarket run. Forza Motorsport 7 is now one of those games. Presumably conscious that key aspects of its franchise have been lapped by rivals Gran Turismo and Project Cars, developer Turn 10 has built carefully on the well-received Forza 6: 700-plus vehicles, 32 racing locations, endless racing conditions due to the new dynamic weather system – these stats are just the start of it. More important is the team’s exacting attention to detail and the technical ability to deliver ever more nuanced 1080p visuals locked at 60 frames per second. Even on a standard Xbox One there’s a solidity to Forza 7’s visuals that few games manage. And despite the increased number of vehicles not translating into meaningful new racing categories (truck racing is one exception, entertaining to the point of encouraging anyone ideologically opposed to this barbaric practice to at least reassess their moral stance), the game is deliberately structured to deliver a more dynamic single-player experience than past Forzas have managed. The core offline career is a substantial offering split across six championship tiers of increased difficulty and commitment, with a satisfying variety of racing series in each. Initially at least, you may pick and choose your way through the more exciting options while amassing the necessary points to unlock the next tier. So you can, for instance, bypass the hot hatch event and launch into historic F1 racing instead – aquaplaning in a ‘60s Brabham BT24 at triple-digit speeds yet still keeping four wheels on a soaked and ever-changing Monza track is as exhilarating as you’d imagine. Or perhaps you jump into the driving seat of a zippy Polaris RZR all-terrain vehicle on a four-race jaunt. If that sounds too frivolous, you get a meaty endurance option early on in the form of a 24-lap run at the supreme Spa-Francorchamps. That’s the best part of an hour spent in the thrilling-but-demanding company of Belgium’s premium circuit. As things get tougher, you’ll likely run out of funds to buy required machinery and will resort to visiting past events in order to boost your purchasing power. Race results mean in-game credits and XP, both of which tie into the acquisition of new vehicles (the latter via ‘level up’ rewards), which in turn opens up the ability to enter a wider range of racing categories. So far, so déjà vu. However, screeching into this recognisable set-up comes the introduction of loot boxes. Called Prize Crates here and currently acquired with in-game currency (though real-world purchase options are expected), these vary in cost and reveal items ranging from limited-use Mod cards (to boost XP gain now that there’s sadly no bonus XP earned from toning down the finely tuned driving assists) to driver avatar race suits (360-odd are available), to top end “Legendary” cars. We’ll sidestep the psychology of gambling discussion for now, but the loot box mechanic is sewn into the fabric of FM7 more neatly than Maserati upholstery and, indeed, relying on Mod cards to accelerate your credit and XP growth becomes necessary for those wishing to fast-track their progress through the campaign. But it’s an inclusion that will prove divisive. At least there will be fewer arguments in relation to the handling dynamics. They may lack refinement, but even if you can’t “feel” your tyres warm up in Turn 10’s game, the model here remains an unquestionable accomplishment within the realm of console driving mechanics. You can still trail brake a Ferrari 288 GTO into corners, balancing your Pirellis on the absolute edge of adhesion, make the apex and power out wide, a reassuring rumble from the kerb sending that muscly 1980s Pininfarina bodywork on its way to conquer the next curve, and do so with every element of that process beautifully communicated via force feedback wheel or – key given the intended demographic – regular gamepad. Seven iterations means Forza knows its audience inside out, and ensures that the experience on offer proves delightful regardless of a player’s level or controller set-up. And regardless of vehicle driven, too. Whether in a puny BMW Isetta or a classic 1970 Camaro, the mighty McLaren MP4-4 or a preposterous Porsche 918, there’s rarely a moment of dubious car behaviour on show – some achievement, given the variety available. You can argue the vans, SUVs, off-roaders feel like odd inclusions in a purely track-based experience but it’s a small concession in a vast lineup that spans hot hatches, sports cars, hyper-cars, muscle, hot rods, tuners, rally, touring, GT, Le Mans prototypes, Formula E, F1 (classic and modern), IndyCar, Nascar and more. Another strength comes from the online component. Better than most, Forza Motorsport’s multiplayer element has consistently displayed carbon fibre-like dependability with superior matchmaking, and here again you can rely on stable racing within a very active community – for the most part united in fun but fair competition (at least in these early days) and fuelled by the series’ considerable customisation options. (A local splitscreen option is offered, incidentally.) At the time of writing, Forza 6’s competitive Leagues and Forzathon (challenge-based events taken from Forza Horizon 3) options remain locked but they’ll be welcome substance on to an already proven package – FM7 online works solidly, seamlessly, from launch. One particularly studious move that may yet have greatest impact in multiplayer is the introduction of homologated events. On the face of it, limiting cars to race within their performance category band may seem counter to the tuning excesses of past Forzas, but in practice it has the effect of delivering atypically balanced competition – several hours spent in the company of homologated strangers can attest to this. The ability to partake in like-minded competition by venturing online is particularly precious because the single-player AI will disappoint. The series’ favoured Drivatar approach – AI competition supposedly formed from real player driving data – makes great marketing blurb, but in practice it rarely reflects believable on-track behaviour. There’s often a general lack of race craft and personality evident, and an over-aggressive response to car-v-car situations seems the result of clumsy number crunching rather than a more excusable virtual win-at-all-costs passion. Still, there’s no denying Turn 10’s commitment to its franchise. You can pick on the AI and you can lament the lack of new circuits at launch: the return of Maple Valley is very welcome and the fast, rhythmic nature of the new Dubai track delivers great online racing but otherwise it’s a selection Forza players will be overly familiar with. You can find alternatives with a greater variety of race disciplines, deeper driving dynamics, or a broader implementation of time of day and weather. And you can certainly question the wisdom of shoehorning the loot-box mechanic in. What you can’t do is ignore another confident and accomplished Forza Motorsport experience. This is a rare example of racing fun for the masses and the maestros, one that’s expertly engineered and polished to a level that would make a Concours d’Elegance winner envious. It may make some controversial design choices, but in terms of the on-track experience, it’s the FM series’ most engaging drive yet.

If Scotland beat Slovakia at Hampden Park on Thursday a win in Slovenia on Sunday would guarantee second place in Group F. Given Scotland have not appeared at a major finals since 1998 – and routinely have not appeared close to doing so – anticipation is high. Strachan, though, has urged his team to retain emotional stability. “The atmosphere will change every minute of the game from ‘Yeah, this is great’ to ‘Oh, Jeez, here we go’; depression to back up again,” Scotland’s manager said. “While that is going on with the fans – who are totally entitled to do that – we have got to stay at a level that is not being affected by that. People have to stay focused. But there is only so much you can do as a coach. They have to stay focused themselves. “The fans have paid their money. They want to get excited and all the rest of it. We have got to stay above it. You can’t ask them to sit there and say: ‘Och, it’s not a problem, the boys have got it well in hand.’ That isn’t football. “The fans will be saying, ‘Let’s go for it, get up for it’, and all the rest of it. We have got to stay above that. There are times when we will have to stay patient on the ball and the crowd will be saying, ‘We want the ball to go forward’ but there is no point in getting it forward because they have two big centre-backs who will head it back up the pitch and we will be in trouble again.” Strachan reverted to sporting parallel when assessing a scenario in which qualification, from looking unattainable, is within Scotland’s grasp. He said: “If you are a golfer coming into the last two holes two ahead. If you are down in tennis and somebody is serving for the match, can you deal with that? You get this in any sport.” The earlier meeting of Scotland and Slovakia brought a comfortable 3-0 win for the hosts in Trnava. At the point of a subsequent defeat by England, Strachan looked to be playing out the final acts of his tenure. “I think we really need to know we could have been out of this thing four or five games ago,” Strachan said. “So I think there was more pressure than now. There is still pressure now, no doubt about it, but there is more excitement about it than the real nitty-gritty we had three or four games ago. “I’m excited. That’s been the overall thing since I knew I was packing my bags the other day to come up here; excitement.” Strachan’s key selection dilemma relates to midfield, given injuries to Stuart Armstrong and the Scotland captain, Scott Brown. The widespread assumption is that Darren Fletcher will replace Brown but Strachan has talked up the abilities of Sheffield Wednesday’s Barry Bannan. “Some of the best performances I’ve seen in the last three weeks have come from Barry Bannan,” Strachan said. “That’s in different areas, different positions, as a sitting midfield player, on the left, across on the right at times. Mark [McGhee, Strachan’s assistant] feels the same. Everybody who has watched him thinks technically he has been wonderful; a great range of passing. “Slovakia are a right good side. They are like a club side, they’ve been together for a long time. Anyone with any knowledge in football will know how tough it’s going to be.” Scotland (4-2-3-1, probable): Gordon; Tierney, Berra, Mulgrew, Robertson; D Fletcher, Bannan; Forrest, Morrison, Phillips; Griffiths. Slovakia (4-2-3-1, probable): Kozacik; Pekarik, Skrtel, Durica, Hubocan; Kucka, Lobotka; Mak, Hamsik, Weiss; Nemec.

Representatives of the 20 Premier League clubs gathered at a hotel in London’s Mayfair on Wednesday to discuss changing the way in which overseas television income is distributed, covering £1bn of annual revenue and a power struggle between the league’s so-called big six and the rest. In a statement the Premier League confirmed the meeting had ended without agreement. “Premier League clubs today met and discussed the future development of the League. Clubs unanimously agreed to adjourn the meeting to allow further discussion.” The current arrangement, in place since the Premier League came into existence 25 years ago, distributes overseas television revenue equally between all clubs. A new proposal, submitted by the executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, would see 35% of the money distributed according to league position. It is understood that this proposal was not put to a vote before the adjournment. According to the Arsenal chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, the meeting was conducted in a “cordial” atmosphere, but there is an increasing division between Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur and the rest. Those six clubs believe their names persuade broadcasters across the world to buy rights to the Premier League. The rest, particularly those clubs relatively new to the division, point to the competitive nature of the league as being its real selling point. These positions are not easily retractable and both sides can claim to have some form of leverage in negotiations. For the six it is the threat of a possible breakaway, leaving the Premier League to form a European Super League (a threat that also dates back at least 25 years). For the rest of the league they can bargain safe in the knowledge that any adjustment to the rules would require a two-thirds majority vote. Both sides are, however, in agreement about the increasing importance of overseas broadcast revenue to balance sheets. The meeting had been mooted to be the last before negotiations begin on a new round of domestic TV rights, with Sky and BT once again expected to spend billions. But growth is expected to be lower than the 70% achieved for the last contract, while overseas rights continue to rise sharply. A compromise on foreign income still looks likely, and another meeting of the clubs is expected in the next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/05/period-poverty-women-sanitary-products","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Period poverty is leaving women such as Kerry isolated and ashamed | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/period-poverty-women-sanitary-products","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/period-poverty-women-sanitary-products","fields":{"headline":"Period poverty is leaving women such as Kerry isolated and ashamed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“If it’s a choice between electricity, snacks for the kids, or sanitary towels … Even that £2 at the end of the month matters,” says Kerry, from Aberdeen. The 35-year-old is raising three teenagers alone – a daughter and two boys with autism. She doesn’t need to explain what gets sacrificed as she chooses between food, heating and other essentials for the children, and sanitary products for herself. Kerry used to have a wage coming in – she was a home carer for disabled and older people – but four years ago had to give up work to care for her boys. As she struggled to apply for benefits, her financial difficulties “snowballed”, and having a period became another cost she couldn’t afford. For a year, in order to pay the bills, Kerry went without any sanitary products at all. Instead, each month she would stuff toilet paper into her underwear. Often, she would just stay in the house and not go out. “Y’know, to be near the toilet,” she says. The only reason Kerry has pads now is because of a local food bank, the Aberdeen City Food network. She’d started to volunteer last Christmas – giving out food parcels to the city’s most deprived areas – and one of the female organisers quietly asked if she needed any “girly bits” herself. She has no idea what she’d have done otherwise. “How do you even say to someone you haven’t got £2 for tampons? How do I verbalise it?” Period poverty is in many ways the hidden side of British inequality: women and girls in one of the richest societies in history stuffing socks inside their underwear and being trapped in their homes each month. It isn’t hard to see why sanitary products are often out of reach. Research shows pads and tampons cost women around £13 every month. Add another £8 for new underwear, and then almost a fiver for pain relief. That means women need to find more than £300 each year for periods – or the equivalent of a fortnight’s rent. The problem isn’t a new one. As a teenager, Kerry herself didn’t have access to sanitary products, missing chunks of school as she waited out her period at home. But, as she puts it to me: “Twenty years down the line, I’m still seeing it.” In a climate of shrinking wages, cut benefits and rising living costs, period poverty is rearing its head with new prominence. Increasingly, food banks are reporting women coming in needing donations, and being ushered into a back room lined with boxes of tampons. Charities typically charged with donating sanitary pads to Kenya are now being called to Leeds; swaths of girls are missing school because their parents can’t afford pads. The scale is such that the Labour party pledged last week to commit £10m to ending period poverty in schools in England. Scotland is already piloting offering free sanitary products to women and girls, via the same scheme that Kerry now relies on. But period poverty is only part of the picture. Hygiene poverty – where families are unable to afford essential products such as shampoo and deodorant – is quietly spreading. As destitution grows, dignity is now a luxury item. One charity alone, In Kind Direct, distributed £20.2m of hygiene products in 2016 – up almost 70% on the year before. Trussell Trust research with the University of Oxford found that more than half of the households visiting the network’s food banks this summer are now struggling to afford toiletries as well. There is something glaringly symbolic about this. Sweat stains. Dirty hair. Blood on your underwear. It’s literally marking certain people out, with poverty seeping into their skin. When Labour announced its commitment to fund sanitary products for low-income school pupils, it signalled more than a pot of money. It was a message that women having toiletries for menstruation isn’t discretionary but essential healthcare; that, as austerity measures exacerbate hardship for the poorest, it is the state’s duty to provide a safety net for a human being’s basic needs. Britain is witnessing the growth of poverty at its most debilitating: isolating, shaming and lasting. For any politician who doubts the need to address this, Kerry’s parting words are worth remembering. “It leaves you with an anxiety. Even once you get access, you worry it will happen again.” She pauses. “The impact stays with you.” • Frances Ryan writes the Guardian’s Hardworking Britain series"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/04/anne-jeffreys-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T16:59:42Z","webTitle":"Anne Jeffreys obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/04/anne-jeffreys-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/04/anne-jeffreys-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Anne Jeffreys obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The diverse show-business career of Anne Jeffreys, who has died aged 94, can be divided into three distinct domains. In the 1940s she was the spirited heroine of low-budget westerns and B- picture thrillers; from the 50s onwards she appeared on television in soap operas and sitcoms, including the supernatural comedy series Topper (1953-55), in which she was known as the “ghostess with the mostest”, and the long-running General Hospital; and she was a singing star in Broadway musicals, notably as Lilli Vanessi in Cole Porter’s Kiss Me Kate (1950-51). During the first period, Jeffreys starred opposite Robert Mitchum in Nevada (1944) and Frank Sinatra in Step Lively (1944). In the former, she played a saloon singer who seduces the hero and is later fatally wounded by gunfire while protecting him; in the latter, her character makes a play for a reluctant Sinatra trapped in a phone booth, singing Where Does Love Begin? Whatever the film genre, good use was often made of Jeffreys’ lyric soprano voice. This was best displayed on stage in the premiere run of Kurt Weill’s “American opera”, Street Scene (1947), in which she sang six numbers as Rose Maurrant, a bright young girl attempting to escape the tenements of Manhattan’s East Side. She was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina, daughter of Kate (nee Jeffreys) and Mack Carmichael. Her mother had wanted to be an opera singer and encouraged Anne to study singing. She became a member of the New York Municipal Opera Company on a scholarship while still in her teens, gradually gaining leading roles in La Bohème and Madame Butterfly at Carnegie Hall. But an offer from MGM tempted her to Hollywood and an acting career. This began with a bit part in the Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddy musical I Married an Angel (1942) before she gained a contract with Republic for a series of eight indistinguishable but enjoyable and snappy B-westerns starring Wild Bill Elliott (for action) and George “Gabby” Hayes (for comedy), with Jeffreys providing the hero’s love interest. Rather more memorable was her part as Tess Trueheart, the witty and patient girlfriend of the eponymous detective, in Dick Tracy (1945) and Dick Tracy vs Cueball (1946), who often put herself in danger on his behalf. She could also be an effective “bad girl”, as in Riff Raff (1947), in which she portrayed a double-crossing nightclub singer, and in Dillinger (1945), playing an amoral gangster’s moll. Jeffreys ended her long run in 40s movies with two excellent Randolph Scott westerns, Trail Street (1947), in which she played yet another dance hall singer, and Return of the Badmen (1948) as a gunslinger, Cheyenne, who decides to swap her cowboy outfit for more feminine attire when she falls in love with Scott. Thereafter began a television career that lasted almost five decades, and got its first lift-off with Topper, in which she and her husband, Robert Sterling, played George and Marion Kerby, a couple of very visible, mischievous ghosts. Having appeared as a guest in almost any TV series one could name, she settled in to General Hospital (1984-2004) and its spin-off, Port Charles (2001-03), in the role of Amanda Barrington, a snobbish, devious, wealthy socialite. Jeffreys also appeared in Falcon Crest (1983) and played the mother of Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff) in Baywatch (1993-98). Jeffreys continued to show her versatility by starring in Broadway musicals such as Camelot (1962), The King and I (1974) and Follies (1977). She returned briefly to the big screen after an absence of 14 years in a small part in the romantic comedy Boys’ Night Out (1962). Jeffreys’ first marriage, to Joseph Serena, was annulled. Sterling, whom she married in 1951, died in 2006. She is survived by their three sons, Jeff, Dana and Tyler. • Anne Jeffreys, actor and singer, born 26 January 1923; died 27 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/04/who-is-marilou-danley-girlfriend-of-the-las-vegas-gunman","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T23:16:31Z","webTitle":"Marilou Danley, girlfriend of Las Vegas gunman, saw 'no warning' of violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/who-is-marilou-danley-girlfriend-of-the-las-vegas-gunman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/who-is-marilou-danley-girlfriend-of-the-las-vegas-gunman","fields":{"headline":"Marilou Danley, girlfriend of Las Vegas gunman, saw 'no warning' of violence","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Las Vegas gunman’s girlfriend spoke publicly for the first time since the shooting, saying on Wednesday that she had no idea of the massacre he was plotting when he sent her on a trip abroad to see her family. “It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,” Marilou Danley, 62, said in a statement read by her attorney Matthew Lombard outside FBI headquarters in Los Angeles. Danley returned from her native Philippines on Tuesday and was being questioned for much of the next day by FBI agents. She also said: “He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen.” Danley, who has been called a “person of interest” by investigators, said she was initially pleased when Stephen Paddock wired her money in the Philippines to buy a house for her family but later feared it was a way to break up with her. Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines days before the shooting, a US official not authorized to speak publicly because of the continuing investigation said on condition of anonymity. When she landed at Los Angeles international airport on Tuesday night, so did investigators’ best chance to understand the reasons for the carnage that unfolded on the Las Vegas strip on Sunday. “We have a lot of questions,” the Las Vegas undersheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters. When Danley landed, the 62-year-old mother and grandmother was met by FBI agents eager to learn what she knew about the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, committed by a man she had lived with for more than four years, according to public records. Danley left the airport in a wheelchair escorted by agents, but was reportedly not placed under arrest. There were no indications from authorities as to how willing she was to speak to investigators. “They don’t know a lot about who the girlfriend is and why she left the country a week prior to the shooting,” said the Nevada senator Dean Heller, who had been briefed by authorities. “She is someone they need to have this discussion with to better understand the shooting and what his thought process was.” Danley, Stephen Paddock’s longtime girlfriend, had arrived in the Philippines on 15 September, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press news agency. She then left for three days and returned again on 22 September before returning to the US late on Tuesday. So far, little is publicly known of Danley. According to Paddock’s brother Eric, she met Paddock when she was working as a casino hostess at the Atlantis in Reno, Nevada. Paddock was a frequent gambler, according to his brother and to an Australian acquaintance who spoke to the Guardian. Casino records showed he commonly wagered $10,000 or more a day. “They were adorable – big man, tiny woman. He loved her. He doted on her,” Eric Paddock told the Washington Post. The two often gambled side by side, he said. Danley is from the Philippines but has Australian citizenship, Australian authorities have said. Danley’s sister, who lives in Queensland, described Marilou as a “good person” and said she would not have known about Paddock’s plot. “I know that she doesn’t know anything as well, like us. She was sent away. She was away, so that she will not be there to interfere with what he’s planning,” the sister, whose name was not revealed, told the Seven Network. Danley was “madly in love” with Paddock, her sister said. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, employees of a Starbucks that Paddock and Danley frequented told the LA Times that they often observed him berating her. Esperanza Mendoza, the shop’s supervisor, said the abuse came when Danley would ask to use his casino card to make a purchase. The cards, a common form of currency on the Vegas strip, allow gamblers to spend credits earned on electronic gaming machines. Mendoza said: “He would glare down at her and say – with a mean attitude – ‘You don’t need my casino card for this. I’m paying for your drink, just like I’m paying for you.’ Then she would softly say, ‘OK,’ and step back behind him. He was so rude to her in front of us.” Fifty-nine people were killed and more than 500 injured on Sunday night when Paddock broke the windows of his 32nd floor hotel suite and began firing multiple semi-automatic rifles into the crowd at a country music concert. Many of the rifles had been modified with bump stock devices that allow the rifles to fire at a speed similar to that of an automatic weapon. So far, no motive has been discovered for the shooting and investigators said they “haven’t absolutely ruled out anything”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/08/one-two-three-swing-superflex-review-tate-modern-turbine-hall-martin-puryear-parasol-unit","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T07:00:44Z","webTitle":"Superflex: One Two Three Swing!; Martin Puryear review – lows and highs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/08/one-two-three-swing-superflex-review-tate-modern-turbine-hall-martin-puryear-parasol-unit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/08/one-two-three-swing-superflex-review-tate-modern-turbine-hall-martin-puryear-parasol-unit","fields":{"headline":"Superflex: One Two Three Swing!; Martin Puryear review – lows and highs","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"First the bad news. This is by far the worst Turbine Hall commission in the history of Tate Modern, and the steepest decline from Miroslaw Balka’s overwhelming black box, Ai Weiwei’s ocean of seeds or Olafur Eliasson’s great radiant sun. After Carsten Höller’s silver slides, moreover, tossing us down through the hall’s chasmic space, you might think no artist would be caught dead repeating the playground theme. But so it is with Danish art trio Superflex, who have filled the place with swing upon swing upon swing. Superflex’s projects range from manufacturing biogas in developing countries to building a park that transformed a run-down Copenhagen district. Civic-minded as ever, their swings start outside the museum, although they are easily overlooked. If it weren’t for the fact that the seats hanging from orange steel frames are big enough for two or three, you would never know they were art swings. Inside, a vast metal ball swings slowly back and forth through the entrance hall, reflecting the stripes of a colossal carpet running down the ramp below in nasty hues of ochre, green and cerise. And then you’re down among the endless swings. Endless, because new swings are (supposedly) arriving all the time at the back of the hall for dissemination out across London. A utopian future of orange swings! I doubt they’ll get further than Bankside. But that’s the trouble with this trivial project. Its vaunted ambitions are so specious. The experience is entirely banal: the ball reflects the stripes in repetitive riffs, the people swing monotonously to and fro; truly, you would have to be stoned. So Superflex have to prop it all up with socio-persiflage. They invite you to play like kids on the swings (as if there was any other way). They want you to make new friends, but more than that, common cause. If everyone got on and pushed together, they claim in the catalogue, then the pendulum would be disrupted from its normal course. But of course it’s only a metaphor, like the whole project. The stripes echo the colour of British banknotes; foreign workers are turning out the swings with which society may rise up and – Superflex flirtatiously imply – undermine global capitalism and perhaps even Brexit. In the frantic week of Frieze, where Florentine pietàs can be seen alongside the latest CGI art films, and almost anything may be bought or sold, it is usual for international art-worlders to take in the Turbine Hall commission for relaxation from the thousands of images dancing on their retinas. But there was no advance buzz this year, perhaps because the prospect of kidult swings and lurching ball was no more enticing than Superflex’s half-thought politics. The commission, sponsored by Hyundai, is always a gamble; the museum picks an artist, who comes up with an idea that may or may not play in its grandest space. But Superflex got no further than games. If I were Hyundai, I’d ask for my ball back. The mercy is that there is so much else at Tate Modern, including a magnificent self-portrait by the great African American sculptor Martin Puryear (born 1941) which is the vital masterpiece of the gallery’s current Soul of a Nation show, now in its final fortnight. A monolith carved out of sleek black wood, abstract but with oddly human overtones, it holds all its mysteries deep within an outer form so strange you have never seen anything like it before, yet so smooth as to invite, and reward, a soft touch. Unique yet familiar: this interplay turns out to be crucial to Puryear’s genius. This is one lesson of a tremendous survey at the Parasol Unit, the artist’s first in Britain, condensing 40 years into 30 works. And perhaps it is true of his art in itself: every piece is utterly singular and distinct, yet they all share the same beauty, warmth and humanity. Here is a wooden table that sprouts an amazing field of golden corn, raised up just high enough so that we stand in field-mouse relationship to it, staring into the high forest of stems. Or perhaps it is more like a shock of blond hair. Both hold true, doubling Puryear’s episodic power of surprise. Here is a huge Phrygian cap of the kind worn by freed slaves and French revolutionaries, glowing scarlet and proud, yet flopped over like a nightcap. From another angle, there’s something vulnerably mortal about it as well. At any rate, this vast red form is both potent and humble, visibly carved of wood yet apparently soft enough to embrace. Puryear once saw an antique print of a black man wearing such a “liberty cap” in the period when the revolution briefly abolished slavery. Political implications hover in the air. Allusions materialise in his work without direct representation. A large ovoid form, hollow and roughly the height of a man, is made out of black steel mesh. Move around it and the mesh, viewed through mesh, fairly glitters so that one has the sense of a bristling human head, as if the sculpture itself were thinking. Two vast conkers, linked by a gnarled maple twist, carry intimations of winter as well as autumn in their barbell weight. A single wooden hoop, painted exactly the right cerulean blue, describes what it implies: the whole expanse of the sky. Puryear works in other media as well. A question mark contorted and inverted is made comically more quizzical in gigantic bronze. Cork stoppers in metal boulders conjure living presences. But the artist’s main relationship is with wood, slowly and exquisitely worked. The scent of cedar, ash and oak lifts from his sculptures. Puryear is a giant of American art, with lifetime retrospectives at the Guggenheim, the Smithsonian and the Museum of Modern Art. So it is greatly to the credit of London’s diminutive Parasol Unit that is has managed to mount such a historic exhibition when mighty Tate Modern never has. Almost everything here is a revelation. I had no idea, for instance, that Puryear could be quite so humorous in his profundity. Brunhilde, a basket-like structure eight feet high, woven out of cedar strips, is a comical invocation of blond plaits and Wagnerian helmets, nonetheless light as any soprano. An innocent, animal-like hump, carved in pale pine, has a dark opening into which you peer; it’s called In Sheep’s Clothing. And the largest work here is nothing less than a meditation on the mind’s eye. A cube-shaped wooden cage borne on a tumbril holds a load you can’t quite make out. Look deep and you see a giant eye reflecting back your own. Closer still and the interior is revealed: a miracle of fan-vaulting that underpins this magical wooden sphere. Outer sight is fused with inner vision, art coincides with philosophy.

Here are the people fighting back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Walk into the home of Robert and Bertha Darden, and you are immediately surrounded by memories. Like many African American couples who have reached a certain age, the front room of their house is full of photos – of the Dardens in their youth, of their happy children and smiling grandchildren. Many of the moments reflected in the photos were captured during their 28 years spent in their Atlanta home. In the midst of all of these stands a plaque. “I received this when I retired after 29 years of working for the city of Atlanta,” Mr Dresden says. He’s an Atlanta man. Beaming with pride, he tells me he had started working for the Atlanta’s sanitation department in 1969, and later transferred to the department of transportation where he remained until his retirement in 1998. But now the city is aggressively trying to take their house. “It doesn’t feel good at all,” he says. “It’s not a good feeling to give the city 29 years of my life and then they want to take my home.” The process the city is attempting to use to take ownership of the house is known as “eminent domain” – the power for governmental entities to take private property for public use. The city claims it needs the house, along with others on the same block in the Peoplestown neighborhood, in order to build a park and pond that will help with street flooding. Meanwhile, community members suspect the flooding is being used as a pretext to facilitate private development in the neighborhood. This process is replicated throughout the US. If successful, eminent domain could become the newest tool that local and state governments could use to accelerate the gentrification and displacement that is already affecting low-income black and brown communities. ‘The most powerful tool in the gentrification arsenal’ Eminent domain has a long history in the US and also exists in other countries where it is known by many names including compulsory purchase, compulsory acquisition and, perhaps most appropriately, expropriation. The US constitution acknowledges the government’s power of eminent domain and imposes two limitations: the taking of property must be for public use, and it must include just compensation. Determinations of what constitutes public use have traditionally been left to each state, and the US supreme court has been increasingly expansive over the years. In Georgia, land cannot be taken and handed over to private developers to increase revenues. However, land can be taken for a public redevelopment project, such as a facility or park to help deal with flooding issues. And that is exactly what the city says it intends to do in Peoplestown. According to a press release issued by the city, “Once completed, the neighborhood will have a Japanese garden, gazebos for community gatherings, several detention ponds, and bio retention areas to treat stormwater.” Tanya Washington, a professor at Georgia State University, lives on the same street as the Dardens, and like them, she is in a legal battle to keep the city from taking her home. According to Washington, the city’s rationale is problematic because it uses the symptoms of the neighborhood’s systemic neglect to become a reason for displacing families. “What I’m concerned about is cities trying to use that crumbling infrastructure as a justification for exercising eminent domain because it provides a basis for arguing public necessity,” she says. Complicating the battle is the fact that cities are given a presumption of public necessity, placing the burden of proof on the homeowner. As a result, the state court hearing the initial case ruled in favor of Atlanta’s government, but Washington and the Dardens are appealing against the decision. If allowed by the courts, that built-in justification could become the most powerful tool in the gentrification arsenal. It would allow almost any city to use the legacy of institutional racism and systemic neglect to further advance the displacement of low-income black residents. In theory, the rationale for using eminent domain could include street flooding, high quantities of lead in city water systems, or even high crime rates in certain neighborhoods. The latter is not unimaginable: crime actually was part of the justification for the city demolishing all of its public housing. Atlanta’s decision to get rid of it eventually became a model for other cities. Its use of eminent domain could be next. When ‘urban renewal’ means pushing black residents out In the late 1950s, Atlanta embarked on its first attempt at “urban renewal”, which for many people at the time translated to “negro removal”. Hundreds of homes were demolished by the city, and thousands of black families in three neighborhoods (Summerhill, Peoplestown and Mechanicsville) were separated from each other when three interstates were constructed through the heart of their communities. The problem worsened in the mid-1960s when the city decided to build a new stadium to house a professional baseball team. A significant portion of the Summerhill neighborhood was wiped away. Whatever sense of community and connection had survived was reduced even further as business left and schools closed. Decades later, in preparation for the 1996 Olympics, an estimated 30,000 low-income Atlanta residents were displaced from their homes in order to make room for the new Olympic Stadium. Landlords in the area sought to raise rents to take advantage of proximity to the Olympic venues which meant many had no choice but to leave. In the process, 1,195 public housing units were gone, and by 2000, only 78 of the families from the former public housing were rehoused in the shiny new development – a mere 7% of the pre-Olympics population. Moreover, the project launched a new agenda that ultimately resulted in Atlanta becoming the first US city to completely demolish all of its housing projects, eliminating 17,000 units of public housing. The Dardens understand these negative side-effects all too well. Such projects tend to place extreme demands on the pre-existing infrastructure, whether in the form of increased traffic or other environmental concerns. Mrs Darden recalls that as the new Olympic Stadium was being constructed, the city had to build a tunnel that could handle water drainage from the stadium. “The tunnel was supposed to go through Grant Park,” she said, referring to a nearby neighborhood where residents are predominantly white with higher incomes. “But Grant Park residents refused to let them bring the tunnel to that neighborhood, so they stopped it in our back yard.” As a result, the Dardens and their Peoplestown neighbors say they have had flooding issues ever since Olympic Stadium was built. These issues led to significant flood damage in 2006 and 2012 after heavy rains, and several residents, including the Dardens, eventually sued the city for failing to address the hazard. Several street drains on their block often become clogged with tree limbs, garbage and other debris. “If the city had just cleaned out the drains the way they should have, the flooding never would have happened.” Instead, ever since 2006 Mr Darden has taken it upon himself to periodically clear the street drains, especially when heavy rain is expected. One could argue that despite his retirement, at the age of 67 he continues to work for the city more than the city works for him. ‘Why don’t y’all just move back to the country?’’ In 2005, the city of Atlanta proposed the Atlanta Beltline Project: a 6,500-acre ring of parks, open space, light rail transit and mixed-use development along a 22-mile industrial rail line that circles the core of the city. Given the previous experience with major development projects in the city, the not-for-profit organization Georgia Stand-Up commissioned a study to explore rising home prices in areas adjoining the proposed Beltline path and to offer recommendations to avoid displacement. Even at this early stage, the 2007 report highlighted troubling increases in property values that did not bode well for low-income renters and owners on the city’s south side. Unfortunately, not enough was done by the city to address those concerns. The project’s affordable housing effort was underfunded, and many of the affordability requirements were either too weak, too temporary or both. The trend towards gentrification increased. A more recent Georgia Tech report shows that prices in neighborhoods bordering the south side of the Beltline increased by 40% from 2011 to 2015, while prices further away increased by 18%. The Dardens have seen the impact first hand. “Some of our friends were renting, and when it came time to renew their lease, the landlords wouldn’t renew and sold their properties to developers instead,” she said. “Some neighbors say the rents went up so much they couldn’t afford it. It doubled or even tripled. We have a lot of senior citizens on fixed incomes who can’t afford that.” And it’s not just renters. Her aunt used to come by on Sundays to pick up one of the neighbors who attended the same church. The neighbor lost her house because she couldn’t afford to pay the increasing property taxes. Mr Darden mentions the house right across the street. “The owner got sick and sold the house. Not sure how much, but a developer bought it, remodeled and just finished it a few months ago. They put it on market for sale, I believe asking $469,000. And that’s just a wood frame house, not even brick like ours.” A house two blocks away recently sold for $515,000. And just a few houses down the street from the Dardens, a house that recently sold for around $100,000 is now listed for around $300,000 after remodeling. Mrs Darden recalled an experience at a town hall meeting last year. “During the public comments, my husband was speaking about some of the issues, and a new white neighbor who had moved here about a year earlier called out, ‘Why don’t y’all just move back to the country?’” To the Dardens, the translation was clear. “Get out.” Not all of the new residents share that attitude. Washington, the professor at Georgia State University, is a relatively new resident of Peoplestown, having moved there in 2011. From her perspective, the main reason she moved there was because she appreciated the neighborhood the way it was and valued her neighbors. “I love to be able to sit on the porch and talk to some of the older neighbors,” she said. “I wasn’t looking to replace, neutralize or change them.” She respected the neighborhood association that was in existence, and didn’t feel like she needed to start a new one. But some new residents, particularly white ones, felt differently. “When folks decide to start their own associations, it sends a message. The imposition of an us versus them, new versus old, resident versus buyer perspective is not healthy for a community,” Washington said. “It has produced harsh feelings on behalf of long-term residents who feel slighted and disrespected. And it impedes building a common platform and demanding representation of the whole community. Part of the community invites development because they don’t feel threatened by it. Part of the community is scared to death of it because of decades of past experience.” Such a split often paves the way for other interested parties such as developers to pursue “divide and conquer” strategies, and as the most recent promise of development began to take shape, the community was vulnerable. Carla Smith, the city councilwoman who represents Peoplestown and Summerhill, argues that the community was able to participate in a Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) that resulted in a robust planning document. “No one will argue that the LCI is not a good product; everyone was involved in that,” she said. The owners and developers of the property announced signing an “agreement” which incorporates concepts from the LCI, stating, “We are deeply committed to making the community safer, stronger, healthier and more stable.” However, Washington highlights that none of it is enforceable. ‘We have to give a damn’ As frustrating as the fight has been for Washington, she remains optimistic and she knows that other cities have found ways to resist gentrification. “But the first thing you have to do is you have to name it and call it what it is. It’s not a question of can we do it … There are lots of policy practices, tax incentives and laws that can be put in place. So there’s no lack of capacity, but there’s a lack of political will. We have to give a damn. We have to give a damn about people staying in their home. We have to give a damn about poor and working-class folks, and about seniors who want to spend their sunset years in the homes that they know and love. We have to care, and our policies will follow our compassion.” Atlanta voters will soon have an opportunity to influence how much the city government cares about these issues. The current mayor is unable to seek re-election due to term limits and on Tuesday the city voted for a new mayor and city council. “Lots of people running are touting their long record of service and how many years they’ve been in public positions,” Washington says. “For some of them, their record is their indictment. Because this [gentrification] happened on your watch, and not only did you not stop it, you facilitated it.” Mrs Darden agrees about the current lack of political will and the need for new leadership. “We need new city council people and a new mayor that has a heart for the people.” As for Mr Darden, he believes the battle is about faith. “I still trust God, and I won’t doubt him. We’re not gonna bow to the city.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/04/joachim-low-germany-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T16:33:24Z","webTitle":"Joachim Löw alarmed by Bundesliga clubs’ poor showing in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/joachim-low-germany-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/04/joachim-low-germany-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Joachim Löw alarmed by Bundesliga clubs’ poor showing in Europe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joachim Löw has described German clubs’ performances in Europe this season as “alarming” and a wake-up call for those who claim the Bundesliga produces the world’s best talent. All six German teams in Champions League and Europa League action last week were beaten with Bayern Munich’s 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain costing Carlo Ancelotti his job. Mats Hummels, who was on the bench for Bayern in Paris, admitted the results were “very embarrassing indeed”. His club’s 3-0 win over Anderlecht in the first round of Champions League matches represents Germany’s only victory in 12 European fixtures this term. There have been nine defeats in total. Löw, in Belfast for Thursday’sWorld Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland, insists it is too early to dismiss German prospects in Europe this season but claimed the quality of the Bundesliga has been exaggerated for too long. “The weak performances of German clubs in Europe is hopefully just a momentary blip but it is alarming,” the Germany manager said. “It is too early to say whether it is a general trend. Bayern and Dortmund have every chance to progress in the Champions League and it is the same for the Europa League teams. “But for a while now I, and my coaches, have been thinking about how to improve things in the Bundesliga and that it’s wrong to praise the Bundesliga to the high heavens or say only the Bundesliga produces the best talent. That would be untrue and people who say this have been humbled by this recent experience. We have to recognise this. We know this from sending scouts to other countries including South America. We know there is talent all around the world and the Bundesliga isn’t the be-all and end-all.” Löw agreed with Jürgen Klinsmann’s assessment that retaining the World Cup in Russia next summer will be Germany’s toughest challenge. The former Germany head coach also suggested in a recent interview that his successor will retire after the next World Cup and, while refusing to be drawn on that issue, admitted he wanted to coach at club level one day. “On the first item I think he’s right,” Löw said. “It will be the hardest task for us as reigning champions and Confederation Cup winners. It will be tremendously difficult to maintain the same level and enthusiasm in our players especially as other nations have caught up and have outstanding players in their ranks. “As for the other point, retirement is far from my mind. I’m enjoying life as it stands and I have a contract running for some more years. But I can quite imagine taking over at a club at one point. I love being on the pitch with players and working with them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/06/aldous-harding-elation-soundtrack-black-mirror-folk-goth-wretch-32-sound-of-arrows","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T14:00:54Z","webTitle":"Aldous Harding’s Elation: the soundtrack to a Black Mirror episode about a time-travelling folk-goth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/06/aldous-harding-elation-soundtrack-black-mirror-folk-goth-wretch-32-sound-of-arrows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/06/aldous-harding-elation-soundtrack-black-mirror-folk-goth-wretch-32-sound-of-arrows","fields":{"headline":"Aldous Harding’s Elation: the soundtrack to a Black Mirror episode about a time-travelling folk-goth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK Aldous Harding Elation With her earthy voice – as timeless as the autumn leaves falling on to your moth-mangled winter coat – New Zealand’s Aldous Harding could be singing this rich, wistful ballad on the Titanic in 1909, or around a campfire on a hippy commune in the 70s.

Lord Coe, president of the IAAF, admitted athletics needs a facelift if it is to compete for audiences, advertising and sponsorship deals with other mainstream sports. This could include athletes being bid for by city franchises in a similar format to cricket’s IPL or even having temporary athletics tracks built inside football stadiums. “Over the next year, our relentless focus on formats and the changes we make in the sport has to be laser-like,” said Coe. “I’m not ruling anything out now. Everything is on the table. I want to look at simple things. Why are we wedded to 400m tracks? Why not have a pop-up 300m track in a football stadium? “There are lots of things we can do,” he added. “What about cities, teams, franchises? You see the excitement of the pick with the IPL auction. We need to have some early hour moments of unease about what we are prepared to do. We have to be radical.” London 2017 saw a streamlining of the world championship schedule, with fewer individual sessions than previous editions and Coe said further changes could be made before the next world championships in Doha in 2019. “In London there were days when there were no morning sessions,” said Coe, speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference. “There was a greater focus on semis and finals, so you’re not having the soufflé collapsing halfway through the evening because the crowd has just seen a spectacular final and then you go to the first round of another event. “I talked about the concept of pop-up tracks,” he added. “We’ve got stadiums, we’ve got football pitches. Why can’t we put a 200m track in a venue? It wouldn’t be a championship track, but take the sport to where you’ve got infrastructure.” The retirement of Usain Bolt after the London world championships has presented athletics with a serious marketing headache because there are few genuine stars who transcend the sport. Coe admitted athletics lacks outspoken voices. “They’re not going to fill the boots of Usain Bolt straight away,” said Coe. “This is not simply about finding somebody who is going to dominate sprinting for three Olympic Games with world records. It’s actually about his personality, we are in the entertainment business. “They have to have an opinion, they have to dominate a room, they have to dominate a stadium. I go to a lot of press conferences post race, and too often I sit there thinking: ‘Are you really offering as much as you should, in terms of the insights and the accessibility?’ On balance they’ve got to be interesting, they’ve got to have an opinion. That’s what takes the sport beyond the stadium.” The retired British 800m runner Jenny Meadows revealed this week she has earned more money in the past 12 months since becoming a pacemaker than she ever did when competing. Coe said he was keen to see more focus on rivalries and competitive races within athletics than a relentless obsession with records. “We’ve got to get people to recognise that good racing is not simply about how fast can you get from A to B,” he said, “There’s got to be a drama, there’s got to be things happening. “There’s quite an emphasis on those meet directors to always push for times and distances. Sometimes there’s more to it. The choreography of a race is much more than who are the seven, 10 fastest people in the field. I think that also impacts, sometimes, on the quality of our championship races.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T16:38:28Z","webTitle":"Saudi king's visit to Russia heralds shift in global power structures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east","fields":{"headline":"Saudi king's visit to Russia heralds shift in global power structures","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia’s King Salman opened his historic four-day visit to Moscow by signalling a new era of cooperation with Russia, but demanding that Iran, an ally of the Kremlin, end its “interference” in Middle East politics. King Salman called for any peace settlement in Syria to ensure that the country remained integrated, but he did not repeat the longstanding, and now shelved, Saudi call for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to stand aside. The visit to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Thursday is the first by a ruling Saudi monarch to Moscow and is widely seen as a potential turning point in Middle East politics, and even the conduct of world oil markets. More than 15 cooperation agreements worth billions of pounds were signed, ranging from oil, military and space exploration, leading the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to claim the visit marked the moment when Saudi-Russian relations “reached a new qualitative level”. In one of the most remarkable deals, the Saudis said they would purchase the Russian S-400 defence system. Many of the agreements covering Saudi investment in the Russia energy markets are hardly likely to strengthen the impact of EU and American sanctions over Russia’s interference in Ukraine. But Saudi Arabia is keen that the visit also secures a more permanent Russian cooperation over oil prices after a January agreement between the world’s two largest oil producers managed to stabilise oil prices. Saudi Arabia wants to prolong the oil agreement, which curbed production and raised prices. Speaking in Moscow, the Saudi energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, said the January agreement “had breathed life back into Opec” and made his country more optimistic about the future of oil. “The success of this collaboration is clear,” he said. Russia is not a member of Opec, but badly needs oil prices to rise to rescue its ailing economy. The Saudis have traditionally seen the US as its chief – if not exclusive – foreign policy partner, but changes inside the Saudi regime, as well as Saudi fears about US reliability, have left the kingdom looking to diversify into wider set of alliances. The visit has been in the works for months, if not years, but the Trump administration’s failure to give the Saudis unambivalent support in its dispute with Qatar earlier this year disappointed the Saudis. Russia and Saudi were at loggerheads through most of the cold war and the Saudis have been stymied by the Russian decision to prop up Assad at a time when it was supporting the Syrian opposition with cash and arms. Faced with Assad’s Russian-backed military advance in the south and west of Syria, the Saudis have been forced to scale back their political demands that Assad leave. They remain virulently opposed to an Iranian presence in Syria and will be seeking assurances from Putin that the Iranian militias fighting alongside the regime will be forced to leave Syria as part of any peace settlement. The Saudis also want the Iranians to stop backing the Houthi opposition in Yemen. In his opening remarks at the Kremlin, King Salman stressed his opposition to Iran, saying: “We emphasise that the security and stability of the Gulf region and the Middle East is an urgent necessity for achieving stability and security in Yemen. This would demand that Iran give up interference with the internal affairs of the region, to give up actions destabilising the situation in this region.” Russia has pulled out all the diplomatic stops to welcome the Saudi king, although there was glitch when the golden escalator due to take the ageing king down the steps at Moscow airport failed to function."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/10/eurostar-web-booking-raising-price","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Eurostar’s web of confusion kept raising price of my trip to Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/10/eurostar-web-booking-raising-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/10/eurostar-web-booking-raising-price","fields":{"headline":"Eurostar’s web of confusion kept raising price of my trip to Paris","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I recently made a booking to go to Paris.

Since the average length of time between pyjama washes is two weeks (the most common excuse people gave was that their nightwear didn’t smell), you might think being naked is healthier. After all, your skin needs to breathe, doesn’t it? The solution There isn’t a lot of research on the topic. But first off, skin doesn’t breathe. The idea that air will waft over our naked bodies and we will somehow soak it up just isn’t true. But sleeping naked does keep you cooler – the optimal temperature for sleeping is around 20C (68F). Lack of sleep is linked to a multitude of conditions such as diabetes, obesity, stroke and depression. It is also corrosive to relationships. If you are too hot in bed, then your core temperature will struggle to fall which, according to the Sleep Council, means you won’t trigger your “sleep mechanism”. During sleep, your body’s temperature falls naturally after three or four hours – and wearing fluffy pyjamas under a heavy duvet will disrupt that. However, your feet mustn’t get too cold, as that also disturbs sleep. Rather than wearing bed socks, which get hotter by the hour, you should use a hot water bottle. Then there is the sex and reproductive health angle. Wearing underwear at bedtime increases the likelihood of your genital region getting sweaty, especially in summer. For women with conditions such as vulvitis, an inflammation of the outer genitalia in which the skin folds are red and swollen with tiny cracks, wearing underwear in a warm bed can encourage opportunistic infections such as yeast that thrive in dark, sweaty crevices. According to a study in Andrology, men who don’t wear pants at night may improve the quality of their sperm. Data from about 500 men in the US showed that those who wore boxers during the day and nothing at night had a 25% lower risk of DNA fragmentation in their sperm than those who wore tight pants night and day. However, the study didn’t show that their partners were more likely to get pregnant or to do so more quickly. Research in the Journal of Urology found no significant difference between underwear types and semen quality. “It is highly unlikely that underwear has a significant effect on male fertility,” concluded the authors. In the absence of any evidence except that most pyjamas are dirty and you shouldn’t overheat, the choice of whether or not to use nightwear is not a health issue. But in the case of those people in surveys who said they wore tracksuits – they really are not for sleeping in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/the-guardian-view-on-taxing-the-digital-economy-crunch-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:25:56Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on taxing the digital economy: crunch time | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/the-guardian-view-on-taxing-the-digital-economy-crunch-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/the-guardian-view-on-taxing-the-digital-economy-crunch-time","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on taxing the digital economy: crunch time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The EU’s faltering progress towards a common system of taxing the huge revenues of the new digital giants lurched forward this morning as Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner in charge of competition, declared that Amazon had received unfair state aid from Luxembourg through its tax arrangements, and demanded that it pay €250m (£222m) in back taxes. At the same time, Ms Verstager announced that the European commission would haul Ireland up before the European court of justice for its failure to demand €13bn of unpaid tax from Apple, identified in an earlier investigation. The two events illustrate the gulf between the commission, together with some of the EU’s largest economies, and smaller members such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Baltic state of Estonia, which hosted a summit on the digital economy last week. Both Ireland and Luxembourg defend their tax arrangements. Ireland in particular welcomes the thousands of good jobs that the tech giants bring and has no desire to find ways of extracting more tax from them in case it drives them away. The Irish government also insists that taxation is a sovereign matter, not an arena for EU interference. Others are under pressure from voters who are outraged that any company can make so much profit in their country and pay so little tax on it. Revenue from Facebook’s UK operations, it has emerged, nearly quadrupled last year to £842m, through growth in digital ad sales; its corporation tax bill crept up from £4.2m to £5.1m. The US inland revenue service is also keen to find transparent ways of taxing the new digital economy, and is watching jealously as the European commission draws up its plans, suspicious of any move that might be used by the tech giants to offset their US tax bills. Already, companies such as Google and Amazon hold billions of dollars in offshore funds, where they are out of reach of the taxman. The US defensiveness about its own tax revenues points to the need for a global rather than a merely European solution to the question of how, what and where to tax the digital economy, but progress through the OECD, the natural forum, is glacial, and would in any event only be advisory. In the absence of common action, some countries are making their own proposals. Last week, Emmanuel Macron presented a sensible plan to levy a turnover tax on a country-by-country basis which now has majority EU support. Britain is a dissenter and, with some other critics, has fundamental questions about the wisdom of treating the digital economy in a different way from any other business. The commission is still hoping to get agreement on a common corporate tax base that would help to identify the parameters of any new tax system, but progress has stalled because of complexities around double taxation. Meanwhile the American Chamber of Commerce in Europe is warning that any attempt to tax the tech giants more would threaten investment and expansion. But across most of the EU discontent is growing, not just over the failure to pay tax – which has already prompted some tech companies to become more transparent, and even pay more – but over many of their practices. The chief executive of the ride-hailing app Uber has been in London this week trying to patch up relations with TfL. Margrethe Vestager is right: enforcing regulations works."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/04/canada-childrens-book-recalled-whitewashing-history","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:05:22Z","webTitle":"Canada children's book recalled amid accusations of whitewashing history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/04/canada-childrens-book-recalled-whitewashing-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/04/canada-childrens-book-recalled-whitewashing-history","fields":{"headline":"Canada children's book recalled amid accusations of whitewashing history","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Canadian publishing company has recalled a children’s workbook after critics accused it of “whitewashing” the treatment of First Nations following the arrival of European settlers in Canada. The workbook, designed as supplementary material for school-age children, recasts the dispossession of First Nations peoples as voluntary, with no mention of lands not signed away through treaty or government policies that sought to starve First Nations peoples in order to move them to reserves. Under the heading Moving Out, the book claims: “When the European settlers arrived, they needed land to live on. The First Nations peoples agreed to move to different areas to make room for the new settlements.” The First Nations peoples moved to reserves, the workbook later notes, “where they could live undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of the settlers”. The passages – which surfaced on social media this week – sparked anger across Canada. “Please do not gloss over the way the white Europeans stole the land from the First Nations people and inflicted terrible murders and damage to them,” one commenter told the publisher on Facebook. Another noted, “You need to stop this white washing immediately! Tell the truth! Both the good old US of A and Canada committed heinous acts against Native Americans.” Others drew links between the misinformation and Canada’s fledgling efforts to confront its historical mistreatment of the country’s indigenous peoples. “This is why the majority of people are so clueless when it comes to the reality of the suffering, oppression and injustice that First Nations (Aboriginal) Peoples have been subjected to for decades … How are people supposed to begin trying to heal when the future leaders of our country are being exposed to this nonsense?” said one Facebook post. The publisher of the workbook, The Popular Book Company, initially responded to concerns by saying that it would revise the section in upcoming reprints. On Tuesday, after one of the country’s largest book retailers said it would remove the book from its shelves, the company issued an immediate recall. “We know that our Complete Canadian Curriculum Grade 3 does not provide an accurate depiction of the interaction between Canada’s First Nations and European settlers,” the publisher said in a statement. The publisher, who did not reply to a request for comment, said in the statement that it would seek to work with members of First Nations communities to more accurately reflect the time period. “While we cannot undo what has already been published, we are committed to making things better for future editions,” it said. “We know that we have to do better and we know that it will take us some time to improve upon this experience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/05/court-to-hear-challenge-to-gchq-bulk-hacking-of-phones-and-computers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"Court to hear challenge to GCHQ bulk hacking of phones and computers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/05/court-to-hear-challenge-to-gchq-bulk-hacking-of-phones-and-computers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/05/court-to-hear-challenge-to-gchq-bulk-hacking-of-phones-and-computers","fields":{"headline":"Court to hear challenge to GCHQ bulk hacking of phones and computers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A challenge to GCHQ’s use of non-specific warrants to authorise the bulk hacking of smartphones, computers and networks in the UK is starting at the court of appeal.

The original claim dates back to 2014 and was brought at the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) following revelations by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden who exposed the extent of surveillance carried out by the US’s National Security Agency and the UK’s GCHQ. The IPT hears complaints about government surveillance and the intelligence services. Some of its hearings are held behind closed doors. PI, along with seven internet service providers, argued that computer network exploitation (CNE) carried out by GCHQ, the government monitoring station in Cheltenham, breaches human rights. At the first hearing, Ben Jaffey QC, for PI, argued that since the 18th century the common law has opposed the use of such non-specific warrants. In February last year, however, the IPT ruled that the legal regime under which warrants were issued for the agency to carry out equipment interference, or hacking, in the UK was compatible with the European convention on human rights. The decision said that warrants do not need to be “defined by reference to named or identified individuals”. Frustrated at the outcome, PI launched a judicial review of the IPT’s decision in the high court because there was, effectively, no right of appeal from the tribunal. In February this year, the high court ruled in favour of GCHQ and the Foreign Office, rejecting the judicial review challenge. On Thursday, the next stage of the legal battle goes before the court of appeal. In advance of the hearing, Scarlet Kim, a legal officer at PI, said: “The [IPT] unlawfully sanctioned the UK government’s use of sweeping powers to hack hundreds or thousands of people’s computers and phones with a single warrant. Rather than debate the necessity and proportionality of their expansive hacking powers, the government is instead arguing that the UK courts should have no jurisdiction to review the legality of the tribunal’s decisions. “Too often, the government justifies intrusive surveillance powers by telling the public that ‘if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear’. We throw that mantra back to the government: ‘If you have nothing to hide about your hacking, you have nothing to hide from our courts.’” If PI loses the case it could be ordered to pay up to £25,000 of the government’s legal costs under a “protective costs order” that caps its liabilities. To pay for the challenge, the organisation has launched a crowdfunding appeal through the website CrowdJustice. In its appeal, PI argues: “Hacking actually makes us less safe because it compromises the technology that is increasingly embedded into the fabric of our lives. By hacking our devices, the government is choosing to take advantage of security holes, which leaves us all more vulnerable to future cyber-attacks. By hacking, the government has deliberately chosen to make our technology less secure than it can be.” Welcoming the IPT judgment in 2015, the then foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: “A proper balance is being struck between the need to keep Britain safe and the protection of individuals’ privacy.” He added: “The ability to exploit computer networks plays a crucial part in our ability to protect the British public. Once again, the law and practice around our security and intelligence agencies’ capabilities and procedures have been scrutinised by an independent body and [have] been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/05/vs-naipaul-shockingly-disloyal-to-his-literary-friend-claims-spurling","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T09:45:10Z","webTitle":"VS Naipaul: shockingly disloyal to his literary friend, claims Spurling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/05/vs-naipaul-shockingly-disloyal-to-his-literary-friend-claims-spurling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/05/vs-naipaul-shockingly-disloyal-to-his-literary-friend-claims-spurling","fields":{"headline":"VS Naipaul: shockingly disloyal to his literary friend, claims Spurling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A decade after the Nobel laureate VS Naipaul published his autobiography, some of his words have come back to haunt him – and sparked a literary feud involving three of Britain’s foremost writers. Passages in which Naipaul dismissed the writing of the late novelist Anthony Powell have sparked condemnation from Hilary Spurling, the prize-winning biographer, who accuses him of carrying out an inexplicable “act of vengeance” against a loyal friend. While researching her biography of Powell, which is published on Thursday, Spurling said, she found that Sir Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul had said one thing in public and quite another in private. She said: “In his memoirs, titled A Writer’s People, Naipaul claimed to have read no more [of Powell’s novels] until Tony died, when he was asked by a literary editor to write about him. So he read the middle section of the sequence and was appalled by its narrative clumsiness and shallow characterisation.” Naipaul had written: “I didn’t know how to present myself to people who knew Powell. I didn’t think anyone would believe that, after all the years of friendship, I had not read Powell in any serious and connected way, had only just done so, and didn’t now think of him as a writer. It was a piece of Ibsen-like horror. “It wasn’t something I could put to the editor, who had asked me to write about him. So I did nothing … Through all our friendship, I had never ceased to think of him as a great writer. It may be that the friendship lasted all that time because I had not examined his work.” Having been given access to the family archives, Spurling has been taken aback by the contents of a 1986 letter from Naipaul to Powell, which takes a completely different view. Referring to The Acceptance World, the third of Powell’s novels in his sequence of 12 called A Dance to the Music of Time, Naipaul began with the words “A fan letter”. He continued: “I’ve been reading The Acceptance World again. I cannot tell you the pleasure – much greater than before – it has given me. So original; so rich; so beguiling; so classical; so full of wisdom and gentleness and passion.” He likened “the language and the images” of one of its scenes to “the wonder and magic of a sonnet by Shakespeare”. Spurling struggles to understand how Naipaul could have written a deeply moving letter about Powell’s writing, only to trash him after his death: “There was no call on him to do this, to go out of his way – and he does.” She added: “I presume it was jealousy. I can see no other reason why you would attack a dead man for writing books that when he was alive you thought were absolutely wonderful. It’s weird.” Naipaul, a Trinidad-born British writer, won the 2001 Nobel prize for literature, with his autobiographical novel The Enigma of Arrival, singled out by the Swedish Academy as “a masterpiece”. Spurling praises him as a “marvellous novelist”, but she questions why he felt the need “to attack a dead man”. She said: “It’s completely gobsmacking … That’s a real act of vengeance for someone who had never been anything but kind, and a reversal of what he thought when he read the books before.” She said that Powell had been Naipaul’s mentor and supporter when he needed it most, and that they remained close friends; he secured regular work for him on Punch and a column in The Statesman, “which was his lifeline”. Spurling added: “In his first years, when he came to England, [Naipaul] had an incredibly hard time … People were very conscious of race in those days. Tony was literary editor of Punch. Writers he knew were hard up he was especially good to. He’d send them books to review. That’s when he took up Naipaul. He reviewed his books himself. He thought they were wonderful. Then he met him, took him to lunch … and that’s how their friendship began. He introduced him to all sorts of other people … There’s a letter from Naipaul to Tony, again private, saying, ‘I just don’t know how I would have got through those years without you.’” She added: “Tony understood what a good writer he was from the very start, from his first novel, when he was just a young West Indian that nobody knew. It’s an extraordinary thing to have done, but that’s just literary feuds for you.” Naipaul’s literary agent declined to comment. His 1986 letter is now in the public domain following the Powell family’s decision to sell it, but there was no reference to it in Naipaul’s biography, Spurling said. She added: “I’m stating facts … He’s likely to be hopping mad. But if you behave like that…”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/06/reviews-roundup-jennifer-egan-martin-amis-eth-tephens-avidowitz","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T15:29:56Z","webTitle":"Reviews roundup: Manhattan Beach; The Rub of Time; and Everybody Lies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/06/reviews-roundup-jennifer-egan-martin-amis-eth-tephens-avidowitz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/06/reviews-roundup-jennifer-egan-martin-amis-eth-tephens-avidowitz","fields":{"headline":"Reviews roundup: Manhattan Beach; The Rub of Time; and Everybody Lies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pulitzer prize-winner Jennifer Egan’s new book, Manhattan Beach, is “a novel that deserves to join the canon of New York stories”, according to Amor Towles in the New York Times. Set in that city between the Depression and the second world war, it depicts a woman looking for her missing father while working as a diver for the navy. Its period research “weighs it down”, thought the Evening Standard’s David Sexton, but “it has also enabled her to write here a gripping, modern version of a 19th-century novel”. For Lucy Atkins in the Sunday Times, “Egan’s descriptive writing is superlative... However, some sections, often involving technical details or descriptions of life at sea, do feel ponderous… her characters are never baddies or angels, they are complex and forgiven. It will win accolades, but whether it is a truly transporting read will depend, heavily, on your desire for narrative propulsion.” Martin Amis examines superlative writing – and sport, porn and politics – in his collection of essays, The Rub of Time. It features “some wonderful writing about football, tennis, Philip Larkin and his own dad, Kingsley”, wrote Anthony Quinn in the Mail on Sunday. “But elsewhere there’s a distinct whiff of used stock in the air... His tirade against Donald Trump ... already it feels like yesterday’s news. His piece on Jeremy Corbyn ... is breathtakingly feeble... Amis’s perspective on British politics, taken from his Brooklyn domicile, rarely felt compelling; now it looks irrelevant. His more personal essays are the best … The Rub of Time, however, creaks in its joints.” The Times’s Roger Lewis found “Amis’s literary criticism ... richly enjoyable [and] his intellectual gifts ... formidable” but was also “less convinced by Amis’s political reporting”. Nonetheless, he is “bayonet-sharp”. According to the Sunday Times’s Claire Lowdon, “the literary essays will leave you educated, enlightened, entertained … The reportage in particular is extremely good ... On sport, Amis is at his funniest... But it’s hard to see why some of the pieces in the ‘politics’ sections have been included.” The New Statesman’s Leo Robson wrote: “In the areas that readers do care about, Amis delivers exceptional service. [It] is a riot of immaculately delivered punchlines and improbably sustained set-pieces.” Everybody Lies, according to Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, whose book is subtitled What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are. What it tells us is that lots of people are racist, sexist and paranoid about their own bodies, apparently. Stephens-Davidowitz is “probably not overstating it when he claims that the continuing study of these searches ‘will radically expand our understanding of mankind’”, wrote Oliver Thring in the Sunday Times, who concluded: “This undemanding book is a useful first step towards that knowledge.” John Thornhill in the Financial Times found it “an absorbing, and impassioned, examination of these new data sources”, even though “the seriousness of his message is, at times, undermined by the over-jauntiness of his prose style.” Overall, it “makes for glum reading”, according to Sam Leith in the Evening Standard. “But it’s glumly compelling ... In our neuroses and anxieties, Google’s giant dataset tells us: you are not alone ... Google searches are a window into ... the boundlessness of our species’s greatest asset, the asset that may save us: curiosity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/it-could-have-been-mexico-the-joy-of-whale-watching-in-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"‘It could have been Mexico’: the joy of whale-watching in Yorkshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/it-could-have-been-mexico-the-joy-of-whale-watching-in-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/it-could-have-been-mexico-the-joy-of-whale-watching-in-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"‘It could have been Mexico’: the joy of whale-watching in Yorkshire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was telling a Londoner recently about the North Yorkshire coast. “I really must go one day,” she said, sounding unconvinced. “But we’ve already booked for Mexico next year – we’re going whale-watching.” I had already sold my home county’s charms long enough, so I decided against landing another killer blow: God’s own county has whales, too. Sean Baxter, a fisherman who lives in the village of Staithes, has been encouraging me to search them out for years. “The summer herring shoals are back,” he told me recently. “We’ve got all sorts of marine life living off them: minke whales, porpoises, dolphins, basking sharks – even humpbacks and sunfish some years.” This was another reason why I failed to mention the Yorkshire leviathans: I had never clapped eyes on them myself. Surely Yorkshire whale-watching could not be a patch on places with exotic names like Kaikoura, Anacortes and Isle St Marie? How could Yorkshire ever compete? Baxter was adamant that it could. There was only one way to test it out. We went in late September, accompanied by wildlife guide Richard Baines. The weather, serene in summer, was already showing signs of breaking up. The morning started badly: there was a splatter of cold rain and a chilly greyness enveloped everything, especially when we got out to sea. Baines, however, sensed hope. There were rafts of young puffins, their beaks yet to develop the distinctive red and yellow coverings (it is like a fingernail that falls off every year); there were gannets diving and skuas pursuing them. There were even early migrants coming over from Scandinavia – a robin chased the boat valiantly, looking for a rest, and a kestrel powered across, heading for the coast. “We are on a major migration route,” Baines explained. A chiff-chaff fluttered past, looking a bit tired after what was probably a journey of at least 500 miles. The advantage of having Baines around was becoming clear: the man is a bird-identification demon. Nothing escaped his eye: great skua, arctic skua, long-tailed skua, manx shearwater, razorbill. For Baxter, though, the birds had added value. “They will lead us to the whales. If there’s a ball of herring, it attracts the birds.” Slowly, the clouds lifted, revealing the cliffs. Patches of sunlight stepped along distant fields. The sight of a pair of hunting gannets plummeting into the waves drew us farther out, towards deeper water. I was scanning the water so intensely that every shadow had become a glimpse of whale back, but when it finally came there was no doubt. Fifteen metres off the starboard bow, a patch of sea suddenly went glassy smooth; an instant later, a great, black submarine of an animal – a minke whale – burst upwards with an explosion of breath. Its dorsal fin appeared, then its back arched and it went down. The whole sequence lasted only a second. “That’s a juvenile,” shouted Baxter, turning the boat to port. “He will do that three times – watch out over there.” The whale had other ideas. We waited and waited, but the creature remained below. My adrenaline level subsided gradually to normal and I was sure our moment had gone. Then, half an hour later, in a different spot, the whale came up again. Now, its dorsal fin was racing effortlessly through the waves towards the boat. “He’s going under us,” shouted Baxter. I could see the distinctive white patches on his pectoral fins, but then it twisted slightly and surfaced a moment later right in front of the boat. There was a massive exhalation – from the whale and from me. I swear it was taking a good look at our boat and its crew. Then its dorsal fin came over and it went down. For the rest of the morning, we spotted other minkes, seven in total, all separate but in the same few square miles of sea. Minkes tend to be more solitary than some other whales, which perhaps is why they remain enigmatic. Their brains are double the size of a human’s and show high levels of gyrification, or furrowing, which is often associated with cognitive ability. They are thought to breed off the west coast of Ireland in spring (a time when they breach – leap from – the water) then move around the British Isles following herring, a migration that brings them into Yorkshire waters from late summer. As the hours went by, I became familiar with the ways of different whales. Some swam purposefully, ignoring the boat; others rose higher in the water to take a peek. The juvenile would rush over, like an amiable puppy, keen to play. With the sun warming us up, I leaned on the bows and watched the dark fins cutting across sparkling water. It could have been Mexico, but for the distant chimneys of Teeside. I came ashore feeling as if I had discovered an intelligent alien from space was living at the end of my garden. Now I’m hooked; I can’t wait to get out there again. Maybe I will get lucky and see a humpback.

The treatment was hailed as a major advance in the field and suggested that the outlook for these patients and their families might be less bleak than was previously thought. However, it has emerged that the scientists behind the research withheld the fact that the man, who remains anonymous, died a few months after receiving the therapy. The team justified the decision, citing the family’s wish to keep the death private and a concern that people might have wrongly linked the therapy, which involved nerve stimulation, to the 35-year-old’s death from a lung infection. However, others said the decision had created an over-optimistic narrative of a patient on an upward trajectory. Damian Cruse, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, said: “I do worry that the media coverage of the study gave a more hopeful message to other families in this situation than the message that perhaps would have been delivered with all of the facts … If we protect patient anonymity, then there’s no reason not to be able to tell the full story.” When the paper came out last month, Angela Sirigu, who led the work at the Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod in Lyon, France, told the Guardian: “He is still paralysed, he cannot talk, but he can respond. Now he is more aware.” Sirigu appeared to suggest that the team was continuing to monitor the man when, in fact, the patient had already died. Of the decision not to report the death, Sirigu told the Guardian: “The patient’s death was not linked to our protocol. He entered in our study in January 2016 and his participation ended [at the] beginning of September 2016. We respected the family decision to not communicate about the event. What was important for us was to keep the event in the privacy of this wonderful family.” Prof Jacques Luauté of the University of Lyon, who had followed the patient for several years, told Le Monde: “We discussed it with the family. Together, we thought, wrongly, that it would lead to people linking the stimulation and the death. We concluded that the death, which wasn’t linked to the study, was a private family event. This was a mistake, because it was obvious that we’d be asked what became of the patient.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/10/has-trump-insulted-you-take-our-quiz-to-find-out","type":"interactive","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T17:24:39Z","webTitle":"Has Trump insulted you? – take our quiz to find out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/10/has-trump-insulted-you-take-our-quiz-to-find-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/10/has-trump-insulted-you-take-our-quiz-to-find-out","fields":{"headline":"Has Trump insulted you? – take our quiz to find out","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/04/tesco-staff-under-pressure-to-hit-financial-targets-fraud-trial-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T06:31:23Z","webTitle":"Tesco staff under pressure to hit financial targets, fraud trial hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/04/tesco-staff-under-pressure-to-hit-financial-targets-fraud-trial-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/04/tesco-staff-under-pressure-to-hit-financial-targets-fraud-trial-hears","fields":{"headline":"Tesco staff under pressure to hit financial targets, fraud trial hears","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tesco staff were under pressure and at least one executive feared jail over actions they were alleged to be taking to meet 2014 financial targets that looked “insurmountable”, a whistleblower has told a court in London. Carl Rogberg, former finance director of Tesco UK, together with John Scouler, former commercial director for food, and Christopher Bush, former Tesco UK managing director, are allcharged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The three deny any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty. The case relates to an alleged hole in Tesco’s accounts revealed by the grocer in September 2014. The company admitted that it had previously overestimated profits by about £250m. The announcement sent “shockwaves” through the stock market, Southwark crown court in London heard. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October that year. Rogberg, Scouler and Bushdeny any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty. On Monday, Southwark crown court heard from Amit Soni, a member of the finance team at Tesco. He said the business was facing external pressure from rivals including Aldi and Lidl but staff were also under “pressure from within”. He said there were “innumerable conversations about how Tesco had to do better”. Soni said he personally felt that the strategy of former chief executive Philip Clarke was “leading to all the pressures on the business” as there was a “performance gap”.In August 2014, at around the time Tesco closed its first-half accounts, Soni said Bush had met with three commercial directors, who oversaw the food, health and beauty businesses, to discuss performance. At those meetings, Soni said, he saw a document outlining a potential gap in the budget of £240m of “budget challenges”. He told the court these were partly the result of the business “pulling forward” income from that period into earlier accounting periods. In order to fill the hole, commercial directors were under pressure to pull forward more income from future periods while sales were falling. Soni said that at this time the difference between the profit target and actual profits looked insurmountable, but Bush had stayed calm and told colleagues “to go back and meet the plan and hit the numbers”. Soni told the court that one of Tesco’s commercial directors, George Wright, complained about the conversations with suppliers he was having to have to hit the budget target and said: “I don’t want to go to jail for this.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2017/oct/05/child-obesity-is-a-national-emergency-so-what-is-jeremy-hunt-doing-about-it","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T12:56:43Z","webTitle":"Child obesity is a 'national emergency'.

So what is Jeremy Hunt doing about it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Obesity was a factor in more than 525,000 hospital admissions last year, and obesity rates have risen from 15% in 1993 to 27% in 2015. Child health experts describe the level of childhood obesity in the United Kingdom as a “state of emergency”. As a GP with over 30 years’ experience, I can state that the vast majority of consultations are for conditions such as diabetes and heart disease – linked to lifestyle or diet. I would estimate that 50-70% of costs to the NHS would be not just reduced but eliminated if patients’ diet and exercise regimes were improved. Children born since the 1980s are up to three times more likely than older generations to be overweight or obese by the age of 10. The number of overweight children admitted to hospital has risen from 872 in 2000 to 3,806 in 2009. And over the past decade, the UK has seen a four-fold rise in youngsters needing medical attention as a consequence of being obese. I am distressed that poor diet is such a feature of the lives of our children and young people. Barring genetic or catastrophic disease, accidents and maybe the ageing process itself, our health is in our hands. Central to tackling this is creating an environment where it is normal, easy and enjoyable for children and young people to eat healthily. At best, politicians pay lip service to the problem – at worst, they play politics. Jeremy Hunt has described the rise in childhood obesity as a “national emergency” – and when he was appointed health secretary in September 2012, he promised a “game-changing” response. It’s been more than four years since the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges submitted a 10-point plan, following a one-year review of the evidence on policies to tackle the obesity epidemic. Its proposals included a tax on sugary drinks, banning junk food advertising to children, restrictions on fast food outlets near schools and compulsory nutritional standards in hospitals. The government published its childhood obesity plan for action in August 2016. The plan, heavily influenced by food and drinks lobbyists, was a watered-down version of proposals the government had been preparing to publish. Except for a levy on sugar-sweetened beverages, no other proposal has been implemented. This week at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Hunt repeated the same message – while wearing a Tate &amp; Lyle lanyard. Prof Russell Viner, health promotion officer at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “It’s a really poor choice of sponsor and sends a very mixed message. On the one hand the government says it’s determined to tackle obesity and to bring in the sugar tax. On the other, they’re giving major prominence to a sugar company at their conference.” According to Prof Robert Lustig, a child obesity expert at the University of San Francisco, sugar (including sweeteners) and processed carbohydrate are the biggest culprits in childhood obesity. He describes sugar as being addictive and toxic and has called for a ban on the sale of sugary drinks to under-17s and a consumer tax on any substance with added sugar. I accept that the government has to tread a difficult line between telling us what to eat and letting “Big Food” feed us junk food and sugary drinks without any disincentive – but that’s what government is for. It took us far too long to agree to real action against smoking. As cases of both type 2 diabetes and obesity continue to rise exponentially, Hunt must act urgently and decisively. The government needs to take more robust action to tackle the impact of deep discounting and price promotions on the sales of unhealthy food and drink. As a first step, the health secretary should accept and implement all the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges’ proposals as a matter of urgency.

Forty-eight cancer drugs were approved by the European Medicines Agency between 2009 and 2013 for use as treatments in 68 different situations. But the study, which looked at the clinical trials associated with the drugs, reveals that at the time the therapies became available there was no conclusive evidence that they improved survival in almost two-thirds of the situations for which they were approved. In only 10% of the uses did the drugs improve quality of life. Overall 57% of uses showed no benefits for either survival or quality of life. The team then looked to see whether the picture improved over time. Huseyin Naci, assistant professor of health policy at the London School of Economics, and a co-author of the study, published in the British Medical Journal, said: “We wanted to see once [the drugs] were already on the market did they actually generate some evidence to show that they improved or extended life?” The team found that after a follow-up period of between three to eight years, 49% of approved uses were linked to no clear sign of improvement in survival or quality of life. Where survival benefits were shown, the team said these were clinically meaningless in almost half of the cases. “What we find very surprising is that not very many studies are looking at overall survival or quality of life as their [primary] objective,” said Naci. He said that instead most of the studies examined indirect measures, such as x-rays or laboratory tests that were assumed to offer clues as to a drug’s survival benefits. He added: “Unfortunately the expectation is that once the drugs are on the market then companies will be investing in [longer term] trials to then demonstrate overall survival benefits. But unfortunately these trials are not necessarily taken up and conducted.” Naci said the findings did not mean patients should worry. “I think it is very important that no one is alarmed,” he said. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at University of Oxford, described the lack of drug improvement with regard to survival as disappointing, and called for a more rigorous approach to evaluating cancer drugs. “It is hard to understand why half the drugs were approved in the first place if they provide no clinically meaningful benefit,” he said. But Winette van der Graaf, professor of personalised oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research, said that making decisions based on smaller studies looking at benefits other than overall survival, were important in making sure new treatments were swiftly made available to patients. “In my area of research [on] rare cancers the level of evidence called for here is very hard to obtain, meaning that these patients would find it extremely difficult to gain access to new treatments,” she said, adding that large trials looking directly at survival could be expensive and lengthy. “Ideally, studies should try also measuring early markers of treatment failure, so that health authorities can make well-balanced decisions.” Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK’s director of policy, warned that the study did not necessarily reflect the situation in the UK where Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) played an important role in deciding which drugs were available to patients. “The study does highlight the importance of using real-world evidence from patients, on top of data from clinical trials, to build our understanding of how drugs work in a real-life setting. We’re already starting to see this happen through the cancer drugs fund in England, where patients can access promising new drugs while more data is collected on their effectiveness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/chicken-katsu-curry-recipe-tim-anderson-japanese-food-a-cooks-kitchen","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T11:00:19Z","webTitle":"Tim Anderson’s kitchen – and his recipe for chicken katsu curry | A cook’s kitchen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/chicken-katsu-curry-recipe-tim-anderson-japanese-food-a-cooks-kitchen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/chicken-katsu-curry-recipe-tim-anderson-japanese-food-a-cooks-kitchen","fields":{"headline":"Masterchef's Tim Anderson’s kitchen – and his recipe for chicken katsu curry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I live in Ladywell, in south-east London, in a modern building nestled in a little close. My wife, Laura, is British, but I’m originally from the midwest, Wisconsin, and when I left for college as a teenager, my mom sent me off with this family recipe book. It’s full of Anderson favourites, such as rumaki (a faux-Polynesian recipe of pineapple, chicken livers or scallops marinated in soy sauce and port, then wrapped in bacon and grilled) and tuna stroganoff – a staple in my lean years! When there’s little in the house, I refer back to it for inspiration. I’d always been fascinated by Japan and its food. I loved anime and J-Pop as a teenager, and at college in Los Angeles – where I studied Japanese history – I became ramen-obsessed, which is easy in LA: there’s Little Tokyo and so many good places to eat it. I like ramen to be salty, with flecks of back fat in the broth, thin, hard noodles, garlic, beansprouts ... and you gotta have an egg ... all in a deep round bowl. But there’s always space for instant noodles – they’re an emergency thing, but undeniably good. I started cooking when I was in high school, but it was only when I moved to Japan after graduation that things started to get serious. I met Laura there and bought her the cutesy Frypanda pan – quite simply a frying pan with a panda face on it – but as you can see we’ve got good use out of it. I think everyone should have a blowtorch. I use mine for getting coals going on a barbecue, for finishing the skin on fish with some crispness and colour, also to cook through little scallops, for ‘smores without a bonfire ... and for cheese on toast. In my stash of Japanese essentials I include dashi powder, which you can get from any Asian supermarket. It’s not a cheat like using a stock cube ‘cos it tastes really good! Smoky, fishy, umami. It’s a flavour enhancer, really: my mother-in-law always adds it to fried rice. To make dashi from scratch, you need konbu (seaweed) and fushi (dried tuna or mackerel flakes). I also like this soy sauce – it’s mellow, subtle, not too aggressive or sweet. I put it in everything I cook, including spag bol. Thirdly, miso – a light, creamy white one for veg, and a caramelised, nutty red one for meat such as pork. For all my Japanese ingredients, I can’t live without Old Bay seasoning . Oh my god, I use it for everything – for eggs, for casseroles – yup, for cheese on toast ... It’s a very Southern blend of spices – celery salt, red and black pepper, paprika – a savoury Bloody Mary kinda flavour. Chicken katsu curry The story of Japanese curry is one of global empires rising and falling. Before the end of the 19th century, there was no curry in Japan. It was introduced not from India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia – or anywhere else that can be thought of as somewhere curry originates – but from Britain. At that time, South Asian curry had already been integrated into the imperial diet, and it was British military officers and diplomats who introduced it to the Japanese. British curry – not very spicy, thickened with flour – caught on, particularly with the Japanese navy and army, where it was celebrated as an economical and tasty way to feed hundreds of hungry servicemen. Curry remains one of Japan’s favourite comfort foods, as delicious as it is weirdly divorced from curry’s Asian origins. Whereas an Indian curry will be naturally thick from pureed onions/tomatoes/chillies and a whole heap of spices, Japan’s curry is based on a flour-and-butter roux that thickens a lightly spiced, stock-based sauce. I do love Japanese curry, but I also love South Asian curries with their vibrancy and layers of flavour. This recipe combines the two. I keep my curry sauce itself vegetarian, because I find it just as satisfying that way, but if you want you can add chicken, beef or pork to this. In fact, you can add just about anything you want (at the restaurant we put ham and cheese on it and it’s amazing). (Note: if you want a really authentic and really easy Japanese curry experience at home, just buy a box of instant Japanese curry at an Asian supermarket. No, really – it’s good and cheap and fast, and it really doesn’t get much more authentic than that!) Katsu curry is simply Japanese curry rice with the delightful addition of breaded, fried meat – typically chicken. Feel free to use less veg in the sauce, if you like, since there will be more bulk from the katsu. Serves 4 1 onion, cut into small chunks 2 carrots, peeled and cut into wedges 400g floury potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks ½ cauliflower, broken into bite- size florets 300g rice For the curry sauce 4 tbsp oil 1 large onion, roughly chopped 2cm piece of fresh ginger, peeled and finely sliced 1 green chilli, chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled 2 tomatoes ½ green apple, peeled and chopped ½ banana 30g mild Madras curry powder 2 tbsp garam masala 750ml vegetable stock (or chicken or beef stock if preferred) 60g butter 6 tbsp plain (all-purpose) flour 2 tbsp ketchup 2 tbsp soy sauce Salt For the chicken katsu (optional) 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut in half horizontally into 2 thin escalopes Salt and freshly ground black pepper Plain (all-purpose) flour, for dredging 1 egg, beaten with a splash of milk or water 200g panko breadcrumbs Oil, for shallow frying 1 For the sauce, combine the oil, onion, ginger, chilli, garlic, tomatoes, apple, banana, curry powder and garam masala in a food processor and blitz to a paste. Pour this into a saucepan and cook on a medium-high heat, stirring often, until the mixture begins to caramelise and the spices become aromatic. Add the stock and bring to the boil. 2 Meanwhile, melt the butter in a separate saucepan and whisk in the flour. Cook on a low heat for about 8 minutes, stirring constantly, until the roux thickens and turns a golden brown colour. Ladle the curry mixture from the other pan into the roux, a little at a time, whisking constantly to incorporate. Add the ketchup and soy sauce. Cook the mixture until it’s quite thick, then transfer to a blender or use an immersion blender to puree until very smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt. 3 Put the onion, carrots and potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, add the cauliflower and reduce to a simmer. 4 Cook for about 10 minutes, or until everything is tender. Drain and return to the pan, and pour in the curry sauce. Bring everything back to a simmer. 5 To make the chicken katsu, season the chicken breasts well with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour. Soak them in the beaten egg, then coat them thoroughly with the panko. Heat a little oil (about 2mm in depth) in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat. Lay the breaded chicken in the oil and cook for 5–6 minutes on each side. Remove and drain on kitchen paper or a wire rack. Leave to rest briefly before slicing. 6 Serve the sliced chicken katsu with a helping of rice, and of curry – on top, or on the side, as you prefer.

The decision to reform the act, which appeared in the Queen’s speech in June, means the government is committed to taking steps to overhaul the legislation in the next 12 months. The 1983 act, which outlines how people can be involuntarily detained and treated in hospital for mental health issues, was amended in 2007. This included introducing the right to an independent advocate while in hospital; and the controversial community treatment orders that were criticised for failing to safeguard patients’ rights. However, 30 years on, the legislation is regarded as outdated and in need of reform. Today, there is greater public awareness about mental health, more demands that the issue has equal parity with physical health, and increasing concerns about the numbers detained in secure care who might instead be treated in local, community-based services. Theresa May acknowledged the inadequacies of the UK’s mental health system in her first speech as prime minister in July last year: “If you suffer from mental health problems, there’s not enough help to hand.” Here, mental health campaigners, those who work in the sector and patients explain what they want to see in a new act. ‘Embedding people’s experiences in any new legislation will ensure that the best options are put in place’ The act should support people when they are most unwell by ensuring their care and treatment is timely, and helping them progress in their recovery. Currently someone detained under the act can’t be confident that their rights, any advance wishes or their dignity will be respected – or even that they will be listened to. The best place to start will be with people who are, or have been, detained under the act – such as myself. Embedding people’s experiences in any new legislation will ensure that the person is at the centre of their care, and that the best options are put in place at every step of someone’s treatment and recovery journey. Ian Callaghan, mental health campaigner, working with charity Rethink Mental Illness ‘Additional and more varied community services must be made available, and GPs must have easier access to them’ Cases of patients presenting with mental health conditions have risen significantly over the past few years across the NHS, especially in general practice. While this might sound alarming, it could also indicate that there is better identification and diagnosis of mental health conditions and that the stigma society attaches to mental health is reducing, so more people are seeking medical assistance. These would be positive steps as we strive for parity of esteem between physical and mental health. Once diagnosed, many patients struggle to get the most appropriate treatment because there is a severe lack of specialist community mental health services. Additional and more varied community services must be made available, and GPs must have easier, quicker access to them. NHS England’s GP Forward View pledges that every GP practice will have access to a mental health therapist – this needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs ‘The best way to prevent someone being detained is to prevent them from falling into a crisis in the first place’ It is imperative that changes to the law are considered carefully and that the voice of patients, carers and medical professionals are listened to. The government is right to look at why detentions under the act have risen and why some ethnic groups are detained more often than others. They must remember that the best way to prevent someone being detained is to prevent them from falling into a crisis in the first place; to understand that poverty, poor housing and poor physical health impact on a person’s wellbeing and psyche. With many services struggling to keep up with demand it can be hard to provide the early intervention needed to prevent people becoming seriously ill. Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists ‘Current legislation is outdated and not in line with the principles of modern healthcare’ Being detained under the act is one of the most serious things that can happen to a person when it comes to their mental health. The current legislation is outdated and not in line with the principles of modern healthcare. In the past 10 years in England we’ve seen a 47% rise in the act being used to detain people. This demonstrates that it fails to support people when they are acutely unwell. Any new legislation needs to ensure that people with mental health problems have more involvement in decisions about their care. Overhauling the act is a mammoth task and needs to be done in full consultation with people with lived experience. Changes to legislation need to coincide with the delivery of the ambitious plan to transform mental health services over the next five years. Paul Farmer, chief executive, mental health charity Mind ‘Mental health should not be a game of political one-upmanship’ I’m yet to be convinced that what was in the Queen’s speech will go far enough to meet Theresa May’s promise of mental health reform. I’ve spent the last 14 years, since my dad’s suicide in 2003, trying to rationalise successive governments’ cuts to mental health provision and disingenuous nods to change being needed. Mental health should not be a game of political one-upmanship. Consistency is vital to those in treatment, other service users and those who care for them. There is no outright [government] majority, which should encourage all parties to provide a universally approved approach. I want a commitment that goes beyond treatment and towards destigmatisation, requiring preventative measures in educational, workplace and public settings. Early interventions can help provide positive experiences of mental health for society and take away the negative perceptions of someone with mental health issues being unhinged or untrustworthy and volatile. Kevin Betts, mental health campaigner ‘Investing money to increase treatment options, staffing levels and mental health promotion – starting in schools – will help’ Mental health legislation has broadly resulted in increased rights and autonomy for patients – yet we still have a long way to go. New legislation must reflect modern day thinking around equality and treating everyone uniquely. Governments have always promised investment in mental health provision, but – with the exception of increased spending on ‘talking therapies’ – I’ve yet to see this. Staff are stressed and constrained by endless bureaucracy that undermines meaningful face-to‑face interventions. Investing money to increase treatment options, staffing levels and mental health promotion – starting in schools – will help put mental health on par with physical health provision. The new act must continue to put the patient at the centre, be as unrestrictive as possible and reflect the importance of eradicating stigma. Lol Butterfield, mental health anti‑stigma campaigner and registered mental health nurse ‘I would like mental health to be treated the same way as physical health’ In the new act I would like mental health to be treated the same way as physical health. So if it’s OK to take days off sick due to being physically ill, it shouldn’t be looked at any differently if someone needs to take time off work because of their mental health. If my leg was broken, I would have to see a doctor straightaway; things would be done immediately to get me better. But apparently not being able to leave the house due to mental health issues doesn’t seem as important. I also think that nobody should be turned down or have to wait for over three months to receive any mental health treatment. Kay Ska, mental health blogger and campaigner ‘Having the right number of local inpatient beds is important, but the problem is about more than beds’ A major challenge for mental health services is to end the practice of sending people miles and miles away from their own homes to receive inpatient treatment. This often occurs in relation to acute episodes of care, but is also a problem for longer-term care, in so-called locked rehabilitation hospitals. Social inclusion is a crucial part of recovery in mental health and isolation from family, friends and communities has a negative impact on care and recovery. Having the right number of local inpatient beds is important, but the problem is about more than beds – it’s how the whole system works in an integrated way to provide the best possible care, close to people’s homes. The only way to achieve this will be to work with the people who use the services, to create better services that genuinely meet their needs.

The eating disorders charity Beat recognises that exact statistics are difficult to collate, but says that up to 25% of people affected by eating disorders are male. And according to NHS Digital, the number of adult men admitted to hospital with an eating disorder increased by 70% during the past six years – equal to the increase among women. Dr Sandeep Ranote, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, and member of the faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: “There’s still much more stigma around eating disorders in men. It’s seen as something that is an acceptable illness for girls, but not for boys. We are seeing more boys, but not as many as we should.” Dr Darren Cutinha, a consultant psychiatrist at the child and adolescent eating disorders service at the Maudsley hospital, south London, believes there are two main issues with boys accessing treatment. “First they’re less likely to want to come forward,” he says. “They may think people will question their masculinity, or not believe that men can get eating disorders. The second barrier is professionals not recognising that men can have an eating disorder.” Dr Cutinha says nobody can be sure what causes an eating disorder and there is usually an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. “More commonly for boys, anorexia can be triggered when they are trying to get fitter or stronger,” he says. “They might want to exercise more, think about their nutrition and eat in a healthy way. But it can get out of hand and lead to anorexia if they have that predisposition.” Beat says that full recovery from an eating disorder is possible, but the sooner someone gets treatment, the better. Dr Ranote says: “Mental health is finally being taken seriously. We have treatment, people can get better. They need to know that they’re not alone.” ‘I saw a lot of blogs about females and eating disorders, but nothing pointed to males’ Priyesh Vyas, 25, from Kent, looks back on the years he suffered with bulimia and explains how guilt and secrecy defined his battle with the condition I was bulimic between the ages of 15 and 18. I had a relapse at 21 as well. It was probably down to more than one factor, but exam stress and social media pressure didn’t help. Men have more pressure in looking a certain way in this day and age. I can’t pinpoint an exact time when it started; it was a gradual thing. There would be times when I’d be at school, eat lunch and purge it out in the toilets without anyone knowing. It’s such a secretive eating disorder. No one can physically see it because your weight fluctuates so much. People just can’t tell. I would often have balanced meals – not junk food or anything bad – but I’d feel guilty and purge it out. After eating a meal, I’d feel like I’d put on weight instantly – that I wouldn’t burn all the calories that I’d just consumed. I was a keen cricketer and there would be instances when I’d be playing cricket and I’d be bulimic in the middle of a match. There would be points where I would go the whole day without being bulimic and days when I’d purge out all my meals – that’s the nature of the eating disorder. No one knew until I was caught by a schoolteacher. The teacher had suspicions because I was going to the toilet so often. One time they found me after I had thrown up and told my parents. I felt embarrassed that my secret had suddenly been exposed. I felt some guilt that what I was doing was definitely wrong. My family were shocked and didn’t know how to deal with it. Eating disorders are not openly talked about – most of my family members didn’t know I was going through it until recently. I knew that what I was doing wasn’t correct and that it would eventually kill me. I had Googled what I was going through and I knew what bulimia was, but I didn’t have the confidence to come forward. I saw a lot of blogs about females and eating disorders, but nothing pointed to males, so confidence in telling anyone was diminished. I felt it was something that only affected women. There is still stigma around men with eating disorders, but hopefully with people like myself campaigning, that can end. I was lucky that I got help early – my parents took me to the GP who referred me to an outpatients clinic. Fitness has also been a big part of my recovery When I was going through my eating disorder I felt lonely and that no one would understand me. I thought that the eating disorder would be a part of me until I was dead. I want to show others that it’s possible to recover.

Nick was the son of Stanley Bowen, a barrister, and his wife, Beryl (nee Bottrill), a home economics teacher. Born in Finchley, north London, Nick spent his childhood between the Isle of Wight, near his grandparents’ home, and the Middle East, where his father worked for British Petroleum. He attended Little Appley prep school, Ryde, and Lancing college, West Sussex. Nick graduated in economics at the London School of Economics before going to the US in 1968 to study for his master’s at Lehigh University, Pennsylvania. While there, through mutual friends he met Joan Schaeffer, who was studying at nearby Cedar Crest College. They married in 1971, and moved to Kent State University, Ohio, where Joan studied for her master’s and Nick taught economics, before starting his PhD at Cambridge. His research on Anglo-American and Argentine relations led to short stays in Washington DC and Buenos Aires, and on their return to England in 1974 the couple settled in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, both taking up teaching jobs. Nick started at the Regent school of English before moving to the fledgling private college, the European Business School in London (now Regent’s University). For more than 30 years, he inspired thousands of students with his lectures on global politics and business and helped create a community spirit in the college through his warm, gentle humour. One of his most notable achievements was travelling to eastern Europe months after the fall of the Berlin Wall to open up opportunities for a new generation of students, especially from Bulgaria. He also authored in 1979 a history of Canning House, home of the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian councils, and co-authored International Business: Challenges and Choices (2013) with his colleague Alan Sitkin. Nick was committed to building communities at work and at home. He was involved in the Chartered Institute of Linguists for more than 30 years and was made an honorary fellow in 1991. In Broxbourne he was a parent governor and a boys’ football coach for more than 15 years. Throughout their marriage, Nick and Joan attached importance to education, empathy and laughter. Following his retirement in 2012, Nick continued to be involved in education, internationalism and community life, as a member of the European Government Business Relations Council, and campaigned in 2016 to stay in the EU.

He makes no mention of the stress many students suffer over their finances, not least the means to eat regularly and healthily. As for parents, Mr Johnson should be aware that parents on middle to low incomes will rarely be in a position to subsidise their children, a cause for parental anxiety. Blithe comments on students making choices over lifestyle, or that students can save from what in most cases will be meagre earnings, really don’t help. Yes, students can work, and many do, but will not earn enough to save. Against all this, there is the chaos which is Student Finance England (SFE), which can (and does) lead to students either beginning or continuing their studies at the start of the academic year with no confirmation of what they will be receiving from SFE or when. Fine, let’s encourage students to be lean, fit and frugal, but too often financial uncertainty contributes to insecurity, depression and isolation. Or is Mr Johnson suggesting it’s all a matter of “character”: a student can go hungry and still perform at the highest possible level, if, that is, he or she is relatively monastic and disciplined in lifestyle? The fallacy of division, Mr Johnson? Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • Rather than the paltry offer by Theresa May to freeze student fees, the government should be ashamed that it is doing nothing to reduce the extortionate interest rate of 6.1% on loans. How can a rate of 25 times bank base rate of 0.25% be justifiable? Ian Arnott Peterborough • It is not too difficult to agree that the current loan system is probably the worst of all possible structures of financing higher education, especially since it seems that the UK spends too little. Martin McQuillan (Never mind the students, tuition fees are a bad deal for the taxpayer, 3 October) sets discussion onto a useful thread by considering where the money comes from and goes. In so doing he suggests that 75% of loans are never paid in full. One of the problems in following this through is lack of data, especially now that ownership of much of the debt is privatised. It is generally assumed that graduates will earn more than others, but the figure of 75% figure casts doubt on such assumption. The threshold repayment earnings (old version and revised) are near the median earnings for the UK. A very rough simulation of returns from the loans, based on only 20% of graduate incomes below median, produced tax returns over 15 years which would see the debt easily cleared. In order to produce a lower return I have to set a greater proportion earning below the median and fewer in the highest income brackets. It appears to me that perhaps graduates as a whole do not earn significantly more than others. Where can one find detailed data to enquire into this? Ray Hall Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex • Theresa May’s raising the threshold for repayment of tuition fees to £25,000 will cost most graduates money. Interest on a debt of £50,000 at 6.1% is £3,050 per year. For every year that graduates earn less than £25k, the debt will increase by that amount and the interest the following year will be even higher. For years in which they earn more than £25k but less than £58,900 they will be paying off less than the full amount of interest and the debt will increase. Only those earning £58,900 or more will be reducing their debt and then very slowly. Abolition of tuition fees and the writing off of the debts is the only fair policy. Ros Campbell Leeds • Professor Gowar’s textbook demolition of neoliberal education philosophy (Letters, 3 October) evokes a strong memory of the last Labour government’s withdrawal of funding from lifelong learners studying for no immediate qualifications, or for none higher than they already possessed. Then as now we heard various bogus arguments about students benefiting only themselves “personally”, as if individuals don’t live in society or as if personal and social could be separated as with a knife. Then, unreason ruled, hallowed learning institutions were savaged and life chances blighted. The unsound philosophy of atomisation is easily refuted: this time round, let’s hope we can end it. Michael Ayton Durham • Pace Michael Rosen, whatever is driving the disastrous education policies of the present government, it is most certainly not “Pisa-envy” (Letter from a curious parent, 26 September). While Rosen is right to be sceptical of the value of these international comparisons, those systems which are most regularly successful in Pisa do seem to have certain characteristics in common, regardless of cultural differences. Three of the most important seem to be: (i) a properly comprehensive system of secondary schooling; (ii) a heavy investment in the education and training of a truly professional teaching force; (iii) a curricular emphasis upon problem-solving, rather than upon the acquisition of large amounts of factual information.

The increased production of carbon comes from the microbes within soils, according to a report in the peer-review journal Science, published on Friday. The 26-year study is one of the biggest of its kind, and is a groundbreaking addition to our scant knowledge of exactly how warming will affect natural systems. Potential feedback loops, or tipping points, have long been suspected to exist by scientists, and there is some evidence for them in the geological record. What appears to happen is that once warming reaches a certain point, these natural biological factors kick in and can lead to a runaway, and potentially unstoppable, increase in warming. Other tipping points posited by scientists include the disappearance of ice in the Arctic, which creates areas of dark water that absorb more heat, and the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from thawing permafrost. In the Science study, researchers examined plots of soil in the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, a mixed hardwood forest in the US. They experimented by heating some of the plots with underground cables to 5C above normal levels, leaving others as a control. The long-term study revealed that in the first 10 years there was a strong increase in the carbon released from the heated plots, then a period of about seven years when the carbon release abated. But after this second calmer period, which the scientists attribute to the adjustment of the soil microbes to the warmer conditions, the release of carbon resumed its upward path. In the last three years, the release of carbon has once again dropped back, which scientists attribute to another reorganisation of the microbes present. They suggest an increase in the number of microbes that can feast on the hard-to-digest organic matter, such as plant-based lignin, which gives clues to the possible cyclical nature of the process. From 1991, when the experiment began, the plots subjected to 5C warming lost about 17% of the carbon that had been stored in the top 60cm of the soil, where the greatest concentration of organic matter is to be found. Scientific understanding of the complexities of soil microbial activity is still limited, but the long-term nature of the study provides valuable insights into what might be happening, and is likely to happen in future, to vast swaths of forest soils across the world. While deforestation has been the focus of most research into forests’ effects on climate change, with a recent study suggesting tropical forests are turning into carbon sources rather than carbon stores as a result, the impact of warming soils has remained much of a mystery. Soils are one of the world’s biggest natural carbon sinks, along with trees and the oceans. Daniel Metcalfe, of Sweden’s Lund University, said: “If these findings hold more widely across major terrestrial ecosystems, then a much greater portion of the global soil carbon store could be vulnerable to decomposition and release of carbon dioxide under global warming than previously thought.” The study was carried out by scientists at the US Marine Biological Laboratory, led by Jerry Melillo, with contributions from the universities of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Melillo, who holds the position of distinguished scientist at the MBL, said: “Each year, mostly from fossil fuel burning, we are releasing about 10bn metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere. The world’s soils contain about 3,500bn tons of carbon. If a significant amount of that is added to the atmosphere, due to microbial activity, that will accelerate the global warming process. Once this self-reinforcing feedback begins, there is no easy way to turn it off. There is no switch to flip.” He added: “The future is warmer. How much warmer is the issue.” While emissions from fossil fuels can be cut back, the reactions of the natural world to a warming climate may be impossible to control. Some recent work has suggested that the warming of the globe may be progressing at a slightly slower rate than the upper range of previous studies estimated. However, feedback loops and tipping points have the potential to create sudden disruptions that are hard to take account of in standard climate modelling, and these could mean much greater changes and far higher rates of warming in the future. Separately, research from Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and other institutions, published in the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, and Global Change Biology, called for more work on how soil could be used as a carbon store. When agricultural soils are well-managed, they can store more carbon than they emit, which would allow them to be used as potential carbon sinks. But the scientists warn that “we still don’t have a strong understanding of the interactions among biological, chemical and physical processes regulating carbon in soils”. They say much more research is needed, particularly as there are dangers in soils in Siberia that are rapidly warning, and could release vast quantities of carbon. They also warn that there may be 25-30% less organic matter in some soils than previously estimated. “Soil has changed under our feet,” said Jennifer Harden, a visiting scholar at Stanford. “We can’t use the soil maps made 80 years ago and expect to find the same answers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2017/oct/10/smartphone-apps-for-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T09:54:52Z","webTitle":"Staying appy: mental health apps deliver mixed results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/oct/10/smartphone-apps-for-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2017/oct/10/smartphone-apps-for-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"Staying appy: mental health apps deliver mixed results","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It doesn’t matter what the problem is, someone will have developed a app to deal with it – so it should come as no surprise that there are now thousands of apps that promise to improve your mental health and wellbeing. But do they work? The mental health app marketplace is “very messy”, says André Tomlin, who runs the Mental Elf website that offers up-to-date information about mental health policy and research. Most apps, says Tomlin, are targeted at common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, but increasingly there are apps for people with more serious conditions, such as bipolar disorder. Appropriate apps, he says, can be hard to find: “If you go to the App Store and browse in the health and wellbeing section, what you’ll get is a ton of yoga and sex apps.” That is not to say that apps cannot be useful. Eve Critchley, head of digital at mental health charity Mind, says those offering access to online peer support are particularly valuable for anyone who feels daunted by the thought of picking up a phone or seeing a therapist: “For people who are socially isolated or less able to engage in face-to-face support, it may be preferable to use something that you can use privately or anonymously.” Mind has its own mental health app, Elefriends, with access to an online community of peer support. It has been downloaded more than 13,000 times. “We hear lots of people say that was their first experience of either seeing someone else talk frankly about mental health,” says Critchley, “or of being able to talk about mental health and feeling understood and accepted.” Other useful apps, she says, range from those that track a person’s mood or use techniques such as mindfulness, to apps such as Stay Alive that offer crisis support for people with suicidal feelings. Some people, Critchley adds, find it helpful to use a smartphone simply as a journal to record feelings. So how can you find the most helpful apps? The best, says Tomlin, are those that have involved both clinicians and people with the relevant mental health condition in development. In the UK there is no system of accreditation, although the NHS has launched a test library of apps for both mental and physical health, which are expected to go live in early 2018. The plan is that some of those apps will be certified as NHS-approved. To this end, the NHS has created a questionnaire for app developers that will help determine whether an app meets the criteria. The biggest challenge is evaluating clinical effectiveness and NHS England has talked to patients and organisations, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, to establish “what good looks like” before an app can be approved. It is a rigorous process, says Juliet Bauer, chief digital officer at NHS England: “If we want to recommend them to the public, we need to know that they’re safe and secure, and effective and easy to use.” Five of the best mental health apps Catch It: helps you capture and understand your mood using a journal. Free on the App Store and Google Play. Chill Panda: helps you relax by measuring heart rate and suggesting breathing techniques and light exercises. Free on the App Store and Google Play. Cove: creates music that reflects your emotional state. Free on the App Store. Elefriends: an online community from Mind. Free on the App Store and Google Play. SilverCloud: an online course to help manage stress and depression. Available via NHS referral. How to choose the right app Look for apps with input from a mental health practitioner. Check that your personal data is held in accordance with data protection laws. Ask if the app is approval by a regulatory body, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration. Ask whether the app has undergone any trials to demonstrate its clinical effectiveness. If the app is for an internet forum, check for moderators and posting guidelines.

The firm is using the new high-end smartphones and Android Oreo operating system to demonstrate its prowess in combining hardware and software, using exclusive features to attempt things other manufacturers including Apple cannot. The two phones both have the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 64GB of storage as standard, front-facing speakers, water-resistance to IP67 standards, and new 12-megapixel cameras on the back, but with different sized OLED screens – and, following the iPhone’s lead, no headphone socket. The Pixel 2 has a traditional 5in screen with large bezels at the top and bottom and costs from £629, while the Pixel 2 XL has a modern design similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG’s G6, with an elongated 6in screen and small bezels, costing from £799. In a direct swipe at Apple, Google’s vice president product manager Mario Queiroz said: “We don’t save cool features just for the large device. You get all the goodness with both phones, so the only choice you have to make is what size you want.” The Pixel 2 and 2 XL also have pressure-sensitive sides that can be squeezed to launch the company’s Google Assistant. A similar feature debuted in HTC’s U11 smartphone, but Google appears to be using it as a way to get around the stigma of using the voice assistant’s wake phrase “OK, Google” in public, launching the Assistant without having to power on the device and hold the home button. Google says the phones also have 10% longer battery life and faster charging than the 2016 Pixel smartphones. “We’ve focused on super-fast charging, so you can get around seven hours of use out of a 15-minute charge. And we supply the fast charger in the box,” said Christiaan Prins, product manager at Google – another jab at Apple, which does not include a fast charger in the box with the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. To take the iPhone on, Google has focused on fine-tuning the combination of hardware and software, from intelligent features to super-smooth operation. The camera is the most obvious element. The Pixel 2 has what Google is calling “the best smartphone camera, again”, employing an improved version of the firm’s HDR+ computational photography technique to create photos from several rapidly captured images, producing better results than simple shots. It will also have optical image stabilisation for both still images and – combined with electronic image stabilisation for so-called fused stabilisation – for video as well, something most other smartphones are incapable of doing. But the big new thing for the Pixel 2 is new depth-sensing system for a single camera using the common dual-pixel autofocus system. Brian Rakowski, vice president product manager at Google said: “Because of the dual pixel sensor system and HDR+, even though they’re only microns apart, we’re able to get multiple right and left images from one camera with each shot, so when combined with a whole bunch of crazy maths we can get a depth map of the scene.” “We can do it with one camera, which means we can do it on the main rear camera, but we can also do it on the selfie camera too, on both phones. Most phones need two cameras to do that, but we can do it with one and do it really well,” Queiroz added. The depth information is used to create a portrait mode, which identifies what’s in the foreground to artificially blur the background simulating the look of a high-end digital SLR camera – a feature that has proved popular for dual-camera phones such as Apple’s iPhone 8 Plus. Google is also using the depth information for augmented-reality experiences, similar to that offered by Apple, calibrating each camera at the factory before shipping it for greater accuracy. There is also a new smart-camera feature called Lens, intended as a demonstration of what Google’s AI can do when integrated into a camera, detecting landmarks and book covers. Rakowski said: “People on Pixel take twice as many pictures as iPhone users, and they’re storing around 23GB of images a year. If you were using Apple’s iCloud after a few months at that rate you’d be into the paid tier, but with Google Photos on the Pixel you’ve got unlimited full-resolution backup.” In a marked change for Google, the company is also baking more of its advanced artificial-intelligence systems directly into the smartphone, rather than relying on the cloud to provide the smart aspects. One new feature driven by that move is the option to have the smartphone listen out for music and identify the song currently playing in your environment. Rakowski said: “The way Now Playing works is that we have an amazing on-device machine learning model and a database of 100,000 songs updated weekly customised to location that will match the song playing in the background and put a little notification telling you what song and artist is playing on the always-on screen.” The “ambient” feature, designed to pick up what’s playing in a coffee shop or gym without the user having to activate anything like similar apps such as Shazam, works even in airplane mode, and doesn’t share the information with Google or contact a server unless the user taps on the notification to find out more or add it to a Google Play Music or Spotify playlist. Queiroz said: “We will do more and more on device, but the capabilities in the cloud will also keep improving, so in the future it’ll be a combination of those two that we think will deliver the optimum experience. Sometimes we’re going to want to do things on the device because it’s very fast, and for privacy reasons, and some things will be done in the cloud for the best experience.” The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will both be available exclusively in the UK through EE, Carphone Warehouse or direct from Google, available for pre-order immediately. The Pixel 2 costs £629 for 64GB of storage or £729 for 128GB of storage and the Pixel 2 XL costs £799 for 64GB of storage or £899 for 128GB of storage. The Pixel 2 will ship on 19 October, the Pixel 2 XL on 15 November. Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight said: “Google has a mountain to climb if it wants to displace Apple’s iPhone, and even challenging Samsung, which has a trio of superb Android-powered flagship devices, will be tough; iPhone users are extremely unlikely to defect from their Apple device to an Android product and if they do the most likely device they will consider will come from Samsung. “At the same time, going head-to-head with other Android phone makers won’t go down well. History has shown that companies that compete with their own channels invariably become unstuck. With the Android platform being so strategic to the broader Google business this is a dangerous game to play.” Alongside the Pixel 2 smartphones, Google also launched a new smaller version of its Google Home speaker with Google Assistant, which now has a male voice option, called the Google Home Mini, which is a direct competitor to Amazon’s Echo Dot. A new premium audio version called the Google Home Max was also unveiled as a direct competitor to the new improved Amazon Echo and Apple’s upcoming HomePod speaker. At the San Francisco launch, the company also took the wraps off a new premium, convertible Chromebook called the Pixelbook, which replaces the £1,000 Chromebook Pixel from 2015, a new version of the DayDream View VR headset, some Pixel Buds Bluetooth earbuds that can do translation in 40 languages and a wearable camera called Google Clips."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/28/debt-timebomb-hardworking-britain-teaching","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"For Julia every month is a desperate fight to pay the bills.

She’s a teacher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Julia has a system to survive. Every month, she maxes out her overdraft: £1,000 in the red to pay for utility bills, council tax, mortgage, and food for herself and her daughter. Then the 49-year-old’s salary puts her back in the black – and she does it all over again. This is the definition of precarious living: a life where, in Julia’s words, “everyday needs pile up”. The overdraft isn’t enough to keep her head above water. In the past nine months, she’s fallen into £5,000 worth of credit card debt. As we talk, Julia writes it all out – listing basic family costs, item by item: replacing broken furniture (“It was falling apart,” she says); buying her daughter shoes and a uniform for secondary school, and a bike to get there; hiring a plumber to unblock the toilet. She can’t remember the last time she went out with friends or bought something as a treat. “I have holes in my clothes,” she says. You may be wondering what Julia does for a living. In a climate of underemployment, insecure jobs and cuts to social security, it would be easy to imagine she was struggling on a zero-hours contract, or perhaps a disability benefit. But Julia is a teacher. If you’re in Norfolk, she may be the one meeting your child at the school gates in the morning or taking your next parents’ evening. She earns what most of us would call a decent wage: £34,000 a year. To say she works full-time for that seems misleading. It’s closer to a 60-hour week, and she’s exhausted. She gets to the school at 7am, prepares for class, teaches until 4pm, and marks homework in the evening – and is rewarded with debt and stress. Julia – not her real name – prides herself on being careful with money, and can’t stand the thought of being recognised by parents or colleagues as having a debt problem. To pay the bills, she tells me she’s thinking of taking on work as a private tutor at the weekends. A teacher with a second job on the side. “If people on my salary are struggling, God help the parents on £20k,” she says. When John McDonnell announced at the Labour party conference on Monday that a Labour government would cap credit card charges, he highlighted the growing crisis facing families like Julia’s. A Guardian series this month chronicled the scale of Britain’s debt timebomb: more than 8 million people living under the weight of £200bn of unsecured credit. But on top of the levels of debt this country’s families are facing, it’s what’s driving them there that stands out. This isn’t a splurge on a new car or designer clothes – but payments for council tax or electricity bills. The gulf between wages and living costs is such that credit cards, loans and rent-to-own deals are now a financial sticking plaster: a frantic attempt to patch up the gaps left by an income that barely covers a home, food and heat. Certain sections of society are particularly vulnerable: gig economy workers, young people, private renters and lone mums or dads. New research by the charity Gingerbread shows that a third of single parents are in debt, with – staggeringly – nearly a quarter of those in debt owing at least £10,000. Debt is the inevitable result of a system in which living costs rise as wages and benefits fall. What’s coming into the average family’s bank account nowadays hardly comes close to what needs to go out. Since 2008 another 4 million people have been pushed below the benchmark for what’s classed as an adequate income to afford decent living standards – as calculated by Loughborough University – due to increasing pressure on household budgets. This has been creeping up for years and is only set to get worse. The pressure on households has just officially jumped, with the cost of basics such as clothing, shoes and fuel pushing core inflation up to its highest since 2011. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has calculated that over the next five years the cost of living could rise by up to 10%. “The cost of living” is in many ways a political euphemism for relentless pressure. The stress in the pit of your stomach of how to pay the bills coming in. Yet instead of overseeing policies to lift the burden, the government is adding to it: freezing working-age benefits, cutting tax credits, and offering token changes to the public sector pay freeze. Next time a minister declares that employment alone is enough to solve people’s financial problems, I would suggest they talk to Julia. Vast chunks of the population now need loans simply to make ends meet. If this is not a national crisis, nothing is. • Frances Ryan writes the Hardworking Britain column for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/28/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T10:15:00Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/28/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/28/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• We referred to Sir Leonard Blavatnik as an “oligarch” (The oligarch who has spent millions on building a reputation, 4 September, page 10).

Warner’s staff indicated to the Guardian that, while nothing was imminent, the senator has considered examining the site as the question of 2016 election interference lingers on in parallel congressional and FBI investigations. “[Reddit] is one of the forums that some of the coordinated information campaigns happened on,” Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at Oxford University, told the Hill. Bradshaw studies how governments use social media to influence public opinion, and said she had witnessed patterns on the site that suggested a deliberate effort to distribute false news. The discussion site is one of the 10 most visited websites in the US, along with Google, Facebook and Twitter, and is considered by many to be the internet’s stepping stone between mainstream social media and more niche sites such as 4chan. Unlike Facebook, which more aggressively polices content it deems harmful, Reddit is known for much looser rules and restrictions, which is part of why the site has been identified at various times as a safe haven for internet trolls, cyberbullies, and Nazi and white supremacist groups. In recent years and months, the site has introduced a number of policy changes aimed at curbing that perception, especially in relation to hate speech, but it has demonstrated the ability to easily sustain and proliferate hoax stories. The highest-profile example of this was the so-called “Pizzagate” conspiracy, which tried to link Hillary Clinton to a fabricated pedophile ring allegedly operating out of a Washington pizzeria via her campaign chairman, John Podesta. In December 2016, a gunman motivated by that story entered a Washington DC pizza restaurant with an assault rifle and fired a shot. The Senate investigation had already zeroed in on Facebook in its investigation last week with word that data on more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads had been turned over to investigators. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, announced last week that the site was “actively working with the US government on its ongoing investigations into Russian interference”, adding that: “I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy. That’s not what we stand for.” That revelation prompted Donald Trump to revive his claim that Russian involvement in the 2016 election was a “hoax”, commenting: “The Russia hoax continues, now it’s ads on Facebook.” On Wednesday he added: “Facebook was always anti-Trump.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/europe-must-act-to-protect-rights-and-freedoms-of-catalans","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T21:00:20Z","webTitle":"Europe must act to protect the rights and freedoms of Catalans | Ada Colau","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/europe-must-act-to-protect-rights-and-freedoms-of-catalans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/europe-must-act-to-protect-rights-and-freedoms-of-catalans","fields":{"headline":"Europe must act to protect the rights and freedoms of Catalans","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Catalan question has become Europe’s most serious territorial crisis in recent years. While the aim of exercising self-government has a long history, the origins of the current crisis can be found in the repeated refusals on the part of the government in Madrid to enter a dialogue on Spanish territorial reforms that recognises the right of Catalans to decide their own political future. You do not need to share the Catalan regional government’s roadmap to realise that the main party responsible for worsening the situation has been the intransigent government of Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. That government has been committed to imposing a judicial solution on to a political problem since 2014, when the government in Barcelona launched a non-binding consultation to gauge the Catalan population’s opinions on independence. We have been witnessing a judicialisation of politics ever since, a process that first started when Catalonia’s former president, vice-president and minister of education were fined and disqualified from politics. This process, however, took a “qualitative leap” last week, putting fundamental rights and freedoms at risk, with the threatened arrest of 700 mayors, the closing of government websites and civil society organisations, the arrest of high-level regional government officials, the interrogation and intimidation of school directors, interference in the regional government’s accounts and a massive deployment of police forces for the purpose of preventing Catalonia’s citizens from being able to vote this Sunday at the referendum convened by their regional government. We are not just facing an institutional dispute but also a social and political conflict that clearly has to be resolved by political means. There are many non-separatists such as ourselves, who, while critical of the unilateral path taken by the Catalan regional government, are calling for a negotiated solution in accordance with the feelings of 82% of the Catalan population, who support the holding of an agreed referendum, like the one conducted in Scotland. That is why it is a mistake to think the Catalan question can be resolved by taking legal action against its political representatives: following that path will only help to raise social tensions and block any possibility of finding a way out of the conflict. By proving itself incapable of finding a solution during all this time, the Spanish government has allowed the Catalan conflict to escalate from an internal dispute to a European conflict. Europe today consists of interconnected states, societies, businesses and citizens cooperating with one another. At a time when the European project finds itself threatened by terrorism and an upsurge in xenophobic populism and isolationist policies in national states, Europe cannot allow itself to adopt an passive position over the Catalan question, seeing that the events going on in Barcelona are affecting Paris, Madrid, Brussels and Berlin alike. The European Union came about as a project to safeguard and guarantee our rights and freedoms. Defending the fundamental rights of Catalan citizens against a wave of repression from the Spanish state is also the same as defending the rights of Spanish and European citizens. Those of us who are committed to advancing towards a democratic, social and freedom-loving European project find it hard to believe that the European Union’s institutions would not only back a situation that jeopardises fundamental rights and freedoms but also fail to commit themselves to finding the means for a negotiated solution to the conflict. It is for this reason, given the seriousness of the situation in Catalonia, that it is my obligation as mayor of its capital, Barcelona, to call on the European commission to open a space for mediation between the Spanish and Catalan governments to find a negotiated and democratic solution to the conflict.

They beat and stabbed her so brutally that she almost died. It took three months for the bruises to heal. Police took Salamanca to a hospital, but never investigated the crime, even though it happened on a busy street. Not that Salamanca thinks the witnesses would have helped. “There were taxis lined up near where the attack happened, urging the attackers on,” she says. “What happened to me can’t keep happening. It’s outrageous that they attack us just for being who we are.” South America’s macho culture, combined with the strong influence of the Catholic church, means it is a particularly difficult place to be a transgender woman like Salamanca. In the past eight years, 74% of all reported murders of trans people were in Central and South America, according to a 2016 report from Transgender Europe (TGEU). Due to violence, poverty and the risk of HIV, the life expectancy for trans women in Latin America is estimated at between 35 and 41 years. Earlier this year, an orange bus stamped with anti-transgender messages toured several South American countries, including Colombia, which has the fourth-highest number of reported murders of trans people. The bus, funded by Catholic group Hazte Oir, bore the slogan: “Boys are born being boys, girls are born being girls. This is biology, not ideology.” On its first tour in Spain, the bus was painted with: “Boys have penises, girls have vulvas. Do not be fooled.” But now Colombia is on the brink of change. Last year’s peace deal between the government and the Farc rebels has renewed hopes that its decades-long civil war might be over. For LGBT people, who were regularly targeted in the violence, there is hope that the country might be made safer for them. Trans people in particular hope that the visibility and acceptance trans issues are beginning to receive in the US might spread south. If this is the beginning of a shift in attitudes, it is people such as Salamanca and other leaders of the nascent Colombian trans rights movement who are largely responsible. Salamanca has recently been working with the Farc, travelling out to transitional zones – rural parts of the country that were formerly held by the militia – to run workshops on gender identity. “Until five years ago, they were displacing us and killing us and now they want to work with us,” she says. But prejudices are hard to overcome. When she was attacked, Salamanca was working in the sex industry, where trans people are particularly vulnerable (65% of those murdered worldwide were sex workers, according to the TGEU report). Yet prostitution is one of only two jobs – along with hairdressing – available to most trans women in Colombia. Those who end up in sex work are mostly in Santa Fe, the notorious barrio on the eastern edge of Bogotá. Even at 10 in the morning, the area is buzzing, frantic. It is estimated there are between 300 and 600 trans people working in the sex trade here, and the rundown streets are lined with mechanic shops, bars, garages and women – women posing in doorways or lounging against walls, women wearing platform heels and neon bandeau dresses or lingerie and bikini tops. “This is where we started our transitions, this is where we are working, this is where we are killed,” says Salamanca. “It’s a contradiction – it’s a safe space for our identities, but it’s one of the most dangerous places in Bogotá.” Red Comunitaria Trans, the organisation Salamanca founded after the attack, records the number of crimes against trans women to counter scant official statistics. It has reported 12 murders of trans women so far in 2017 in the suburb of Santa Fe alone. On the day of the city’s Pride parade in July, members of Red Comunitaria Trans walked through Santa Fe painting flowers on the ground – one in each spot where a trans woman had been killed. Bibian Sophia Cáceres, 37, was 22 when she was forced to abandon her studies in economics in Bucaramanga in the north of Colombia and flee to Santa Fe. When she first read about transgender people, it immediately resonated. “I felt like a lightbulb went on in my head. I thought: Oh my God, this is my life,” she says. Cáceres began taking hormones and, when her breasts started growing, she bound them so people wouldn’t notice. But they did. First, she lost her job, then the local rightwing militia sent her a note saying she had 24 hours to leave the town or they would kill her. She boarded a bus out of Bucaramanga. “I got on the bus as a man and got off the bus in Bogotá as a woman. The first thing I did in Bogotá was get in a taxi and [the driver] said: ‘Señorita, where would you like to go?’” Cáceres beams at the memory. “The only way to be myself was to be in Bogotá.” But she quickly faced a huge obstacle. Until 2015 when the law was changed, it was incredibly difficult for Colombian people to alter their gender on identification documents, requiring a judge to order a bodily inspection or psychiatric exam. Cáceres found it impossible to get a job or apartment – employers and landlords would balk at the fact her appearance was female, but the name and stated sex on her documents were male. “Every time I would try to rent a room, they would look at my appearance and say no,” she says. Cáceres turned to sex work and, for years, the only places she could find to stay were through that work – sleeping in brothels, the pods where webcam sex sessions were filmed, or in clients’ homes. In the years she worked as a prostitute she was beaten once and raped once – which she says is far less than most sex workers she knows. She got a break in 2012 when she was hired by an LGBT group, and now she is coordinator of the Sebastián Romero LGBT centre in the leafy middle-class neighbourhood of Teusaquillo. It is clear she is competent, hard-working and beloved – a mother-figure to a lot of the younger LGBT people who attend events and support groups there. Despite this, the spectre of a return to sex work hangs over her. “If I lost my job now, it would be hard for me not to go back to prostitution,” says Cáceres. “Basically, if you’re unemployed and trans, you have a month to sort your life out or you’re on the street.” It’s a truth Andree Kate Smith, 27, knows only too well. She is employed in the LGBT sector as a contractor, but between contracts she is forced to turn to prostitution, sometimes for months. Her current contract, with the LGBT centre in Santa Fe, runs out on 9 December, a deadline that is particularly frightening because Smith’s partner – a trans man – gave birth to their first child, Eithan, a week ago. “With a son now, I’m even more worried than normal,” she says. For trans people, says Cáceres, only the lucky few have any safety net. “If you’re a trans person from Bogotá and your family still loves you and supports you, of course you don’t need to go into prostitution,” says Cáceres. “But for most trans people that’s not their experience. They lose their families, they lose their jobs.” Cáceres is talking on her day off, in an apartment in the upmarket suburb of Zona Rosa that belongs to Kaperuzza Orozco Guzman. Guzman, 67, is the oldest trans person Cáceres knows of in Colombia and is Cáceres’s adopted “trans grandmother”. The pair spend Christmas together. But Guzman, who comes from a wealthy and influential family, has a completely different experience of being trans to Cáceres. Guzman spent her youth as a ballet dancer in Spain, and on her return to Colombia was protected by her wealth and connections. She opened a high-end beauty salon that provided a decent income, and she styled the hair of beauty queens, actresses and, once, a president’s wife. She opened a nightclub, where she would dress up as a Playboy bunny, that was popular enough with straight people to be protected from bigoted attacks. “Because I was who I was and I was well known, I felt completely comfortable being trans and nobody bothers me,” Guzman says. The situation for trans people is often stratified along class lines. Those who hold white-collar jobs and have university degrees are often, though not always, able to stay employed when they transition. But for others, things are much harder. Megan Weed, an 18-year-old trans woman, has to dress as a man and answer to the male name she no longer goes by to keep her job at a liquor store. She dreams of moving to the US to study psychiatry and appear on RuPaul’s Drag Race. “I don’t feel like I have a future in Colombia,” she says. But Cáceres says that, in the past year, working at the Sebastián Romero LGBT centre she has noticed a shift in attitudes. “I’m seeing more and more families helping their children transition,” she says. “That’s a change I’m seeing across all class spectrums, including the poorest neighbourhoods. It used to be that the richer people with more education would come in for advice, but now rich and poor are coming here to get help for their kids.” Cáceres, who spent four years married to a trans man, insists that life is much easier for trans men in Colombia than for trans women, partly because it is often easier for them to “pass”, but also because of Colombia’s macho culture. “Here, it’s a big problem in society if a man gives up the privilege of being a man,” she says. “Families tend to be more accepting of trans boys than trans girls. It comes from a culture that values men more than women. To gain a son is OK, but to lose a son is catastrophic.” But when this idea is put to five of the trans men that make up the band 250 milligrams – named for the dose of testosterone trans men take each month – they all disagree strongly, saying they, too, face obstacles when it comes to gaining employment and acceptance. With one exception, the men, who range in age from 22 to 43, all seem to be thriving. They have jobs in a variety of sectors – one is a computer engineer, another a vet and two work for the government – and many have supportive families. But they all point out how privileged they are and insist that most trans men, particularly those from outside Bogotá, have much harder lives. Only one, 22-year-old drummer Thomas Jiménez Montaño, faces the sorts of struggles described by most of the trans women I meet. He has changed his documents to reflect his male identity. In Colombia, however, men are required to carry proof of their military service, or a card exempting them from it, which can in some circumstances be bought. Montaño cannot afford one and, despite a 2014 law forbidding universities and private employers from demanding to see it, he has been barred from education and formal employment. As is often the case in Colombia, the laws do not necessarily match people’s lived experiences. Montaño works in a shop, but is employed off the books, which means he can’t pay into a pension or get a social security card, which restricts his access to healthcare. “It’s a catch-22,” says his friend Andrew Aguacia, a 36-year-old computer engineer, and a singer in the group – if trans men change their identification documents, they face the issue of the military passbook; if they don’t, they face other dangers. Gustaff Garzón Aguilar, the bass player, was picked up by police in January after a security threat in the city. Police were checking the documents of men in the street. When they saw that the 30-year-old’s identification card said “female”, which clearly did not match his appearance, they arrested him. Once at the station, he says, “they ripped my clothes off, beat me and mocked me. I was out in two hours, but I was so scared.” The LGBT group Colombia Diverso recorded 57 cases of police brutality against trans people in 2015, including eight reports of sexual abuse of trans sex workers. Aguilar has filed an official complaint about the incident but he is not optimistic. “I know of no cases of police being held to account for mistreating trans people.” Ultimately, this is the problem facing trans people in Colombia, says Laura Weinstein, a trans woman and director of prominent trans rights group GAAT. In a society suffused with prejudice against trans people, even the relatively privileged can still be victims of an attack that will never be prosecuted or even recorded as a hate crime. “Even people who have supportive families are vulnerable,” says Weinstein. “There are people out there who want to kill trans people and they are not going to ask where you went to university or who your parents are.” So, is coming out, with all its risks to their lives and livelihoods, worth it? “It’s worth it because it’s a transition to joy and freedom,” says Weinstein. “And in the end that’s why we do it: to be happy. All I want is a world where it’s safe to be trans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/27/jockey-gibbons-alleged-urine-swap-avoid-positive-drug-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T17:45:33Z","webTitle":"Gibbons faces music over alleged sample swap to avoid positive test for cocaine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/27/jockey-gibbons-alleged-urine-swap-avoid-positive-drug-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/27/jockey-gibbons-alleged-urine-swap-avoid-positive-drug-test","fields":{"headline":"Gibbons faces music over alleged urine swap to avoid positive test for cocaine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Graham Gibbons, who allegedly attempted to swap a sample of his urine for one provided by a young apprentice before a random drug test, will face a disciplinary panel in London on Thursday after it emerged that his own sample subsequently tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine. Gibbons, who was the leading jockey on the winter all-weather circuit at the time of the incident, faces a ban of up to three years if he is found to have “acted in a manner prejudicial to the integrity, proper conduct and/or good reputation of horseracing” by attempting to pass off a sample from Callum Shepherd as his own. At least 10 riders were selected randomly for sampling by a British Horseracing Authority testing team at Kempton’s evening meeting on 7 December 2016. Reports at the time suggested Shepherd initially agreed to provide a sample for Gibbons, but then assisted the stewards and officials with an inquiry into alleged “sampling irregularity”. Gibbons agreed to stand down from riding “with immediate, indefinite effect” on 8 December after details emerged of the events the previous evening, and has not ridden in public since. In 17 seasons in the saddle he has ridden more than 1,000 winners including victories at Group Two and Group Three level, and was on course to reach 100 winners in a calendar year for the first time in his career at the time of the Kempton incident. Gibbons also has a history of problems relating to alcohol. He was suspended from riding for 35 days after failing a breath test in 2007 before a meeting at Hamilton, and banned from driving for four years in 2011 after being found asleep in his car outside his Yorkshire home after driving from a local pub. A subsequent blood test showed that Gibbons was three times over the limit. The presence of benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, in Gibbons’s sample from Kempton was only revealed on Wednesday, when the BHA published the official notice of Thursday’s hearing. He is the 13th jockey to test positive for cocaine in Britain since testing was introduced in 1994, and could expect to face a six-month ban from riding as a result. His apparent attempt to cheat the system, however, has led to an additional charge under the disrepute rule, which carries a maximum penalty of a three-year ban. The panel on Thursday is also expected to formally conclude the racing career of Dale Swift, who took the Ebor Handicap at York in 2011 aboard Moyenne Corniche. Swift has not ridden since April, when he announced his retirement from the saddle because of increasing weight problems. It has now emerged that Swift, who served a six-month ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2015, returned a second positive for the same drug when sampled at Southwell racecourse on 29 March. There was little movement on Wednesday in the outright betting on the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, with the market awaiting the announcement on Friday of the final field and draw, but Ladbrokes decided to close betting on Ryan Moore’s mount at Chantilly after seeing money only for Order Of St George, the 2016 Ascot Gold Cup winner and third home in last year’s race. Limato, an impressive winner of the Group One Prix de la Foret on the Arc undercard last season, has been ruled out of this year’s renewal due to the likelihood of soft ground on Sunday, while the connections of Marsha, who will attempt a repeat win in the Prix de l’Abbaye, are also concerned about the likely conditions at Chantilly. “ We won’t be using it as an excuse if she gets beaten, though. She’s heading to the December sales like Elite [Racing Club, Marsha’s owners] tend to do, but the syndicate do have a few of her siblings, who are now very valuable.She’s run well on soft ground at Goodwood,” William Butler, assistant to Sir Mark Prescott, Marsha’s trainer, said. “We’ll just have to hope they don’t get too much more rain.

In the autumn, my oven is in constant use: I start roasting again, big trays of jewel-coloured roots, the last of the corn, broccoli and cauliflowers. In winter, my heavy, cast-iron pots seldom leave the hob, always full of soup or a vegetable braise. In spring, the tender and fresh vegetables need only a lick of heat from a hot frying pan. And, in summer, I use my mandoline most, to slice fennel and courgettes finely for grilling and for raw salads. The seasons mean that the way I cook and the time I spend doing it change as dramatically as the contents of my fruit bowl and fridge. While I shop as locally as possible and focus on British produce, I have no qualms about leaning on our other European friends and their incredible offerings: citrus from the Mediterranean, the imminent winter tomatoes from Italy, pink and purple winter radicchio. Never has it been more important to foster these links, the trade it encourages and the barriers it breaks down. I long for a vegetable garden and to grow what I eat, but that’s not possible just now. The bulk of what I buy is from nearby shops and our excellent farmers’ market, topped up with supermarket deliveries for bulky things and dry goods. Supermarkets are getting better at stocking and championing local produce, so it is absolutely possible to eat seasonally wherever you regularly shop. If you aren’t in tune with the season, then perhaps remind yourself of what’s growing and good to eat now before you shop, look at labels, buy food from nearby if you can. If you are after some greens to steam alongside your supper, I’d urge you to scan them all and perhaps choose some British purple sprouting broccoli over the Kenyan green beans. It will taste better, support our farmers and have used up fewer resources in getting to your plate. This is nothing new, but while our shops still stock Peruvian asparagus in December, I think we all, myself included, need a reminder from time to time. Using produce in its prime means your work in the kitchen will be simpler and quicker. Putting what’s most flavourful at the centre of your plate often means you will need only the lightest of touch, adding to and accenting that flavour. You won’t need to work hard to boost lacklustre vegetables, but instead gently enhance and celebrate the vibrancy. This week’s offering from my new book gives you eight recipes that put seasonal produce at the centre of your table. From a hearty beetroot gratin to the transportive flavours of feather-light sweet potato bao, and from a stellar breakfast of chocolate rye porridge with pears to comforting malt loaf at tea time, there should be something for everyone. Party bao with sweet potato and pickled cucumber (main picture) If you’ve not come across them, bao are light but pleasingly chewy little steamed buns stuffed with flavourful fillings. You can make these bao a day in advance (re-steaming them before serving). Makes 20 For the bao 120g unsalted butter 2 x 7g sachets of dried yeast 1kg strong white bread flour, plus extra for rolling 1 tsp baking powder ¾ tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tbsp flaky sea salt Olive oil For the filling 1.5kg sweet potatoes, sliced lengthways and chopped into 2cm slices 4 tbsp tamari or dark soy sauce 2 tbsp runny honey 2 tbsp finely grated ginger 1 tbsp five-spice powder 2 pinches of chilli flakes 6 tbsp toasted sesame oil 1 large cucumber 2 tbsp mirin 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup 3 tbsp rice wine vinegar A pinch of white pepper For the dipping sauce 3 tbsp white miso 3 tbsp runny honey 1 tbsp brown rice vinegar 1 green chilli, finely chopped A large piece of ginger To finish A bunch of spring onions, finely sliced A large handful of coriander, leaves picked 250g salted roasted cashews 1 Melt the butter in a saucepan over a low heat. Put the yeast into a large bowl with 450ml warm water and leave for a few minutes until tiny bubbles begin to form. 2 Mix in the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sea salt and the melted butter until it all comes together, then knead for 10 minutes to a silky dough. Put in an oiled bowl, cover and leave in a warm place to prove for a couple of hours. 3 Once the dough has doubled in size, knock it back by kneading it for a few seconds on a floured surface. Split it in half, then, using your hands, roll each half into equal-sized logs. 4 Cut each log into 20 small, equal pieces (I find it easiest to cut each into 4, then cut those smaller pieces into 5). Roll each piece of dough into a ball and put on baking sheets lined with greaseproof paper. Cover and leave to prove again for 30–45 minutes. 5 Knock each risen bun back with the palm of your hand, then, using a rolling pin, roll into oval shapes about 12cm long and 9cm wide. Coat a chopstick with a little oil, put it across the width of each bun and fold the dough over, then gently remove the chopstick. 6 Set a large steamer (preferably with two tiers) over a medium heat, and get the water boiling. Put a layer of baking parchment in each steamer basket, then arrange the buns on top, spaced at least 3cm apart, then leave them to steam, not too fiercely, for 10–12 minutes, or until they have puffed up and are light, fluffy and cooked through. Leave to cool, then cover and chill overnight if you are preparing them in advance. You could make the bao even further in advance and freeze them until needed. 7 Preheat the oven to 240C/475F/gas 9. Meanwhile, make the filling. Toss the sweet potatoes into a roasting tin with the tamari, honey, ginger, five-spice, half the chilli flakes and 4 tbsp of the sesame oil. Roast for 20–30 minutes, turning halfway, until glazed and soft. 8 Shred or slice the cucumber into a bowl with the other pinch of chilli flakes, the mirin, honey, rice vinegar, white pepper and the remaining sesame oil. Toss to coat and set aside for 10 minutes before you want to eat, or chill for up to 5 days. 9 Make the dipping sauce by whisking all the ingredients together until you have a thick, rich sauce. Split the buns open and fill with the roasted sweet potato, drained cucumber, spring onions, coriander and lots of cashews crushed for texture. Not-chicken soup This is what to eat when you have a chill, feel fluey, or if you just need a bit of bolstering. It is a soup for the soul: chicken soup without the chicken, and with no apology! Serves 4 Olive oil 1 medium onion, quartered and thinly sliced 1 leek, finely sliced 3 bulbs of fennel, trimmed and finely sliced, fronds reserved 3 celery stalks, chopped into 1cm pieces, leaves reserved 1 medium carrot, peeled and chopped into 1cm pieces 8 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced 2 tbsp ginger, peeled and grated 1 lemon 1 tsp whole white peppercorns, plus more to taste 200g firm tofu, sliced into roughly 1cm sticks 3 tbsp soy sauce 50g small pasta or broken up spaghetti To serve Fennel fronds and celery leaves Extra virgin olive oil 1 Heat a little olive oil in a large soup pot over a medium heat. Add the onion, leek, fennel, celery and carrot, then turn the heat down to low and cook gently for 20-30 minutes, or until everything is soft and sweet, without browning too much. Keep a little jug of water close to the pan and add a splash of water if it looks like it’s going to stick. 2 Add the garlic and ginger, cook for another couple of minutes, then squeeze in the juice of the lemon. 3 Add the peppercorns and 2 litres of water, plus a good pinch of sea salt (or you can use vegetable stock if you want a fuller flavoured soup). Bring to the boil and simmer for 20-30 minutes. 4 Meanwhile, toss the tofu in 2 tbsp soy sauce. Heat a pan with a little olive oil and fry until crisp. Once the tofu is golden and crispy, add the final tablespoon of soy sauce and toss quickly in the hot pan: the soy should stick to the tofu and give it a rich stickiness. Remove from the heat. 5 Your soup should now be about ready. Add your pasta: if it’s long noodles then break them up as you add them: cook for another 8 minutes (or as long as your pasta takes to cook). Finally, taste, and adjust with more salt, water or even a squeeze more lemon, if needed. Ladle the soup into shallow bowls and top with the tofu, some fennel fronds and celery leaves, plus a good drizzle of olive oil. Gentle potato chowder with toasted chilli oil Warms you right down to your toes. Serves 4 25g unsalted butter or 2 tbsp coconut oil 2 leeks, washed, trimmed and cut into 1cm-thick rounds A pinch of salt 2 tbsp flour, such as spelt 1 tbsp vegetable stock powder or 1 stock cube 800g floury potatoes, peeled and cut into rough chunks 300ml whole milk or soy milk 400g tin of green lentils, drained (or 250g home-cooked) For the chilli oil 2 red chillies 1 tsp to 1 tbsp dried chilli flakes 2 garlic cloves 1 tbsp almonds Salt and black pepper 200ml mild-flavoured oil, such as light olive or rapeseed 1 Fill and boil a kettle. In a medium-large pot, melt the butter over a medium heat. Add the leeks with a pinch of salt, lower the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for around 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet. 2 Stir in the flour and allow to cook for another minute or so to get rid of the raw flavour. Gradually add 600ml hot water from the kettle, a bit at a time, then add the stock powder or cube. Add the potatoes and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are cooked through, which should take about 25 minutes, making sure you stir from time to time to stop it sticking. 3 Meanwhile, make the chilli oil. Put the fresh and dried chilli and garlic into a food processor and pulse until fine, then add the almonds, a good pinch of salt and a generous amount of black pepper. Pulse again, put the lot into a small saucepan with the oil and cook slowly for 10 minutes or so, until everything is toasted and golden, then remove from the heat and set aside. The oil can be used warm (not hot) on your soup. The leftovers should be left to cool completely, then stored in a jar in the fridge for up to 3 months. 4 Back to the soup. Add the milk to the pot, stir in the lentils, and heat until the milk is just simmering. Serve the soup ladled into deep bowls, topped with a slick of the chilli oil. Beetroot, rhubarb and potato gratin I tend not to cook with a lot of dairy, but here I make an exception, using the best I can get. Serves 4–6 Butter, for greasing 1kg potatoes, preferably waxy ones such as desiree or charlotte 500g cooked beetroot, peeled 300ml weak vegetable stock 300ml double cream 150ml sour cream 2 bay leaves 2 tsp pink peppercorns or ½ tsp black peppercorns 200g forced rhubarb, thinly sliced 1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Butter a large gratin dish. 2 Peel the potatoes and slice them very finely – a mandoline or the fine slicer attachment on a food processor is the best way to do this; just watch your fingers if you’re using a mandoline. Cut the beetroot into fine slices as well – they don’t have to quite be as thin, so you could just use a knife. 3 Put the stock and both the creams into a large saucepan, along with the bay leaves and 1 tsp of the peppercorns. Bring the liquid to just under the boil, then take off the heat and leave to sit for 30 minutes or so. Remove the bay leaves, leaving the peppercorns in, then bring the liquid to just below a simmer. Add the sliced potatoes and cook gently for 5 minutes. 4 Remove from the heat, season really well with salt and pepper, and spoon half the potatoes into the gratin dish. Put half the beetroot and rhubarb on top, seasoning as you go, then top with the rest of the potatoes and their cream, followed by the rest of the beetroot. 5 Roughly bash the remaining pink peppercorns in a pestle and mortar and sprinkle on the gratin. Bake for 1 hour, or until the vegetables are completely tender. Cover the top with foil after about 45 minutes if it looks like it is becoming too dark. Chocolate rye porridge with quick honey pears The traditionalists out there might be rolling their eyes, but porridge is personal. This is my very favourite of winter breakfasts: chocolate, a malty back note from the rye flakes and a very quick pear compote with honey. Serves 2 50g rolled rye flakes 50g rolled oats 300ml unsweetened almond milk or cow’s milk A pinch of flaky sea salt 2 tsp raw cacao or unsweetened cocoa powder A pinch of ground cinnamon 2 tsp runny honey For the topping 2 pears, cored and sliced 1 tbsp runny honey To serve 2 tbsp almond butter A handful of chopped almonds 1 First, make the pear topping. Heat the pears and honey in a small pan over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until just warmed through and beginning to soften, adding a tiny splash of water if it’s looking too dry. 2 Meanwhile, put all the porridge ingredients into a pan with 100ml hot water and cook for 5–8 minutes, or until the oats come together; add more water if it looks too thick. 3 Spoon the porridge into bowls and top with the pears, almond butter and almonds. Bay and lemon-laced creme caramel Making caramel can put people off, but I have given easy instructions here, so don’t be nervous – it’s really not hard at all. You will need six ramekins or dariole moulds. Just be sure to check the wobble on the baked creme caramels – you want a very light wobble in the middle; they shouldn’t be too liquid. Serves 6 A knob of butter, for greasing 500ml organic whole milk 1 unwaxed lemon 2 bay leaves 1 vanilla pod 2 medium organic eggs, plus 4 egg yolks 75g golden caster sugar For the caramel 60g golden caster sugar 60g light muscovado sugar The juice of 1 lemon 1 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas 3½. Grease all the ramekins or dariole moulds with butter. 2 Start by infusing your milk. Pour the milk into a saucepan. Peel 4 strips of zest from the lemon with a speed peeler and add to the milk with the bay. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod and add to the milk along with the pod. Heat gently over a low heat and, when it’s just under a simmer, take off the heat and allow to cool a little and infuse for 15 minutes. 3 Next, make the caramel by melting the caster and muscovado sugars together in a large, deep saucepan with the lemon juice and 2 tbsp of water. Try not to it stir once it’s heated (stirring will encourage the sugar to crystallise) – a gentle shake and tilt of the pan now and then will help the sugar to melt evenly. Let the sugar mixture cook until it’s bubbling, is a rich molasses colour all over and smells biscuity. It should take around 3 minutes from when it starts to bubble. If you’re nervous and want to test that it’s done, pour a small dot on to a cold plate; if it sets, it’s done. Pour the caramel into your greased ramekins, distributing it evenly across all 6, and leave to one side to set. 4 Now, on to the custard. Crack the whole eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk with the yolks and caster sugar until everything is combined. Gradually add the cooled milk to the eggs and sugar, gently combining with a whisk as you go. Fill and boil the kettle. 5 Pour the mixture through a sieve into a jug, then pour into the ramekins and put them in a deep roasting tray. Cover each ramekin tightly with foil. Carefully pour the hot water from the kettle into the tray until it reaches about halfway up the ramekins’ sides. 6 Bake in the centre of the hot oven for 15 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for a further 15–20 minutes, or until they’re set with a bit of wobble still in the centre. Cool on a roasting tray, then put them, covered, in the fridge – ideally overnight, but definitely for at least 3–4 hours. 7 Remove from the fridge at least 30 minutes before you want to serve them. When you’re ready, gingerly run a small palette knife around the edge and invert each one on to a plate. Salted chocolate truffles Just some melting, mixing and pouring – your own little chocolate factory. This batch makes a lot, and can be wrapped up and given as Christmas presents. Makes about 48 60g coconut oil, plus a little extra to grease 30g coconut or light brown sugar 200g raw almond/cashew/ hazelnut butter 200g dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa solids) Seeds from 1 vanilla pod 2 big pinches of flaky sea salt Additional flavours Zest of 1 unwaxed orange Zest of 1 unwaxed lemon Zest of 1 unwaxed lime Swap the salt for smoked sea salt 1 red chilli, finely chopped Seeds from 2 cardamom pods, removed and crushed ½ tsp ground cinnamon To coat (use one or more) 50g raw cacao or cocoa powder Pistachios, almonds and/or hazelnuts, finely chopped Candied orange peel, finely chopped Candied ginger, finely chopped Chocolate (dark, milk or white), grated Dried rose petals, crushed 1 Grease a 20 x 20cm square brownie tin with coconut oil. Heat the coconut oil and sugar in a saucepan on a low heat. Once the oil has melted and the sugar has dissolved into the oil, take the pan off the heat and add the nut butter, chocolate, vanilla and salt. Stir off the heat until everything has melted. If you’re adding another flavour, stir it in now. 2 Pour the mixture into the tin. Chill for about 2 hours, or until set solid. While the truffle mix is cooling, get your chosen coating or coatings ready and put each in a little bowl. 3 Once set, turn the truffle slab out on to a cool work surface and cut into squares (mine are 1–1½cm), then gently dip each truffle in its coating to cover. 4 The truffles will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks in a sealed container. Malt loaf with prunes and black tea Pure nostalgia. I remember eating this in my grandma’s flat – high up in a 1970s tower block. How I wish we could still share a slice. Makes 1 loaf 125g prunes, pitted 125g raisins 150ml strong black tea, hot Butter or oil, for greasing 150g malt extract, plus 2 tbsp to finish 100g light muscovado sugar 125g wholemeal spelt flour 125g white spelt flour 1 tsp baking powder A pinch of fine salt 2 medium eggs 1 Put the prunes and raisins into a shallow bowl, cover with the hot tea and leave to soak overnight (or as long as you can manage). Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. 2 Butter a deep loaf tin measuring 20x9cm and line it with baking paper. Put the malt extract and muscovado sugar in a small saucepan and warm, without stirring, over a medium heat, until the sugar has dissolved, then take off the heat. 3 Put the flours, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl and use a whisk to get rid of any lumps. 4 Using a stick blender, puree 2 tbsp of the soaked fruit into a chunky paste. Pour the warm malt and sugar mixture into the flour, and add the fruit paste and whole fruits. 5 Break the eggs into a small bowl, beat lightly with a fork and fold into the mixture. 6 Scoop the mixture – it is quite soft – into the lined loaf tin and gently smooth the surface. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until lightly springy, then remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin. While the cake cools, brush the top with a little more malt extract.

We were in the shopping centre, and the security guard was watching us, suspiciously. It always happens. He was following us around the store.” According to Olukaga, “It’s not that we’re loud, we just have a presence. We’re always being told to dial it down a little bit.” Anecdotally, her experience and those of other young black women who have grown up in Britain appear to correlate with the latest studies in the US. A new book, Pushout: the Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools by Monique Morris, highlights the disproportionate levels of punishment meted out to black schoolgirls, who make up 16% of female students but more than one-third of all girls with a school-related arrest. The reasons are complex, but may be linked to recent research by Georgetown Law’s Center on Poverty and Inequality, which found that adults view black girls as “less innocent” and “more adult-like” than their white peers. The Georgetown academics surveyed adults from diverse backgrounds and drew a range of conclusions, including that adults think black girls, especially between the ages of five and 14, need less protection than white girls, know more about sex and need less nurturing than white girls. This mirrors previous research in the US which has found that, from age 10 onwards, black boys are more likely to be viewed as older and guilty of suspected crimes than their white peers. Yewande Adeniran, 23, had a particularly tough childhood thanks to her skin colour, and believes the Georgetown study reflects her experiences. She was the only black girl at her boarding school apart from her sister, and says she was immediately singled out: “I’d get put into detention for things my white female peers didn’t. We’d just be in class chatting – and I always got straight As, so it wasn’t like I was being bad – but I’d be sent to isolation. I had a teacher who picked all of the people of colour out, and the only outwardly gay person too. He moved me down a set and said, ‘We don’t want too many of your kind of people in the top set.’” It may sound like the stuff of 1950s racist nightmares, but this was in the 2000s. Perhaps Adeniran’s treatment forced adulthood upon her faster than it should have come, the perception of a lack of innocence becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy? “They perceived anything I did as being really aggressive, really angry. Even me calling something out as racist [would equal] isolation,” she says. “I was 15, none of the teachers listened to me, the head of the year pulled me into a class and started calling me a bitch and all sorts of stuff. I told the head of school, but obviously nothing was done.” Much like in the US, a lot of black British girls tend to do well at school. As far back as 2004, black African girls were overtaking white British boys in the classroom. But black African students also significantly outperform their Caribbean counterparts, and black Caribbean girls are twice as likely to be excluded from school than other female students. This reflects the statistics from the US, where researchers worry the perception of black girls lacking innocence is leading to their higher rates of exclusion and suspension. As a mixed-race black child myself, growing up in a very white environment in Scotland, I didn’t ever come close to being excluded from school – but there were incidents that still rankle. As one of only two black girls in my year, I was picked on at various points by teachers; in my final year, a teacher told me just because I was black, that didn’t mean I could get away with giving him dirty looks. My black peers in their early 20s have dozens of horror stories to tell: “I used to get detentions for the way I’d walked into lessons ... Teachers used to tell other pupils confidential private stuff I’d told them; put me on report card and threatened to take away my scholarship when they found out I was self-harming.” Some say they felt sexualised by adults from an early age. One friend recalls that “adults used to comment on my body bare when I was in primary school, and note how it was developing, in a way that they would never do to white girls”. ‘Watch what you wear’ So is the situation any different for young girls now? Ella Benson Roberts is a biracial white and black Caribbean student at Acland Burghley school in north-west London. We meet at Caravan in Kings Cross for a hot chocolate and fries with her mum. “I really enjoy sociology and drama; I feel sociology looks into different people’s lives and how things affect them differently,” the 14-year-old tells me. “And you’re a bit of a feminist, aren’t you?” chimes in her mum. “Yeah,” Ella says, “an intersectional feminist. Or a womanist.” Thanks to the internet, black girls these days have the language to explain their struggle. Recent research from the media agency UM London suggests that 69% of teenage girls in the UK now identify as feminists: a higher proportion than any other age group. When Ella tells me about some of her feminist idols, Amandla Stenberg and Yara Shahidi, I feel gladdened these black women I’ve often written about are impacting their peers in a positive way. There was no real equivalent when I was in my teens. Ella’s complaints are less about how she’s treated by adults, and more how her friends often run their hands through her afro. “I don’t think I’ve been treated that differently,” she says, “But there are certain things that adults do which are annoying – like comment on my hair.” It makes her feel as though she stands out. The Georgetown study didn’t make allowance for light- and dark-skinned African American children, but my guess is that lighter-skinned and mixed-race children – like myself and Ella – are probably perceived as being slightly more innocent than darker-skinned children, thanks to colourism. Fifteen-year-old Jade Olaide is of Nigerian heritage, and has had a slightly different experience of growing up black. “I’ve been told I act older than most of my year group; that I come across as more mature than other people my age,” she says. “That happens to a lot of my [black] friends too – being [seen as] more mature than their white counterparts.” But Jade also says she has been treated as “older” by her family since she was very young. “I’ve been given responsibility at a young age. It wasn’t just in school – I think it’s a cultural thing: I was expected to do more than my white friends. I don’t think it’s a bad thing.” It may also be the case, of course, that black girls are treated as older by relatives who want to prepare them for the struggles of being a minority in a white world. Jade, a born-and-bred Mancunian, describes a recent incident that made a big impression on her: “We were kicked out of McDonald’s,” she says of her black friendship group. “It wasn’t actually us that caused the trouble, but the police were called to McDonald’s and every single one of my friends got kicked out. That day really upset and angered me … Something went on with a white group of people, and the police showed up and straight away went to our table without asking any questions.” Jade has a lot of black friends from similar Nigerian backgrounds, which means she’s always had someone to talk to about her identity issues. She says she is looking forward to visiting Nigeria for the first time in the next year, and sometimes talks as though everyday racism is something that happened to my generation, but not her own. “My brothers went through racism as well, and because there’s an age gap they grew up quite a long time before me,” Jade says. “Racism was actually quite bad when they were growing up … They repeat to me a lot of the time: ‘You’re a black girl growing up in a white man’s world. You need to keep your head down, and don’t ever let it get to you.’” Olukoga, who is one of three girl triplets, remembers her older brother often having “the talk” about racism with her father. “It’s something that’s been discussed in my house, but always directed towards my brother – he’s a black guy, he has to be aware,” she says. “With me and my sisters, it was never really explicit. It was more like ‘watch your tone of voice’, that kind of thing. And watch what you wear, because you’re over-sexualised [by adults].” According to Olukoga, who lives in Islington, north London, “A lot of my friends have quite curvaceous bodies and the cat-calling, the screaming, is very uncomfortable to watch. It’s definitely a problem – we’re only 16 or 17. Our body types shouldn’t give you a passport to advance on us.” After studying the Civil Rights movement in the US, Olukoga did her own research on the black power movement and her black identity on social media. “You can often get stuck in your own bubble and think there’s not a lot of black women out there doing their thing,” she says. “Up until two years ago I didn’t really think there was anyone out there doing it [being a politician]. The only person I could think of was Diane Abbott. But then I got on Twitter and saw a bunch of amazing black women and it pushes you a lot.” In the future, Olukoga is considering building a foundation to support black boys. “I see a lot of stuff – how they’re demonised in the media as ‘aggressive’. I want to do something to get away from the stigma of black boys and find a balance.” But concerns about how young black men are treated by adult authority figures can sometimes leave black women battling their oppressions alone, as Kimberlé Crenshaw, creator of the #SayHerName campaign in the US, identified – pointing out that police violence occurs disproportionately to black women too. “One of the things that is unique about gender racism in American society,” Crenshaw told Revolution Newspaper, “is that black women are subject to many of the racial stereotypes that people think apply primarily to men. In fact, they apply to women as well.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com Follow the Guardian’s Inequality Project on Twitter here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/shortcuts/2017/sep/27/terace-politics-when-football-fans-have-a-message-to-deliver","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T16:08:30Z","webTitle":"Terrace diplomacy: when football fans get political","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2017/sep/27/terace-politics-when-football-fans-have-a-message-to-deliver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/shortcuts/2017/sep/27/terace-politics-when-football-fans-have-a-message-to-deliver","fields":{"headline":"Terrace diplomacy: when football fans get political","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"While Donald Trump will soon have the opportunity to fulminate in 280 characters against #Takeaknee protests, and some American sports fans have been left complaining that they turned on the Pittsburgh Steelers’ game to get away from their nation’s endless political convulsions, here in Europe, the collisions between sport and politics feel much more manageable. Last night in Cyprus, while watching their team succumb to a Harry Kane hat trick for Tottenham in their Champions League tie, Greek-Cypriot fans of Apoel Nicosia fans unfurled two banners that read: “History Cannot Be Stolen” and “Bring The Marbles Back”. The marbles in question being the Parthenon Marbles, removed from the Parthenon in 1801 by Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin, and brought back to the British Museum where they still reside today, much to Greek national outrage. In recent times, beyond deeply domestic soap operas such as Wenger Out, the terraces have been prone to occasional outbreaks of politicking. Most shockingly, last August, Legia Warsaw fans unveiled a huge stand-sized banner to celebrate the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising of 1944. It depicted a German soldier with a pistol pointed at the head of a child, bearing the legend: “During the Warsaw uprising the Germans killed 160,000 people. Thousands of them were children.” Oddly, their opponents weren’t German, but the Kazakh side, Astana. A month later, Legia fans’ bizarre sense of humour revealed itself with their next banner – this time of a pig in a suit, labelled “Uefa” , with the legend: “And the €35,000 fine goes to …”, openly inviting the sport’s governing body to fine the club, as Uefa forbids the use of messages of political, religious, ideological or offensive nature. Which it duly did. In March this year, fans of Russian side Spartak Moscow unveiled a banner during a draw with Lokomotiv Moscow, depicting the BBC as “Blah Blah Channel”. It showed two hooligans in red balaclavas, following on from the Beeb documentary Russia’s Hooligan Army, that had been broadcast the previous month. In Liverpool, just before June’s snap election, fans in Anfield’s famous Kop stand unveiled a banner depicting not only Jeremy Corbyn but John McDonnell too, with the words: “What unites us is greater than what divides us”. In August last year, Celtic faced Uefa censure when fans unfurled Palestinian flags as their team played Israel’s Hapoel Beer Sheva. The hoops’ Irish Catholic heritage has long lent its support to the Palestinian cause. Less controversially, last month Celtic fans unveiled a banner in rainbow colours on Glasgow’s 21st Pride day. It read: “A club open to all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/07/howard-jacobson-on-conkers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Howard Jacobson: ‘A conker is a rite of passage’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/07/howard-jacobson-on-conkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/07/howard-jacobson-on-conkers","fields":{"headline":"Howard Jacobson: ‘A conker is a rite of passage’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The other day, I showed a child a conker. He’d never seen one before, and tried to eat it. His parents flew off the handle. He could have choked to death, they said. I reminded them that the world was full of objects on which a child could choke to death. I quoted Nietzsche: “Life is dangerous.” I was angry with myself afterwards for letting Nietzsche distract me. I should have said that if their child had choked on a conker, that would have been because they hadn’t shown him what a conker was. That’s the sad thing: a generation of children growing up ignorant of the beauty of conkers and the exhilaration of going on a conker hunt. I don’t know if schools really are banning conkers. But I wouldn’t be surprised. When students are sheltered from hurtful ideas at university, it’s only to be expected that some over-zealous headmaster will declare the space beneath a horse chestnut tree a combat-free zone. But I am loth to join Brexiters in their chorus of scorn for regulation: the Grenfell fire showed what happens when we confuse liberty with lawlessness. Conkers, though, are a risk we should be prepared to take. A conker is a rite of passage. Until you have vinegared a conker, baked it in the oven, pierced it with a nail, strung it, squared up to your opponent, conker to conker, and taken aim, you will not have learned how triumph hangs by a thread and can turn, in a moment, to defeat. But that’s only the gladiatorial aspect of conkers. As with panning for gold, the real joy is in the search: getting up early on a bright autumnal morning and hunting for them among the fallen leaves, sometimes hearing one drop from the trees, on occasions at your very feet, a gift just emerged from its prickly casing like a new-hatched chick, perfectly formed and already independent, as yet unseen by any human eyes but yours. I was hardly what you’d call a child of nature, but in the moment of stooping to pick up a conker, I became William Wordsworth. To take a conker wasn’t theft, but it seemed to impose an obligation: to look, to feel, to trace, to understand how resilience was a property of shape and colour. Yet, today, they lie on the ground in their thousands, unnoticed and uncherished. You can’t play with them on your smart phone – is that why they are forgotten? Here, then, is a suggestion: drop your phone in vinegar, drive a nail into it, attach it to a piece of string and see how many other phones you can destroy. Then, when they’re all gone, go looking for a conker on a bright autumnal morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/27/sugar-daddy-money-sense-website","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T18:32:19Z","webTitle":"Who would shed a tear for the sugar daddy with more money than sense? | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/sugar-daddy-money-sense-website","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/sugar-daddy-money-sense-website","fields":{"headline":"Who would shed a tear for the sugar daddy with more money than sense?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is uproar this week over the so-called new “sugar daddy and sugar baby” dating website RichMeetBeautiful, which promises to hook up rich men with beautiful young women. The site, which started in Scandinavia, has been putting up posters near university campuses in Brussels, attracting accusations of playing on young women’s financial insecurity. The controversy is wonderful publicity for the site. It could claim it’s only being honest about brutal market forces that traditionally link up rich guys and younger spouses. We could, for example, apply Mrs Merton’s legendary interview question to Louise Linton, the glamorous 36-year-old wife of the US Treasury secretary: “What first attracted you to the staggeringly wealthy banker and movie producer Steven Mnuchin?” As Marilyn Monroe says in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: “Don’t you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You wouldn’t marry a girl just because she’s pretty – but, my goodness, doesn’t it help?” But the point is that RichMeetBeautiful is looking for thousands of registrations. You pay to use it. And of course it’s overwhelmingly conceited and deluded men who’ll be paying. Could it be that, as with the so-called infidelity site Ashley Madison, a lot of the young female images will be fake? In which case the site could be renamed GullibleMenMeetCunningWebsiteOwner. Trump’s ultimate deterrent Twitter is experimenting with doubling its character limit to 280, and the only question is: how does this affect the chances of you, me and everyone in the world being annihilated in a nuclear war? It does affect these chances – but advantageously. Like everyone else on the site, Donald Trump has got used to the 140 limit, and like all addicted Twitter users regards it as a fact of life, or law of nature. The US president’s traditional signoff –“Sad!” – is a function of this constriction. He has got used to being punchy, and punchiness in someone with a fist near the nuclear button isn’t good. As Hillary Clinton said: he is someone you can bait with a tweet – and he is someone who baits with a tweet (which can, with a single click, be translated into Korean). So why not encourage Mr Trump’s notorious tendency to stream-of-consciousness verbiage in another direction? That’s the sort of thing to make everyone tune out from pure boredom – including people in Pyongyang. The president’s Twitter limit should be lifted to 140,000 characters. Race to the bottom Now that Transport for London is on the verge of its mighty victory against Uber, I’m wondering who else it can get tough with. Manspreaders? Sodcasters? People who hit other passengers by wearing a backpack big enough to transport an upright piano? No, I’m talking about people who do the “fake exit” to get a seat on a packed carriage. The train comes into the station, and someone prepares to stand up. A seat is about to be vacated. The people standing nearest obviously have priority, and hover ostentatiously. Then you make your move: sidling up to the vacant seat but with your eyes fixed on the doors, as if you merely intend to get off. Fellow passengers stand back to let you pass. But you flop into the empty seat, having subtly converted your walk into a halting limp, while simultaneously wincing, clutching a hip or leg and giving a little whispered “Thanks!” to the astonished person whose seat it rightfully was, as if he could see how much pain you were in and had given you permission to take it.

Google Shopping will also operate as a separate business, seeking to make a profit, albeit it will continue to be part of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. The changes, introduced from Wednesday, are an attempt to answer the EU’s claim that the Google shopping service could always outbid others for the advertising space at the top of the site, as its cash would not be leaving the wider company. The shopping service will have its own accounts, which it will provide to the European commission to scrutinise, and there will be Chinese walls within the company to ensure it gains no competitive advantage, Google said. The tech giant was forced to make the change after the European commission ruled in June that it had been artificially and illegally promoting its own price comparison service in searches, denying consumers real choice and rival firms the ability to compete on a level playing field. Google was set a deadline of 28 September to change its practices, or face huge daily fines. The company is appealing against an initial €2.4bn (£2.1bn) fine tabled by the commission last June as a consequence of the ruling. The commission has been aware of Google’s plan since August but Brussels has not given any indication as to whether the change goes far enough. Competitors in the price comparison market are not expected to find the change acceptable, however, and there is talk of a boycott of the internet search engine’s auctions. Such an outcome would mean Google’s shopping services ads would continue to monopolise the top of the site. It is understood that of 300 price comparison sites, only about a dozen have so far agreed to take part in auctions for the advertising spots at the top of its search page. Al Verney, a spokesperson for Google, said that whatever the outcome the company had provided a level playing field that should satisfy the European regulator. He said: “We’re implementing a remedy to comply with the European commission’s recent decision. “We’re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google’s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping. “Google Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else.” From Wednesday evening, users searching for products may notice a small change to the advertising panel at the top of the search screen that shows pictures of products with links to retailers’ websites. Instead of Google’s shopping comparison service monopolising all the slots, the name of the price comparison site that has won the ad space auction will be displayed below the picture of whatever product is being sought by the user. The commission’s fine of €2.4bn was said to take into account the “duration and gravity of the infringement”, and was based on Google’s revenue from its comparison shopping service in the 13 countries where the illegality occurred. It was claimed by Brussels that Google’s illegal promotion of its shopping service caused traffic to it to jump 45-fold in the UK, 35-fold in Germany and 19-fold in France. The changes brought in by Google will only be seen by users of the search engine in the European Economic Area (EEA)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/27/jaromir-hrbek-jailed-five-years-dover-guns-knives-nca","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T15:45:47Z","webTitle":"Man found with guns and knives at Dover jailed for five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/27/jaromir-hrbek-jailed-five-years-dover-guns-knives-nca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/27/jaromir-hrbek-jailed-five-years-dover-guns-knives-nca","fields":{"headline":"Man found with guns and knives at Dover jailed for five years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A man has been sentenced to five years in prison after a cache of weapons, including pistols, a bow and arrow, machete and knuckle-duster, was found hidden in his van. Jaromir Hrbek, 59, was stopped last month as he drove through the port of Dover in his Peugeot Expert. A magazine of ammunition was discovered in the driver’s door compartment, but Hrbek, who said he had been to visit his daughter in Edinburgh, denied there was anything else in the vehicle. He told the officers that he had a gun for which he held a licence, but it was at his home in the Czech Republic. However, on searching the van, officers discovered a loaded 9mm Walther PPK in the back of the passenger seat. Hrbek told the officials his lifestyle was “a bit chaotic” because he was getting divorced and he had forgotten that he placed the gun there. He was arrested and cautioned. The officers continued their search, uncovering a bow with arrows, five knives, including a 12-inch blade, a machete, a knuckle-duster, and a loaded Walther PPQ pistol wrapped in a paper bag, then hidden in the vehicle’s frame. They also found more ammunition, including 50 9mm Luger cartridges and 50 .22 cartridges. The National Crime Agency, which led the investigation, described the haul as a “veritable arsenal”. Hrbek remained silent in an interview, but was jailed at Canterbury crown court on Tuesday after admitting possession of a firearm and offensive weapons. On Wednesday, Richard Bowen, the NCA senior investigating officer, said the British public faced a significant threat from firearms-related crime. “Hrbek’s Peugeot van was a veritable arsenal,” he said. “This National Crime Agency investigation has taken all those weapons out of circulation and I applaud the Border Force officers who stopped the vehicle and questioned Hrbek.” Last year, police seized more than 800 potentially lethal weapons during a month-long operation designed to prevent terrorists and criminals from gaining access to illegal firearms, amid fears of a Paris-style gun attack on the streets of Britain. The haul included a fully loaded AK-47, one of 11 assault rifles seized, a Skorpion submachine gun, two machine guns and 4,385 rounds of ammunition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/352","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T23:00:16Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 352","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/352","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/352","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 352","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/27/billy-hatton-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T15:55:22Z","webTitle":"Billy Hatton obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/27/billy-hatton-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/27/billy-hatton-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Billy Hatton obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Billy Hatton, who has died aged 76, was the bass player and harmony singer with the Fourmost, the Liverpool beat group signed in 1963 with the Beatles manager Brian Epstein’s NEMS company. Their first hits, Hello Little Girl and I’m In Love, released later that year, were produced by George Martin and written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Hatton’s relationship with Lennon was strained, however, as he had stopped the Beatle from beating up the Cavern Club’s DJ Bob Wooler at Paul McCartney’s 21st birthday party. “Lennon deserved a smack, no doubt about that,” Hatton said, “but someone shouted out: ‘Billy, if you hit him, your career will be over!’” The Fourmost made the Top 10 in April 1964 with the up-tempo A Little Loving, then had a record-breaking run, from June to December that year, in the Startime revue at the London Palladium with Tommy Cooper, Cilla Black and Frankie Vaughan, and appeared in the film Ferry Cross the Mersey (1965). Three further singles made the Top 40, and their versatility was showcased on the album First and Fourmost (1965). The group’s promotion of their cover of the Four Tops’ Baby I Need Your Loving on Ready Steady Go! was helped when an enthusiastic fan made a grab at Hatton on live TV. Hatton had a love for American cars, and on the back of this success swapped his old Ford Prefect for a Mercury Monterey, which created a sensation when he took it home to Liverpool. Son of Harry, a fireman, and Alice, Hatton was born in a terraced house in the Dingle area of Liverpool. In kindergarten, his playmates were Ronnie Wycherley (later Billy Fury) and Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr). During his teens, Hatton and Wycherley played guitars together and he encouraged Wycherley to write songs and to perform. “He was a sexy sod, wasn’t he?” recalled Hatton, “He would walk into a party and all the girls would turn into blobs of oil. I was lucky to be with him.” Hatton himself sang and played the guitar in a country band and then with the Four Jays. In 1962 they were Epstein’s second choice to sign, after the Beatles, but there were problems. Their lead singer and guitarist, Brian O’Hara, was studying accountancy; the rhythm guitarist, Mike Millward, worked for a solicitor; the drummer, Dave Lovelady, had his sights on being an architect; and Hatton was serving an apprenticeship with the Atomic Energy Authority in Cheshire. They were regarded as the brainiest group on Merseyside and they did not want to throw away their prospects for the slim chance of a hit record. For the time being, they remained on Merseyside and played in their spare time. “We never wanted to just stand there and sing,” said Hatton, and they developed a fast-moving act which included comedy routines and a lengthy version of September in the Rain, packed with impersonations. The Beatles had them as special guests for their fan club night at the Cavern in April 1962. Once the NEMS artists were having hit records, Epstein approached the Four Jays again. By then, both O’Hara and Hatton had passed their examinations and they turned fully professional as musicians, securing a record contract with Parlophone. Wooler suggested a name change to the Fourmost. For all their early success, Hatton lacked confidence and in his private life he never wanted responsibility. He recognised this as a flaw and said he regretted not marrying his onetime girlfriend, Nicky Stevens, singer with the pop group Brotherhood of Man. In later years Hatton mostly worked as a security officer on Merseyside but he often played with Dave Lovelady and Joey Bower as Clouds and later the Original Fourmost. In 2008, they lost a court case to a tribute band calling themselves the Fourmost. “We made those records, we established the name,” Hatton railed. “Doesn’t that count for anything?” He was a popular figure in Liverpool, especially in the Roscoe Head, the pub he called his office. His final television appearance was with the Hairy Bikers in their Liverpool episode of The Pubs That Built Britain (2016). “I’ve had a good life,” Hatton told me. “I never thought I would even get on TV with my spikey nose.” He is survived by his sister, Ada. • William Henry Hatton, guitarist and singer, born 9 June 1941; died 19 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/03/british-gas-broke-into-flat-changed-meter","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"British Gas broke into my flat and changed the meter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/03/british-gas-broke-into-flat-changed-meter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/03/british-gas-broke-into-flat-changed-meter","fields":{"headline":"British Gas broke into my flat and changed the meter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I have spent months trying to get British Gas to sort out a meter problem in an empty flat we are renovating.

However, no one turned up for the agreed appointment. They did call unannounced two weeks later, but of course I wasn’t there.

In doing so, he is effectively going to war with some of the most powerful Labour councils. Rent controls in cities, a tax on landbanking by big developers, and forcing slumlords to bring their homes up to scratch: in what was easily the best speech Jeremy Corbyn has made as party leader, the strongest section was on housing. Within minutes, he moved Labour policy forward by miles. While the general election manifesto had been disappointingly slight on housing – especially when set against his rhetoric – these remarks change all that. They also set Westminster Labour squarely against Labour local authorities. When Corbyn began, “After Grenfell we must think again about what are called regeneration schemes”, many Labour council leaders in the audience must have had a start. For decades, Labour councils, especially in London, have invited in big developers to “regenerate” public housing estates. What follows fits a wearily familar pattern. Families are booted out of their homes, the bulldozers tear down publicly owned property, and on the ruins are erected hundreds of expensive flats and a risible number of “affordable” homes. The developer makes their mark-up, the council gets some loose change, and the Evening Standard has something to fill its property pages. Everyone’s a winner – apart from those now deemed too poor to live in their former homes. This is what the academic Paul Watt has termed state-led gentrification, and it applies to the giant Aylesbury estate in Southwark, Cressingham Gardens in Lambeth, Love Lane in Haringey, and the Ferrier in Greenwich. And on and on: the activist group Architects for Social Housing has identified 195 council estates in the 21 Labour-run London boroughs that have been through this process, are going through it, or are faced with it. The result, as Corbyn put it on Wednesday, is “forced gentrification and social cleansing, as private developers move in and tenants and leaseholders are moved out”. He could have added: as tenants and leaseholders of Labour councils are turfed out by the party many of them have voted for all their lives. In 2014, Sophie Robinson-Tillett and I investigated this process at the giant Woodberry Down estate in Hackney. We spoke to pensioners living in exile from their children, old ladies who had seen their communities ripped apart and their backyards turned into smack dens. In the process, the developer told us, it would provide 1,177 “affordable” homes. The number of social-rented homes would drop from 1,555 to 1,088. The London Borough of Hackney has 13,000 applicants on its housing waiting list. Corbyn’s response is twofold: if elected to government, he will compel councils to ballot all tenants and leaseholders before any regeneration. Second, all tenants on a redeveloped site will be entitled to move back to the same estate, on the same terms and conditions. “No social cleansing, no jacking up rents, no exorbitant ground rents.” Taken together, the two promises would form a huge deal for any council estate facing the prospect of redevelopment. Imagine! Not just gerrymandered consultations but an actual vote. Not just councillor promises but legally enshrined protection. Some regeneration schemes would be killed at blueprint. But Corbyn’s words also matter now – because the leader is taking sides against his own municipal leaders. His remarks are almost certainly miles from the estate-renewal scheme Sadiq Khan (who this week claimed “I love Jeremy Corbyn. We all love Jeremy Corbyn”) is drawing up in London’s City Hall. In Haringey, the Labour leadership is pushing ahead with a plan to shunt housing estates, school buildings, libraries and other public property into a £2bn private fund – despite the opposition of local Labour MPs, the local trade unions, constituency parties and even many Labour councillors. The plan has sent the local Labour movement into a bitter civil war. Corbyn has effectively taken sides in that war – and it is against council leader Claire Kober. Imagine how many times she and her lieutenants will now have to defend themselves against the words of their own party leader and against the policy of their own party. Corbyn ended his short section on housing with a promise of more policy to come within a year. Good. I’d like to see more money made available to build social housing, and a reflection of how our crocked housing market reflects an equally lopsided national economy – in which nearly all the chips are placed on the capital. But this is a big and bold move. It would have been hard to imagine Corbyn making it before this June, and the election that entrenched his leadership. And it is a sign that he and his team plan to use the new powers they have."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/05/country-diary-strange-spiders-and-help-from-the-web","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T04:30:14Z","webTitle":"Country diary: strange spiders and help from the web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/country-diary-strange-spiders-and-help-from-the-web","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/05/country-diary-strange-spiders-and-help-from-the-web","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: strange spiders and help from the web","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We may be living in a golden age for natural historians. The old naturalists’ field clubs, rooted in the Victorian passion for collecting and sharing knowledge of flora and fauna, may be in decline, but, thanks to social media, it has never been easier to correspond with a helpful expert when you need one. Post a picture of, say, an unfamiliar spider on the internet and it’s likely that someone out there will identify it for you. That’s what happened when I uploaded a picture of what I thought was the harvestman Leiobunum rotundum. Within a day an expert in the study of these arachnids – distinguished from true spiders by their globular bodies – informed me that it was something more interesting: Opilio canestrinii. This invasive species from Italy, subtly distinguished from my mistaken identification by its exceptionally long black legs and orange knee joints, was first found in Essex in 1999. Since then it has strode with remarkable speed through much of Britain, and it’s the second alien harvestman species to colonise our garden. I first encountered the other – the fork-pedipalped harvestman Dicranopalpus ramosus three years ago – when I reached for the greenhouse door handle where it was resting. I came within a whisker of squashing it. Once seen, this squat-bodied Moroccan species, which was first recorded in Bournemouth in 1957 and has steadily spread northwards, is unforgettable. Unlike our native species, which rest with their eight legs arrayed at points of the compass, it aligns its limbs as parallel as railway tracks on opposite sides of its body. It has been suggested this arrangement allows it to sit comfortably along slender twigs, making it hard to spot. Harvestmen hold a strange kind of fascination, with their blobby bodies and beady black eyes mounted in a turret on their back. Watch them moving speedily over rough terrain, slung between those gangly struts, and these nocturnal predators bring to mind the Martian fighting machines in HG Wells’s The War of the Worlds. There is no death ray, but they have been known to hunt in a chilling way, arranging their feet as a palisade to corral prey then drop on it with pile-driver force.

The song is not bad: lazily funky organ stabs undercut Moz warbling about how we should all shut out the modern world by building a pillow fort, sticking our fingers in our ears and shouting “LA LA LA!” An admittedly short-term solution to society’s ills, but an effective one.

In a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of the independence of the Bank of England, the prime minister will insist that there are benefits from an open and innovative economy – provided it is reformed and properly regulated. “A free-market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created,” May will say. “It was the new combination which led societies out of darkness and stagnation and into the light of the modern age. It is unquestionably the best, and indeed the only sustainable, means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country.” May has favoured a more interventionist approach since succeeding David Cameron as prime minister in July 2016, announcing support for an industrial strategy and saying that her mission was to create a Britain that worked for those “just about managing” as well as the better off. But living standards have been falling this year as a result of wages failing to keep pace with the price increases caused by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote 15 months ago, leaving the government vulnerable to attacks from Labour on its handling of the economy. In a sideswipe at Corbyn likely to be followed by a more concerted assault at next week’s Conservative party conference in Manchester, the prime minister will attack an ideological approach to running the economy. “We should never forget that raising the living standards, and protecting the jobs, of ordinary working people is the central aim of all economic policy. Helping each generation to live longer, fuller, more secure lives than the one which went before them. Not serving an abstract doctrine or an ideological concept, but serving the real interests of the British people.” The prime minister will contrast her belief in open and innovative markets with the more state-dominated approach favoured by Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor at this week’s Labour party conference. Corbyn believes the hung parliament that resulted from June’s general election demonstrates that voters have tired of the spending cuts that have formed a central part of economic policy since 2010. May’s government has slowed the pace of deficit reduction and on current plans it will take until the middle of the next decade for the budget to be balanced. But she is expected to say that it would not be in the best interests of working people to abandon deficit reduction altogether and that a balanced approach is needed. “That means continuing to deal with our debts, so that our economy can remain strong and we can protect people’s jobs. At the same time, it means investing in our vital public services, like schools and hospitals, which our successful management of the economy has made possible. “To abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people. Ultimately, that would mean less money for the public services we all rely on.” May began her career at the Bank of England 40 years ago, and her speech will also discuss how the nature of central banking has changed over the past 30 years with its new defining characteristics being “openness and transparency”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/08/tim-minchin-the-world-feels-a-bit-post-jokes","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Tim Minchin: ‘The world feels a bit post-jokes’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/tim-minchin-the-world-feels-a-bit-post-jokes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/08/tim-minchin-the-world-feels-a-bit-post-jokes","fields":{"headline":"Tim Minchin: ‘The world feels a bit post-jokes’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Australian composer and comedian Tim Minchin, 42, was born in Northampton but raised in his parents’ native Perth. After an award-winning comedy career, he wrote the music and lyrics for the Royal Shakespeare Company’s global hit musical Matilda, followed by the stage musical adaptation of Groundhog Day. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Sarah, a social worker, and their two children. Tell us about your new children’s book, When I Grow Up, which is based on the lyrics of the song from Matilda. It’s awesome – I didn’t even have to do anything [laughs]. That’s the incredible thing about Matilda, it keeps manifesting itself in different ways. It’s profoundly gratifying to have something else beautiful put into the world that was sparked by something you wrote eight years ago. Did you test the book on your own children? I’ve shown them it, but my kids are pretty unimpressed by me. They’ve never seen me do comedy or a concert. All they know is that I do “quiet work” or “loud work”. Quiet work is writing, loud work is performing. They’ll ask: “Are you going out, Dad?” and I say: “Yeah, I’ve got loud work tonight.” Do your kids know you’re famous? Not really. The horrible F-word doesn’t get used in our house. If someone recognises me and the kids ask why, I just say they know my work. One of the reasons we moved to LA four years ago to make an animated film [musical comedy Larrikins, which was recently cancelled by DreamWorks after Minchin worked on it for several years] was to arrest any chance of me becoming too well-known. And that really fucking worked. It worked too well. I screwed my own career. I sometimes think: “What have I done? I’d just done an orchestral tour and could’ve spent the last four years being a rock star rather than talking to studio execs.” I’m guessing your Hollywood experience hasn’t been good? You could say that. I’m slowly recovering from the slings and arrows of outrageous Americans. The film getting shut down was awful. It really knocked me sideways. I’m grieving the loss of time and art. Don’t worry, though – I know I’m banging on, sounding bitter and spoiled, when I’m actually the most privileged person in the world. So you’re swapping America for Australia? Yes, we’re moving to Sydney at Christmas. It was always the plan to go home for when my daughter starts high school. You played some live gigs in London this week. Do you miss it here? Very much. London’s my favourite place. I lived in Crouch End for years and come back as much as I possibly can. I miss touring, too. The plan for next year is to get back into it and create a new live show. I’m interested in how the world’s changed since I last properly did comedy in 2010. What’s been your view of that from over in LA? Pretty bleak. It feels a bit post-jokes. Maybe “Post-Jokes Jokes” should be the name of my next live show. In this post-factual era, the horse called “evidence” seems to have bolted. That horse is in the knacker’s yard. California is obviously a liberal heartland but I really have a problem with this country. They call it populism, but it’s just nationalism. In a global world, nationalism is a fantasy and it’s poison. It used to be appropriate but it’s not any more and we haven’t learned that lesson yet. Trump is a nationalist. Brexit wouldn’t have got across the line without nationalistic philosophies. Even Australia’s stubbornness about gay marriage, which is as upsetting as everything else at the moment, is a sort of nationalism. You recently posted a song on social media titled I Still Call Australia Homophobic. How would you feel going to live there if the law doesn’t change? I have to believe it will get passed, but the plebiscite has already done its damage. The stupid fucking postal survey [to gauge public opinion] is just the prime minister trying to placate these idiots who are on his back, but it’s indistinguishable from deliberately trying to hurt the LGBT population. Families with same-sex parents have spent six months with this bigoted shit coming through their letterbox. The whole disgusting circus makes me want to scream. Whichever way the vote goes, these people have revealed themselves. I don’t think they’re evil, it just means we’ve got a long way to go. Is there still a film version of Matilda in the pipeline? Yeah, but it’s a pretty thin pipe, so we’ll be squeezing our way through it for a long time. Bertie Carvel, who played Miss Trunchbull in Matilda on stage, is currently causing a stir in BBC drama Doctor Foster… Bertie’s an incredible actor. He can go from evil headmistress to sexy bastard. Now he’s Rupert Murdoch in Ink. He’s a rare creature who takes his parts very seriously and makes careful decisions about what he’ll do next. It takes strength to run your career like that. Your Groundhog Day musical just closed on Broadway. Is it heading back to the West End? It’s my favourite thing I’ve ever been involved in. I’m very proud of it. Hopefully it’ll be back there soon and we can’t wait. It went down well in New York – critically acclaimed, nominated for seven Tonys, ran for six months on Broadway – but it’s a tough town at the moment. There’s a post-Hamilton bottleneck so it’s a slaughterhouse of competition, like the Red Wedding from Game of Thrones. Aren’t you also about to join Robin Hood’s Merry Men? I’m playing Friar Tuck in a crazy big Robin Hood reboot that comes out next autumn with Jamie Foxx and Taron Egerton. That’s going to change my life again. Or maybe it’ll sink without trace (laughs). What else are you up to at the moment? Loads of bitty things. You “take meetings” in LA and I’ve been taking meetings about acting gigs. I wanted to stay behind the camera for ages but now I’m considering some sort of comedy vehicle. I’m writing a new, non-comedy album. I’m about to shoot a still-embargoed TV show in the UK, which I can’t tell you about or I’d have to kill you. There’s some films I’m writing songs for. So I’ve got my fingers in more pies than a Bake Off contestant. I’ve always been like that. One of the great heartbreaks of the last few years is that I let myself get sucked into this massive project. All my eggs were in one basket, whereas my favourite thing about my career is its variety. I saw you described recently as “the world’s favourite ginger”. Are you? Trouble is, I’m not a real ginger. I’m just a ginger-bearded, pale-skinned, strawberry blond. I have a ginger vibe about me but can’t put myself in the Damian Lewis/Ed Sheeran/Rupert Grint league. I’d feel fraudulent. I don’t reckon I’m in the top 20, if for no other reason than a basic lack of red pigment. • When I Grow Up by Tim Minchin, illustrated by Steve Antony, is published by Scholastic (£12.99).

But it might not mean a thing in 2018. Those in the populist Steve Bannon wing of the conservative coalition already see Moore’s victory as a sign of a rightwing uprising before next year’s midterms, as a wave of primaries unseats those creatures of the DC swamp they see as insufficiently loyal to Donald Trump’s agenda. However, it is not clear that Moore’s win will lead to quite such sweeping changes. Moore is as sui generis a product of the Yellowhammer State as white barbecue sauce and Bear Bryant. The social conservative firebrand has been an institution in the state’s politics for nearly two decades. He has twice won election to be chief justice of the state’s supreme court and twice been removed from office for defying federal courts; first in 2003 for refusing to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments from the Alabama judicial building and then, in 2016, over his defiance of the supreme court ruling legalizing gay marriage. In between he has run twice for governor and once for president and built a hardcore devoted following in the state. His opponent, former state attorney general Strange, was appointed to the Senate in January by Republican governor Robert Bentley, whom he was investigating for criminal efforts to conceal an extramarital affair. Bentley has since resigned and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors. Even in a state where political corruption has long been endemic, the appointment – which followed Jeff Sessions’ elevation to the role of attorney general – raised eyebrows. The two faced off in an odd-year special election runoff where turnout was low and few voters were engaged. With Bannonite populists already targeting Republican incumbents in Senate seats in Nevada, Arizona and Mississippi, the question is: did these unique local factors dominate the race, or can Republican primaries now be successfully nationalized in opposition to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell? One Bannon ally joked to the Guardian on Tuesday night that “Mitch McConnell in a Republican primary is now what Nancy Pelosi is in general elections for Democrats”. However, those races will be held under far different circumstances. Turnout is likely to be higher in an election-year primary and against incumbents who have actually won their Senate seat – unlike Strange. Further, it is rare that any candidate, let alone a primary challenger, has the level of name recognition that Moore has in Alabama. But Moore’s win on Tuesday sets the stage for many of these races in 2018. The outsider won despite being outspent 10 to one and his opponent receiving an endorsement, albeit a somewhat lukewarm one, from Trump. Already Republicans aiming to emulate his insurgent bid are taking heart from Moore’s win. Mississippi state senator Chris McDaniel, who narrowly lost to incumbent Republican Thad Cochran in 2014, has already said Moore’s victory makes it more likely that he will challenge incumbent Roger Wicker in 2018. McDaniel even attended Moore’s election-eve rally along with several other potential candidates in his mode, including Paul Nehlen, the Republican who is mounting his second longshot bid against speaker Paul Ryan in 2018. It is unclear if candidates in this mold will be able to succeed in 2018. After all, despite the endorsements of figures like Bannon and Sarah Palin, not even Moore was a pure Trumpian populist. His roots in social conservatism and predilection for quoting scripture and condemning “sodomy” firmly rooted Moore in a different faction of the party. His victory will give fellow outsider candidates the hope that an anti-incumbency message bashing the congressional Republican leadership in 2018 can work – but they will have to fight their campaigns on far different and likely more unfavorable terrain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/28/miley-cyrus-younger-now-review-rca","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T20:30:06Z","webTitle":"Miley Cyrus: Younger Now review – big-hearted country-pop from Miley v4.0","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/miley-cyrus-younger-now-review-rca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/28/miley-cyrus-younger-now-review-rca","fields":{"headline":"Miley Cyrus: Younger Now review – big-hearted country-pop from Miley v4.0","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘No one stays the same,” sings Miley Cyrus on the excellent title track of her sixth studio album, surely referring to a career of reinventions from Disney child star to Wrecking Ball-era sledgehammer-licking controversies to Dead Petz’s psychedelic weirdness.

In Malibu, she mourns the loss of an ordinary childhood (“I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean”), while Miss You So Much seems to take a sly pop at the music industry (“You can drink my blood”). Elsewhere, there are teary anthems; Rainbowland pairs her with her godmother, Dolly Parton, for a rumbustious Southern stomp; while the confessional I Would Die for You would fit on to Beth Orton’s Central Reservation.

Schäuble, 75, was asked to take on the role by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is keen on someone with authority and experience to steer future debate in the Bundestag after the success in Sunday’s election of the rightwing radical Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). The AfD is due to take up 94 seats in the house, having secured 12.6% of the vote, and its leadership has pledged to shake up the debating culture in the Bundestag, making it considerably rowdier than the calm and consensus-based mood that has characterised it in the past. The role of speaker has been empty since Norbert Lammert, a veteran CDU MP, recently announced he would retire at the end of the last parliamentary term. In terms of protocol it ranks second only to that of federal president, and ahead of the chancellor, but in reality it is considerably less powerful than his current post. Schäuble, a lawyer by training, is the longest-serving MP in the Bundestag, having been elected in 1972. Once one of Merkel’s staunchest rivals, he has since become one of her closest confidantes as well as the most experienced and high-profile minister in her cabinet. He has been finance minister since 2009 and is held in high regard in Germany, particularly by the conservative base, who revere him for acting in Germany’s interests as the dogged protector of austerity economics in the eurozone. He is also admired at home for his insistence – some would say obsession – with a balanced budget or the “black zero”. Germany today has a record budget surplus. But elsewhere he is a hugely controversial figure, particularly in Greece and in Ireland, where he has often faced criticism for his handling of the euro crisis that has dominated almost his entire time as finance minister. Schäuble has yet to respond to the reports of his new appointment, but it was confirmed on Wednesday afternoon by Volker Kauder, the chairman of the CDU parliamentary bloc. Those close to him have suggested in the past he would not favour the role because it does not involve active policymaking. Others have suggested that health concerns may have persuaded him it is time to switch to a slightly less demanding role. But commentators say the role will change considerably with the arrival of AfD. The question of who will replace him as finance minister has yet to be even hinted at by the government. As Merkel, the leader of the Christian Democrats, began complicated talks this week with her sister party, the Christian Social Union, the pro-business FDP and the Greens over a possible coalition, the future composition of the new government remains open. But it has been widely speculated that in return for entering a coalition with Merkel, the FDP will want to have control of the finance ministry, a position it has secured in past coalitions with the CDU. However, given that the FDP has so far firmly resisted plans by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to overhaul the eurozone – to which Merkel has given her tacit backing – an FDP finance minister could greatly complicate her fourth term in office. Shortly after leading negotiations for the reunification of East and West Germany in October 1990, Schäuble, a father of four who has been married since 1969, was left paralysed by an assassination attempt in which he was shot in the spine and face three times. He has used a wheelchair ever since. Within three months of the attack he was back at work as interior minister. In 2010 there were serious concerns for his health after he suffered complications from an earlier operation, and Merkel has twice rejected his offer to step down over his health."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/01/turner-prize-2017-shortlist-hurvin-anderson-lubaina-himid-andrea-buttner-rosalind-nashashibi","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T06:59:11Z","webTitle":"Bang a drum for the Turner’s coming of age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/01/turner-prize-2017-shortlist-hurvin-anderson-lubaina-himid-andrea-buttner-rosalind-nashashibi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/01/turner-prize-2017-shortlist-hurvin-anderson-lubaina-himid-andrea-buttner-rosalind-nashashibi","fields":{"headline":"Bang a drum for the Turner’s coming of age","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Good news from the north. Lifting the age bar has had dramatic effects on the Turner prize. Now that it’s no longer restricted to the under-50s, with all the usual star-making and specious controversy of the last two decades, the shortlist is far more varied and mature. Painting, sculpture, installation, collage, film and print are all on display in an absorbing and graciously presented show at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull. This is immediately more representative of the art scene in Britain today. And more than that, the work feels out-turned, rather than wilfully inaccessible or self-involved; all four artists are alive to the ebb of flow of other people’s lives and to the tide of international history. Hurvin Anderson (born Birmingham, 1965) looks both backwards and forwards with a sequence of metaphysical post-pop paintings of his father’s barber’s shop in the Midlands and lush landscapes of their ancestral Jamaica as it exists in his imagination. Here’s a customer in a not-quite shop, where the floor falls away and the ceiling opens skywards, in a cape that might be made of African fabric. Is he dreaming of Jamaica? Is he actually black? The image deflects all answers in its strange conflation of contradictory visual layers. Another painting in the series shows black and white photographs pinned to the mirror above a miniature skyline of hairdresser’s bottles. Probably Muhammad Ali, possibly Martin Luther King: you deduce the identity from the form or pose, until both fade into uncertainty and you can’t even recognise these black heroes. Is it OK to Be Black? asks the title. Anderson alludes to art as well as politics – Morandi bottles and Mondrian abstractions in the rectilinear photos and mirrors; colour field painting and Peter Doig in his dripping Caribbean landscapes. His art swithers between figuration and abstraction. And always there is the sense of something hidden, something behind what you see: another life, another place. This is less compelling in the landscapes, overlaid with gigantic palm fronds and the mesh fences through which an outsider might view them. But it’s languidly pervasive in the shop scenes, where figures (and the artist himself, one senses) truly seem to exist in a floating world. What is it to be a black painter? Lubaina Himid (born Zanzibar, 1954) is showing works from her Oxford and Nottingham shows earlier this year. They are, I fear, the wrong ones. Her partial redactions of old Guardian covers, so that they show up what she regards as black stereotyping, are like an agitprop slide show. Her 18th-century bone china service, overpainted with scenes of slavery and the supposed perils of abolition, is an apt period piece, but it is overdone and its piquancy thus short-lived. Indeed the strongest work here, other than the recent and marvellously dreamlike painting of an encounter between four black men and a mythological bird-woman in a curious seaborne chamber, which touches on the tragic journey of a slave ship, is the huge installation A Fashionable Marriage. Life-sized figures cut out of plywood preen, gawp and guffaw across a raised stage: a Georgian toff with a ruff of filthy rubber gloves, in memory of Hogarth (whose Marriage à la Mode is reprised and updated here); Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as the fated lovers; and looking on, as one of the two black servants in Hogarth’s original, Himid’s alter ego in modern dress. It is an uproarious send-up of 80s politics and art through the theatrical medium she has made her own. Indeed it was created in 1986. At least this exhilarating parade is the artist’s own work, however dated. Andrea Büttner (born Stuttgart, 1972) has simply borrowed an enormous photo display from the Peace Library in Berlin and let it run through more than one gallery. Presented rather crudely, like a series of parish noticeboards, this is nonetheless a riveting examination of the French philosopher Simone Weil’s ideas on rootedness, belonging and the human heart, accompanied – one might say illustrated, except the relationship is far deeper – by the photographs of August Sander, André Kertész and others. What we might not be able to imagine – the soul, the Holocaust, the universe – is carried here in these magnificent images. Weil’s concern for the poor is, I suppose, Büttner’s own theme. It is in the photographs of old master paintings of beggars displayed on tables so low you are required – ostentatious tactic – to bend down to see this priceless high art. It is in the large and heavy-handed woodcuts she has derived from Ernst Barlach’s 1919 statue Cloaked Beggarwoman, embodying German shame and defeatism after the first world war. Coarsest of all, it is in the greasy finger swipes made on a mobile phone that the artist has had painstakingly transformed into enormous etchings that resemble ab-ex brushstrokes; a counterproductive waste of human labour, never mind money. Büttner’s 2007 film about Carmelite nuns was a much stronger candidate for the prize, which will be awarded in a live TV ceremony on 5 December. Indeed one concern about the new age rules is that the prize may start to look backwards, as in Himid’s case, to work from the long ago past. But the judges base their shortlist strictly on the exhibitions they have seen in the previous year; in this respect, nothing has changed. And rather like the Man Booker, often thought to reward the wrong novel in a writer’s output, so the Turner prize sometimes alights on the wrong phase or works in an artist’s career. And so it seems for Rosalind Nashashibi, whose spellbinding films I always seek out, and who has long been one of Britain’s best artists. Nashashibi (born Croydon, 1973) is showing two films. Electrical Gaza employs many characteristic methods, fusing narrative techniques with documentary footage, staging occasional scenes, interrupting vérité with fragments of animation. Here, she captures the self-contained life of Gaza, removed from the world yet somehow enchanted: shops selling sweets and wedding dresses; cars stopping so that friends can leap out and hug one another; streets that end in sparkling blue sea, where – unforgettable image – horses are bathed in the waves. It could be a seaside idyll were it not for the fearful crowds queuing at the Rafah border as the gates clang shut, or the Hamas youth march cutting straight across the scene. Alleys end in roadblocks, cars are forced to reverse down streets and as the camera rises high to look down on the blasted landscape, revealing traces of unexplained violence, Benjamin Britten’s Fanfare from Les Illuminations surges on the soundtrack, Rimbaud’s ironic phrase “Only I have the key to this savage parade” ringing out as if describing the ultimate mystery of Gaza. The film is incomplete. Nashashibi was forced to leave by Israeli incursions and my sense is that the piece might have been as good as her best work given more time. But as it is, she is showing another film about a secluded enclave, this time a compound in Guatemala where two artists live together, an elderly mother and her daughter. Whose work is whose? Are we inside or out? The women speak of being imprisoned here, once, and it feels as if they still are, only now by choice. Glowing red interiors give way to dense green gardens, threatened by snakes and the jungle beyond. Villagers arrive with food, make lunch, keep the artists afloat. How would the women survive without them – or without each other? What will the mother do when the daughter leaves on holiday? What will the daughter do when the mother dies? Nahashibi takes us into this slow, mesmerising existence in a film without narration, or even much dialogue, yet profound as any tragedy. It’s only half of her show, but this work alone deserves the Turner prize. • At Ferens Art Gallery, Hull, until 7 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/27/classical-architecture-has-deep-roots-in-england","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T18:29:15Z","webTitle":"Classical architecture has deep roots in England | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/27/classical-architecture-has-deep-roots-in-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/27/classical-architecture-has-deep-roots-in-england","fields":{"headline":"Classical architecture has deep roots in England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Richard Rogers says classicism is an odd choice of architectural style for the Prince of Wales to promote as it does not have “deep roots in England” (Report, 23 September). Rogers is misinformed. Classical architecture came to Britain with the Romans two millennia ago. Elements of classicism re-emerged early in the 16th century in Henry VII’s tomb at Westminster and under Elizabeth I (to name but two examples) at Longleat and Caius, Cambridge. Four hundred years ago, Inigo Jones introduced the classical style of the Italian Renaissance in an unadulterated form. What deeper roots does Rogers want? Certainly the classical style has deeper roots than his modernism – a mere 80 or so years old in the UK and hardly any more indigenous than the classicism he rejects.

Even so, the stylistically bold approach that director Midi Z brings to the struggle of Lianqing and Guo, the boy who loves her, sets this apart. A combination of tender details – the way Guo carefully picks the fibres from his girlfriend’s skin after a gruelling shift at the factory – and a strikingly surreal approach to a scene in which Lianqing prostitutes herself for the first time makes this unflinching picture a notable addition to the ever-swelling list of films that deal with migration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/27/why-womens-golf-could-desperately-use-an-andy-murray","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T15:00:23Z","webTitle":"Why women's golf could desperately use an Andy Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/27/why-womens-golf-could-desperately-use-an-andy-murray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/27/why-womens-golf-could-desperately-use-an-andy-murray","fields":{"headline":"Why women's golf could desperately use an Andy Murray","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week Andy Murray wrote an op-ed for the BBC highlighting the reasons why he’s so outspoken on behalf of women’s tennis. My heart, along with other women in sports, swooned over this, and in particular, my heart skipped a beat when he wrote, “Anyone who has spent any time with any of the top women will know that they make those same sacrifices and are as determined and committed to winning as any of the top men on the tour.” Murray embodies what a male advocate for women’s sports should be. Recently he shot down a reporter when he incorrectly stated that Sam Querrey was the first US player to reach the semi-finals of Wimbledon since 2009, to which Murray replied, “Male player.” The confused reporter said, “I beg your pardon?” Murray replied again, “Male player.” When he won gold for the second time in Rio last year, he corrected BBC commentator John Inverdale when he congratulated Murray on being the first to win two gold medals in tennis. “I think Venus and Serena have won about four each,” he replied. Did I mention that I love this man? As someone who played a short while on the LPGA circuit and developmental tours, I can speak to the sacrifices and hard work that my colleagues made in order to compete. I can also speak to the casual sexism we often faced, be it from spectators or when we played with sponsors of the tournaments before competition began. Common questions asked: “Do you hit with ladies’ shafts?” The answer is no, and I hit it further than you. “Do you hit from the ladies’ tees?” The answer is also no. “Would you sleep with someone so they’d sponsor you?” This is how desperate some of the men thought we were. “Do women hook up with each other on tour?” Can you imagine this same question being asked to PGA Tour players? The last question, in particular, always rubbed me the wrong way because it infuriated me to think about all the women I played on tour with and how our hard work was being reduced to being asked questions about who we sleep with. Now, in my next career as a sports journalist, I write and think about women’s golf a lot. But the biggest question I find myself trying to answer is how to get people to take us more seriously. While better and more equal media coverage is an essential part to providing more legitimacy to women’s golf – I’m looking at you Golf Magazine and Golf Digest – I’m beginning to believe that women’s golf needs its own version of an Andy Murray. Yes, the LPGA needs a crusader, preferably a big name like Rory McIlroy or Jordan Spieth, to stand up and say, “Y’all should be paying attention to women’s golf because they are amazingly talented athletes.” The question remains, how would they advocate? Well, first, they could talk about how women golfers don’t receive enough credit. For instance, they could bring up the fact that Lydia Ko, who was the world No1 at 17 years-old, has 19 professional wins, won silver at the Rio Olympics and has never been on the cover of any major golf publication. PGA Tour players could attend women’s golf tournaments and show support from the sidelines, the same support the women give when they attend PGA Tour events. The men could also advocate for equal pay in the US Open, a topic I wrote on, and something Murray has advocated for in tennis: “I think there should be equal pay, 100%, at all combined events. Crowds are coming to watch the women, as well. The thing doesn’t stack up. It changes depending on the matches. Men’s tennis has been lucky over the last nine or 10 years with the players they’ve had. That’s great, but the whole of tennis should capitalize on it, not just the men’s game.” Now, before some of you trample all over me, I understand the nuances between tennis and golf. Yes, the LPGA and PGA aren’t ran by the same organization. Yes, men and women in golf don’t play the same venues. I. Get. It. However, these nuances should not preclude male players from showing support and helping elevate women’s golf to receive more support. It should not keep them from talking about how male only golf clubs still exist, or that even the top players on the LPGA still don’t have sponsors or get paid by equipment companies. The strongest response I’ve heard in favor of women’s golf is when McIlroy spoke out against Muirfield Golf Club’s men’s-only membership policy after they changed the policy. Even then, his response did not directly speak on behalf of professional women’s golf. Truth is, I don’t even know if many of the PGA Tour players know who LPGA golfers are, or if they watch women’s golf. While there are players on the PGA Tour who I know are friends with LPGA players, I fail to see the men truly use their platforms to lift up the women golfers they are close to. Women’s golf has grown immensely over the last seven years under the leadership of LPGA commissioner Mike Whan, and this year, the Solheim Cup had the largest TV viewership in women’s golf history. And they’ve accomplished this without male golfers showing any outward love and support. Now imagine how women’s golf could grow if PGA players stepped up offered their voice to calling out sexism in golf media or called out to sponsors to support women’s golf? Would it change much? Who knows. But it would be fun to find out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2017/nov/01/borneo-voluntourism-holiday-orangutan-foundation","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-01T12:41:34Z","webTitle":"Monkeying around in Borneo: a voluntourism trip with a difference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/nov/01/borneo-voluntourism-holiday-orangutan-foundation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/nov/01/borneo-voluntourism-holiday-orangutan-foundation","fields":{"headline":"Monkeying around in Borneo: a voluntourism trip with a difference","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’ve got a hammer in my hand when the cry goes up: “Orangutan in the camp.” Nine people down tools and grab their cameras and a chance to snap one of the critically endangered primates that we are here to help on our three-week stay in Indonesian Borneo. Rimba, a 17-year-old male orangutan, doesn’t disappoint: he circles the camp, going from tree to tree just a few metres above our heads for almost 30 minutes, hooting gruffly if anyone comes too close. It’s a well-earned reward for our group, which has spent a week sawing, hammering, chiselling, drilling and painting in the 32C heat and almost 100% humidity of the jungle. The Pondok Ambung research post, operated by the UK-based Orangutan Foundation, is little more than a handful of single-storey wooden and concrete buildings. We got here by driving from the regional capital, Pangkalan Bun, then taking a four-hour boat ride from the port of Kumai, along the Buluh Kecil river in central Kalimantan (the Indonesian name for Borneo). We’re surrounded by towering ironwood trees, which form a canopy 50 metres above our heads, blocking out sunshine but trapping moisture and heat. Below it the thick tropical rainforest is alive with small things that crawl and fly. There’s no mobile signal, let alone broadband. Our luxuries are packets of sweets and biscuits rationed to last the duration of our trip; a plate of sliced watermelon or oranges is greeted with delight. As Kalimantan is a dry state, the detox is physical as well as digital, and by the end of the first week we each feel we’ve sweated out more toxins than in a year of hot yoga. The Orangutan Foundation runs its volunteer programme every summer, attracting adventurers who fly at their own expense and pay £800 to spend three weeks sleeping in basic accommodation and building infrastructure for the full-time Indonesian research staff, forest wardens and visiting students. Over the past 15 years, volunteers have built facilities including guard posts and boardwalks in Tanjung Puting national park, further south in Borneo, and the Lamandau wildlife reserve, a few hundred kilometres to the east. I’m here because I want to do more for our beleaguered primate cousins than give money or avoid food and cosmetics containing palm oil. Naturally, we all want to see the orangutans. One of this year’s volunteers is back for a second year; others have given time elsewhere in animal welfare and environmental programmes. Volunteer tourism has become big business, estimated at up to $2bn a year as tourists demand experiences beyond sightseeing. It’s also controversial thanks to the image of wealthy “gap yah” students and the scandal of orphanage tourism. Tourism Concern warns against joining volunteering placements that are little more than “expensive holidays.” Its guidelines lay out best practice for organisations, and its annual conference, in Croydon on 4 November (tourismconcern.org), helps potential volunteers look at their own motivations for volunteering and advises on questions to ask before signing up for a project. My fellow participant Alec Watson, 45, who has volunteered on wildlife projects in Asia and China before, agrees it’s hard to find programmes with the high standards of the Orangutan Foundation: “Trying to find eco-trips where you can make an actual difference is not simple. A lot of them you just feel are cashing in on eco-tourism; here you’ve got a physical outcome at the end of it.” The Orangutan Foundation’s programme flips the much-criticised colonial model on its head. Our boss in the rainforest is Jakarta-born Fembry “Arie” Arianto, the research and camp manager for Pondok Ambung, while our foreman on the building site is Kalimantan native Mat Jurie, leading a team of half a dozen camp staff who show remarkable patience with our basic DIY skills. The work enables the Orangutan Foundation to study the wildlife of this protected area and to educate people about the risk of extinction faced by the apes and other animals. It’s a delicate mission: the palm oil industry is destroying animal habitats, but has raised the standard of living dramatically in a few decades. For us volunteers, it’s not all work. There are several trips a short distance upriver to Camp Leakey, the pioneering primatology site established by Birutė Galdikas more than 50 years ago. Daily feeding time draws a crowd of orangutans, many of whom were released into the forest after being rescued from captivity as infants; it also attracts daytripping eco-tourists on boats from Pangkalan Bun ticking their bucket-lists or hoping for an Instagram hit. Over our three weeks we get several visits from orangutans – either curious apes like Rimba or others just passing through as they forage for food and good nesting sites. Proboscis monkeys and macaques make their way noisily along the trees lining the river every day, and often just hang around in the trees opposite our jetty. We’re also escorted on night walks to spot tarantulas, civets and tiny huge-eyed tarsier primates, and boat rides at dusk to look for saltwater crocodiles and their smaller relatives, false gharials. We become accustomed to the low-riding and wobbly motorised canoes that ferry everything along Kalimantan’s fluvial highways. Every group of volunteers is different, but ours ranges from 18 to 60 years old, with eight women and four men when we begin. Despite the collegiate atmosphere, the basic conditions are hard to cope with: one volunteer takes a boat back to civilisation within a day of arrival; two more decide to return home after a week. It take all of us a few days to get used to the heat, and everyone is glad to escape from the mosquitoes when we leave. The kitchen is two gas burners run by our cook and camp mum, Ibu Opit, who turns out a surprising variety of meals, although we can always rely on a base of sticky white rice. We take turns to assist Ibu in providing the national staple plus mie goreng (fried noodles), fried and stewed chicken, fried or barbecued river fish, prawn crackers, rice pancakes and banana fritters. After dinner, Arie talks about the challenges of conservation in Indonesia, and the Indonesian staff are keen to practise their English and share colourful Indonesian phrases. After three weeks we are all delighted with the smile on Arie’s face as he reveals that we’ve surpassed his plan for the programme: not only has the main building been rebuilt and extended, we’ve also repainted the outbuildings and his team has reroofed the accommodation block. We could have seen wild orangutans on day trip to Camp Leakey, but we would have left Kalimantan as ignorant as we were on our arrival. While none of us is under the illusion that we’ve solved any of the knotty socio-economic problems that are driving orangutans to extinction, we have made a difference to people who are working to save them. • A three-week stay with the Orangutan Foundation costs £800, including all meals, accommodation, outings and local transport.

Written by David Simon, who created The Wire, and his frequent collaborator George Pelecanos, the series charts the rise of the pornography industry in New York City. Simon has said that the show is about “the commodification of women” and from the female bar staff poured into skimpy leotards by James Franco’s bar manager, Vinnie, to the violent control the pimps exert over the prostitutes they run, every woman in the show, and her sexuality, is being packaged and profited from. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Eileen “Candy” Merrell, a prostitute and single mother who rejects street-walking protocol and refuses to be controlled by a pimp, stating that “nobody makes money off my pussy but me”. “Somebody asked me the other day whether I thought porn was exploitative or empowering for women,” says Gyllenhaal. “At the time, I didn’t actually know how to answer. Then a couple of days later, I thought, can the answer just be: ‘Yes?’” It is a typically nebulous answer from an actor, who, in spite of roles in mainstream films such as The Dark Knight and Nanny McPhee Returns, has spent much of her career in the independent film sector. She is famed for playing the kind of complex, unconventional women who are now increasingly emerging from the small screen; her most famous role to date, of course, was the troubled, submissive assistant to the masochistic James Spader in 2002’s Secretary. While initially wary of the extensive shooting schedules of most series, the enormous success of The Honourable Woman – the BBC miniseries that won her a Golden Globe for her role as Baroness Nessa Stein – opened up Gyllenhaal to television. With The Deuce – set to be one of HBO’s biggest shows of the year – how did she feel about the high levels of nudity the part required? “You know, I spent no time moralising it. I am pretty comfortable with it,” Gyllenhaal says when we meet in a slick boutique hotel on the Brooklyn waterfront. “I have never been very shy about my body, and this is something I really believe in.” She lets out a small laugh. “This is so silly, but the only place I have felt shy is imagining those people who I see when I pick up my kids from school watching it. And I have to be honest and say that I don’t think I ate any bread at all while I was making this show. When you know you are going to have to wear very short shorts all summer long, you don’t.” The show has already been commissioned for a second season, which will jump forward to the late 1970s; while a pending third season will take place in the mid-1980s, thus charting the effects of the boom in pornography on its players over a 15-year stretch. In order to explore the intricacies of such a shrouded, changing industry, Gyllenhaal was faced with a challenge. “There is so much about sex work that is in the dark, because it’s illegal, so how do you get that information in a reliable way?” she asks. She was directed to Annie Sprinkle, a 63 year-old writer and television presenter, and former porn actor, who had also worked as a prostitute in the early 1970s in San Francisco and New York. “She has a support group for women who are involved in porn and prostitution,” says Gyllenhaal. “So she introduced me to this world of women in their 60s who had been, and some of whom still are, involved in sex work.” Their experiences challenged many received ideas about prostitutes as victims. “They all said: ‘Don’t write us off,’” reports Gyllenhaal. “They said: ‘Yes, there is often an element of damage [in their past].’ But there are a lot of other things too; there’s curiosity, and an actual love of sexuality. And I saw both elements.” And, contradictory though it may sound, in a show that features both graphic sex and violence, there is also an innocence to the trade it portrays. “Annie said that sex work then really had a different feeling about it than now,” nods Gyllenhaal. “That they were just coming out of the 1960s, and there was a celebration of freedom. People had this idea that they were smoking pot and making love.” Similarly, her ideas about pornography were transformed. “I thought of all pornography the same way, and what I realised is that pornography is an art form. And that there are actresses who are very proud of what they did in pornography.” The growth of the embryonic porn industry is seen primarily through Candy’s lens, both figuratively and literally: over the course of eight episodes, she develops an ambition not merely to star in porn films, but to direct them. “It’s like a light goes on inside her, and she starts thinking of herself as an artist,” says Gyllenhaal. A similar shift took place with Gyllenhaal’s ambitions, too. “I wanted some kind of guarantee that I would be a part of the storytelling, part of considering what it is we want to be saying,” she says. Gyllenhaal asked for a production credit, but people around her said that given a show of this size and profile she shouldn’t expect to get one. “And I thought, ‘Well, I’m still going to ask for it.’” To her surprise her request was granted. When this happened she felt a “real shift in my sense of myself as a woman and an artist. Which was like a meta version of what the piece is about.” As a producer, she was empowered to suggest additions to the script. For example, a deeply intimate scene in which we see Candy masturbate was Gyllenhaal’s own idea. “It wasn’t that I had a burning desire to pretend to masturbate on television,” she says, wryly. “It was that I wanted to find a way to express the difference between performative, transactional sex, and sex that is about someone’s actual desire. And I thought that was an interesting way to do it. But that was the scene I felt the most vulnerable about. Because I was trying to create something that looked and felt real.” Other challenging scenes included a porn shoot in episode two in which Gyllenhaal’s character “gets Campbell’s soup sprayed on her face with a fucking turkey baster,” she says, looking suitably horrified. “I can’t actually think of anything more degrading. And I knew it was in service of having a conversation about degrading women – which we are having – but I still had to do it, and I found that very difficult.” So far, The Deuce has been widely applauded for its exploration of the female gaze, and Gyllenhaal claims that it is “absolutely, definitely a feminist project”. But therein also lies a challenge: how to make a show about the sex trade and pornography without it becoming pornographic itself. Gyllenhaal, however, believes that is part of the show’s power and what it has in common with The Handmaid’s Tale and The Girlfriend Experience. “If it turns you on, but then makes you horrified to consider what’s actually turning you on, and what the consequences are for the characters that are turning you on, then it’s a better show,” she says. “If you’re patting yourself on the back and just thinking how terrible porn is, then it doesn’t make you consider your position as a person in the world right now, and how sex is commodified everywhere today.” The Deuce continues on 3 October, 10pm, Sky Atlantic"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/28/protomartyr-relatives-in-descent-review-sensational-bloodied-but-unbowed-post-punk","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T20:45:06Z","webTitle":"Protomartyr: Relatives in Descent review – sensational, bloodied but unbowed post-punk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/protomartyr-relatives-in-descent-review-sensational-bloodied-but-unbowed-post-punk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/28/protomartyr-relatives-in-descent-review-sensational-bloodied-but-unbowed-post-punk","fields":{"headline":"Protomartyr: Relatives in Descent review – sensational, bloodied but unbowed post-punk","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A slow-burn apocalypse of ennui and injustice crackles through the sensational fourth album from these Detroit post-punks.

CSKA Moscow were wretched, but the visitors were very impressive. Romelu Lukau scored twice, the sparkling Anthony Martial converted a penalty and Henrikh Mkhitaryan completed the rout. United are in control of Group A after starting with two convincing wins. Thanks for reading and emailing. Night. 90 min+1: CSKA are finishing strongly, for what it’s worth. Kuchaev has another shot deflected wide, then Schennikov sees a low piledriver held by De Gea. This is no more than a consolation, but it’s a nice goal nonetheless, and one fashioned by two youngsters. Golovin, who’s been bright, scoops a ball over the top of the United defence and Kuchaev, the young substitute, takes it on his chest before slamming a low shot past De Gea. The home fans enjoyed it. Mourinho looks displeased. 87 min: “Watching the game as a United fan, I’m not too sure whether we’re playing all that well, or CSKA are just awful!” says Luke Madden. “What do you think?” A little from column A, a little from column B. 85 min: Rashford sends a 30-yard free-kick miles over. He can afford to smile. 84 min: Konstantin Kuchaev replaces Vitinho. 81 min: Matic sprays a superb pass through to Darmian, who’s denied by Akinfeev. CSKA’s defence is appalling. 79 min: They could probably blow up now. 76 min: Basel are 5-0 up against Benfica! 74 min: Lingard’s down after a clash of heads with Wernbloom. 72 min: Marcus Rashford replaces the outstanding Anthony Martial, while Georgi Milanov replaces Alan Dzagoev, who’s a bit underwhelming to be perfectly blunt with you. 70 min: Lukaku is desperate for a hat-trick. 67 min: Matteo Darmian replaces Ashley Young, while CSKA make their first change, Timur Zhamaletdinov coming on for Fedor Chalov. 66 min: Vitinho shoots well wide from 20 yards. 62 min: “As another long-suffering Liverpool fan, I agree with Matthew Turner how frustrating this is to watch,” says Mike Richardson. “But at times, I think Liverpool is playing against ManU, like the absurd defending on the last two goals. Maybe Klopp can sign Ignashevich as a new center back to partner with Lovren and Klaven?” 60 min: Jesse Lingard replaces Henrikh Mkhitaryan. And the substitute almost scores straight away! The superb Martial scoots past the hapless CSKA defenders and sets up Lingard, who’s denied by the sprawling Akinfeev! 59 min: Vitinho’s booked for catching Bailly with a stray arm. 58 min: You do see some rubbish in the Champions League group stage, don’t you? Lukaku momentarily looks like he’s in the clear, Ignashevich playing a hopeless offside trap, but he takes a heavy touch and Berezutsky steps in. Ignashevich, though, is having a horrific evening. He plays an awful pass out of defence and Herrera wins back possession before knocking a pass through to Martial. His shot’s saved by the despairing Aknifeev, but Mkhitaryan strokes home the rebound. 54 min: Wernbloom picks up a booking for a forearm smash into Mkhitaryan’s jaw. He could have been sent off. Mkhitaryan groggily gets back to his feet. That was a disgraceful challenge from the CSKA midfielder. 51 min: Young swings a cross in from the right. Blind heads just over. 49 min: Martial threads a pass through the eye of the needle for Lukaku, who takes one touch before ramming a volleyed shot goalwards from close range. Akinfeev makes a superb stop and the ball’s scrambled away from Lukaku before he can complete his hat-trick. 47 min: Robert Critchley is the latest to send in a poem. When you three nil up and you know it Who cares if they think you’re a poet If you score three or four I don’t think that’s a bore Just as Leeds, and their man, Gary Rowett 46 min: CSKA Moscow get the ball rolling again. They make a positive start, Golovin turning this way and that on the edge of the area before sending a powerful shot over the bar. De Gea didn’t look too concerned. “The reason Macca is so upset is because of the juxtaposition with yesterday’s Moscow match,” says Matthew Turner. “It hurts us Liverpool supporters very much to see United play opponents who simply don’t show up, who don’t even try. It hurts us almost as much as the knowledge that our own team would still manage to not beat those same opponents. Liverpool can lower their game to any level.” CSKA need to get Didi Hamann on. 44 min: Dzagoev’s low shot from 25 yards doesn’t trouble De Gea. 43 min: Anthony Martial goes on a daring dribble inside from the left, winding into the area, briefly looking like he might run all the way through and score a fantastic solo goal. He’s crowded out in the end, but it’s another example of his glittering talent. He is so very good at football, Mourinho must find a way to extract those flashes from him on a more consistent basis. 42 min: Golovin’s booked after tripping Herrera. At least it’s an attempt at a tackle. 41 min: “CSKA are woeful,” Steve McManaman spits on BT Sport. He seems personally offended by their performance. 39 min: “The less said about my brief career as a Chelsea physio the better,” says Matt Richman. 38 min: Vitinho’s ambitious, swerving shot from 25 yards flies straight at De Gea. 37 min: CSKA show up in attack for the first time in a while, Dzagoev slithering into the United area and touching the ball to Chalov, who sets himself for a rising shot that De Gea brilliantly pushes over the bar. 35 min: Mkhitaryan lollops through the middle, no one in a home shirt bothering to stop him, because why would you? He lays it off to Lukaku, who takes a touch before deciding to shoot from 25 yards. Might as well. Aknifeev pushes it wide. 34 min: The CSKA fans have decided to have a noisy party. Might as well. They’re more impressive than their team. 31 min: In the other game in this group, Basel are 2-0 up at home to Benfica. “Maybe Matt Richman had a petty, vindictive manager who wouldn’t hesitate to throw him to the lions for any fault, real or otherwise, if it took the heat off himself,” says Stuart Jenkinson. “Unlike Martial, who has Jos.....oh hang on, I haven’t thought this through....” 29 min: Poetry in motion. This is pathetic. Igor Akinfeev has a face like thunder in the CSKA goal. Anthony Martial teases two defenders and coaxes in a cross that Vasili Berezutsky should deal with. Instead he takes a hapless swing at the ball, misses it and lets it bounce through to the far post, where Romelu Lukaku isn’t going to let him off the hook. He’s alert, Ignashevich isn’t and the Belgian cushions it past the fuming Akinfeev from close range. Good night, thanks for coming. 25 min: “That boy has ice running through his veins,” says Matt Richman. “He’s only 21? I was a nervous mess then.” Why would you be a nervous mess while leading 1-0 in a low-key group stage mismatch? 22 min: Golovin’s bending effort bounces a yard or two wide of the left post from 25 yards. It’s unlikely it would have beaten De Gea. 20 min: United could score a hatful here. CSKA can’t defend and Lukaku and Martial are in the mood. This is a peach of a penalty from Anthony Martial. So cool. He casually rolls up to it, watches Aknifeev dive to his left and nonchalantly pops it into the opposite corner. 18 min: Mkhitaryan bustles into the CSKA area on the right. Schennikov clumsily goes to ground in a desperate attempt to win the ball but only succeeds in chopping the Armenian down in front of the official behind the goal. Shocking defending. 17 min: Dzagoev prods a pass to Vitinho on the right of the United area. His shot ricochets off Lindelof, though, hits him and goes behind for a goal-kick. 14 min: By the way, that Lukaku goal means it’s 41 games since Igor Akinfeev kept a clean sheet in the Champions League. Poor Igor. “A limerick for Jose,” says Robin Hazlehurst. A grumpy old man name of Jose Responded to poetry: “No way! My ears are hurtin’ Leave that stuff for Jurgen I’ll stick with my dirges and prose play”. 13 min: There are more goals in this for United. They pass the ball patiently in front of the CSKA defence, working it out to Blind on the left. He has space. He slides a low ball into the area for the onrushing Mkhitaryan. He should score, but he raps his shot too close to Akinfeev, who saves well with his feet. United should lead by two. 11 min: Matic romps up field and finds Lukaku, who glides inside, easily evading Ignashevich. He finds Mkhitaryan, who sees his shot deflected wide for a corner on the left. Soon Martial has the ball. He skips past Golovin too easily, but he runs out of room before he can cause more problems for CSKA. 9 min: Golovin produces a fine tackle to stop Mkhitaryan’s run. CSKA are wasteful in possession when they try to break, though. 7 min: Here’s Stephen Gosling. José’s teams have a certain aesthetic More prosaic, and seldom poetic Still, I hope he’ll prevail And, if he should fail That he won’t blame the ref; that’s pathetic. 6 min: That goal hasn’t knocked the stuffing out of the home side. They’re right back at United’s throats, Golovin threatening again. He looks to have worked an opening for a shot, only to take a messy swipe at the ball. It runs to the unmarked Dzagoev on the edge of the area, though, and he forces De Gea to make a brilliant save low to his right with a rasping drive! The resultant corner is a waste. This is what happens when a 38-year-old marks Romelu Lukaku. Anthony Martial does well on the left, skilfully making space for a floated cross to the far post, where Lukaku bullies Ignasevich and plants a low header to Akinfeev’s left! What a start for United! 3 min: Martial conjures a beautiful backheel to set Mkhitaryan away on the left. The Armenian steams inside, but he runs into traffic. There’s a rare old atmosphere being created by the CSKA fans. This is likely to be a night that requires patience. CSKA win back possession and the talented Golovin, only 21, slices United open with a beautiful pass with the outside of his right foot, looking to set Dzagoev clear. However Dzagoev might be the slowest man alive and Young mops up. Peep! Manchester United get the game underway. They’re kicking from left to right in the first half. CSKA Moscow are in blue shirts and red shorts. United are in grey for the first time since ... you know when. The teams emerge. Liverpool could only draw in Moscow last night. Can Manchester United show them how it’s done? Pre-match poetry corner. “If Mourinho likes a sort of mechanical way of playing so much and as he does likes to win he would probably like ‘Ode Triunfal’ from Álvaro de Campos, one of Fernando Pessoa’s heteronyms,” says Rui Sequeira. A haiku from JR in Illinois, meanwhile: Disingenuous So cynical and classless Ruins everything Aniket Chowdhury seems like more of a Mourinho fan: There’s nothing like the taste of winning However, draws will do the job too As long as the players follow my instructions,theres nothing else to be done You can call me a boring guy,and you can hate me too I will park the bus whenever I want Coz I am the Special One Mike Richardson quotes from The Second Coming The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. There’s only one way to make Mourinho like poetry. We have to make him like poetry. We have to come up with the perfect poem for him. This is why we have emails open on the MBM. It works because it rhymes. CSKA Moscow line up with a back three that contains a couple of veterans, Vasili Berezutsky and the 38-year-old Sergei Ignashevich. It will be interesting to see how they fare against Romelu Lukaku. Manchester United make five changes to the side that beat Southampton on the weekend and also seem to have changed their system to a 3-4-3. Victor Lindelof and Chris Smalling return in defence, Ander Herrera joins Nemanja Matic in midfield with Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini injured, Daley Blind starts on the left and Anthony Martial, an unused substitute on the weekend, replaces Marcus Rashford. With a few players missing, it’s a solid line-up that looks built to play on the break. CSKA Moscow: Akinfeev; Vasin, V Berezutsky, Ignasevich; Fernandes, Wernbloom, Dzagoev, Golovin, Shchennikov; Chalov, Vitinho. Subs: Pomazun, A Berezutsky, Milanov, Nababkin, Natcho, Zhamaletdinov, Kuchaev. Manchester United: De Gea; Lindelof, Bailly, Smalling; Young, Matic, Herrera, Blind; Mkhitaryan, Lukaku, Martial. Subs: Romero, Tuanzebe, Darmian, Mata, McTominay, Lingard, Rashford. Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden). Hello. Don’t talk to Jose Mourinho about poetry. He isn’t a fan. Not in a footballing sense anyway. ‘There are many poets in football,” he said in response to criticism of his pragmatism after Manchester United beat Ajax in last season’s Europa League final, “but poets don’t win many titles.” And do you know who does win many titles? Mourinho. Two last season, 24 overall over the course of a 17-year managerial career. Clearly, then, there’s a fair amount of merit in his approach, even if it isn’t always to the taste of the neutral fan. There are undoubtedly fair questions to be asked about whether Mourinho’s style of attack is still relevant in 2017; the Chelsea implosion is still fresh in the memory and he there was nothing dashing about the way United finished sixth last season after breaking the world record to sign Paul Pogba. But history shows that the second season is when everything begins to come together for Mourinho teams. It happened at Inter, Real Madrid and at Chelsea second time round, and signs are that it could be happening at United. Okay, they haven’t really played anyone of any note yet – hang your head in shame, Ronald Koeman – and they got done over by Real in the Super Cup, but there is a familiar remorselessness to them at the moment that Mourinho’s rivals will recognise and fear. It would be nonsense to say that attacking football has suddenly become fashionable. It’s always been fashionable. Newsflash: people like goals. However it has become trendy at the highest level for managers to embrace risk by using intense pressing to overwhelm their opponents, attack as the best form of defence in its purest form. Done well, the logical conclusion is that your opponent can’t get the ball or out of their own third. But it has to be done right or it falls apart – and that’s why someone like Mourinho narrows his eyes when he sees that ... that ... that ... poetry. He prefers the traditional method of defending, eliminating the random and maintaining control, and it doesn’t bother him if he has to bore us half to death on the way to getting the thing that matters above all else: the result. It’s not that his attacking players aren’t allowed to have an ice cream after dinner every now and then, which is why United have already had three 4-0 wins this season, but they’d damn well better have had their greens and done their homework first. In United’s opening group match against Basel, Mourinho fumed about “Playstation football” when they started showboating after going 2-0 up. He had no compunction about packing his defence to protect a 1-0 lead at Southampton on Saturday and he’s made it clear that United will be “humble” at CSKA Moscow tonight. Fourth in the Russian league, CSKA opened their Champions League campaign with an impressive 2-1 win at Benfica. As far as Mourinho’s concerned, this isn’t the time for poetry.

How is any modern human meant to survive with only two double plug sockets per room? Don’t get me wrong, I like an ornate fireplace, but the mounting tension in the living room over who unplugged whose phone puts its beauty into perspective.

It would be about time. Ice ages have come and gone in less time than it’s taken for viewers to tire of its hatchet-faced judges and retina-scorching sets. Yet here we are, with The X Factor’s ratings plummeting; The Voice slumming it on ITV and reduced to a phlegmy croak; Pitch Battle’s tawdry choral contest prompting a collective cry of “must we?”; and the Gary Barlow-masterminded Let It Shine declared DOA. Even the BBC’s cringe-fest Even Better Than the Real Thing, in which “fans” showed their love for their favourite pop singers by honking through their hits in a series of atrocious wigs, was a one-off, surely deemed too flimsy for an entire series. Still, if we know anything about talent shows, it’s that they are TV’s answer to the Hydra: cut down one and more will grow in its place. Be upstanding, then, for Sing: Ultimate A Cappella (6 October, 9pm, Sky1), in which amateur singing groups from across the UK are invited to wow viewers “using only the power of their voices”. This is, says host Cat Deeley, “a singing show like no other”, a bold claim given all the other programmes that have featured members of the public singing in front of audiences using their actual vocal cords. But no matter. It is hoped that, by keeping a lid on the wardrobe budget and stripping away the bombastic musical accompaniment favoured by its predecessors, Sing will breathe new life into an ailing format. To which the only sane response is: dream on, chumps. Every week, five groups are required to sing in front of a panel of judges whose glittering credentials, we learn, include having had undisclosed parts in West End shows such as Shrek: The Musical and Sister Act, and having “many musical qualifications including a masters degree in songwriting”. Excellent. I look forward to my invitation to join next year’s Man Booker prize panel based on my A-level in English lit. There are no bleeding-heart backstories manipulating viewers into pity-votes, while the obligatory family members weeping side of stage are nowhere to be seen. Clearly an executive decision has been made to make a singing contest where singers just … sing. All of which means that while the show is pure of heart and humane of spirit, it’s also boring as hell. Many of the contestants in the opening episode are university pals who found kinship in their first year by dressing like 1950s doo-woppers and practising harmonised versions of S Club 7 songs while everyone else was out getting twatted on jelly shots. It’s with a note of melancholy that a member of Academy, an all-male group made up of science and law students from Bristol University, reflects: “We’re all currently single at the moment. Who knows what might happen?” Elsewhere, in Elle and the Pocket Belles, swing and rap are united to produce a sound so excruciating that dogs howl several postcodes away. The judges deem it a triumph. While there is no disputing the friendship-building properties of this apparently overlooked art form, students reinventing the Flying Pickets for the 21st century does not, alas, make for world-class entertainment. Odds are that, by Christmas, Sing will be lying in the TV morgue next to Let It Shine and Sky commissioning editors will brainstorming its successor. Because clearly we haven’t suffered enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/mushroom-bao-recipe-chinese-bun-meera-sodha-vegan","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T08:30:03Z","webTitle":"Meera Sodha’s recipe for vegan mushroom bao","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/mushroom-bao-recipe-chinese-bun-meera-sodha-vegan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/mushroom-bao-recipe-chinese-bun-meera-sodha-vegan","fields":{"headline":"Meera Sodha’s recipe for vegan mushroom bao","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is genuine pleasure to be had in things that feel just right: the weight of a pound coin, a bath at the perfect temperature, the feel of a well-worn wooden spoon. To this list, I’d add bao: it’s as if this little bun was ergonomically designed for eating – it fits snugly into the nook of a hand; the pillowy dough gives like memory foam; and the semi-circular shape slots cleanly into the mouth. It’s no surprise that these buns – thanks to Bao, the Soho restaurant, a bit of social media hype and our ever-growing appetite for new tastes and cultures – have become popular in the UK. Especially in the Sodha household. Ordinarily, the buns are made with milk and the fillings are porcine, but this recipe uses neither. The bun is filled with some of the finest mushrooms in the land, shiitake, which are coated in sesame and soy, covered with sharp cucumbers and finished with a smattering of salty peanuts. It’s everything you need and nothing you don’t. Mushroom bao This is a good weekend project, where the paper can be read while waiting for the dough to prove. You’ll need a steamer: the inexpensive bamboo ones are brilliant and can be set very easily over a pan of boiling water, to steam anything to your heart’s delight. Makes 10 bao. For the bao buns 375g plain flour, plus extra for rolling 1 tsp dried yeast 2 tbsp caster sugar ½ tsp salt 1¼ tsp baking powder 225ml warm water Rapeseed oil For the pickled cucumbers 100ml rice-wine vinegar ½ cucumber, halved lengthways, seeds removed and cut into very thin half moons For the mushroom filling 6 tbsp light soy sauce 4 tbsp crunchy peanut butter 8 tsp rice-wine vinegar 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 4 tsp toasted sesame oil 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 600g oyster and shiitake mushrooms, cut into 0.5cm slices 1 large handful salted peanuts, ground or very finely chopped Start by making the dough. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, then add the water little by little and bring the dough together using your hands; you should have a sticky ball. Turn it out on to a floured surface and knead for five minutes, until smooth and bouncy, then place in an oiled bowl. Cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to double in size – an hour to an hour and a half. Meanwhile, put the vinegar and three tablespoons of water in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer over a low flame, then pour into a bowl, add the cucumber and leave to cool. Turn out the dough on to a floured surface, knead for a minute to knock out the air, then divide into 10 equal-sized pieces. Take one piece, gently flatten it into a 1cm-thick disc, then brush one half with a tiny amount of oil. Fold the bun into a half-moon and place on a small square of baking paper on a tray. Repeat with the remaining dough, then loosely cover the tray with clingfilm and leave to rise for 30 minutes more. Now for the filling. In a small bowl, whisk the soy sauce, peanut butter, vinegar, garlic and sesame oil. Heat the rapeseed oil in a frying pan on a high flame, then fry the mushrooms hard for six minutes, until soft and browning at the edges. Stir in the sauce to coat, then turn the heat to medium and cook, stirring regularly, for five minutes, until the sauce reduces and goes dark brown. To cook the bao, set a steamer over a pan of simmering water. Put the bao in batches in the steamer, still on their baking paper mats and making sure they don’t touch, cover and steam for eight minutes. Once done, fill each bao with a generous tablespoon of mushrooms, three or four slices of cucumber and, for a little crunch, some peanuts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/28/alternative-news-sites-waging-guerrilla-war-on-bbc-says-nick-robinson","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:01:22Z","webTitle":"Alternative news sites waging guerrilla war on BBC, says Nick Robinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/28/alternative-news-sites-waging-guerrilla-war-on-bbc-says-nick-robinson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/28/alternative-news-sites-waging-guerrilla-war-on-bbc-says-nick-robinson","fields":{"headline":"Alternative news sites waging guerrilla war on BBC, says Nick Robinson","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alternative news sites are waging a “guerrilla war” against the BBC in an attempt to promote their own editorial agenda, according to the BBC’s former political editor Nick Robinson. The Today programme presenter said criticism of BBC journalists and others on sites ranging from the pro-Corbyn Canary to the rightwing Westmonster was so persistent that it was negatively affecting public perceptions of mainstream media. Writing in the Guardian, Robinson said: “Our critics now see their attacks as a key part of their political strategy. In order to succeed they need to convince people not to believe ‘the news’.” He added: “Attacks on the media are no longer a lazy clap line delivered to a party conference to raise morale. They are part of a guerrilla war being fought on social media day after day and hour after hour.” During the Scottish referendum campaign Robinson was booed by pro-independence supporters in press conferences. His successor as political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has faced similar hostility on and offline, and was accompanied by a security guard at the Labour conference after receiving threats. On Wednesday the Canary published an article about Kuenssberg that was swiftly debunked. The article, originally headlined “We need to talk about Laura Kuenssberg. She’s listed as a speaker at the Tory party conference”, said that the BBC journalist was due to speak at a fringe event at the Conservative party conference next week. It said this “raises questions about the impartiality of the journalist and her organisation. Again.” However, the BBC said Kuenssberg was not speaking at the event, at which she was listed only as an “invited speaker”. The Canary article’s headline was amended to say the journalist was “listed as an ‘invited’ speaker at the Tory party conference”. Robinson said all alternative websites shared a “certainty fuelled by living in a social media bubble” that reporters and presenters at the BBC and other mainstream media organisations were “at best craven – obeying some dictat from our bosses or the government – and at worst nakedly biased”. He argued that trust in the UK media was declining and blamed this on the “increased polarisation of our society and the increased use – particularly by the most committed and most partisan – of social media and alternatives to what they call the MSM, the mainstream media.” He said these alternatives included Wings over Scotland, which is pro-independence; the New European, a pro-EU newspaper; and the leftwing Novara Media, Skwawkbox and Evolve Politics, as well as the Canary and Westmonster. “They would all be horrified to be compared with each other, since what motivates them is the belief that the other lot are not just mistaken but an existential threat to the future of their country, but they often respond in similar ways.” He added: “Campaigners on left and right have been looking at and learning from the method behind what some regard as the madness of Donald Trump’s attacks on the ‘failing’ press as purveyors of fake news. “Paul Mason – formerly a distinguished colleague at the BBC and Channel 4, now a hyperpartisan campaigner for Jeremy Corbyn – told me before the election: ‘We see the media as the enemy navy … we need our own navy.’” The journalist will expand on his views on Thursday night when he gives an inaugural lecture in memory of Steve Hewlett, the late broadcaster. In the talk he will call on the BBC to do more to engage with people disillusioned with news bulletins and who instead get their news from social media. Robinson will also urge the broadcaster to promote and celebrate its impartiality, potentially by publishing the BBC’s so-called “producers’ guidelines” that outlines how its news coverage should be impartial, and by revealing the discussions and decisions at editorial meetings. • Nick Robinson is delivering the first Steve Hewlett memorial lecture on Thursday.

The announcement, made at a meeting of the G7 science ministers in Turin, marks the fourth cataclysmic black-hole merger that astronomers have spotted using Ligo, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The latest detection is the first to have also been picked up by the Virgo detector, located near Pisa, Italy, providing a new layer of detail on the three dimensional pattern of warping that occurs during some of the most violent and energetic events in the universe. A tiny wobble in the signal, picked up by Ligo’s twin instruments and the Virgo detector on 14 August, could be traced back to the final moments of the merger of two black holes about 1.8bn years ago. The black holes, with masses about 31 and 25 times the mass of the sun, combined to produce a newly spinning black hole with about 53 times the mass of the sun. The remaining three solar masses were converted into pure energy that spilled out as deformations that spread outwards across spacetime like ripples across a pond. Detecting these tiny distortions has required detectors sensitive enough to measuring a discrepancy of just one thousandth of the diameter of an atomic nucleus across a 4km laser beam. Ligo scientists’ historic observation of gravitational waves in September 2015, marked the first experimental proof of Einstein’s prediction a century ago that space itself can be stretched and squeezed. However, the parallel orientation of the two Ligo detectors, one in Hanford, Washington state, the other in Livingston, Louisiana, has meant that scientists are effectively observing one flat plane through space, rather than getting a 3D picture. “It’s like if I give you just one slice of apple, you can’t guess what the fruit looks like,” said Prof Andreas Freise, a Ligo project scientist at the University of Birmingham. This was intentional because it maximised the chances of detection – a discovery that is hotly tipped to be rewarded when the Physics Nobel Prize is announced next week. However, the configuration made it impossible to test a second crucial prediction of Einstein’s theory – the shape of the path that the waves travel along. Virgo’s arms are angled differently than the two Ligo detectors, allowing astronomers to extract new information about the polarisation of gravitational waves – essentially the path traced out by the vibrations. “When you see things from different angles, suddenly you can see the 3D shape as well,” he said. “Einstein’s theory of what [the waves] look like is pretty clear.” Einstein’s theory predicts two polarisations of gravitational waves, but some competing theories of gravity predict up to six. Prof Stefan Ballmer, a physics professor at Syracuse University, explains: “If you look at how you can bend the sheet of paper that spacetime is, there are many ways you can bend it. But if you look at [Einstein’s predictions], only two of those ways are present.” The new data – albeit based on a single detection – already appear to strongly favour Einstein’s predictions of how spacetime is expected to crumple. Combining results from three detectors has also allowed scientists to more accurately triangulate the area of sky from which the waves are emanating. In future, this could allow scientists to swing ground-based telescopes to the target locations to see whether there is any visible trace of the collision itself. Dr John Veitch, of the University of Glasgow, who co-led a team working on determining the origins and properties of the source, said: “This was a very strong first. Having a third detector means that we can now triangulate the position of the source, and much more accurately determine the exact spot in the cosmos where the signal came from.” In the case of black holes, theory predicts that there should be no optical signal – but astronomers are open-minded. “They should be dark ... but black holes are a mystery still to some extent,” said Freise. “We’re only getting signals from them for the first time, the rest is just theory.” Virgo has been collecting data since 2007, but the instrument was offline undergoing upgrades when Ligo made its first detections of gravitational waves in 2015. The revamped detector was switched on earlier this year, meaning it had a short overlap with Ligo’s observing run, which came to an end in August. “This is just the beginning of observations with the network enabled by Virgo and Ligo working together,” said Ligo spokesman David Shoemaker of MIT. “With the next observing run planned for [autumn] 2018 we can expect such detections weekly or even more often.” UK science minister Jo Johnson said: “The latest detection of gravitational waves is an excellent example of international collaboration, which was only made possible due to the breakthrough work undertaken by UK scientists and engineers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/27/people-saw-right-through-it-jeremy-corbyn-hits-back-at-daily-mail-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T16:22:49Z","webTitle":"'People saw through it': Corbyn hits back at Daily Mail attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/27/people-saw-right-through-it-jeremy-corbyn-hits-back-at-daily-mail-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/27/people-saw-right-through-it-jeremy-corbyn-hits-back-at-daily-mail-attacks","fields":{"headline":"'People saw through it': Corbyn hits back at Daily Mail attacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has attacked “overwhelmingly hostile” press coverage of Labour and his leadership, and said the June election result showed people were no longer affected by reams of negative articles. In his speech at the Labour conference in Brighton, Corbyn said he had been targeted with 14 pages of attacks in one paper on a single day, but it had strengthened support for the party. “There were some who didn’t come out of the election too well,” he said to applause and laughs in the conference hall. “I’m thinking of some of our more traditional media friends. They ran the campaign they always do, under orders from their tax-exile owners to trash Labour at every turn.” One delegate shouted “the BBC” as Corbyn criticised the coverage the party had received. However, Corbyn himself made the rightwing Daily Mail and its editor, Paul Dacre, the main target of his attack. “The day before the election, one paper devoted 14 pages to attacking the Labour party. And our vote went up nearly 10%,” he said. “Never have so many trees died in vain. The British people saw right through it. So this is a message to the Daily Mail’s editor: next time, please could you make it 28 pages?” Corbyn said the pages of hostile stories had fuelled social media trolling of Labour party candidates and MPs, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, had borne the brunt. The mention of her name in the hall drew a standing ovation and cheers and a spontaneous rendition of Happy Birthday for Abbott, a longtime ally of Corbyn. “The campaign by the Tories and their loyal media was nasty and personal,” Corbyn said. “It fuelled abuse online and no one was the target of that more than Diane Abbott.” He said Abbott had a “decades-long record of campaigning for social justice and has suffered intolerable misogynistic and racist abuse”. In a nod to a motion passed by conference delegates on Tuesday that set out tough new rules to prevent antisemitism, racism and hate speech, Corbyn said: “Yes we will disagree, but there can never be any excuse for any abuse of anybody. We settle our differences with democratic votes and unite around those decision.” Corbyn attributed the party’s improved performance in the election to viral social media campaigning and enthused new street activists. He paid tribute to the efforts of Labour supporters in getting the party’s message across, with many delegates in the room first-time members aligned with the grassroots social movement Momentum, which first sprung up in support of Corbyn’s leadership bid. “Our members, our supporters in the trade unions, our doorstep and social media campaigners,” he said. “Young people sharing messages and stories on social media, hundreds of thousands organising online and on the ground to outplay the Tories’ big-money machine. “Is it any wonder that here today in Brighton you represent the largest political party in western Europe? With nearly 600,000 members, alongside 3 million affiliated trade unionists, brimming with enthusiasm and confidence in the potential of our people.” Negative press coverage On Wednesday 7 June, the day before the election, the Daily Mail ran a sustained attack on Corbyn and Labour, as well as articles supportive of Theresa May’s Conservatives, which appeared on each of the first 14 pages. The front page had images of Corbyn, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Diane Abbott, under the headline “apologists for terror”. The opening paragraph read: “Today, the Daily Mail accuses Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott – the troika who could run the next government – of being unashamed apologists for terror, who have devoted their lives to befriending the enemies of Britain while undermining the very institutions that keep us safe in our beds.” The story continued on the next page under the headline “For the sake of Britain, give Mrs May the mandate she needs to keep us safe - and give us Brexit”, which gave a six-point rundown of why Britain would be “nothing short of insane to vote Labour”. The attack continued on page three under the headline “EXPOSED: Corbyn at rally attended by jihadis linked to London Bridge killer”. A spokesman for the Labour leader pointed out that it was a public event promoting the human rights of Palestinians and Corbyn had no control over who attended. Two spreads across pages four to seven, titled “In their own damning words, so full of contempt for British values, proof Corbyn and Co are unfit to rule”, accused the trio of being “anti-royal” and the “Gypsies’ hero”. The attack continued on page eight under the headline “Revealed: Labour plan to crash house prices”, writing the party would replace council tax with a levy based on the total value of land. It said party figures had “boasted that it will help trigger a house price crash” because a briefing paper on the proposal said it would increase supply and, as long as demand did not grow more quickly, help more people afford a home. The facing page singled out Diane Abbott under the headline “Calling in sick? Now Abbott is ‘too ill to go on air’”, and accused Labour of “hiding” her after a series of muddled media appearances. Pages 10 to 14 eased up somewhat, focusing on the relative strength of the Tories and how to vote tactically to ensure they remained in government, as well as railing against what the Mail perceived as the BBC’s pro-Corbyn bias."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/28/free-childcare-extension-could-widen-gap-between-rich-and-poor-says-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T23:01:22Z","webTitle":"Free childcare extension could widen gap between rich and poor, says charity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/28/free-childcare-extension-could-widen-gap-between-rich-and-poor-says-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/28/free-childcare-extension-could-widen-gap-between-rich-and-poor-says-charity","fields":{"headline":"Free childcare extension could widen gap between rich and poor, says charity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A charity has said the government’s 30-hours free childcare offer risks widening the gap between disadvantaged children and their wealthier peers before they start school. From this month all three- and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare a week, up from 15 hours. The Sutton Trust, an education charity, says the scheme is not adequately resourced and a new funding formula will divert resources away from state nurseries disproportionately attended by disadvantaged children. The charity says the policy will help more parents to return to the workplace, but argues it is being implemented at the expense of high-quality early years education which particularly benefits children from poorer families. Research has consistently shown that high-quality early years education delivered by qualified teachers is the most effective way of boosting the development of the poorest two- and three-year-olds. In recent years there has been a narrowing of the gap between disadvantaged and wealthier children in school readiness, from 21.2 percentage points in 2007 to 17.7 in 2015. The Sutton Trust’s report, Closing Gaps Early, says that progress may be in jeopardy with a shift in focus away from quality early years education towards affordable childcare for working families. It also says the funding will be spread more thinly. Kitty Stewart, associate professor of social policy at the London School of Economics and one of the report’s authors, said: “To make up some of the funding gap, a new funding formula reallocates resources away from state nurseries disproportionately attended by disadvantaged children, and they may in the future struggle to afford a qualified teacher. To remove this advantage must be expected to have negative effects on social mobility.” The report says a third of staff working in group-based childcare lack English and/or maths at GCSE. It highlights other potentially damaging policies including the axing of financial support for graduate training for early years professionals and the lifting of the requirement for Sure Start centres in disadvantaged areas to offer graduate-led early education. It raises concern about a proposal to remove the requirement for nursery and reception classes to have a qualified teacher. The Sutton Trust’s chair, Sir Peter Lampl, said: “Good quality early years provision is vital to narrow the gaps that leave too many youngsters behind by the time they start school. But it’s unlikely that the government’s policy to provide 30 hours of free childcare will provide this.” Tracy Brabin, the shadow minister for early years, said: “The whole system is now being underfunded and undermined. They [the Conservatives] have created less than a quarter of the places they promised, excluded parents on the lowest incomes, and mismanaged the scheme so badly that many families simply can’t find a provider prepared to offer them the free hours they are supposedly entitled to.” Ellen Broomé, chief executive at the Family and Childcare Trust, said her organisation’s research had shown that many children arriving at primary school were not ready to take part in classroom activities. “There is strong evidence that early education can help to boost children’s outcomes and narrows the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers – but only if it is high quality. The government must make sure that every child can access high-quality early education.” A Department for Education spokesperson said 15,000 children were already benefiting from the 30-hours free childcare offer, which came in this month, taking pressure off family finances. “Every child should receive the same high-quality care and support, regardless of their background or where they live, which is why we are increasing spending on childcare to over £6bn per year by 2019-20,” the spokesperson said. “Alongside our 30-hours free childcare offer, we are spending over £2.5bn on free childcare for disadvantaged two-year-olds over five years, as well as providing extra support for disadvantaged families through the early years pupil premium.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/29/nfl-protests-readers-views","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T15:35:32Z","webTitle":"'I was upset at first.

Then I thought about the first amendment': readers on NFL protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week, Donald Trump said any “son of a bitch” who kneeled during the anthem should be “fired”. The president’s comments drew a widespread response among NFL teams with players dropping to their knee during the anthem. Even the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a staunch supporter of Trump, took the knee albeit not during the anthem. We asked what you think about the protests. Here are some of your responses. Kellie Johnson, 45, Minnesota: When I joined the military I took an oath to defend freedom of expression As a former member of the US military, I took an oath to defend the constitution which includes freedom of expression. They aren’t kneeling for fun, it’s a protest. It would be nice if people would stop focusing on the anthem and instead focus on the reason for the protest; America has some serious race issues and we need to deal with them. But it’s hard and some people can’t face hard things. What’s sad is that so many people in the stands at sporting events talk or look at their phones during the national anthem and I bet a lot of them are now complaining about kneeling. Those are the people who are truly disrespecting the flag and the anthem. Sheila, 47, Los Angeles: They are courageously using themselves as a subtle but powerful political statement When you have the privilege of being famous enough to have a public forum that many will witness, it is vitally important to use that fame for something useful at this point in history. Fame for the sake of being famous just makes you into another Kardashian and a part of the problem as opposed to part of the solution. These players, by courageously using themselves as a subtle but powerful political statement have done us all a favor as we continue to wrestle with a truth so deep, that white supremacy is endemic to American culture it’s institutions and overall psyche. Barbie, 57, Chesapeake, VA: If you don’t want to honor your country then leave and go somewhere else Kneeling during the national anthem and flag burning shows utter disrespect for everything this country stands for, especially the military who fight and stand up for our right to protest and freedom of speech. If you don’t want to honor your country then leave and go somewhere else and see how that works out for you. If the NFL players want to express themselves do it off the field and do something for your community. Football is a pass time where fans don’t want to get involved in their political BS, it’s a game and it’s entertainment and if it continues fans will lose interest and the NFL will pay dearly. So suck it up and show your protest off the field. Derek Sanderson, 50, Arizona: Trump is attacking the constitution, not defending it As a veteran and descendant of many who served their country honorably in WWII, including the Battle of Midway and the Battle of the Bulge, I fully support the players in their peaceful expression of free speech, a right enshrined as the very first amendment to our constitution. Although the president enjoys the same rights of free speech as any other citizen, he holds the highest executive office in our system of government, charged with enforcing its laws and constitution. Using the power of his office as a bully pulpit, to coerce citizens into silence by applying economic pressure against those with whose speech he disagrees, is a violation of his oath of office. He is attacking the constitution, not defending it. Jimmy, 65, Port Royal, SC: I want to watch a sports event for entertainment not to see a political forum I think it is the wrong platform to use for protesting. The country is politically divided so half the audience is going to be displeased. I want to watch a sports event for entertainment not to see a political forum. I will not be watching NFL not because I agree or disagree with the protesters, but because they have taken the fun out of the game. Players are no longer larger than life talented athletes, but political activists. I tried to watch an NFL game, but couldn’t accept some players as anything more than an intermediary for social change and watched true crime shows instead. Riley Michel, 32, US: It seems to be the last vestige of the first amendment being allowed to African Americans Considering the fact that it is largely the only form of protest not being violently opposed by white nationalists or police in riot gear, it seems to me it is the last vestige of the first amendment being allowed to African Americans in the current socio-political climate. As it is an entirely peaceful and respectful method I struggle to see any real issue with it. Furthermore, considering the constitution lays out a very specific list of actions considered disrespectful towards the American flag, such as using it for marketing, holding it still, laying it flat, etc., which are all done by Trump and pretty much everyone else including the NFL, I see it as the highest hypocrisy to vilify Colin Kaepernick and other African American players for doing none of those things. Rob W, 29, Charlottesville, VA: The message of racial inequality and injustice has not been conveyed well They have the right to peacefully protest and to speak out however they want but the message of racial inequality and injustice is not, and has not been, conveyed well through them ‘taking a knee’. This has lead to division through misunderstanding in a realm where fans come from all socio-economic, racial, and gender backgrounds. While the first amendment gives the right of freedom of speech and to peaceably assemble, it’s confined between the people and the government. These protests are clearly outside that realm, so the NFL - as with any owner of private property - may restrict their players however they see fit within reason. Amy, 62, New York: Being forced to stand at attention with a boot on your neck is not patriotism, it’s tyranny I couldn’t care less. This obsession that some of my fellow Americans have with flags and anthems is downright creepy. I am white, middle class and relatively privileged. I say to the Colin Kaepernicks of the world: “Keep on keeping on, my brothers.” Being forced to stand at attention with a boot on your neck is not patriotism. It’s tyranny. These yahoos complaining that it disrespects the military are the worst of them all. Read a history book, fools. Good god, it’s just embarrassing to be American right now. Obviously Trump is the biggest moron of them all. Tamara, 53, Kansas: Freedom of speech doesn’t mean they have that freedom only when I agree with them I was upset when NFL players began kneeling during the national anthem. I thought they were being unpatriotic. Then I thought about the first amendment. Freedom of speech doesn’t mean they have that freedom only when I agree with them. It means everyone has the right to free speech whether I agree or not. That’s the whole point. Get your message across to people who may not agree with you in the hope that you can change their minds. In this case, I would say the football players’ protest is having the desired impact. The country is talking and people like myself are reevaluating former beliefs. So while I may not totally agree with their method of protest, I deeply respect their right to do so, and I have to admire the guts it takes for them to pull a stunt like that knowing a large portion of the country is going to hate them for it.

As well as market stalls, exhibits, a ham-cutting competition and the chance to win your weight in ham, the local bars and tavernas offer two tapas for €2 and then stamp your loyalty card allowing you to vote for the best tapas of the festival. If you can’t make the festival, the Ibérico Ham tour runs throughout the year – a guide takes you from farm to fork and shows why the black-footed pig has been considered a delicacy for centuries. The town also has a ham museum. • In 2017, the festival runs on two consecutive weekends in October (20-22 and 27-29). Ham tours cost €37.50 (under-12s free), last 2½ hours and run at 11am and 4.30pm daily Ruth Kelly Sagre in Modena, Emilia Romagna, Italy You can’t move for sagre (food festivals) in Emilia Romagna in autumn and it’s the perfect place to tour by car or bike, following the strada dei vini e dei sapori (wine and tastes road) which winds through vine-clad hills to little fortified hill towns. Among the best events we have visited are the sagra dell’uva (grape festival, middle two weekends in September) in Castelvetro, where you can try local Lambrusco varieties in the medieval piazza, accompanied by local specialities from tigelle bread with lardo to stuffed pasta. Nearby Spilamberto is not as impressive architecturally but the Mast Còt festival (this weekend) is a fun spectacle celebrating Modena’s balsamic vinegar. The streets are fragrant with the aroma of grape must cooking in the open air, which is the first step to producing the vintage vinegar. There are balsamic vinegar tastings, eateries dish up local specialities and food trucks line the piazza serving a range of dishes featuring the famous aceto. A great place to stay in the vicinity is the Locanda degli Ulivi (doubles from €90 B&amp;B) in Montebudello, where comfy rooms share a pool with a view and there’s a great restaurant serving local classics like tagliatelle al ragù, tortelloni and scaloppine all’aceto balsamico. MThurstan Valtellina food and wine festivals, Italy Tucked into the last fold of the Italian Alps before you hit Switzerland, the Valtellina is gastro heaven in autumn. While the north-facing wall of the valley bristles with sweet chestnuts, the south-facing flank is terraced into tiny patches of flat soil packed with vines, which produce various delicious wines. Sample these on one of several tasting trails, four around the elegant town of Morbegno; or, our favourite, in the lofty stone village of Traona. You follow the marked trail around the cellars, sampling the lovely nebbiolo wines and taking advantage of the excellent nibbles – mostly local cheese and cured meats but also a memorable walnut bread – at each atmospheric venue. The various wine trails in Morbegno run across three weekends in 2017 between 30 September and 15 October. The village wine trails and other foodie events are all worth investigating and Traona has its own info page for its wine trail. Stay at a fabulous agriturismo in the valley near Morbegno, such as La Fiorida (doubles from €160 B&amp;B, including spa access). marthah Porcini mushrooms, eastern Tuscany, Italy The Valtiberina is mushroom country and the village markets have mounds of porcini. In the village of Monterchi (25km east of Arezzo) where we bought them, they were brown as conkers and swelling like the Renaissance masterpiece the Madonna del Parto (Pregnant Virgin). Even post-Brexit they are affordable by the kilo and you need little more than a glass of wine and loaf of bread – plus someone to share with – for a wonderful meal. The village restaurant does a fine line in truffles too, as do those in Arezzo and Sansepolcro, where more Piero della Francesca frescoes (like the Madonna) can be found. John Pelling Stew and dumplings, Tyrol, Austria Visit Austria in early autumn and relish the delights of freshly gathered mushrooms in a super stew. The eierschwammerlgulasch made from chanterelles is a delight. Many local restaurants in the Tyrol use these, freshly picked, to cook up a delicious stew served with the local speciality of semmelknödel dumplings. A glass of grüner veltliner (made from a grape variety grown in Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic) provides suitable refreshment. Round this off with an equally seasonal slab of zwetschenkuchen (plum cake) with a generous dollop of whipped cream and the energy used in the mountain walk is quickly replenished. The Tirolerhof hotel and restaurant in Hopfgarten in the Kitzbühel district (doubles from €75 B&amp;B) is a great place to stay and to eat. Janet Sims Autumn pintxos, San Sebastían, Spain San Sebastián’s famous pintxos reflect the seasons, and last autumn we gorged on those topped with delicious, locally foraged wild mushrooms. The bar tops in the Parte Vieja (old town) groan with the weight of pintxos and every bar has a different offering, so you never have to eat the same type twice. • Road trip from San Sebastian to Valencia Fionag20 Seasonal delights, Scottish Highlands Scotland is at its best in autumn, and nowhere more so than at the Monachyle Mhor hotel and restaurant (doubles from £195 B&amp;B) at the end of Balquhidder Glen, an hour’s drive north-west of Stirling. The drive there, along the banks of Lochs Voil and Doine, is luminous, the colours of the surrounding trees and hillsides rich and almost fluorescent in the sunshine – and the food from the family’s farm and surrounding land shines equally in the hands of accomplished chefs who fully understand the seasons. Locally stalked venison and game; home-grown beetroot, swede, celeriac; freshly foraged mushrooms and berries; and much more, appear in delicious and creative dishes in this romantic yet convivial location. teresastansby Helsinki herring festival, Finland Each October the Finnish capital hosts a week-long herring festival, which dates back several hundred years, in the Market Square on the waterfront. This year it runs from 1-7 October. The festival not only celebrates the herring but the fishermen who catch them and marks the end of summer. Fishermen come from all over Finland, and there’s a real festive feel. When we went, all Helsinki seemed to be there: cafes and stalls were set up (alongside herring, you will see knitted hats and socks, jams, dried meats), there was live music and a huge rowing race (with the proceeds going to environment charities). When you’ve had enough herring or it’s getting too cold, walk over to the covered old market hall with its coffee shops, delis, bars and bistros. John Redston St Dogmaels market, Pembrokeshire, Wales The coastal market in St Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire, shifts up a gear in autumn as seasonal produce fills the stalls. Delicious, vibrant hedgerow jams, heritage vegetables and tangerine squashes and rare varieties of apples dating from medieval times from the villagers’ gardens, sit side by side with locally caught Cardigan Bay shellfish. This is the best time to eat the local crab as the females are full of roe, making the crab meat red and rich; the fresh prawns, meanwhile, are meaty and tender. This weekly market is a delight for anyone interested in local foods who also wants to explore the stunning Welsh coastline. • Market runs Tuesdays 9am-1pm, welshcountry.co.uk peppermintpattis Bucharest, Romania Bucharest isn’t one of the most talked-about cities in Europe but it is a really beautiful place and the Romanian food is perfect for warming you up on crisp autumn days.

The west must repay its debt","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hostile moves by neighbouring governments to blockade and isolate the Kurds of northern Iraq in punishment for this week’s vote for independence require a robust response by Britain and the international community. Despite the historical betrayals of the western powers, the Kurds have proven loyal and valuable allies in the struggle against Islamic State and the former dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Now is time to settle the debt. With the official results of the referendum called by Masoud Barzani’s Kurdistan regional government (KRG) due on Wednesday, it is already clear an overwhelming majority backed independence. This outcome was never in doubt. It represents the partial culmination of a dream of self-determination and self-rule nurtured by generations of Kurds since the arbitrary Anglo-French carve-up of the Ottoman empire at the close of the first world war left them dispersed, stateless and homeless. What is surprising, and dismaying, is the extraordinary display of unanimity exhibited by the world’s most powerful governments in opposing Kurdish independence. When before in the modern era have the US, the EU, Russia and China, plus the Arab League, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey all agreed on anything? Boris Johnson and Britain’s Foreign Office are part of this too cosy consensus. They argue, like the others, that Kurdish aspirations fuel instability in a volatile region. As always when dealing with the Kurds, the self-interest of outside actors obscures the vision of a better future. Their short-term focus is on defeating Isis and Islamist terrorism in general. Their longer-term interest, particularly the US and Russia, is in shaping the balance of power and advantage in a post-Arab spring, post-Syria Middle East. In the great powers’ geopolitical playbook, the Kurds have their uses. But their ideas of nationhood are a nuisance. The limitations of this blinkered outlook are becoming apparent as Britain and its allies find themselves on the wrong side of a rapidly developing confrontation between Barzani’s government and its immediate neighbours, principally Iraq, Iran and Turkey. The KRG is not the cause of this upsurge in tensions. It has just conducted a long-delayed, highly successful, transparent and inclusive democratic exercise in a region not renowned for grassroots consultation. The source of tension is external. Take, for example, the behaviour of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president. Erdoğan has spent the period since June, 2015 – when he almost lost power due, in part, to the success of a pro-Kurdish party – attacking the Kurdish minority populations in south-east Turkey and northern Syria, curbing democratic freedoms and purging tens of thousands of supposed fifth columnists. His neo-Islamist regime has cut cooperation with Nato and blackmailed the EU over Syrian refugees. Erdoğan has proved himself no friend of Britain or Europe, or of western values. Now this same posturing bully is threatening to starve out the Iraqi Kurds and block their oil exports for having the temerity to try to direct their own future – and Britain is in his camp. “[They] will be left in the lurch when we start imposing sanctions. It will be over when we close the oil taps, all [their] revenues will vanish, and they will not be able to find food when our trucks stop going to northern Iraq,” Erdoğan warned. In opposing the referendum, Britain also finds itself in bed with Iran, which has a long, ignoble history of oppressing its Kurdish minority. To mark its displeasure over the possible knock-on effects, Tehran sent fighter jets screaming menacingly over Kurdish areas of western Iran on Tuesday. The “ethnic and sectarian war” predicted by Erdoğan is also rendered a more likely prospect by this week’s joint Turkey-Iraq military exercises along the KRG’s border and moves to shut down airports and trade routes. Barzani is meanwhile facing a predictable barrage of condemnation from Baghdad, where successive Iranian-backed, Shia-led governments have fiercely opposed Kurdish self-determination. Iraqi Shia militias are reportedly ready to march on Kurd-controlled Kirkuk. But if fighting breaks out, it will be the fault not of the KRG but of its hostile, insecure neighbours and of complacent, unimaginative western leaders. In a report published in 2015, the Commons foreign affairs committee was clear where Britain’s loyalties lie. “The UK is fortunate to have in such a volatile part of the world a partner as relatively moderate, pragmatic, stable, democratic, secular and reflexively pro-western as the KRG,” it said. Maintaining the KRG as a “haven of tolerance and stability”, not least in its approach to women’s rights and humanitarian issues, and as an ally against extremist forces, was of critical importance. Saddam tried to crush the Kurds of northern Iraq in 1991, in the wake of the first Gulf war. Britain and its partners responded effectively with safe havens and a no-fly zone. A determined, principled stand is once again required to uphold the Kurds’ democratic rights. • Simon Tisdall is an assistant editor of the Guardian and a foreign affairs columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2017/sep/27/sierra-leone-arrests-pastor-who-blamed-islam-for-every-terrorist-act-in-history-victor-ajisafe","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T16:59:50Z","webTitle":"Sierra Leone arrests pastor who blamed Islam for 'every terrorist act in history'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/27/sierra-leone-arrests-pastor-who-blamed-islam-for-every-terrorist-act-in-history-victor-ajisafe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/sep/27/sierra-leone-arrests-pastor-who-blamed-islam-for-every-terrorist-act-in-history-victor-ajisafe","fields":{"headline":"Sierra Leone arrests pastor who blamed Islam for 'every terrorist act in history'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Nigerian pastor has been arrested in Sierra Leone after recordings of a sermon targeting Muslims went viral on social media, sparking widespread outrage. In an address to his congregation on Saturday, Victor Ajisafe, founder and leader of one of the country’s largest churches, called Islam a “violent religion of lies and deceit” and said Muslims have been responsible for “every terrorist act in the history of the world”. Sierra Leone’s population is roughly 78% Muslim, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center estimate. Audio and video recordings of the sermon appeared online within three days, and were met with immediate and near-universal condemnation by both Muslim and Christian Sierra Leoneans. Ajisafe was arrested on Tuesday, but has not yet been charged. “Everyone is very upset by his message,” said MB Kamara, head of Sierra Leone’s criminal investigations department. “We are a very religiously tolerant country and no one ever worries whether someone is Muslim or Christian. We all have lived peacefully for generations, and no one wants that disrupted.” An initial press release from the social welfare ministry said Ajisafe was being held for his own protection. Kamara said Ajisafe would be held until a charge against him could be determined. Sierra Leone does not have legislation devoted specifically to hate speech, but incitement is prohibited under common law. The attorney general, Joseph Kamara, is expected to make a decision on Thursday. All six branches of Ajisafe’s Sanctuary Praise Church, one of Sierra Leone’s largest Evangelical communities, have been indefinitely shut down by the social welfare ministry pending further investigations. Police have been dispatched to each location to prevent anyone from entering after CID officials claimed that “credible information” indicated the existence of a plot to burn down the church’s Freetown headquarters. Ibrahim Tommy, director of the civil society group Center for Accountability and the Rule of Law, said he was worried that banning people from Ajisafe’s church may constitute a violation of people’s right to free assembly. “It’s completely wrong what he said, and in some ways even criminal,” Tommy said. “He should be held fully accountable, but I don’t think that the government should shut down a whole church and disband its congregation just because of one person. People have the right to worship where they please, and we’re venturing into dangerous territory by limiting that right, even temporarily. “Besides, who says just because some hateful comments were said that suddenly every Muslim in the country is going to jump for an opportunity to destroy the man? By assuming so, the government is just reinforcing that stupid narrative about Muslims the pastor put out in the first place.” Members of the Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone have condemned Ajisafe’s statements. The council’s secretary general, Reverend Dr Usman Jesse Fornah, said Sierra Leone’s Christians have lived “a peaceful coexistence with Muslims and want it to continue”. The organisation’s president, Sheikh Abu Bakarr Conteh, emphasised Islam’s peaceful nature and urged his followers to forgive Ajisafe and refrain from passing judgement on their Christian neighbours. Ajisafe’s comments have been decried by Sierra Leoneans at home and abroad on social media. Some have demanded an apology, while others have called for the pastor’s deportation back to Nigeria. “Statements like his can bring chaos to whole countries, so of course we’re concerned,” said Emmanuel Lansana, a lecturer in Freetown. “I come from a family of mixed religion. My father is a Muslim and my mother is a Christian. It’s the same with me and my wife, and we have happy homes. It’s as if [Ajisafe] wants to divide our country’s unique union at a time when the world needs us to lead by example. But I think he will be disappointed. We know how to love each other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/01/daphne-film-review-sex-drugs-nihilism-emily-beecham","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Daphne review – sex, drugs and nihilism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/01/daphne-film-review-sex-drugs-nihilism-emily-beecham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/01/daphne-film-review-sex-drugs-nihilism-emily-beecham","fields":{"headline":"Daphne review – sex, drugs and nihilism","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Daphne is a Londoner in her early 30s who lives her life like an act of war. Intensely inhabited by Emily Beecham, it’s a performance full of jangling discord and serrated edges, capturing a woman at the exact moment when circumstances magnify her already forcefully nihilistic personality. Even before Daphne, a junior chef in a busy kitchen, witnesses a violent stabbing in a convenience store, she drinks hard, takes drugs and sleeps with whoever she wants. She rebuffs the attempts of anyone to get close to her – she deliberately and repeatedly gets the name of one hapless conquest wrong, before brushing his hand away like dandruff and stomping off into the night. She recoils from her well-meaning mother’s mindfulness DVD as if she has just been handed a bag of cold vomit. It’s tempting to draw parallels between Daphne in this striking first feature from Peter Mackie Burns and the protagonist in Carine Adler’s Under the Skin, who spirals into self-destruction after her mother’s death. But that would suggest a tragic, victim-like quality to Daphne which is simply not the case. Her main problem is an eye-rolling impatience that sees her bored with each experience – food, sex, conversation – before it has even finished. As such, this is almost as much a portrait of a city as it is a person – London, with its manifold distractions and endless scope for bad behaviour, is the ideal playground for the self-sabotaging thrill-seeker. But while it’s not easy being Daphne, or being around her, she’s a knotty character, articulately drawn. I particularly loved a moment when she grasps the remove between the way she sees herself and the way she’s perceived. Daphne identifies with the cool self-sufficiency of the snake she keeps in her flat. But to the wife of the stab victim she helped, she is pitiable – the runt kitten that is written off and kicked away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/20/lets-move-to-berwick-upon-tweed-northumberland","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T15:30:00Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland: it’s delightful","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/20/lets-move-to-berwick-upon-tweed-northumberland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/20/lets-move-to-berwick-upon-tweed-northumberland","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland: it’s delightful","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What’s going for it?

This is the frontier town, the most fought-over in Europe, scrapped over by the English and the Scots, and it has the town walls to prove it. Elizabeth I built them (not herself, obvs), with her eye on the Scots’ Auld Alliance with the French. The Union of the Crowns rendered them superfluous a few decades later, although people have long memories round here; the Scottish Borders tourist board offered £8,000 for the place in 2002 and Berwick might have become a border town once more, had the Scottish referendum turned out differently. All that back and forth has left this beautiful, stern, pragmatic place a muddied patch. The townsfolk’s accent hovers between Borders and Northumbrian burr, and, trivia geeks, Berwick Rangers are the only English football team who play in a Scottish league. Fact.

And for 34 years Irish feminists and their allies have been campaigning to end the shame and suffering that have been the fruits of our holy eighth amendment. In 2011 the Abortion Rights Campaign organised its first annual March for Choice in Dublin. The police told the media that only 500 people had attended, a figure easily contradicted by video evidence. The national press barely blinked at us. The following year the then taoiseach, Enda Kenny, told Time magazine that abortion was “not of priority” for his government. We were not on the radar. That year brought the senseless, preventable death of Savita Halappanavar during a miscarriage. The government reacted by passing the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, a ludicrously restrictive piece of legislation that was soon proved to be unfit for purpose. In response, the movement to “Repeal the 8th” grew louder and braver. Amanda Mellet and James Burke went before the UN human rights committee, alleging “cruel and degrading treatment” at the hands of the Irish state. They won. Women including Tara Flynn, Róisín Ingle, Susan Cahill and Helen Linehan publicly shared abortion stories. Anna Cosgrave’s iconic REPEAL shirts strutted unrepentantly through Irish towns. The March for Choice grew each year. And when it crosses the Liffey this Saturday, it will very certainly be on the radar. Since 2011 marchers have demanded a referendum on the eighth amendment. Now we have one. The current taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has announced a vote for May or June of next year. The question is – can we win? There are hopeful signs. The resounding success of 2015’s marriage equality referendum indicates a republic no longer willing to defer to the Catholic church on issues of sex and morality. An impartial citizens’ assembly, set up last year to examine the eighth amendment, delivered resoundingly liberal results. Polling indicates that up to 82% of the population favours some loosening of Ireland’s restrictive laws. Yet repealing the eighth is very far from a done deal. The marriage equality referendum had the support of every major Irish political party, with Kenny assuring the electorate that “there is nothing to fear for voting for love and equality”. In contrast, the repeal campaign is operating in an extremely hostile political environment. Varadkar has long been on public record as “pro-life”. Though his stance softened somewhat during his tenure as health minister – and he now admits fatal foetal abnormality and risks to women’s health are justifications for abortion – he remains an unsympathetic figure to preside over the referendum. The taoiseach has spuriously claimed that pro-choicers don’t understand what repealing the eighth amendment would entail. He refuses to acknowledge abortion as a class issue. He tends to respond to questions on abortion – a procedure that 92% of the time happens in the first trimester of pregnancy – by raising straw-man arguments about abortion on request up to birth, and he is fond of publicly reaffirming his belief in the rights of the unborn. In short, while the wording of the referendum text has yet to be confirmed, I wouldn’t be surprised if our even-handed political representatives decide on: “Do you want to give murderous harlots the right to kill innocent children temporarily residing in their uteri, when any one of those unborn children could be a future Nobel laureate?” What’s certain is that Varadkar will not be rushing to assure the Irish electorate that there is nothing to fear from voting for women’s bodily autonomy. The encouraging outcome of the citizens’ assembly should also be viewed critically. The assembly comprised 99 participants, chosen to represent the electorate demographically. Over a period of five months, they listened to a balanced series of experts. The assembly was widely regarded as a stalling tactic on the part of Kenny, who clearly didn’t want any more lady talk in parliament under his watch. The outcome surprised the country, with 64% of the participants agreeing that abortion should be accessible without restriction up to 12 weeks’ gestation. This is widely out of sync with polls, where only 23% of the population agree that abortion should be available on request. Mary Laffoy, then a supreme court judge who presided over the assembly, has vehemently denied that participants were subjected to partial information. It seems that if you put 99 people in a room and expose them to expert testimony from various ideological camps, they will come out pro-choice. This has given rise to some hope that the Irish middle ground will come to support best international medical practice. But I do not share this optimism. The electorate is not about to be educated in an objective manner on the science of foetal development or the philosophy of when life begins. Rather, it is about to be bombarded by emotive social media campaigns, campaigns that – as the tech journalist Gavin Sheridan points out – can potentially be funded to the tune of millions by foreign sources without regulation. A study of the 2016 US presidential election indicates that social media polarisation does not act equally on people to the left and right of the political spectrum. Conservatives consume less neutral or ideologically oppositional news than liberals, while liberals – more committed to journalistic standards and diverse viewpoints – read a comparatively balanced newsfeed. The end result skews right. I am not trying to make discouraging doomsday pronouncements. I believe we can win, and will be working every spare second to ensure we do. But this is no time for complacency. In a hostile political and technological environment, the repeal movement needs intelligent strategising and brave campaigning to reach those whose minds are not yet set. We have our referendum, and that’s an achievement in itself. Now let’s realistically assess the challenges that face us, and win it. • Emer O’Toole is assistant professor of Irish performance studies at Concordia University, in Canada, and author of Girls Will Be Girls"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/933","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T23:00:15Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 933","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/933","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/933","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 933","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/07/smart-home-wears-technology-lightly","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T10:00:18Z","webTitle":"What lies beneath: the smart home that wears its technology lightly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/07/smart-home-wears-technology-lightly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/07/smart-home-wears-technology-lightly","fields":{"headline":"What lies beneath: the smart home that wears its technology lightly","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Picture a tech-savvy home and you will probably envisage a slick, white cube where the blinds whirr up at a preset hour and sensors turn on the shower. But a smart home doesn’t have to be robotic and flashy. “We wanted to use technology to make life easier,” says Gigi Sutherland of the home she and her partner, Matt Sellers, redesigned in East Sussex. With walls clad in basic building materials, the mood here is far from futuristic. The rough and ready aesthetic has hidden depths, though, from concealed speakers and motion sensors to app-controlled energy and security systems. The house dates from the 1950s and, while the building itself is not so special, it backs on to Camber Sands. “It was just a set of boxy rooms and two garages,” says Sutherland, a stylist. “We wanted to join up the spaces and integrate the garages into the house.” The pair rebuilt the interior from scratch. Walls are made from OSB, a type of chipboard, and plaster-like dark grey Artex. “It creates a tadelakt-style finish with a nice chalky texture,” says Sutherland. The flooring is grey poured concrete. Technology was integrated from the start, but it isn’t the main focus: fittingly, for this beachside house, it is all about helping its owners to switch off. A wood-burning stove provides old-school heat in the living room (above). Elsewhere, an app, MiHome (mihome4u.co.uk), operates the 300‑litre MegaFlo boiler and Haverland RCTT radiators; it uses geofencing technology to send a signal to the wifi-enabled radiator valves to turn them on or off when the couple are a certain distance from home. “When we reach a GPS point – we chose about 16 miles from the front door – they turn on, so it is warm when we arrive,” says Sutherland. “For us, old‑fashioned timers would waste energy, because we don’t always get home at the same time every day.” App‑linked energy monitors on the radiators give an instant snapshot of how much electricity is being used. “If I’m away from the house, I can look on my phone and see instantly if, say, we have left the hot water on,” says Sutherland. Tucked out of sight on the living room ceiling, a projector screen slides down at the touch of a button, partnered with a Benq 3D HD projector (benq.co.uk). “It’s like being at the cinema, but with a wood burner and comfy sofas,” says Sutherland. The screen plays DVDs, Blu-rays, YouView TV or images streamed via a five-channel Yamaha RX-V473 AV receiver. The sofas are from Ikea, the cushions from marimekko.com and the Vitra bench – used here as a coffee table – by George Nelson. The framed print is from playtype.com. The entrance hall (above) is painted in Bedec’s multisurface paint in satin black, available at brewers.co.uk. For similar vintage wall hooks and bench, try Sunbury antiques market. The hammam towels are from thesilversheep.co.uk. Solar-powered motion sensors light up the decking, just off the kitchen/dining area (above), while a Yale (yale.co.uk) SR-330 smart home alarm with PIR – passive infrared – motion detectors and camera are part of a security system that, again, is linked to the owners’ phones. “If a sensor is triggered, it sends us an alert, along with an image of the area,” says Sutherland. They recently spotted someone having a good nose around. “There’s a built-in speaker, so I said: ‘Hello, can I help you?’ They quickly disappeared.” At the front of the house is an HD video doorbell from Ring (ring.com), which can be answered from anywhere via a phone, PC or tablet. “I can see and talk to someone at the door without them knowing whether I’m busy inside or away from the house,” says Sutherland. “It’s useful for asking couriers to leave a delivery by the door – and even better for politely sending cold callers on their way.” Small but powerful Pioneer S-HS100 speakers are concealed in every room, even on the decking outside.The AV receiver that is used to screen films also plays music via Spotify or iTunes in every room and is controlled from the pair’s phones or tablets. They have playlists for every room. With so much tech linked to their phones, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that, when the couple rewired the house, they chose plug sockets that include USB ports for most rooms (then attached a bunch of power cords) to make charging easy (above). This has the added advantage of leaving the three‑pin sockets free.

This Urdu word, also recognised in Persian and Arabic, has gently invaded Manchester, glowing in neon at the entrances to three of its museums. Waqas Khan, who created this public artwork, hopes it will reassure people there is nothing to be scared of in Manchester’s cultural sanctums. Even if you don’t read Urdu, you somehow understand it is a message of love. So accept the welcome. Pass under the Khushamdeed sign and enter Manchester Art Gallery, where Khan’s first solo show in Britain is a visionary voyage to the ends of the universe and the depths of the soul. Stars and galaxies, moons and mountains shimmer in his extraordinary drawings – or do they? These forms all appear and vanish as you explore the intricate and rich world of an artist who is creating something stupendous and unique: perhaps the greatest abstract art of our time. That he is making this art in his Lahore studio in months and years of solitary labour, hunched over a drawing board, does not mean he should be seen as simply an Islamic artist, but the religious and mystical power of his art is inescapable. That same spiritual intensity blazes in the paintings of Rothko and Mondrian – two great abstract artists with whom Khan, as his art grows in grandeur and complexity, deserves to be compared. If that makes Khan sound forbiddingly high-modernist, think again. His drawings are thrillingly accessible. There is a simple pleasure in looking at his endlessly varied and subtle patterns of dots and lines that add up to networks of circles or calligraphy-like marks – and then, when you stand further back, into what might be maps of mountains and rivers, pages from gigantic books, or planetary bodies. It all depends how closely you look. The complexity of this visual experience is rare in today’s art. The biggest works here are the same size as epic abstract canvases or murals. You feel their authority the moment you see them. Go close and the sheer work the artist has put in is staggering, for every tiny detail on these huge interconnected sheets of paper has been conjured with precise penmarks. Go really close and a work that portrays what might be a distant galaxy, in white ink on black paper, becomes the silken architecture of a spider’s web. Gaze at a stretched oval moon, also in white on black, and your eyes enjoy the mottled contours of its cratered surface – even as your brain can see perfectly well that these are not craters but a network of floating circles. Time stops. It is a little bit like daydreaming over a Chinese landscape painting. Then again, the illusory games make me think of MC Escher, or the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci. I am not chucking in these comparisons lightly. Khan is only in his mid-30s but these astounding creations show that he is growing into a great artist. The Khushamdeed signs Khan has put up all over Manchester announce not just his exhibition but parallel solo shows by South Asian artists. Also at Manchester Art Gallery is a multi-channel film by Neha Choksi of her and her friends playing about on the building site of an unfinished ashram, as well as Hetain Patel’s meditations on his childhood fascination with Spiderman. There’s a lot more going on in the paintings of Risham Syed, who, like Khan, works in Lahore. Both owe something to miniaturist painting techniques that go back to the Mughal court: Syed uses them to create hyperrealist postcard-sized pictures of the houses of Lahore’s elite. Seen from behind, the fine houses turn out to be gimcrack cowboy jobs. At the Whitworth – past another neon welcome – Raqs Media Collective create a dazzling magic-realist history of the world. The fragments of this pulsing four-dimensional montage include ash-black biscuits from the Paris Commune (also on sale at the cafe, if you dare) and a video of a man and woman both naked except for deep-sea diving helmets. Outside the gallery, they have erected hollowed out and decapitated colonial statues that watch a world and a city they never imagined could exist. Waqas Khan is at Manchester Art Gallery from 30 September.

Do they see him as some Churchillian English gent who lives in Downton Abbey and has managed to single-handedly secure Brexit against the efforts of the entire political establishment by sheer force of personality and capital? I can see why Farage is in the US. It makes perfect sense for a man raging against the dying of the light at home. For people like Farage, who occupy that precarious territory where they are ubiquitous but don’t actually do much apart from writing the odd semi-literate column in a tabloid or website, or a brief weekly radio phone-in show, the launch of a US career is the klaxon that things might not be going too well. And if you see them on Fox News then the suspicion is confirmed. Fox News is Britain’s dumping ground for those who would rather be relevant in a garbage can than irrelevant outside one. That’s all I hear when people like Farage talk about how many supporters or followers they have on social media. I am relevant! Who cares how I got there or what I have to keep doing, if I don’t get attention then what am I? Merely a husk who has abandoned all sense of self and moral responsibility in exchange for some limelight. I cannot go back now, the breadcrumb trail to redemption has been lost and so I must press on. Nothing is too putrid for Farage, from backing a virulently rightwing homophobe running for senate to addressing far right rallies in Germany. There was something tragically poetic about the fact that not a moment after Farage celebrated his one millionth follower on Twitter this week, it was revealed that over half were bots. Just Nigel and his fake friends chasing the caboose end of the train trying to catch a ride. I don’t know who you think you are paying for, America. We’re not talking great intellect here, or success. He describes himself as “separated and skint”. He lives in Single Street (I know, leave it) :around the corner from his mother”. His Wikipedia page includes the entries “Ukip leadership and resignations” (plural), “expense disclosure”, “undeclared gifts”, “car tampering” (where his wheel came loose and he said it was foul play, a claim unsupported by the police or his mechanic), and “tax avoidance”. Plus a long list of “not elected”s for parliament from 1994-2015. The preparation for this illustrious career is privileged – Farage is no establishment outsider. He is the son of a stockbroker and attended the eye-wateringly expensive private school Dulwich College which, as of 2016, costs almost £40,000 for full board and hovers around the 45th ranking of the best schools in the UK list. After graduating from this overpriced creche he then went on to a modestly successful career as a City trader before entering politics. Sorry to break it to you America, you’re not getting some wily hacker of the establishment from the fringes. You’re not getting our Bruce Wayne. You’re not even getting Alfred. But let’s not get too hasty. Perhaps his schtick will be so successful he will be absorbed full time into the American freak show and stop spreading toxic waste here in the UK. Every time I sigh when I see a British diamond in the rough who couldn’t get enough traction in the UK and had to move to the US to be appreciated (Riz Ahmed, John Boyega, Daniel Kaluuya, Idris Elba), I remember that the US has also taken others: James Corden, Louise Mensch and now Nigel Farage. Not to mention Piers Morgan, who, alas, even the Americans couldn’t stand. Whenever I think of Morgan’s return, I remember the scene at the beginning of the Sound of Music when Captain von Trapp asks Maria to change before meeting the children because her dress is too shabby. She says she gave all her other dresses to the poor when she joined the abbey. “What about this one?” he says, gesturing towards the dress she was wearing. She replies “the poor didn’t want this one.” So, perhaps we shouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. If he prefers America to the UK, then I, for the first time, am happy that he’s finally getting what he wants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/27/benjamin-mendy-manchester-city-extended-absence-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-27T11:10:20Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Mendy to see knee specialist as Manchester City fear extended absence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/27/benjamin-mendy-manchester-city-extended-absence-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/27/benjamin-mendy-manchester-city-extended-absence-injury","fields":{"headline":"Benjamin Mendy to see knee specialist as Manchester City fear extended absence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City face a serious blow as fears grow at the club that Benjamin Mendy faces a lengthy absence due to a knee injury. Pep Guardiola’s team have made an impressive start to the season after winning eight of their nine matches so far, with Mendy featuring in five of the victories. Yet the France defender was forced off from Saturday’s 5-0 win over Crystal Palace and despite City initially being optimistic that Mendy’s problem was not serious, the left-back will now fly to Barcelona to see specialist doctor Ramon Cugat on Thursday. Mendy was taken off against Palace in the 29th minute after a tackle with Andros Townsend but on Monday Guardiola discussed the possibility of a late fitness test regarding his availability for Tuesday’s Champions League group game with Shakhtar Donetsk at the Etihad Stadium. City won 2-0 but Mendy did not feature after the club’s medical department ruled he needs further examination. After the win over Donetsk, Guardiola said: “Our first impression [is he] will be a little bit long, out of the picture, unfortunately for us. I don’t know, we will wait until Thursday, but I am pretty sure it will be longer than we would like, unfortunately.” Some reports on Wednesday suggested that the former Monaco defender has ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament, although Mendy himself dismissed that on Twitter. Mendy, bought for around £52m in the summer, has been pivotal in City’s flying start. A prolonged absence would weaken Guardiola’s defensive resources as Vincent Kompany has again been ruled out with a calf injury. The manager can call on Danilo, another summer purchase who can play on the left, though against Shakhtar he preferred Fabian Delph. His other options might be to operate a wingback system featuring Leroy Sané or Raheem Sterling. Cugat has previously treated Gabriel Jesus, Vincent Kompany and Kevin De Bruyne, with Guardiola particularly trusting of him. Of Delph’s display against Donetsk Guardiola said: “I have a theory - midfield players, when they are intelligent, can play everywhere because they understand the global situation. “He played an amazing game. I am so happy for him. Last season he was injured a lot of the time and when he was fit maybe I didn’t count too much on him. That was my personal regret. He deserved more minutes.” City travel to Chelsea on Saturday for their seventh Premier League match. The encounter with the champions should offer the sternest test yet of their credentials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/29/young-women-poverty-mental-health-pay-jobs-debt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"For young women, poverty and poor mental health are a fact of life | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/young-women-poverty-mental-health-pay-jobs-debt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/29/young-women-poverty-mental-health-pay-jobs-debt","fields":{"headline":"For young women, poverty and poor mental health are a fact of life","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Whenever anyone says tritely that money can’t buy happiness, I wonder to myself if they have ever been truly skint. Solvency doesn’t guarantee happiness, to be sure, but grinding poverty and constant financial anxiety certainly make it very difficult. I know, I’ve been there, and members of my family still are. Just being able to afford the basics without facing that constant gnawing panic makes a hell of a difference to your general sense of wellbeing. The latest report for Young Women’s Trust – a charity that supports women aged 16-30 who are in poverty, or on low or no pay – paints a glum picture. The Worrying Times (and never has a name been more apt) shows that a third of young people feel more anxious now than this time last year, with Brexit, money worries and housing the dominant reasons. Low pay and insecure jobs are on the rise, with a third of young people saying they have been offered a zero-hours contract, more than half worrying about their earnings, a quarter in constant debt and one in 10 skipping meals. Financial anxiety, by definition, is an issue of mental health. It’s heartbreaking to think that almost four in 10 young people say they feel “worn down”, not words that those who are supposed to be at an exciting, carefree stage in their lives should be using to describe their day-to-day existence. Poverty has a habit of seeping into every aspect of your life – your diet suffers, your energy is sapped from constant worrying, and your lack of funds exacerbates loneliness and isolation. The bureaucracy you face is labyrinthine and all-consuming, the systems in place and the hoops you have to jump through feel designed to humiliate. The way you are spoken to by people employed to help you can be so rude and uncaring that it brings you to tears. Perhaps you can’t afford tampons or toilet paper, sometimes stealing the latter from work. Your home might be cold and damp, causing a cough you just can’t shake. Your children, if you have them, often go without. It’s unsurprising, then, that 45% of young women and 36% of young men are concerned about their mental health. Jenny, 27, a support worker who lives in Brighton, is one such young woman. “I am constantly worried about money,” she tells me. “From the time payday comes to the day before payday. My salary isn’t the best … so after rent and bills, I’m not left with a huge amount for general living costs. “I do suffer with depression and anxiety anyway, and money has always been a huge contributing factor to that … I know there is a big link between depression and spending, and I do find that when I’m particularly low, I spend money on things that I think will make me feel better – but obviously, it contributes to my debt and makes me feel worse in the long run. I’m always worried about how I will ever get out of debt or be able to buy a house when I can’t even get out of my overdraft. It stops me sleeping too; I lie awake just thinking about how I’ll get to the next payday.” It’s strange, in an era so focused on identity politics, that when activists speak of struggle, working-class women are so often forgotten. Austerity has hit them the hardest, they shoulder most of the caring burden, and many face gender discrimination to boot. Nearly half of young mothers regularly skip meals because they struggle to feed their children, and 27% of mothers aged 16-24 were using food banks or had used them in the past. Our financial system depends on their domestic labour, yet they are so often voiceless and forgotten. It is shameful. It is young women of the lowest socio-economic group, DE, who were most worried about their mental health and who were most likely to report it worsening. These are not the kinds of people who are splurging on brunch and holidays – stereotypes that most young people find infuriating. Of course, this is not the first generation to have suffered poverty. Many of us will have grown up knowing that our parents and grandparents went through difficult times when they were young and renting, or newly married and at the bottom of the career ladder. To an extent, youth is by its very nature a time of instability; you’re still working out where you’d like to be and how you’d like to look. But expensive housing and cost of living mean that what this generation faces goes beyond any usual struggle. The evidence that today’s young people are worse off than our parents were is indisputable. Labour has succeeded in galvanising young people, many of them part of what is termed the “precariat”. Their latest commitments to social housing and rent controls is welcome. But there is more that could be done to help the hundreds of thousands of younger people suffering from the effects of low pay and high living costs. Raising the apprenticeship pay rate from the paltry £3.50 an hour would be a start. Giving young people equal pay, so that they don’t have to wait until they are 25 to be eligible for the national living wage, would also help. Equalising financial support for jobseekers is crucial – housing benefit for 18-21s should be reintroduced, as should maintenance grants for students. There needs to be a crackdown on exploitative, zero-hours contracts and casual work, and – as the Guardian’s coverage of the country’s growing debt problem demonstrates – we urgently need to be giving pupils financial education in schools, such as teaching them the ins and outs of consumer credit agreements. For the moment, however, young women like Jenny will continue to lie awake at night, wondering how they’ll ever make it to payday. • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist Comments on this thread will be premoderated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/28/maysaloun-hamoud-female-director-israel-palestine","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T17:14:03Z","webTitle":"How sex, drugs and politics earned In Between's director a fatwa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/28/maysaloun-hamoud-female-director-israel-palestine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/28/maysaloun-hamoud-female-director-israel-palestine","fields":{"headline":"How sex, drugs and politics earned In Between's director a fatwa","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The freedom to love who you want or live how you like does not come, says Maysaloun Hamoud, without consequence. The Palestinian film-maker has caused a sensation with her debut feature In Between, the story of three young Arab women living together in Tel Aviv, by determinedly breaking the stereotype of what that reality is and what its consequences look like on screen. Salma, Laila and Nour – the sullen lesbian DJ, the sexy criminal lawyer and the strait-laced hijabi student – might sound like the setup of a joke without a punchline, but theirs is a fresh, little-seen take on breaking rules and taking risks in the underground party scene of their city. “When the movie was released in Israel and Palestine, it was like a bomb for both sides,” says Hamoud, her hands flicking for emphasis. “There were walkouts. It was a shock to the system for Palestinian society, about rebelling from the mainstream, and people feeling shame about themselves. But a lot of people – women, gay people, alternative scenes – were just so pleased it represented them.” Shot in just 26 days and premiered at Toronto film festival the same year, In Between’s acclaim on the festival circuit was almost assured from the off. The film has been boycotted back home, decreed haram by religious leaders and earned Hamoud the first fatwa to be issued in Palestine since 1948. It has been buoyed by controversy – “The mess was good publicity,” Hamoud admits – over its presentation of Muslim and Christian Arab women in spiky, subversive roles. But that hype – as fun as it is – also undermines Hamoud’s obvious talent: the film is compelling because it’s so skilfully understated, and the cast (about 90% of whom were in front of a camera for the first time) are so good. Few scenes seem more seductive in films than the ones that casually nail a universal truth on youth or lust – or both – in an original way and In Between seems built on them. Accessorised by sunglasses, cigarettes and coffee, Hamoud is sharp company. We meet on a north London canalside on a crisp autumn morning, overlooking the ducks and houseboats, which she finds kookily quaint. It is a surprise to her that she is still asked – twice the night before, once at a screening Q&amp;A and then on Newsnight – whether she expected her film to resonate. “Western audiences seem to want to feel they are better, that their hopes and dreams are unique and different and authentic to ours,” she says. “It is not true. We are human beings with the same stories, same dilemmas, we have the same feelings. Every big city has the underground culture I show – we hear the same music, there are the same drugs, in each country. The film is successful all over the world because people can relate.” She buzzes with stories of young people who have contacted her since watching the film. It’s worth all the stick. “I was criticised for taking Israeli government funding to make it. But that money is ours, we should take more. We don’t take what we deserve.” The main problem for her critics, she thinks, is that she, and her three female characters in the film, won’t be quiet or subdued. “Feminism is political because whoever is in charge has a position of power. When you try to change the status quo, and let the women lead and challenge male authority, of course it is fucking political in society. But I want to show a different way to be, of what a Palestinian woman looks like, and to break the victim ideal.” The daughter of Communist Palestinian parents who was born and largely grew up in Budapest, Hungary before heading to university in Jerusalem for Middle Eastern studies, Hamoud knows she comes from a place of privilege. “Art is about challenging and changing,” she says, “and I’m lucky to do it.” Her own life was flipped after “a dramatic health issue”, after which she dropped out of her course and went to Tel Aviv to study cinema. Her passion for 90s Hollywood films and B-movies finally seems to be paying off; In Between has won awards at the Toronto, San Sebastian, Haifa and Cannes film festivals. It opened on seven screens across Britain on Friday, and is showing at 28 screens this week, with more cinemas picking it up nationwide. Fans queued in lines snaking around the ICA for the screening hosted there and Hamoud is already working on the second film of an In Between trilogy. “The community I show in the film has developed in the last 10 years – and I’m proud of it,” she says. “The generation younger than us has more freedom than I had, and I wanted to bring that fresh blood to Arab cinema. I just captured life.” In Between is in cinemas now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/29/britons-in-eu-hail-mays-big-step-forward-on-residency-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Britons in EU hail May’s ‘big step forward’ on residency rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/29/britons-in-eu-hail-mays-big-step-forward-on-residency-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/29/britons-in-eu-hail-mays-big-step-forward-on-residency-rights","fields":{"headline":"Britons in EU hail May’s ‘big step forward’ on residency rights","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Campaigners for the rights of British nationals in Europe have urged the EU to reciprocate a “significant” offer from the government to allow them continued freedom of movement to retire or live in another country in the bloc after Brexit. They made their call after Theresa May appeared to respond to a letter they sent following her Florence speech imploring her to make a gesture that would break the logjam in talks. Under the offer, unveiled after the close of Brexit talks this week, EU citizens settled in the UK following Brexit would no longer be stripped of their rights to permanent residency if they move abroad for more than two years, for example for work or to look after an ill relative. The offer was described as a “big step forward” by British in Europe, which campaigns for the preservation of rights of 1.2 million Britons on the continent. “We are delighted,” the group said in a statement. It hopes the move will pave the way to persuading the EU that Britons already settled in Europe should continue to have freedom of movement after Brexit. Britons have expressed fear that the loss of free movement rights would mean they are “locked in” to an EU member state to which they have emigrated, preventing them from returning to Britain to look after elderly relatives for a period of more than two years, or unable to retire to another EU country without going through immigration procedures for third-country nationals. “We are delighted to hear that the UK government has shown the flexibility that we asked for on free movement and has offered guaranteed rights of return to EU citizens in the UK with the hope that the EU will respond with onward rights of free movement for UK citizens in the EU,” said Jane Golding, the chair of the group. “This is what we asked for in our letter to Theresa May last week: we asked for a gesture to remove the logjam, and it looks like they have listened.” Activists lobbying for the rights of EU citizens living in the UK said it was “really positive” that the two-years-and-out rule could no longer apply after Brexit. They also welcomed the announcement by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, that those who had endured the ordeal of applying for permanent residency would not have to “go through the whole process again” when it comes to registration after Brexit. “There was a real sense that progress was made. We really welcome that,” said Nicolas Hatton, the co-founder of the3million, which campaigns for EU citizens in the UK. “There is still work to do though,” he added. Last month fewer than half of the issues on the table at the UK-EU talks were agreed. Official documents released on Thursday show that 47 of 60 issues are now agreed. “We have made real progress which will enable citizens to live their lives broadly as before,” Davis said at a press briefing. The3million also welcomed the promise that EU citizens’ legacy rights would be enshrined in law, with UK courts allowed to take rulings by the European court of justice into account. “This agreement on direct effect is really positive and a key part of what we have been asking for. It means that if there is a change of heart at the government or at the Home Office, we will be able to challenge it in the UK courts,” said Hatton. The Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress have issued a joint appeal to Brexit negotiators to resolve the issue of future citizens’ rights as a matter of urgency. They said EU citizens affected by Brexit were caught up in an intolerable round of “human poker”. In a rare joint statement, the CBI’s director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, and the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said the UK and the EU needed to issue a clear guarantee within weeks that citizens could carry on living where they are. Barnier said on Thursday that although good progress had been made in the fourth round of talks, there still had not been sufficient progress on three key issues – the role of the European court of justice, family reunification rights and the future registration system for EU citizens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/28/in-defence-of-peoples-quantitative-easing","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T17:47:38Z","webTitle":"In defence of People’s Quantitative Easing | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/in-defence-of-peoples-quantitative-easing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/28/in-defence-of-peoples-quantitative-easing","fields":{"headline":"In defence of People’s Quantitative Easing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two comments on my letter concerning the use of People’s Quantitative Easing to buy out PFI (27 September) in your paper on 28 September require a response. Martin Wheatcroft says that the Bank of England reserve deposits of our clearing banks, which is where most QE funds are now located, have interest paid on them, meaning that People’s QE is not costless, and that cost could rise, considerably. He makes three mistakes. First, interest is only paid by Bank of England discretion. It could withdraw or limit it. Second, he quotes nominal and not inflation-adjusted interest rates, and it is adjusted rates that matter overall for People’s QE because they indicate the real cost. Third, he assumes UK interest rates will rise without QE being unwound, and that is exceptionally unlikely. His scenario will not come to pass: if rates were as high as he suggests there would be no QE-generated funds in the Bank of England on which interest would be due. Tim Worstall also makes a mistake. He says big business does not use gilts for cash management. That’s true if nominal ownership of long-term funds is taken into account. But that’s because big business only makes use of these gilts overnight, when the massive “repo” market, which places the cash of these companies on deposit while the world sleeps, makes extensive use of, and is entirely dependent upon, the availability of government-backed gilts to make that market work. My critics are making use of highly selective and unrealistic evidence. I stand by my arguments. Professor Richard Murphy Professor of practice in international political economy, City, University of London; Director, Tax Research UK • I have never been a chartered accountant, but I am a gardener. The dispute between Richard Murphy and Martin Wheatcroft over “People’s QE” seems to me to turn on the question of who tends and who owns the magic money tree garden, the chancellor of the exchequer or the governor of the Bank of England. The magic money that funds quantitative easing, once in circulation, effectively redeems the debt (the “promise to pay the bearer” is met). At that point the paper debt becomes pure fiction, the waters muddied only by the question of which part of the state apparatus, the government or its putatively independent central bank, ultimately owns it. Just as the government sets the Bank’s remit, it can – if necessary, through act of parliament – instruct it to write off the debt.

Since his election as leader, Corbyn has been reluctant to discuss the reasons for his euroscepticism, preferring instead to focus on sovereignty, and the need to accept the democratic will of the British people expressed in the 2016 referendum. But in a break with this recent reticence, Corbyn told the Andrew Marr Show the single market “has within it restrictions in state aid and state spending. That has pressures on it through the European Union to privatise rail for example and other services.” Asked to cite specific examples, he said “there are issues of state aid rules which are endlessly disputed”. His analysis has immediately been attacked by remain MPs such as Chuka Umunna who say he is peddling “absurd myths” about EU opposition to state aid, a view shared by many Labour MEPs. Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College London, said the argument that EU state aid rules would constrain Labour’s manifesto pledges on nationalisation is “nonsense”. “We are dealing with a union that includes the French and the Germans and they wouldn’t tolerate that level of economic interference in their economic model,” said Menon. Yet the claim that the EU is a capitalist workers’ club and a neo-liberal straitjacket has a long lineage within the Labour party and trade union movement, dating back to Tony Benn and Michael Foot. The contemporary Bennite Brexiters include some – but by no means all – allies of Corbyn in the shadow cabinet, a small group of older leftwing MPs, as well as a few unions, mainly outside the Labour party, such as the RMT and Fire Brigades Union. Some groups, such as the Communist party of Great Britain, also hold this view. During the election campaign, the Communist party general secretary Robert Griffiths hailed Corbyn’s declarations that “Britain can be better off after Brexit” and “Labour will build a better Brexit”. The view is also set out in LabourFutures, most frequently by Danny Nicol, professor of public law at the University of Westminster. “In Article 106, the EU prohibits public monopolies exercising exclusive rights where this violates EU competition rules,” claimed Nicol. The most recent British controversy about state aid concerned the threatened Redcar steelworks where the pro-European business minister Anna Soubry said “overly strict EU state-aid rules” meant the UK could not apply for help. Redcar campaigners insisted this view was incorrect, since the Italian and French states subsidised their steel industries, and such help is allowed so long as the cash is given for a specific reason, rather than a general subsidy, Two lawyers expert in EU state aid law, Andy Tarrant and Andrea Biondi, say they have tested 26 economic proposals in the 2017 manifesto to see if they fall foul of any EU law. They conclude most do not even potentially fall within the scope of the state aid rules. They believe there are only two measures which would even have to be notified: the state investment bank/regional bank proposition and the state funded regional energy suppliers. It is likely that both could be structured to be cleared. They point out that the UK would have to triple the amount it spends on state aid to match the proportion of GDP which Germany spends on aid. Equally there are over 800 companies with state ownership in the EU. The European commission says it has never had a policy on privatisation – a stance that dates back to the founding text six European leaders signed during the cold war. Nevertheless, the EU does have an agenda on the economy. “There is something structurally capitalist about the EU, because one of the drivers that has pushed the [European] court forward in its jurisprudence has been market making,” Prof Menon said, but and pointed out the EU’s pro-competition stance is often aimed at protecting consumers. In a twist lost on no-one in Brussels, the EU’s pro-liberalisation stance reflects the influence of British prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair. Conservative and Labour ministers set the agenda on opening energy, telecoms, railways and postal services to the chill winds of competition. In France and Belgium, in contrast, state-controlled companies still run the railways and deliver the mail. Labour ministers fought hard to keep Britain’s opt-out from the EU’s working time directive, an exemption secured by John Major. Nonetheless, while Brussels says it has no policy on privatisation, it is pushing policies that open the door to private providers. From 2023, all contracts to run rail services should be open to tender by public and private operators. However, in true EU style, there are exceptions, when authorities can prove the line is not “fit for competition”. Lord John Monks, the veteran trade union leader, said: “There are no strict rules binding Corbyn, but there is a philosophy [in Brussels] that nationalisation is a bad thing. That said, we never noticed anyone being stopped from doing anything.” He pointed to a German scheme to protect jobs during the financial crisis and France, “which has done what it’s always done”. In 2003, the French government saved engineering company Alstom from bankruptcy in 2003, although the plans had to be re-written to satisfy Brussels. The EU also allowed bank bailouts during the financial crisis, although a 2017 bailout of two Italian banks was widely criticised as abandoning EU rules intended to safeguard taxpayers’ cash."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/29/from-clueless-to-tarantino-why-the-90s-was-hollywoods-fairytale-decade","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"From Clueless to Tarantino: why the 90s was Hollywood’s fairytale decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/from-clueless-to-tarantino-why-the-90s-was-hollywoods-fairytale-decade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/29/from-clueless-to-tarantino-why-the-90s-was-hollywoods-fairytale-decade","fields":{"headline":"From Clueless to Tarantino: why the 90s was Hollywood’s fairytale decade","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cinema is once again mining its recent past for hits. Joel Schumacher’s 1990 medic-goth thriller Flatliners is the latest cult classic to be remade for a contemporary audience. Almost three decades on, the original – in which a group of medical students deliberately kill and then revive themselves in order to report back on the afterlife – resembles in parts a crossover episode between Buffy and Holby City. But in the shiny 2017 sequel, the gritty, steamy streets have been replaced by brightly lit high-rises, its rudimentary computers have been given an upgrade, and the astonishing amount of angular yet floppy hair sported by Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Billy Baldwin has been closely cropped for more austere times. Sutherland pops up in the new film, too, although the starring roles go to Ellen Page, Rogue One’s Diego Luna and Happy Valley’s James Norton. It is, so far, untainted by reviews, as it did not screen in advance for critics, which is rarely a sign of confidence in its merits. Yet it’s unlikely to matter too much if the film is not great. As Hollywood gets increasingly caught up in reboots and remakes, Flatliners is just one of a number of 90s hits to be lined up for a do-over, with a nostalgic audience ready to revisit it. Following in Jurassic Park reboot Jurassic World’s phenomenally successful jungle footsteps is a return for the 1995 Robin Williams hit Jumanji, which has been revived for Christmas as Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, starring Jack Black and Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson with a retro video game in place of the board game. Tim Curry played It in 1990; the Andy Muschietti remake has already become the highest-grossing horror film of all time, a rare success in an otherwise flat summer for the box office. Over the past few years, there have been reports of development deals and scripts for remakes of everything from Sister Act to I Know What You Did Last Summer (although both projects have since gone quiet), while new versions of Blade, The Crow, The Craft and White Men Can’t Jump are said to be making progress after a few false starts. One reason films from the 90s hold such appeal is that they seem to depict a simpler, more innocent time. “A lot of these films were written by baby boomers, so even if someone had a dead-end job, they were still able to afford accommodation, they lived in a nice neighbourhood. Even if they were struggling, their problems were quite superficial,” says Elizabeth Sankey, who worked on Beyond Clueless, a 2014 documentary about teen movies that focused heavily on the mid-to-late 90s. Sankey is currently directing a documentary about romantic comedies and has noticed a stark change in tone. “Later on, we had romcoms like Trainwreck, where the problem with the woman that needs to be fixed is that she’s an alcoholic. But in the 90s it was like, Oh, she’s really clumsy!” she says. It’s natural, of course, to be nostalgic for the era of film-making that accompanied your adolescence, as the 90s did mine, but there is a breadth and brilliance to much of the decade’s output that is unrivalled. In this paper last year, Steve Rose described the early 90s as a “golden age” for black cinema, as film-makers such as John Singleton and Julie Dash broke through. The 90s saw the emergence of an LGBT cinema movement, with mainstream, award-winning films such as The Birdcage and Boys Don’t Cry as well as cult slow-burners such as But I’m a Cheerleader. Spike Jonze, Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, David O’Russell, Noah Baumbach, Wes Anderson, Lisa Cholodenko, Alexander Payne, Lynne Ramsay, Darren Aronofsky, Sam Mendes and Todd Haynes all made their directorial feature debuts. Odd, experimental films with wild structures and often a leaning towards verbosity, such as Magnolia or Pulp Fiction or Being John Malkovich, were relatively mainstream successes. But it wasn’t just the arrival of a particularly strong new guard that made the era special. The dominant formula of smart-but-accessible was evident across genres. There was an avalanche of glossy, skilful and lubricious trashy thrillers such as Wild Things and Single White Female, with director Paul Verhoeven in particular embodying a kind of knowing mischief that allowed him both to titillate and to tease the audience for desiring titillation. The witty smut of Basic Instinct and Showgirls have aged surprisingly well, and that is to say nothing of his sci-fi satire Starship Troopers, which he described with evident pride last year as “the most expensive art movie ever made”. (He has been less than complimentary about a mooted remake that would be less satirical, saying it would “very much fit in with a Trump presidency”.) Like Starship Troopers, the action films released towards the end of the decade were filled with a millennial angst and political paranoia that appears both quaint, given the relatively sunny geopolitical climate of the time, and prescient. In the 2016 documentary Hypernormalisation, Adam Curtis compiles clips from Independence Day, Deep Impact, Armageddon and Godzilla of New York being terrorised or destroyed, just before he cuts to footage of 9/11. Outside of big-budget action, teen movies benefited from the era’s appetite for smartness and enjoyed a boom period of the kind not seen since Judd Nelson punched the air in The Breakfast Club. High-school films excavated literary classics, rather than just older high-school films, for their plots. Famously, Clueless is based on Jane Austen’s Emma, and anyone who saw Gwyneth Paltrow in the faithful 1996 adaptation will know that Amy Heckerling’s 1995 smash, starring Alicia Silverstone, did a far better job of telling the story. She’s All That was based on Pygmalion, while 10 Things I Hate About You made The Taming of the Shrew, one of Shakespeare’s most awkwardly sexist works, into a riot grrrl-referencing feminist-ish teen classic, complete with a Joan Jett soundtrack. With the Scream trilogy, Kevin Williamson made clever horror, using a deep awareness of the genre’s tropes and playing with the audience’s expectations of them. He bumped off the big-name star Drew Barrymore in the first few minutes for not knowing the correct answer to a quiz question about a horror film, and didn’t kill off the lead, Sydney, despite her having sex with her boyfriend, which would usually signpost imminent doom. The same meta approach is present, although to a lesser degree, in other teen horrors such as I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend and The Faculty. The Craft marked the convergence of horror and high school with Neve Campbell at the centre of the Venn diagram, and although its box office takings were disappointing, it had a long afterlife on VHS, and is responsible for more than one generation of girls dabbling in black lipstick and playing the “light as a feather, stiff as a board” sleepover game. “I think the 90s, like any other era of cinema, is remembered for a very small pocket of its output, in the same way that the 1980s wasn’t just Back to the Future and a bunch of movies where people wore bright neon bomber jackets,” says film-maker and critic Charlie Lyne, who directed Beyond Clueless. “I’m also very wary of my own biases; that a movie that came out during the 90s is much more likely to have then been watched on VHS and cherished by a teenage-me than a film that came out before or after that, therefore you get a certain inevitable attachment that is not necessarily reflective of any objective truth.” He does say, however, that two things happened in tandem during the 90s that he sees as significant and measurable shifts in movie history. The first is that more films were made for less money. “There is a massive lowering of the barrier to entry to make a fairly serviceable feature film. What constituted a low-budget film dropped massively during that period because of technological changes and the way the industry saw low-budget film-making, coming through festivals like Sundance. That was absolutely true in the teen genre, but also more widely, you did see an explosion in films that cost $5m and under making it to a wide audience.” Second, there were vast improvements in home video equipment, although it was just prior to the advent of DVDs. “That had an effect on film culture and the scope of film culture – people were more able to look backwards and to a broader swath of what was coming out at the time. All of those structural changes are distinct to that decade,” he explains. Sankey’s research for her romcom documentary has only cemented her view that the 90s were a fairytale decade. “Every single person I’ve interviewed for my film says they don’t want to get married, because they don’t have that stability in their lives. All of those things that make people feel uncomfortable about marriage are the reasons they like those films, because it felt like a much more simple, naive time.” She says that it isn’t just people who were young at the time clinging on to their halcyon days. There’s a sense of loss, too. “I think we are pining for a time we felt like we were going to get and never got. It’s a promise that was made to us by these films that we haven’t actually been able to achieve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/sep/30/robert-macfarlane-lost-words-children-nature","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"Badger or Bulbasaur - have children lost touch with nature?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/30/robert-macfarlane-lost-words-children-nature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/sep/30/robert-macfarlane-lost-words-children-nature","fields":{"headline":"Badger or Bulbasaur - have children lost touch with nature?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In August 1913 the children’s writer Eleanor Farjeon visited the poet Edward Thomas and his family at their home near the South Downs. On their first walk together, Thomas’s 11-year-old daughter Bronwen realised that the city-dwelling Farjeon knew few of the names of the wild flowers that flourished in the surrounding landscape. “My ignorance,” Farjeon recalled later, “horrified her.” Remedial work was promptly set. Bronwen gathered a hundred different flowers and plants, taught Farjeon their names (“agrimony, mouse-eared-hawkweed, bird’s-foot trefoil … ”), and the next day sat her down “to a neatly ruled examination paper, with the numbered specimens laid out in precise order on the table”. Farjeon was given an hour to complete the test: “60 for a Pass, 70 for Honours.” Her memory was sharp and she topped 90: “Bronwen was proud of me.” Those flower names would later blossom in Farjeon’s books for children, which are twined through with natural lore, notably her chalkland fairy fable, Elsie Piddock Skips in Her Sleep (1937) and her Martin Pippin stories. Nearly a century later, Cambridge researchers seeking to “quantify children’s knowledge of nature” surveyed a cohort of four- to 11-year-old children in Britain. The researchers made a set of 100 picture cards, each showing a common species of British plant or wildlife, including adder, bluebell, heron, otter, puffin and wren. They also made a set of 100 picture cards, each showing a “common species” of Pokémon character, including Arbok, Beedrill, Hitmonchan, Omanyte, Psyduck and Wigglytuff. The children were then shown a sample of cards from the two sets, and asked to identify the species for each card. The results were striking. Children aged eight and over were “substantially better” at identifying Pokémon “species” than “organisms such as oak trees or badgers”: around 80% accuracy for Pokémon, but less than 50% for real species. For weasel read Weedle, for badger read Bulbasaur – and this was before the launch of Pokémon Go. The researchers published their paper in Science. Their conclusions were unusually forthright – and tinged by hope and worry. “Young children clearly have tremendous capacity for learning about creatures (whether natural or manmade),” they wrote, but they are presently “more inspired by synthetic subjects” than by “living creatures”. They pointed to evidence linking “loss of knowledge about the natural world to growing isolation from it”. We need, the paper concluded, “to re-establish children’s links with nature if we are to win over the hearts and minds of the next generation”, for “we love what we know … What is the extinction of the condor to a child who has never seen a wren”? ❦ My first response on reading the “Pokémon paper”, as I have come to think of it, was dismay. My second was a wish to write a book for children that might conjure with the magic of “living creatures” rather than “synthetic subjects”. And my third was puzzlement. What had happened to the names and knowledge of nearby nature in the lives and reading of British children? Could they really have dwindled towards a vanishing point? Subsequent research has confirmed the Pokémon paper’s broad findings. In a 2008 National Trust survey, only a third of eight- to 11-year-olds could identify a magpie, though nine out of 10 could name a Dalek. A 2017 RSPB “Birdwatch” survey smartly shifted the focus, assessing nature knowledge in parents rather than children. Of 2,000 adults, half couldn’t identify a house sparrow, a quarter didn’t know a blue tit or a starling, and a fifth thought a red kite wasn’t a bird – but nine out of 10 said they wanted children to learn about common British wildlife. A 2017 Wildlife Trusts survey found a third of adults unable to identify a barn owl, three-quarters unable to identify an ash tree – and two-thirds feeling that they had “lost touch with nature”. The hunger is there but the knowledge is not. Where have these lost names gone, and does their vanishing matter? If so, how might we invigorate what anthropologist Beth Povinelli calls “a literacy of nature” in ourselves and our children? Was there ever a time when such a literacy existed? We read the results of these surveys, perhaps, with a mixture of consternation and insecurity. My own children can name a moorhen but not a collared dove, a blackbird but not a starling. They know oak but not hawthorn, beech but not ash. They like to recall the time in a wood when I confidently identified – from 10 yards away – a reddish object as a fly agaric toadstool. On closer inspection it turned out to be a discarded slice of water melon (I blamed my glasses). I know I would have hopelessly failed Bronwen’s flower test, despite living on chalk myself and loving the chalkland flora. For a decade or so now I have been fascinated by the relationships of naming, knowing and nature, writing a book on the subject called Landmarks in 2015. In the past few years I have become especially interested by these questions as they bear on contemporary childhood – and how they feature in what we uneasily call “children’s literature”, but which I prefer to think of as “literature read by children”, in a wish to avoid limiting or patronising the powers of that extraordinary, diverse body of work. I am unconvinced that children need names to need nature. The last chapter of Landmarks was entitled “Childish”. There, inspired by the work of an early years specialist called Deb Wilenski, I wrote about the “fantastical travelling” of a class of four- and five-year-old children in Hinchingbrooke Country Park, north Cambridgeshire. Each Monday for three months they explored the park, mapping it through their stories and drawings. I was fascinated by how the children wove words, images and actions together in their inhabitation of this modest landscape (bounded by a dual carriageway and a hospital car park). Given the chance, children will new-mint stories for nature and coin gleaming names for it. Given the chance, they will meet the living world eagerly with their bodies and minds, touching and eating and dreaming it: no Linnaeus necessary. But I also believe that names matter, and that the ways we address the natural world can actively form our imaginative and ethical relations with it. As George Monbiot wrote recently, calling for a “new language” to vivify conservation, “words possess a remarkable power to shape our perceptions”. Without names to give it detail, the natural world can quickly blur into a generalised wash of green – a disposable backdrop or wallpaper. The right names, well used, can act as portals – “hollowings”, in Robert Holdstock’s term – into the more-than-human world of bird, animal, tree and insect. Good names open on to mystery, grow knowledge and summon wonder. And wonder is an essential survival skill for the Anthropocene. Clearly the lack of natural literacy – especially of nearby nature – is involved with the major structural changes that have occurred in the experience of minority-world childhood. Online culture has boomed and screen time has soared. In Britain, the “roaming range” (the area within which children are permitted to play unsupervised) has shrunk by more than 90% in 40 years. Traffic growth, the pressures of school work, parental fears and the decrease of available green space have all helped close down wild play and the knowledge it brings. “The children out in the woods, out in the fields,” said Chris Packham in 2012, “enjoying nature on their own – they’re extinct”. Meanwhile, childhood wellbeing declines, with obesity rates rising and mental health dipping. The headline of a 2016 report (sponsored, notably, by Persil) was that British children “spend less time outdoors than prisoners”: climbing walls, not trees. Such buttonholing headlines disguise a complex picture, though. Access to nature is hugely unevenly distributed across the population, with class, income and ethnicity playing strong determining roles. Within “nature deficit” discourse, “tech” is too often simplistically opposed to “nature”, though it can act as accomplice rather than antagonist, and a lost golden age of barefoot childhood is too often presumed. Shocking headlines also occlude the hopeful signs and good work that are, to me at least, presently visible in Britain and beyond. In his influential book Last Child in the Woods, Richard Louv suggests that both adults and children have increasingly come to “regard nature as something to watch, to consume, to wear: to ignore”. Inevitably, such a shift – if it is a shift, rather than a new edition of an old problem – has consequences for imaginative territories as well as real ones. As children “abandon the sandlots and creekbeds, the alleys and woodlands”, asks Michael Chabon in his essay “The Wilderness of Childhood”, “what will become of the world of stories, of literature itself?” One answer to Chabon’s question might be found in the data sets provided by the annual 500 Words story competition, run by the BBC and Oxford University Press. This glorious story fest is open to five- to 13-year-olds, and typically attracts more than 120,000 entries, supplying an annual corpus of well over 50m words. Taken together, the stories offered remarkable insights into the communal imagination and vocabulary of Britain’s children. Plots and characters can be seen emerging and fading. It’s possible to drill down in the data to specific lexical choices, tracking the rise and fall of single words. In the 2017 stories, unsurprisingly, the word “Trump” starred, as well as a rich broth of variants including Trumpelstiltskin (respect!) and Trumpedo. In 2015 the most frequent characters were Wayne Rooney, Snow White, Adolf Hitler, Lionel Messi and Cinderella. “Oak” was the commonest natural term that year, used encouragingly often (3,975 usages). Down at the lower end, heading for disappearance, were “acorn” (293), “buttercup” (168), “blackbird” (167) and “conker” (155). One of the two most popular plots was achieving sudden internet fame after posting a YouTube video. As OUP noted when crowning “hashtag” as the 2015 Children’s Word of the Year, “new technology [is] increasingly at the centre of children’s lives”. Technology is miraculous, but – and – so too is the living world, including the everyday nature with which we share our everyday lives. And this aspect of the world’s wonder seems presently at the margins of many children’s experience, speech and stories. ❦ Nature, naming and dreaming are all tangled together in perhaps the most famous childhood reading scene in English literature. Jane Eyre is 10, and on the novel’s opening page she has retreated to read on the “window seat”, screened off by a heavy red curtain from the rest of the house. Seated cross-legged, she relishes the “double retirement” of her situation: behind a curtain and within a book. The book is Bewick’s History of British Birds, in which Thomas Bewick’s woodcuts of bird species are accompanied by name details and explanatory notes. As Jane turns the pages, her mind is set wandering: “Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting.” She imagines herself northwards, up into the white wastes of the Arctic, borne there on the wings of words and woodcut. “I feared,” she says wonderfully, “nothing but interruption.” Looking back, I see that many of my own “window seat” books – the ones I read as a child fearing only interruption – shared preoccupations with names and nature. I still owe my (wobbly) knowledge of knapweed and sweet pea to Cicely Mary Barker’s Flower Fairies. Arthur Ransome’s young citizen scientists in Coot Club inspired in me the wish, though not the application, to become a teenage naturalist. I also devoured stories of survivalism, especially BB’s Brendon Chase, in which three brothers live wild in an English forest for eight months, making their camp in an ancient oak. By far the most powerful books, though, were those in which nature mingled with the supernatural. For me these included John Masefield’s The Box of Delights and The Midnight Folk; TH White’s The Sword in the Stone; the novels of Alan Garner, especially The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Owl Service; Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea trilogy; Susan Cooper’s astonishing The Dark Is Rising series; and Robert Holdstock’s Mythago Wood and Lavondyss. These novels all took deep root in me as a child. Thirty-odd years on, they continue profoundly to shape my fascinations as a writer with deep place and deep time, with wildness, power and the more-than-human world. Questions of naming and nature return repeatedly in these books. On Le Guin’s archipelago of Earthsea, magic requires knowing “true names” in the Old Speech, the language spoken by dragons and gods. Early on the young wizard Ged realises that to name the natural world is to gain aspects of its power: When he found that the wild falcons stooped down to him from the wind when he summoned them by name, lighting with a thunder of wings on his wrist […] he hungered to know more such names […] the name of the sparrowhawk and the osprey and the eagle. Ged learns, though, that on Earthsea you must be careful of what you utter, because there names bind and “cannot be unsaid”. Power has to be used in “balance”, the vital principle of Earthsea’s thaumocracy. In Cooper’s The Dark Is Rising (1973) – truly a title for our times – knowing the “real names” of things is a form of defensive strength. Will Stanton, the novel’s boy hero, is saved from the Dark’s first assault by standing on a path known truly as “Oldway Lane”, and because his guardian, the magus Merriman, knows “the real name” of their foe. “The only way to disarm one of the creatures of the Dark,” Merriman tells Will, “is to call him or her by his real name.” And to Tallis – the mesmerising 13-year-old at the heart of Holdstock’s Lavondyss – what adults dismissively call her “name game” is of utter importance. To find her way into the forest of Ryhope that holds her lost brother, Tallis must intuit the “secret names” of each part of the landscape around it: “She had not known, until now, that every field, every tree, every stream had a secret name.” Her grandfather, on the eve of his death, writes Tallis an urgent letter. “The naming of the land is important,” he tells her there, “it conceals and contains great truths. I urge you to listen to the names when they whisper.” All of these books practise magical acts of natural naming. Occasionally in them, naming is taming: the enforced subjugation of a natural other. Mostly, though, naming enables adventures into the mysterious life worlds of different creatures, even different kinds of matter: Wart becoming trout and falcon in The Sword in the Stone, for instance, or Ged becoming hawk in Earthsea, or Tallis slipping between epochs and species via the “hollowings” she opens in Lavondyss – until at last she is absorbed into the sap and bark of the old wildwood itself. Such naming events – which embrace mystery rather than assert mastery – might remind us of the contrasting meanings of our verb “to identify”. In its taxonomic sense, it means “to recognise as belonging to a particular category or kind”. Used thus, it is a verb that holds subject and object in hierarchical distance. The verb has a transformative sense, though, where “to identify” is “to feel oneself to be, or to become, closely associated with or part of an other” (OED). This is the identification of which John Keats wrote in his letter to Benjamin Bailey of 1817: “If a sparrow come before my window, I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel.” Two years and a summer ago I began work with the artist Jackie Morris on a book called The Lost Words: A Spell-Book, about the magic of naming and nature. When we began, we knew only that we wanted to make a modern-day spell-book for the natural world – a book that might go some small way towards conjuring back the words, names and species that were being lost. We wanted to celebrate the “identifications” made possible by names that are, as Observer columnist Henry Porter put it, part of “the plain euphonious vocabulary of the natural world – and do not simply label an object but in some mysterious and beautiful way become part of it”. So Jackie and I chose 20 common names of 20 common species of creature and plant. Our choices formed a crooked almost-A-to-Z, from acorn and adder through bluebell, conker and kingfisher, to weasel, willow and wren. For each name I wrote a summoning spell, structured as an acrostic, to be read aloud by child to grown-up, grown-up to child, or even grown-up to grown-up. The act of reading out – of spell-speaking – was also an act of conjuring back. Because I am certainly not a poet, and do not want to be mistaken for thinking I am one, I always imagined my texts as “spells” or “charms” rather than “poems”. I wrote them to be spoken aloud, and often I wrote them by speaking them aloud – sounding them out while walking or waiting, seeing if they would stick in my mind as chants before putting them down on paper. The otter-spell slipped into my skull while I was walking over the Cairngorms with my father. The willow-spell arrived on the towpath of the River Lea, tramping the unglamorous bank-miles between Broxbourne and Tottenham Hale. The first line of the newt-spell came while I was in the checkout queue at Sainsbury’s. I sent each drafted naming-spell to Jackie with the same accompanying note: “To be read aloud.” I needed Jackie to test them for what Seamus Heaney called language’s “palp and heft” – its thickening by rhyme and texturing by rhythm. I wanted to write spells that, even if they were not fully understood by their readers, might (Heaney again) “weave a gauze of sound” around them. Young children meet language sensuously as well as semantically. They embrace what Francis Spufford in The Child that Books Built calls the “gloriously embedded” aspects of language: “Its texture, its timbre, its grain, its music.” These are also the aspects that have always been central to spells and incantations – for such utterances originated in oral cultures where gestures and speech, rather than the written word, were executive. In many of the spells I found myself writing about shape-shifting: the “partaking of existence” of which Keats spoke, and at which children are such natural geniuses. Thus the last line of the “otter-spell”: Run to the riverbank, otter-dreamer, slip your skin and change your matter, pour your outer being into otter – and enter now as otter without falter into water. Elsewhere I tried, futilely, to catch at what Hopkins called the “thisness” of each creature; the swiftness of wren-flight in the first line of the “wren-spell”, for instance: When wren whirrs from stone to furze the air around her slows, for wren is quick so quick she blurs the air through which she flows. Nature isn’t always wondrous. Often it’s absurd, violent or vile. Ravens rip the eyeballs out of living sheep stranded in snowdrifts. Skuas half-drown gannets and then eat their vomit. I wanted to allow certain species their brutality or comedy – and others their unsettling, alien otherness. In the “willow-spell”, human voices beg to be taught to speak willow: Willow, when the wind blows so your branches billow, will you whisper while we listen so we learn what words your long leaves loosen? But the willows soundly reject their entreaties: We will never whisper to you, listeners, and even if you learn to utter alder, elder, poplar, aspen, you will never know a word of willow – for we are willow and you are not. While I wrote, Jackie painted. I had the easy job: 20 spells to cast. Jackie had hundreds of paintings to create. She painted for a year and a half, working seven-day weeks for most of the final six months. For each name she first painted its absence or lostness. Then – on the facing page of my spell – came the conjured-back creature or plant in the form of an “icon”, set against a shimmering background of gold leaf. Finally, she painted a double-page spread showing each species back in the landscape of which it was intricately part: wren whirring through furze, acorns in an owl-haunted oak-wood. The absences were hardest. How to paint what isn’t there? Jackie drew the empty silhouette of a wren in 18 pen strokes, miraculously catching its teleport-quickness, its jaunty-jenny pose. She painted a blue ripple under willow leaves where a kingfisher should have broken a stream’s surface; a single heron feather rocking down through air. On these “absence” pages, too, Jackie hid single letters that – when sought and found by children – would spell out the lost word. So the book grew and grew and grew – until it was 128 pages long and a foot-and-a-half high: a proper grimoire. We should be unsurprised that nature’s names are vanishing from children’s mouths and minds’ eyes, for nature itself is vanishing. We are presently living through the sixth great extinction – a speed and scale of planetary biodiversity loss not seen since the Cretaceous. At a local level, this expresses itself in what Michael McCarthy memorably calls “the great thinning”. The 2016 State of Nature report found Britain to be “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”, with 53% of British species in decline – among them barn owls, newts, sparrows and starlings. As nature thins, so does our memory of it. Shifting baseline syndrome flattens out the losses; each generation grows into ease with its new normal for nature. The grim end-point of this thinning is foreseen in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, where common names survive but the common species to which they refer are all extinct. Names in that novel are spoken hopelessly, shaken like rattles filled with ash. “Reconnect with nature” is the mantra for fixing this awful decline – as if we could just plug the toaster back into its socket and get right on back to lightly browning bread. We load the cant-word “connection” with responsibility, but rarely examine what it means philosophically or practically. An exception to this is the RSPB’s 2013 Connecting with Nature report, based on a three-year research project. Sensibly, the report recognised “nature deficit” as a complex problem, strongly inflected by socioeconomic and cultural factors. Dismayingly, it found only one in five British children to be “positively connected to nature”. Hopefully, it emphasised “nature connection” as not only a “conservation” issue, but also one closely involved with education, physical health, emotional wellbeing and future attainment: what’s good for nature is also good for the child. ❦ Nature deficit needs structural and political fixes. Hearteningly, hundreds of organisations – from Earth Force Education to the John Muir award and the Forest Schools Network – are striving to close the gap between childhood and nature, including working with schools to get more children learning outdoors, regularly. Most of these organisations specifically aim to help children at risk of social exclusion, or who are otherwise unlikely to reach green places. A proportion of proceeds from each copy of The Lost Words is being given to one such organisation, Action For Conservation – a young charity with the mission of empowering young people to take action on behalf of the natural world. Nature deficit also needs cultural and creative responses. We are “blessed with a wealth of nature and a wealth of language,” concluded Monbiot in his essay on natural naming, “[so] let us bring them together and use one to defend the other.” Just so – and in the work of increasing numbers of contemporary writers for children, nature and language tangle wonderfully. I think here, among many others, of SF Said’s Varjak Paw books, Terry Pratchett’s Tiffany Aching novels (where natural knowledge is both praised and parodied), Michelle Paver’s Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series, Katherine Rundell’s The Wolf Wilder and The Explorers, the novels of Abi Elphinstone and Cressida Cowell, and Piers Torday’s The Dark Wild and The Last Wild. We need all the wildness we can get in the books that our children read, and more. Will it do any good? Only its readers can tell us that. In her classic study of children’s literature, Boys and Girls Forever, Alison Lurie recalls moving from the city to the country and becoming aware of the “impenetrable thicket of blackberry briars and skunk cabbage” beyond the garden fence. “No longer a rationalist,” Lurie remembered: I began to believe in what my storybooks said. Suddenly I saw the landscape as full of mystery and possibility – as essentially alive. For me, and I think for most children who have really known it … nature seemed both powerful and sentient. This, it seems to me, is what nature must best be to children: something “alive, powerful and sentient”, rather than something that can be, in Richard Louv’s terms, “watched, consumed, ignored”. The difference is akin to that between anthropomorphism and animism: in the first, we convert the more-than-human world into an image of ourselves; in the second, we lean a little into its complexity and mystery. The bird which became the guiding, gilding spirit of The Lost Words is the goldfinch. Goldfinches flit across its cover and gleam from its pages. They are present in part as a sign of hope, for those bright birds represent a rare conservation success story in Britain, their numbers having surged by almost 50% over the past 10 years. They are there, too, because the collective noun for goldfinch is a “charm” – a word which also means “the chanting or recitation of a verse supposed to possess magic power” and “the blended singing of many birds, or children”. • The Lost Words is published by Hamish Hamilton on 5 October.

This happened recently, when a missed late train detoured me to a friend’s flat, where I had to make do with what he had in the bathroom. Within seconds of massaging Superdrug’s Optimum PhytoGlyc Age Day Cream SPF15 into my hungover face, I knew I needed my own. This non-greasy cream provides superior moisturisation, smoothing silkily on to normal, combination or dry skin, and an exceptional base for makeup. For a cream containing sunscreens, it manages that rare feat of staying stable under slapdash foundation application, without peeling, and didn’t sting when it wandered into my eyes. Whatever Superdrug is doing to integrate its SPF, luxury brands need in on it, because I can barely remember a more instantly pleasing, no-fuss cream. I’m sceptical about its long-term “firming” claims, as I am with those for products at five times the price, but for £12.99 I’ll take my chances. This led me to its big sister Optimum Phytodeluxe Day Cream (£14.99), which is richer in texture, and for drier, more mature skin, but just as lovely a texture. The brightening, plumping effect is instantly noticeable and, again, makeup lies so cosily on top, you can happily skip primer. One launch I couldn’t fail to notice is Avon’s legitimately game-changing Anew Reversalist Infinite Effects Night Treatment Cream (£25). It’s the first moisturiser based on key research into our skin’s tendency to plateau following long-term use of previously effective products. Having long dismissed women’s claims that a favourite skincare had suddenly stopped working, scientists now concede we had a point. Avon’s solution is to adopt the principles of interval training, where the body is shocked from an idle state by brief bursts of high-intensity exercise. They’ve done this with a double-ended pump (one side contains a low concentration of retinol) that’s flipped and alternated weekly, so startling the skin into a response. The clinical trial (over a year, rather than the standard 12 weeks, and with a large sample group, too) had amazing results, with visible improvements in facial wrinkles in that half of the testers who were using the cream. It’s an exciting, affordable development that should at least encourage women to swap routines as often as we do a whites wash."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/28/trump-nfl-owners-afraid-of-players","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T15:27:01Z","webTitle":"NFL owners 'are afraid of their players, and I think it's disgraceful' – Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/28/trump-nfl-owners-afraid-of-players","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/28/trump-nfl-owners-afraid-of-players","fields":{"headline":"NFL owners 'are afraid of their players, and I think it's disgraceful' – Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump believes NFL owners are “afraid of their players” when it comes to the protest of racial and social injustice that has swept the American sporting landscape. “I have so many friends that are owners, and they’re in a box,” Trump said in a Thursday interview with Fox News. “I mean, I’ve spoken to a couple of them, and they say, ‘We are in a situation where we need to do something.’ I think they’re afraid of their players, if you want to know the truth, and I think it’s disgraceful.” He continued: “They’ve got to be tough and they’ve got to be smart.” It was the latest salvo in Trump’s attack on NFL players who have refused to stand for the anthem, a six-day broadside launched with a speech in Alabama on Friday. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” he said. More than 200 NFL players kneeled, sat or prayed during the anthem in response to the president’s remarks, an unprecedented wave of protest in America’s most popular sports league. Trump’s rhetoric has drawn rebuke from beyond the gridiron. NBA superstar LeBron James called the president a “bum” and told reporters on Monday: “The people run this country, not one individual. And damn sure not him.” Trump has given no quarter in the debate, saying during a White House press gaggle on Wednesday that the NFL is “in a very bad box” and “their business is going to hell” barring a change in policy. “You look at what’s happening with their ratings,” he said. “I mean, frankly, the only thing that’s doing well in the NFL is the pre-game because everybody wants to see what’s going on. “You cannot have people disrespecting our national anthem, our flag, our country, and that’s what they’re doing. And in my opinion, the NFL has to change or you know what’s going to happen? Their business is going to go to hell.” He added: “We have to show total respect for our national anthem, for our flag, for our country, we have to do it. There are plenty of places – personally, when they’re protesting during a football game, I think they can find better places – but they cannot do it during the national anthem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/30/pele-soccer-america-new-york-cosmos","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T10:00:30Z","webTitle":"How Pelé lit up soccer in America and left a legacy fit for a king","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/30/pele-soccer-america-new-york-cosmos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/30/pele-soccer-america-new-york-cosmos","fields":{"headline":"How Pelé lit up soccer in America and left a legacy fit for a king","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Winning a World Cup is a steep enough challenge. Pelé had the gifts, and talented and remarkable team-mates, to accomplish that not once, not twice, but three times. Trying to win over a country? That might be even harder. That seemed to be an impossible mountain to climb, even for a man nicknamed O Rei (The King). Yet, in 1975 Pelé took a gamble and ventured to the one major nation on earth that had not embraced the beautiful game. “I was retired from my team, Santos, I was retired from Brazil from the national team,” Pelé told me a few years ago when he questioned why he would want to come to the United States in 1975. “What I am going to do in New York? I come from the two biggest teams, the biggest moments. Clive Toye [New York Cosmos president] told me, ‘Listen, we want to make soccer, football, as big as it is in Europe and South America.’ “When I signed with the Cosmos, the Cosmos were almost a university team. Later on, we became the best team, almost in the world. After we got some excellent players, then the Cosmos became No 1.” Sunday is the 40th anniversary of Pelé’s retirement game, a lavish affair in which a capacity crowd of 75,646 jammed New York’s Giants Stadium to say farewell and thank you to the man many regard as the world’s greatest player. The celebrity list included Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, Diane Keaton, Mick Jagger, Muhammad Ali and Henry Kissinger. It was a fitting finale for a king. During his three-year tenure in the States, Pelé helped ignite a soccer boom the USA is still feeling today. While the original incarnation of the North American Soccer League went bust after the 1984 season, soccer, slowly, but surely, began to take root. It is now an established part of the country’s sporting ecosystem – some of the teams in the league attract crowds of upwards of 40,000, and as a participant sport, particularly in schools, it has risen dramatically over the last 10 years. Back then, it struggled. It was considered a sport popular among immigrants and even ridiculed as a “commie” sport by its biggest detractors as it fought for acceptance in the media. But when Pelé signed with the Cosmos, however, he was difficult to ignore. Whenever the Cosmos came to town, he became the major sports story as US stadiums played to full capacity to watch Pelé perform some magic. His first game was broadcast to over 20 countries and 300 journalists from all over the world were in attendance. Pelé, who would sign autographs all day for fans until team officials pulled him away, also opened the door for many other stars to play in North America. Giorgio Chinaglia followed him to the Cosmos, then Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto before several other world-class players helped fill out a formidable Starting XI. Over the next few years other legends decided it was fair game to test the NASL waters, including Johan Cruyff, Bobby Moore, George Best and Gordon Banks, among others. They helped lay the groundwork for what we have today. Looking back 40 years, it would be easy to say those were the good ole days. Pelé and the Cosmos brought glamour and glitz – and huge crowds. But, in some respects, New York City in the mid-70s was a mess. It tried to move forward while other forces pulled it back, enduring some tumultuous times while fighting financial difficulties and a notorious crime rate. When New York City asked for a financial bailout from the federal government and President Ford in 1975, it was rejected, leading to this memorable New York Daily News headline: Ford to city: drop dead. During the summer of 1977, Son of Sam terrorized the city with random killings until he was apprehended that August. Times Square was far from the more welcoming place it is today as XXX-rated entertainment and filth dominated the streets. In 1977 the city went dark during a midsummer blackout during which looters gave it a black eye for lawlessness. Even the Cosmos experienced their share of turmoil. After a shaky start, they fired popular coach Gordon Bradley and replaced him with Tampa Bay Rowdies coach Eddie Firmani in June. Toye was forced out as team president. On the field, the team added two former World Cup champions – West Germany’s Beckenbauer and Brazil’s Carlos Alberto. In June, the Cosmos attracted an NASL-record 62,394 fans to Giants Stadium for a 3-0 victory past the Rowdies as a 37-year-old Pelé reigned with a hat-trick. The team suddenly caught lightning in a bottle as attending Cosmos games became the trendy thing to do. Even gritty Daily News columnist Dick Young, a baseball aficionado, admitted he was won over. “I had been seduced by Pelé,” he wrote. By the end of the season, Pelé did not always have to be the leader of the band thanks to his superlative supporting cast. In the first leg of the quarter-final series, they attracted a US-record crowd of 77,891 for what turned into an 8-3 rout of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers at Giants Stadium. In the second leg of the semi-finals against the Rochester Lancers, a 4-1 triumph, the Cosmos attracted 73,669 for a midweek game in the rain as Pelé tallied his final competitive goal. The win propelled the Cosmos into the Soccer Bowl against the Seattle Sounders in Portland. Their goals were pretty obvious: to win the championship for the king. Pelé did not figure much in his last competitive match as Steve Hunt and Chinaglia provided the heroics as the Cosmos won 2-1. What transpired afterwards has been seared into my mind. I could not believe what I saw or heard from the loudest and crowded locker room. The entourage of Brazilian media lifted their countryman onto their shoulders and paraded him around while chanting “Pelé! Pelé! Pelé!” Later, Pelé sat at his locker in front of a media scrum as he seemed at peace with himself and the world. “God has been kind to me,” he said. “I can die now.” Of course, he didn’t. After a tour of Asia, the Cosmos returned home for one final goodbye to the king in a surreal farewell game at a packed Giants Stadium. During pre-game ceremonies, the captains of the five last World Cup championship teams were introduced – Brazil’s Bellini (1958), Mauro (1962) and Carlos Alberto (1970), England’s Moore (1966) and West Germany’s Beckenbauer (1974). Jeff Carter, the son of then President Carter, read and presented Pelé with a plaque: “Presented to Pelé for the smiles he put on children’s faces, the thrills he gave to fans of this nation and the dimension he added to American sports. Pelé has elevated the game of soccer to heights never before attained in America and only Pelé, with his status, incomparable talent and beloved compassion could have accomplished such a mission. The United States of America is deeply grateful.” – President Carter, 1 October 1977 Eventually, an emotional Pelé stepped to the microphone. “Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to be there with you in this greatest moment of my life,” he said. “I want to thank you all every single one of you. I want to take this opportunity to ask you to pay attention to the young of the world, the children, the kids. We need them too much. And I want to ask you because I think that, I believe that love is the, the …” Tears streamed down his cheeks. “Love is more important than what we can take in life,” he said. “Everything passes. Please say with me, three times – love! Love! Love!” The stadium scoreboard repeated those words – “Love! Love! Love!” as the crowd responded in unison. Overcome by emotion, Pelé tried to speak before managing: “Thank you very much.” Roberta Flack sang The Star Spangled Banner before Sérgio Mendes and his band played the Brazilian national anthem. There was still a game to be played in the rain. Quite fittingly, it was between the only two clubs for which Pelé wore a jersey – the Cosmos and Santos. The Brazilian side grabbed a 14th-minute lead on Reynaldo’s goal. While performing for the Cosmos in the opening half, Pelé gave the crowd one last glimpse of his greatness with 2.34 remaining. He drilled a free-kick past Santos goalkeeper Erani, who dove to his left in vain to stop as it nestled into the back of the net. The crowd went crazy on Pelé’s 1,281st goal of a 22-year career and 64th in 106 matches with the NASL side. More ceremonies at halftime. While standing in the center circle, Pelé took off his No 10 Cosmos shirt and gave it to his father, Edinho. He then put on the No 10 of Santos. While many fans hoped for a Pelé goal for Santos, he could not duplicate his scoring feat as his replacement, Ramon Mifflin, connected to give the Cosmos a 2-1 win. After the final whistle, Pelé walked back to the center of the pitch, took off his Santos jersey and presented it to his first coach. With the rain pelting the field, a shirtless Pelé took one last victory lap around field with the crowd chanting “Pelé! Pelé! Pelé!” He was lifted on to the shoulders of several Santos and Cosmos players, including goalkeepers Shep Messing and Errol Yasin. He exited the field with an American flag in one hand, a Brazilian in the other. “I die a little bit today,” Pelé said afterwards. “Now I am born again to another life. You see, I stop playing soccer because I want to stop, and that is important.” It might have been the end of an era for American soccer, but it was the beginning of something much bigger for the sport, though it would take years for those seeds that Pelé and friends planted to grow. “It was the best thing I did in my life,” he told me a few years ago about playing in the US. “I thank God for that because I became more well-known throughout the world after I came here.” Forty years on, no statues have been built for the man who helped to transform American soccer. But perhaps there are greater monuments that honor Pelé. After all, we seemingly can’t drive anywhere in the US without seeing a soccer park or field. There is a professional league – Major League Soccer – that will complete its 22nd season with many of the clubs sporting soccer-specific stadiums. The women’s national team has set international standards that will be difficult to duplicate. Soccer haters have died off and the sport, perhaps most crucially, has taken root among schoolchildren and their parents. It has put down roots in communities across the states and this time it is growing from the bottom up. With American football enduring a difficult time with worries over brain injuries for children and adults, “soccer” has seen its popularity grow as an alternative to the other “football”. Now, that is a legacy certainly fit for a king."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/28/twitter-congress-russian-election-interference","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T22:58:35Z","webTitle":"Democrats rebuke Twitter for 'frankly inadequate' response to Russian meddling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/28/twitter-congress-russian-election-interference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/28/twitter-congress-russian-election-interference","fields":{"headline":"Democrats rebuke Twitter for 'frankly inadequate' response to Russian meddling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Twitter has suspended 201 accounts tied to Russian-linked sources that posted political ads on Facebook during the 2016 presidential election, officials from the social media giant told congressional investigators on Thursday. Top Democrats, however, said they were disappointed by Twitter’s briefing to congressional investigators and questioned the company’s commitment to investigating Russian use of its platform to influence the US vote. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, who was among those briefed, said Twitter displayed an “enormous lack of understanding” and called its presentation to his panel “frankly inadequate on almost every level”. Warner accused Twitter of failing to grasp “how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered”. “There is a lot more work they have to do,” he told reporters on Thursday. The US intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the election to damage Hillary Clinton’s chances and boost those of Donald Trump. Social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook are under mounting pressure from Congress and the public to provide more information about the spread of Russian propaganda and disinformation on their platforms. Twitter detailed the meetings with Capitol Hill staffers in a blogpost published on Thursday. The closed-door briefings followed a similar briefing involving Facebook, which revealed earlier this month that it sold more than 3,000 election ads linked to a Russian agency. Facebook has said it will provide Congress with copies of those ads as well as payment information and who the ads targeted. Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, noted that Twitter’s findings appeared to be based on Facebook’s disclosures and said the company still had “significant work to do to understand the depth and breadth of Russian activity during the campaign”. “This additional analysis will require a far more robust investigation into how Russian actors used their platform as a part of their active measures campaign and whether any of the targeting on Twitter suggests the possibility of assistance or collusion with any US persons,” Schiff said. The suspended Twitter accounts were tied to the 470 Russia-linked accounts and pages that Facebook removed after they promoted messages intended to amplify divisive social issues such as gun control, race relations and immigration – all of which were central to Trump’s campaign. Twitter said it identified 22 accounts that corresponded with the ones shared by Facebook as part of its review. Twitter then found an additional 179 accounts “related or linked” to those accounts, it said. Twitter also identified three accounts linked to the news site RT, formerly Russia Today, that spent $274,100 on sponsored tweets in 2016. The blogpost noted that the intelligence officials have linked the news network to the Kremlin. “Neither the original accounts shared by Facebook, nor the additional related accounts we identified, were registered as advertisers on Twitter,” the blogpost said. “However, we continue to investigate these issues, and will take action on anything that violates our terms of service.” Facebook’s findings entangled both social media companies in the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, raising calls for increased transparency around political advertising on social media platforms. Twitter acknowledged such demands and on Thursday said it would examine its current guidelines with “an eye to improving them”. Facebook has faced the harshest scrutiny so far. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Wednesday apologized for initially dismissing the notion that fake news on Facebook had influenced the election as a “pretty crazy idea”. “Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it,” Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post responding to a claim by the president that the platform is “anti-Trump”. “This is too important an issue to be dismissive. The Senate and House committees are trying to understand what companies could have done to stem Russian attempts to spread fake news stories and misinformation. The House intelligence committee announced on Wednesday that it planned to hold an open hearing with the tech companies next month. A Senate aide confirmed that Twitter, Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, have been invited to testify publicly before the Senate intelligence committee on 1 November. Twitter had previously been relatively quiet on the subject. In a June blogpost, its vice-president of public policy, Colin Crowell, wrote: “Twitter’s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information. “This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not. We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.” A spokeswoman for Twitter declined to respond to the criticism over Thursday’s briefing, directing the Guardian to the blog post outlining their presentation to congressional investigators. In the post, Twitter said the presentation covered only the company’s “initial findings” and committed to “continue to work with official inquiries into these isssues, and to share updates publicly as we are able”. The social media company also described a series of changes it intends to roll out in the coming weeks and months to more quickly detect and respond to suspicious activity on its platform. The changes, however, are not meant to be “definitive solutions”, Twitter said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/29/geralds-game-review-netflix-stephen-king-carla-gugino","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T09:00:21Z","webTitle":"Gerald's Game review – suspense-packed Stephen King adaptation is worth playing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/geralds-game-review-netflix-stephen-king-carla-gugino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/29/geralds-game-review-netflix-stephen-king-carla-gugino","fields":{"headline":"Gerald's Game review – suspense-packed Stephen King adaptation is worth playing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been one heck of a year for Stephen King adaptations, at least in terms of sheer quantity rather than consistent quality. A mixed reception met the small-screen redo of The Mist, critics and audiences were uninterested in the failed franchise starter The Dark Tower, no one really got to see Mr Mercedes and then, saving the day, It is now set to become the biggest horror film of all time. But while the latter remains a trending topic, there’s a Netflix thriller quietly launching this weekend that also deserves some fanfare. Jessie (Carla Gugino) and Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) are a married couple who are hoping to spice up their sex life by indulging in a dirty weekend away in the countryside. Gerald has an idea: he will handcuff Jessie to the bed and the two will attempt some role play. But things get too rough and Gerald has a heart attack while Jessie remains in cuffs. She must use her wits to find a way out of an impossible situation while battling her own crumbling psyche. What often elevates far-fetched genre fare is a firmly planted foot on the ground, an ability to ask and answer the question: but what would someone really do in this situation? Last year, the sci-fi semi-sequel 10 Cloverfield Lane and the home invasion horror Hush mastered this with stories of resourceful women refusing to fall into victim mode while dealing with fantastical, terrifying situations. There’s DNA of the latter in Gerald’s Game, none too surprising given that they’re both directed by Mike Flanagan, who again shows his impressive Hitchcockian ability to squeeze suspense out of a one-location nightmare (just wait and see what he does with a precariously placed glass of water). There’s a glorious sense of unpredictability running throughout Gerald’s Game and initially, it seems like Flanagan will struggle to convert a thin premise into a 105-minute feature. But there’s more than just a simple survival tale at play and as the minutes turn to hours, Jessie’s fears become manifest; she engages in a series of increasingly unhinged conversations with herself, and we get to learn about her dark past via flashbacks. King’s knack for shifting timelines and perspectives can prove tough for those adapting his work but for the most part, Flanagan, working with his writing partner Jeff Howard, has provided something of a blueprint, effortlessly weaving it all together without threatening to break up the pace. It’s a barnstorming showcase for Gugino, so often underused, who tackles a difficult, physically restricted role with gusto. There’s a stirring, surprisingly impactful sexual abuse narrative, the film offering more humanity than the majority of horror films spewed out at the moment. Genre fans will also be satisfied with some third-act violence that proves almost unbearable to watch. Yet it’s also in the final stretch that the translation from page to screen becomes a bit more strained: A convoluted splurge of unlikely exposition almost sinks the film with an ending that may be faithful to King’s work but feels like fan service at best and unnecessary clutter at worst. As clunky as the final moments might be, Gugino and Flanagan work hard to sell it and there’s a muddied yet vital message about a woman fighting back against toxic masculinity that gives the film a strident, urgent edge. With Hulu’s Castle Rock series and an It sequel on the way, Hollywood’s rediscovered fetish for Stephen King shows no sign of abating and while Gerald’s Game doesn’t quite stick the landing, there’s enough here to suggest that, done right, his work will continue to play well.

I thought: ‘What the fuck have I done to these people?’” The “it” is the Bilbao Guggenheim museum, which made both its architect Gehry and the Basque city world-famous. Its achievement, measured in much-repeated metrics of visitor numbers and economic uplift, in global recognition and media coverage, in being, in effect, an Instagram sensation long before anyone knew what that might be, is prodigious. It revived belief that architecture could be ambitious, beautiful and popular all at once, yet Gehry has always said that its success took him by surprise. The museum was opened 20 years ago this month, by the king and queen of Spain, since when it has become the most influential building of modern times. It has given its name to the “Bilbao effect” – a phenomenon whereby cultural investment plus showy architecture is supposed to equal economic uplift for cities down on their luck. It is the father of “iconic” architecture, the prolific progenitor of countless odd-shaped buildings the world over. Yet rarely, if ever, have the myriad wannabe Bilbaos matched the original. This is probably because it came about through a coincidence of conditions that is unlikely to happen again. Despite Gehry’s protestations of surprise, it is a project that has fulfilled its original intentions with precision. Juan Ignacio Vidarte, the museum’s director, whose involvement dates back to the time of its inception in the early 90s, says that it was meant to be “a transformational project”, a catalyst for a wider plan to turn around an industrial city in decline and afflicted by Basque separatist terrorism. It was to be “a driver of economic renewal”, an “agent of economic development” that would appeal to a “universal audience”, create a “positive image” and “reinforce self-esteem”. All of which it pretty much did. It has been rewarded with a steady million visitors a year, the 20 millionth having arrived shortly before the 20th birthday. Gehry, who beat two other architects in the competition to design the building, recalls that he was asked to design what was then not called an icon. He was nervous. “They said: ‘Mr Gehry, we need the Sydney Opera House. Our town is dying.’ I looked at them and said: ‘Where’s the nearest exit? I’ll do my best but I can’t guarantee anything.’” So he came up with the convulsive, majestic, climactic assembly of titanium and stone, of heft and shimmer, a cross-breed of palazzo and ship that also flips its tail like a jumping fish, that now stands on the bank of the river Nervión. It was not a wholly new set of ideas – Sydney, indeed, had demonstrated the value of the transformative landmark, as had Paris with the Pompidou Centre. Frankfurt, Glasgow and Pittsburgh had striven to raise themselves with culture and/or museum-building. What set Bilbao apart was the degree of contrast between the city’s lowly status and the artistic and architectural ambition of its proposed flagship. They found an ally in the Solomon R Guggenheim Foundation of New York, which had previous in commissioning icons from architects named Frank, in the form of Frank Lloyd Wright’s white spiralling museum on Fifth Avenue. It was then run by Thomas Krens, the holder of an MBA from Yale and a man formed by the risk-taking, deal-making culture of the 1980s. The Bilbao people had heard that the Guggenheim wanted to expand its European presence, and plans to do this by adding to the Peggy Guggenheim collection in Venice weren’t “going forward sweetly”, as Vidarte puts it, so they offered their battered city in place of La Serenissima. The Guggenheim, he says, liked their ideas and their seriousness. An agreement was worked out, an early instance of the international trading of museum brands that also engenders, for example, the forthcoming Louvre Abu Dhabi, whereby the governments of the city, and of the province and region in which Bilbao stands, would pay for construction, and contribute to acquisitions and running costs. The Guggenheim Foundation would lend its name, works from its permanent collections and its management and curatorship. The arrangement wasn’t universally popular – it was called “McGuggenheim”, an act of cultural imperialism paid for by the people it subjected – but it gave Bilbao access to the high-quality art without which a museum would be pointless. The Canadian-born Gehry, now aged 88, was then in his 60s, and he had a high reputation in the architectural world for his imaginative reinterpretations of the everyday structures of his adopted home of Los Angeles. He didn’t have the celebrity he gained later (an appearance on The Simpsons, for example), and although he was known for the freedom of his forms, the public hadn’t yet seen much of the complex, multiply curving shapes which, since Bilbao, are assumed to be his trademark. They were, however, brewing in some of his projects, especially an $82m house for the Ohio insurance magnate Peter Lewis – a trustee of the Guggenheim foundation from 1993 to 2005, its biggest donor, and the man who introduced Gehry to Krens — that was designed and redesigned but never built. Gehry and his office pioneered the use of CATIA, software originally developed for designing aircraft, which allowed elaborate shapes to be made without prohibitive cost. It enabled him to realise the Bilbao Guggenheim, as he is keen to point out, within its $100m budget. “I could have straightened everything out,” he says, but “it wouldn’t have cost less.” The ability of computers to design unfeasibly elaborate buildings has since multiplied. It is a ubiquitous and defining feature of contemporary architecture. It has been an effective accomplice of post-Bilbao “iconic” architecture which, although sensible architects have been pointing out its weaknesses for almost as long as it has existed, and although it suffers from an obvious hyperinflation of shape – if everything looks abnormal it becomes normal – shows no sign of going away. This long-running craze would have happened in any case, but the Guggenheim gave it fuel. Its influence takes two main types. In one, public authorities – in West Bromwich, in Denver, in Metz – seek to use some version of the “Bilbao effect” to “kickstart” (as it is often horribly put) regeneration. In Spain, in the bubble years, cities became particularly fond of monuments whose appearance outran their content, architectural dumb blondes by Santiago Calatrava or Oscar Niemeyer or Peter Eisenman that looked especially redundant when the crash came. In the other type, private developers use funny shapes as marketing tools for their towers – see the skylines of Dubai or many Chinese cities, or London’s car boot sale of domestic gadgets. What both approaches, public and private, have in common is the use of spectacle to distract attention. Public authorities might not want you to notice that their regeneration plans are flimsy. Developers typically use eye-catching design to justify their stretching of planning restrictions, or to obscure the fundamental sameness and ordinariness of their products, or to sell buildings before they are realised – in some cases too to deodorise the dirty money that pays for the projects. The use of spectacle was also the basis of the most sustained critique of the generally lauded Guggenheim, that its powerful look makes it a poor setting for art. For the critic Hal Foster, speaking in Sydney Pollack’s film Sketches of Frank Gehry, the building trumps the art it is supposed to serve: “he’s given his clients too much of what they want, a sublime space that overwhelms the viewer, a spectacular image that can circulate through the media and around the world as brand”. Gehry is familiar with the criticism and pushes back. All his professional life he has known and worked with artists. “In the beginning,” he says, “I thought architects should make neutral spaces for art. But my artists were saying: ‘Fuck off, we want to be in an important building. I want to go home and tell my mother I’m in the Louvre.’” He reels off the artists who he says liked the Guggenheim – Anselm Kiefer, Sol LeWitt, “even” Robert Rauschenberg. He says that a clique of museum directors, meeting in London, “passed a resolution that they should never build a building like Frank Gehry’s… they pretty much kept to it.” He claims that the same directors – “you know who they are” – told Cy Twombly never to show in Bilbao. He did, eventually, two years or so before his death. “Cy called me and said it was the best show in his whole life.” Gehry is also keen to distance himself from the dumber aspects of the building’s architectural legacy. “I apologise for having anything to do with it,” he says. “Maybe I should be hung by the yardarm. My intention was not that it should happen.” Talk of the “Bilbao effect” makes him cringe – “it’s bullshit... I blame your journalist brethren for that.” He wants to stress an aspect of the design often overlooked by imitators, which is that it works hard to connect to its surroundings: “I spent a lot of time making the building relate to the 19th century street module and then it was on the river, with the history of the river, the sea, the boats coming up the channel. It was a boat.” Vidarte, too, is uneasy about its influence. He’s “flattered”, but at the same time “concerned and nervous… many people are just trying to replicate its most superficial aspects.” The project was not about the building, he says, but also a “sustainable” plan for its management and content, and the regeneration of Bilbao was not just about the Guggenheim but also about investment in infrastructure and other urban essentials. Alongside Gehry’s building stands a giant puppy, covered in living flowers. It was created by Jeff Koons and “underwritten” by Hugo Boss. Shortly before the opening three Basque separatist terrorists tried to disguise themselves as gardeners so as to plant explosives in it. They were foiled, but a policeman died in the ensuing shoot-out. The incident was emblematic. It was evidence of the troubles that Bilbao was trying to escape and which have indeed diminished. The Koons-Boss pooch, charming and calculating at once, was an early manifestation of the sort of global, big-money, market-led, spectacular art culture that has now become familiar, for which the Bilbao Guggenheim was certainly a Trojan horse. Krens himself went on to be a controversial and ambitious protagonist of this culture, if not an entirely successful one – his Guggenheims planned for Rio de Janeiro, Las Vegas, Guadalajara, Taichung, lower Manhattan and Abu Dhabi have mostly failed to materialise, or stuttered if they did. But to lay on the Bilbao Guggenheim the effects of its legacy is an injustice to what it was and is. From the political, cultural and commercial currents of its time, not all of them noble or elevated, it drew the energy to make a phenomenon that few people would wish away, least of all Bilbao itself. Its true lesson is that it can’t be copied, because it came from circumstances that were unique. Five would-be icons Centre Pompidou-Metz, France, designed by Shigeru Ban, 2010 As in Bilbao, a famous art institution created an architecturally conspicuous outpost in an unglamorous city. The Public, West Bromwich, designed by Will Alsop, 2008 An attempt to revive the West Midlands with a “box of delights”, where people could both experience and make art. It is now a sixth-form college. Centre Niemeyer, Avilés, Spain, designed by Oscar Niemeyer, 2011 A cultural centre designed by the celebrated Brazilian architect in his 90s, it closed for financial reasons soon after its completion, but later reopened.

The man travelled more than 50 miles through three police force areas before his car was stopped by armed police close to a busy motorway junction between Bristol and Portishead. A number of shots were fired and the man was declared dead at the scene. A non-police-issue firearm was recovered by officers. It emerged on Thursday that West Mercia police received a report about a man pointing a gun at a fellow motorist at 8.30am on Wednesday near junction eight of the M5 in Worcestershire. The force passed this information on to the central motorway police group (CMPG), which covers the network in the Midlands. At 8.40am the CMPG told Gloucestershire police about the unfolding incident. Avon and Somerset police also took calls about a man threatening other motorists and officers stopped the car when it left the M5 at junction 19 at 9.30am. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the shooting, as is required by law. The road where the car was stopped, the Portbury Hundred, was closed for more than 30 hours while the scene was examined. Officers involved are being questioned and their weapons have been seized and are being checked. CCTV footage and body cameras are also being examined. No individual police officer is under investigation at this stage, said the IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts. The man’s identity has not been released but it is understood police know who he is. An important part of the investigation will be to understand how the information was passed from force to force. West Mercia and Gloucestershire police both confirmed that they had received reports at about 8.30am and 8.40am of a man in a vehicle on the M5 pointing a gun at another motorist, and had passed the information on to the IPCC. In a joint statement the chief constable of Avon and Somerset constabulary, Andy Marsh, and the area’s police and crime commissioner, Sue Mountstevens, said: “Our thoughts are with the family of the man who died and all those involved and affected. A full investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission is under way, and we are working to support this ongoing investigation.” The closure of the road caused chaos in and around Portishead, including for police officers trying to get to and from their nearby headquarters. Images of the scene showed what appeared to be a handgun on the roof of a red Suzuki Swift. There were at least four bullet holes in the offside of the vehicle and the driver’s side front window was smashed. Blood and glass, as well as a sunhat, could be seen on the floor by the hatchback. Witnesses have given different accounts of how many shots were fired. Motorist David Ellison said: “Ahead of me were police in the road. I saw them back off from a car and then they surrounded it. They maybe shot with handguns five, six, maybe 10 times. Then they dragged a man from the car to resuscitate him.” Frazer Phillips, from Bristol, wrote on the Hello Portishead Facebook page: “I was right next to it when it happened and heard about 4-5 shots.” The IPCC confirmed it was looking at the West Mercia report. An IPCC spokesperson said: “We have received a referral from West Mercia police in relation to a report they received from a member of the public prior to the incident near Portishead. We are assessing the referral and whether we should also investigate West Mercia police actions.” It has not commented on Gloucestershire’s involvement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T12:53:33Z","webTitle":"'A white girl had to die for people to pay attention': Heather Heyer's mother on hate in the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other","fields":{"headline":"'A white girl had to die for people to pay attention': Heather Heyer's mother on hate in the US","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Recently, someone sent Susan Bro a T-shirt and a stack of bumper stickers that read “Just be nice”. She gave the shirt to her mother, who had always told her that: be nice. Bro has no interest in being nice, and she has no interest, just now, in forgiveness. Her 32-year-old daughter, Heather Heyer, was killed seven weeks ago when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Nineteen other people were injured. The man charged with Heather’s murder was a 20-year-old from Ohio who had demonstrated that day alongside a white nationalist group and had, a former teacher recalled, a longstanding fascination with Hitler. At Heather’s funeral, Bro refused to let any politicians speak. When it was her turn to address the crowd, “I could have driven it to hate and vengeance, and I could have driven it to understanding and love and forgiveness and sweetness and light. And neither of those was what I wanted to say.” “They tried to kill my child to shut her up,” she said at the funeral. “Well, guess what: you just magnified her.” After Donald Trump repeatedly blamed “both sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, Bro announced on Good Morning America, “I’m not talking to the president. You can’t wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying I’m sorry.” “Think before you speak,” she told the president of the United States. ‘I’m just a waitress’ Heather had been the kind of American who showed up often in articles about Trump’s political rise: the great-granddaughter of coalminers, she had grown up living in a trailer in rural Virginia, in a family that has “always, our entire lives, been on the bottom end of the middle class, with not much hope of rising above that”, Bro said. “To us, middle class is working class.” The school Heather attended, where her mother also worked, was overwhelmingly white, only 4% black, 1% Hispanic and less than 1% other races, Bro recalls. Heather had struggled to graduate from high school and had never gone to college. She had lived at home with her mother, clashing with her frequently, into her early 20s, and then worked as a waitress and bartender, before getting a job in 2012 working with bankruptcy clients as a paralegal. Five years into this job, she had not yet fully accepted that she might have career success. When she made a typo, or when a law firm colleague’s college fraternity brother asked her out, she would say, reflexively, “I’m just a waitress.” Heather had been afraid of what Trump’s political rise meant for America, and she had paid attention to him, long before her supervisor, a man who had studied political science, had taken him seriously. She was passionate about injustice, bristling when clients acted surprised or skeptical that the highly credentialed man running her bankruptcy division was black, and breaking down into tears of fury when a local sheriff’s office posted on Facebook about its public seminar on the “Muslim religion” called “Understanding the Threat.” Bro’s idealistic daughter had been anxious about being out on the streets protesting the hundreds of racists assembled at the 12 August rally, but she had gone anyway. Before she was killed, Heather was walking with a group of friends from her office through the streets of gentrified Charlottesville as the crowd chanted, “Black lives matter.” Earlier in the day, the town had descended into chaos, with white supremacists wearing helmets and shields fighting with anti-fascists in the streets, including spraying them with Mace. Counter-protesters hurled bottles of urine. A 20-year-old black Charlottesville resident was beaten with poles inside a parking garage. Officials declared a state of emergency and cleared the park that had been the center of the protest. But in the early afternoon, as a crowd of people protesting against the white supremacists walked down a narrow street, a gray Dodge Charger plowed into them, sending bodies flying into the air, and then reversed, dragging more people with it. People who witnessed the attack described screams of terror, the sound of bones breaking, and the instant conviction that this was a purposeful attack. Charlottesville is a quaint, glossy, prosperous college town. The street where Heather was killed is around the corner from an Urban Outfitters, and just blocks away from the Let it Be yoga studio. Today, some white Charlottesville residents talk about the violent rally as something that opened their eyes and finally pushed them to have uncomfortable conversations about race. These kinds of discussions , they say, are important but difficult to begin. Heather’s mother, blunt and opinionated like her daughter, does not talk about racism this way, as if it were some kind of social faux pas. “I think it’s a damn shame that a white girl had to die for people to have to pay attention,” Bro said during a wide-ranging, three-hour interview in Charlottesville this week. “I think if a black girl had died, or a black man, [the reaction would have been] ‘Oh well, another person lost to violent protest.’” Some white people have asked her why she let Heather go to the protest. This is a ridiculous question, Bro says: her daughter was 32 years old. “I’m glad she was there,” she added. “I’m very proud of her.” Recently, Bro said, she had seen young black residents commenting on Facebook that they were worried that last Sunday’s benefit Concert for Charlottesville, which raised money for victims’ families and positive charities, would convince local residents that the response to the white supremacist attacks was done, that everyone could move on. She shares that fear. “I think what has happened with this administration, and with our country, is that finally this festering boil of hate has been lanced to reveal its full measure of infection, full measure of bitterness, full measure of disease,” she said. “Now we see how deep that disease runs, we have the chance to start working to heal it.” Bro is a cancer survivor, and when she talks about healing, she does not talk in pretty ways. “What I learned from my own surgery is that wounds cannot heal on the surface. You seal it over and it festers,” she said. “You have to heal from the inside out, and that requires keeping the wound open. That’s not a pleasant experience. That requires anaesthetic. That requires pain.” ‘This place is such a good place’ Charlottesville is still full of memorials to Heather. More than a month after her death, there are still fresh bouquets on the sidewalk where the attack took place, and chalk messages scrawled on the brick walls on both sides of the street: “Heyer Purpose.” “You magnified her.” “Love will prevail.” Restaurants and cafes in the posh downtown pedestrian mall display signs with Heather’s name in cursive inside a purple heart, along with placards warning patrons that if they don’t value diversity, they’re not welcome. All of this – the word “diversity”, the pretty fonts – is sanitizing. It avoids much reckoning with the actual ideology of the neo-Nazi groups, much less how the attack on 12 August fits into in America’s broader history of white supremacist violence. At the free benefit concert, Dave Matthews, whose rock band got its start in Charlottesville in the early 1990s, reminded a stadium of tens of thousands of local residents, many of them white, that their home is not just “the place where those Nazis came to town with their machine guns out, talking about hate”. “This place is such a good place, and it’s so full of love, and it’s so full of hope,” Matthews said, to cheers. Pharrell Williams took a knee at the concert, in a contribution to Trump’s culture war over athletes’ protests over police brutality. But other pop stars did not even make that much of a political statement. Justin Timberlake, who opened his set singing, “A Change is Gonna Come,” quickly segued into his top hits. Alfred Wilson, Heather’s supervisor and friend at the Miller Law Group in Charlottesville, had brought his children and their friends to the concert. During the concert, a white couple behind them made a point of complimenting Wilson on how well-mannered and courteous his black children and their friends were –particularly his son and his friends, black teenagers who all went to private school. Wilson told this story to Heather’s mother the next day in the conference room of the firm where he worked. “I’m sorry – to me that’s a little irritating, that that even has to be commented on. Of course they are,” Bro broke in. “It was,” Wilson agreed, wryly, although he had started the story in a positive vein. “It was a weird experience.” “I guess it’s better for him to say that than to make assumptions otherwise. But the fact that the guy is surprised – that’s what irritating,” Bro sighed. “We’ve so far to go yet.” When Bro first herself heard about “white privilege”, she had rejected the concept. “I was like, ‘I’m not privileged. I’m poor. I’ve struggled.’” Over time, through conversations with black friends and with her daughter, it began to make sense to her – that for some people, racial profiling and harassment were not extraordinary events, but the norm, that “I have basic assumptions of safety, basic assumptions of trust that other people are not given.” Neo-Nazis and white nationalists often refer to the demographic shifts in America and elsewhere as “white genocide”. A much broader segment of Americans believe that whites, especially white males, now face significant discrimination, and that as they fall behind, women and other racial groups are being given unfair advantages. At the core of today’s far-right ideologies is the fear that white people are being “demographically displaced” in their own countries, and that when whites become a racial minority, they will suffer the same discrimination and disadvantage that has been visited on other racial minorities for centuries. Heather’s experience had been precisely the opposite: her African American boss’s own experiences had made him uncommonly willing to lift other people up. Wilson had hired Heather and mentored her at the law firm despite her lack of on-paper qualifications. The reason he had made an effort to hire so many single mothers and women without traditional résumés, he explained, was because of his own mother’s example. She had gotten both of her children into top-tier universities on her salary as a cook. Only after he took a sociology class in college had he realized that he had actually grown up below the poverty line. His mother was smart and driven, and wanted to give other women the kinds of opportunities she had never been offered. Wilson had trained Heather in bankruptcy rules, sent her to classes, told her to take charge of her job, ask for whatever resources she needed, and watched her soak in information like a sponge. She and her boss had clashed frequently. But she had once broken up with a man she was dating because he had commented, after seeing her walk out of the office with Wilson, “You never told me you worked for a black man.” “She cared enough for me as a person that she stood up for me even in her own personal relationships,” Wilson said in his speech at her funeral. “That took a lot of strength.” Working as a paralegal with clients going into bankruptcy gave Heather an unexpectedly intimate look into the struggles of other Americans. Sometimes she was frustrated when couples making three or four times her salary were forced to declare bankruptcy, wondering why they could not simply control their spending, Wilson said. But she also grew adept at reading the narratives behind the financial statements – seeing the patterns that meant that a client had breast cancer, or that someone had a drug addiction. Before her death, Wilson had coaxed Heather into beginning to plan retirement savings accounts for herself, setting up a college fund for her niece, and making a plan to purchase her condo. These were small steps forward to trusting in her financial future. “Heather, you’re in different place now,” he told her. “I have faith in you.” Bro buried her daughter in a private location, in a grave that does not even list her name. “I just wanted her left alone,” she said. Last Monday, Bro took Heather’s grandparents, her brother and his wife, and her young niece to visit the grave site together. For the weeks after the attack, Bro had reminded herself that her daughter had most likely died quickly. It hurt her to think that “her last few seconds were fear and terror, which no mother wants for her child,” but, she said, “I was sadly accepting of that.” At the concert in the stadium on Sunday, many people came up to talk to Bro. Among them, she said, beginning to cry at the memory, were three young black women. One of them said she had been walking alongside Heather the day of the protest, when Heather said “watch out” and pushed her. When the car rammed into the crowd, Heather had pushed her out of the way again, saving her. “I was very reassured,” her mother said. “At the very last second of her life … she wasn’t scared. She was in charge.” ‘She hated statues of any kind’ The rise of rightwing populism, in America and in Europe, has often been blamed on “economic anxiety” of working-class white voters. But many of the white men who have funded and led white nationalist organizing for decades have not had just college degrees, but degrees from leading universities – Yale, Brown, Chicago – and some have supported their racist agenda with their family wealth. Richard Spencer, the poster boy of the white nationalist “alt-right”, earned two degrees before he failed to finish a PhD program in intellectual history at Duke. William Regnery, Spencer’s backer at the generically named National Policy Institute, has poured his money into racist organizing for years. Some of the most active new white nationalists groups are attempting to focus their recruitment efforts on college campuses. The rally of white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups in Charlottesville was not spontaneous. It was the culmination of months of planning and networking between different far-right groups, and of years of investment by Regnery and others. With the Heather Heyer Foundation, Bro is trying to make a different kind of investment, in a different kind of organizing. Wilson, Heather’s supervisor, had been relieved when he saw that a crowdfunding account for Heather’s family had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in the days immediately after her death. He knew Heather had had no insurance, and the fundraising would give Bro, who was working as a bookkeeper and secretary, the money to pay for Heather’s funeral. When they talked about how to handle the money, Wilson said, he had told Bro that “What Heather would want you to do is stop struggling in life.” Bro is adamant that her daughter not be honored by having the park where the white nationalists demonstrated renamed after her. “Everyone who knows Heather knows that she hated statues of any kind,” she added. Instead, she seized on Wilson’s mention of starting a foundation. For the past month, she has been crisscrossing the country, talking about her daughter’s legacy and raising awareness about her foundation, which will give scholarships to future educators, paralegals, social workers and others trying to advance peaceful social change. She announced the foundation at the Video Music Awards in Los Angeles, and last week accepted the 2017 Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Award for Social Justice that had been given posthumously to Heather. In Greece, anti-fascist protesters have put Heather’s face on posters and signs as they have demonstrated against Golden Dawn, a violent neo-Nazi political party that now has seats in the Greek parliament. At her public events, people come up to Bro to vow that, following Heather’s example, they are going to take action. One Charlottesville local called Bro herself a “beacon of light”. “Sometimes, I’m still baffled by it. I’m baffled by someone saying I’m so brave and so wonderful. What would you want me to do? This is who I am. I don’t know any other way to be,” Bro told me. She attributes some of her strength to her family background. Though she was raised in the city, Heyer’s parents both came from coalmining families. “In my experience, being from mountain people, we are resilient and self-reliant – strong people.” She has been surprised, as she has traveled across the country, how many people reach out to her not just to offer comfort, but to be comforted themselves. All kinds of people have shared their grief with her, but she has heard in particular from queer Americans, and from mixed-race couples and mixed-race children. “I think we’ve got to have some difficult, very difficult conversations about people’s beliefs and their anger and their hurt and what it is they need fixed to feel right again,” she said. “We’re not going to hug it out and be happy. That’s just not reality. But we can listen to one another.” “People are listening to me right now, so I’m talking right now,” she said. “When they stop listening, I might shut up, I might not. I’m not good at shutting up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/28/donald-trump-waives-jones-act-puerto-rico","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T13:10:21Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump waives Jones Act to allow foreign ships to supply Puerto Rico","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/donald-trump-waives-jones-act-puerto-rico","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/28/donald-trump-waives-jones-act-puerto-rico","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump waives Jones Act to allow foreign ships to supply Puerto Rico","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The White House on Thursday waived an act that was preventing foreign ships from delivering supplies to Puerto Rico, more than a week after Hurricane Maria devastated the US territory. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a tweet that Donald Trump had authorized the Jones Act to be waived for Puerto Rico at the request of its governor, Ricardo Rosselló. “It will go into effect immediately,” she said. The Jones Act requires goods sent between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by the US. But lawmakers said it slowed the delivery of much-needed aid to Puerto Rico, where millions of Americans do not have electricity, adequate access to clean drinking water or a reliable fuel supply. The law was suspended in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma to help ships reach Florida and Texas, but the president expressed reluctance to do the same for Puerto Rico. “We’re thinking about that,” Trump said on Wednesday. “But we have a lot of shippers and a lot of people that work in the shipping industry that don’t want the Jones Act lifted, and we have a lot of ships out there right now.” The situation in Puerto Rico is dire – few of the hospitals are functioning and about 44% of residents are without clean drinking water, according to the US Department of Defense. There are food shortages and some isolated parts of the territory are still without functioning telecommunications systems. Cash is also running low on the island, where only a few banks are open and lines to withdraw money stretch for hours. Lawmakers, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, had pushed the government to waive the Act. McCain sent a letter to the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Elaine Duke, on Tuesday arguing the Jones Act should be suspended for good. “Now, more than ever, it is time to realize the devastating effect of this policy and implement a full repeal of this archaic and burdensome Act,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/sep/28/late-night-trump-culture-war-samantha-bee-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T14:49:46Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts blast Trump for 'openly stoking a culture war'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/28/late-night-trump-culture-war-samantha-bee-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/sep/28/late-night-trump-culture-war-samantha-bee-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts blast Trump for 'openly stoking a culture war'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Wednesday addressed Donald Trump’s ongoing feud with the NFL, as well as the Alabama senatorial primary race, in which the candidate Trump endorsed, Luther Strange, lost to Roy Moore. “The president has had his hands full openly stoking a culture war,” Samantha Bee began. “Last week on sports roundup we were trying to figure out if the president is a white nationalist, which he clarified this week when he demanded that black people be fired for insufficient nationalism.” “And if anyone knows about treating soldiers and first responders with respect, it’s the guy that decided to fire transgender troops and deport paramedics who happen to be Dreamers,” the host continued. “Having been told to be upset, some Trump/Steelers fans eagerly obliged by setting their own clothes on fire,” Bee said. “You see what Trump’s trying to do. Take a protest specifically about police brutality and pretend it’s about the Star-Spangled Banner and ‘Oh say can you see’.” “Well it’s not going to work, Cloud Donald, Americans are too smart to fall for your flag gambit,” Bee said, before showing clips of Fox News pundits passionately objecting to the players’ protests. “I’m sorry, we are not actually too smart,” Bee said, before noting that the tradition of standing for the anthem at NFL games dates back only to 2009. “If an entire nation is going to soil its jorts over a hallowed tradition, it should at least be older than the Kanye-Swift feud.” “The general sentiment over at the Traditional Values Network is that nothing fucks up a Sunday like people kneeling,” the host continued. “Ultimately conservative ex-cons and pundits were left asking the same question about the protesters they ask about healthcare and education and everything else: why would anyone who has lots of money care what happens to people who don’t?” Bee then showed the former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich saying that if multimillionaire athletes feel oppressed, they “need a therapist”. “No, if you’re a multimillionaire who feels oppressed, you’re a Fox News personality,” Bee quipped. “And you still need a therapist and probably a very good lawyer.” Trevor Noah of Comedy Central weighed in on the Alabama Senate race, which pitted Trump-endorsed Luther Strange against former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore. “Let’s get to our big story tonight, the race that’s been dominating Alabama,” Noah began. “No, not white people, I mean the Senate race.” “Republicans went to the polls to choose between two candidates, Roy Moore, former Alabama chief justice, and Luther Strange, the 6ft 9in former attorney general,” Noah explained. “Now, the reason a Republican primary race became national news is the same reason everything becomes national news. Mango Unchained got involved.” Noah went on: “You’d think that an Alabama Republican race with Donald Trump endorsing one of the candidates isn’t even a race, right? Because that guy is just going to plow over everyone else. What makes this story different is that everyone on Trump’s team was supporting the other guy.” Noah then explained that housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, former White House senior adviser Steve Bannon, and other Republican personalities such as Sarah Palin all supported Moore over Strange. “Last night, Alabama Republicans chose which endorsement they preferred,” Noah said, noting that Moore defeated Strange. “Unfortunately for Donald Trump, his supporters didn’t vote for the guy he wanted them to. And he handled this defeat as graciously as he handles everything in life.” The host then showed news reports claiming Trump was “embarrassed and pissed” about Strange’s defeat. “Donald Trump was so humiliated he even deleted a bunch of his tweets where he told people to vote for Luther Strange,” Noah added. “I know this is a small thing, but in a weird way it’s a big thing,” he continued. “I would want a president smart enough to know that just because you delete the tweets doesn’t mean that they’re gone. If someone went up to Trump and said, got your nose, I’m afraid he’d be like, my nose, my nose!” Finally, CBS’s Stephen Colbert briefly discussed Trump’s apparent confusion over the state of the GOP’s Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill. “Trump’s not giving up on repeal and replace just yet,” Colbert said. “The Senate has a Friday deadline to pass it with 50 votes and even though they do not have the votes, Trump insists they have the votes.” Colbert showed an interview in which the president, even after Republicans pulled the bill and said they wouldn’t vote on it, repeatedly says they “have the votes”. At the end of the video, he acknowledges they are “one off, maybe two”. “Then you don’t have the votes,” Colbert quipped. “That’s like a baseball manager saying, ‘As you know we have the home run, we’re just one maybe two bases short.’” “So they have the votes, but they’re not going to have the vote,” Colbert said, before showing a clip from the same interview in which Trump says the vote is delayed because a senator he neglected to name is in the hospital. “You don’t even know his name,” Colbert shot back. “By the way, there is no one in the hospital, we checked. And while it’s unclear which senator Trump is referring to, whoever it is I just pray they’re not on Trumpcare.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/30/jacob-kenedy-chef-kitchen-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T09:00:29Z","webTitle":"Chef Jacob Kenedy: ‘I do a lot of cooking at home and I never lost my passion for it' | A cook’s kitchen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/30/jacob-kenedy-chef-kitchen-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/30/jacob-kenedy-chef-kitchen-interview","fields":{"headline":"‘I do a lot of cooking at home and I never lost my passion for it’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I live above Plaquemine Lock – my pub-turned-Southern restaurant in Islington. I was born here, opposite the pub on Noel Road, on the other side of the canal, but am newly returned. I didn’t think I’d ever been here when it was still a working pub, but my childhood au pair visited from Israel after we’d just opened and said she used to bring me in here for tea in the pram after a morning walk. So the whole thing feels quite serendipitous. I’d been nursing the idea of a Louisiana-style restaurant for a few years, and when the pub came up, it fell into place. There’s no style of food that goes quite so well with alcoholic drinks as Cajun and Creole, and we’re right by the water here, which feels fitting ... I commissioned Darwen Terracotta, a British company specialising in faience – glazed ceramic tiles that are moulded to buildings – to do the cladding for the pub exterior. They have an amazing catalogue of glaze recipes, so we got this bold, and splashy splashback for the flat while we were at it. It’s an investment in our happiness – and in British workers in some measure, who deserve our support. It sits on the back of the chimney breast and I love it. It’s really important to me to have as big a work surface as possible. That in turn needed a big – but not flashy – light. Mine is a simple ring of LEDs, a design called Doppio, by German lighting firm Sattler. The moka coffee pot to my left is an Alessi Pulcina. It makes delicious coffee (I just use Lavazza espresso) and it means I don’t use Nespresso capsules, which, convenient as they are, are horribly wasteful. I do a lot of cooking at home and I never lost my passion for it. A week rarely goes by that we don’t entertain. The kitchen is the heart of the home and it’s only really beating when you’re cooking in it. This is how I justified the Wolf cooker, which is huge and expensive, but pretty incredible to use. My favourite thing to work with in the kitchen is dough. I learned to hand-roll pasta at a trattoria called Anna-Maria in Bologna, using a very very long rolling pin like this one I am holding. The two enamelware vessels are my favourite pots. I use the orange one, passed down through my family, for stocks, lobster and large amounts of pasta. The other, yellow one by my left hand I use for stews, casseroles, even pies without the lid. It’s a 1950s a Creuset called Le Coquelle – an aspirational design, I think. It’s got hope in it, and we need hope these days.

But that’s what he was","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Long ago, in another time, I got a call from a lawyer. Hugh Hefner was threatening a libel action against me and the paper I worked for at the time, for something I had written. Journalists live in dread of such calls. I had called Hefner a pimp. To me this was not even controversial; it was self-evident. And he was just one of the many “libertines” who had threatened me with court action over the years. It is strange that these outlaws have recourse in this way, but they do. But at the time, part of me wanted my allegation to be tested in a court of law. What a case it could have made. What a hoot it would have been to argue whether a man who procured, solicited and made profits from women selling sex could be called a pimp. Of course, central to Playboy’s ideology is the idea that women do this kind of thing willingly; that at 23 they want nothing more than to jump octogenarians. Now that he’s dead, the disgusting old sleaze in the smoking jacket is being spoken of as some kind of liberator of women. Kim Kardashian is honoured to have been involved. Righty ho. I don’t really know which women were liberated by Hefner’s fantasies. I guess if you aspired to be a living Barbie it was as fabulous as it is to be in Donald Trump’s entourage. Had we gone to court, I would like to have heard some of the former playmates and bunnies speak up in court – because over the years they have. The accounts of the “privileged few” who made it into the inner sanctum of the 29-room Playboy mansion as wives/girlfriends/bunny rabbits are quite something. In Hefner’s petting zoo/harem/brothel, these interchangeable blondes were put on a curfew. They were not allowed to have friends to visit. And certainly not boyfriends. They were given an “allowance”. The big metal gates on the mansion that everyone claimed were to keep people out of this “nirvana” were described by one-time Hefner “girlfriend no 1” Holly Madison in her autobiography thus: “I grew to feel it was meant to lock me in.” The fantasy that Hefner sold was not a fantasy of freedom for women, but for men. Women had to be strangely chaste but constantly available for the right price. Dressing grown women as rabbits – once seen as the height of sophistication – is now seen as camp and ironic. There are those today who want to celebrate Hefner’s contribution to magazine journalism, and I don’t dispute that Playboy did use some fantastic writers. Part of Hefner’s business acumen was to make the selling of female flesh respectable and hip, to make soft porn acceptable. Every man’s dream was to have Hefner’s lifestyle. Apparently. Every picture of him, right to the end, shows him with his lizard smirk surrounded by blonde clones. Every half-wit on Twitter is asking if Hefner will go to heaven when he already lived in it. But listen to what the women say about this heaven. Every week, Izabella St James recalls, they had to go to his room and “wait while he picked the dog poo off the carpet – and then ask for our allowance. A thousand dollars counted out in crisp hundred dollar bills from a safe in one of his bookcases.” If any of them left the mansion and were not available for club nights where they were paraded, they didn’t get their allowance. The sheets in the mansion were stained. There was to be no bickering between girlfriends. No condoms could be used. A nurse sometimes had to be called to Hefner’s “grotto” if he’d had a fall. Nonetheless, these young women would have to perform. Hefner – repeatedly described as an icon for sexual liberation – would lie there with, I guess, an iconic erection, Viagra-ed to the eyeballs. The main girlfriend would then be called to give him oral sex. There was no protection and no testing. He didn’t care, wrote Jill Ann Spaulding. Then the other women would take turns to get on top of him for two minutes while the girls in the background enacted lesbian scenarios to keep “Daddy” excited. Is there no end to this glamour? Well now there is, of course. But this man is still being celebrated by people who should know better. You can dress it up with talk of glamour and bunny ears and fishnets, you can talk about his contribution to gonzo journalism, you can contextualise his drive to free up sex as part of the sexual revolution. But strip it all back and he was a man who bought and sold women to other men. Isn’t that the definition of a pimp? I couldn’t possibly say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/28/armie-hammer-call-me-by-your-name-there-were-all-these-fetishes-i-didnt-understand","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-28T15:26:30Z","webTitle":"Armie Hammer on gay romance Call Me By Your Name: ‘There were fetishes I didn’t understand’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/28/armie-hammer-call-me-by-your-name-there-were-all-these-fetishes-i-didnt-understand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/28/armie-hammer-call-me-by-your-name-there-were-all-these-fetishes-i-didnt-understand","fields":{"headline":"Armie Hammer on gay romance Call Me By Your Name: ‘There were fetishes I didn’t understand’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Armie Hammer strides in to the press room a few minutes early, catching the eight or nine assembled journalists mid-conversation. There can be no ignoring him. Cartoonishly handsome, with a big square slab of jaw and a grin that arrives a couple of seconds before he does, he is also 6ft 5in tall. “What did I miss, what’s happening, something funny?” asks the 31-year-old actor. Gesturing at a colleague’s bulbous yellow microphone, I explain that I was remarking on its resemblance to a lemon and pointing out that it would have been more fitting if it were a peach. “Ah,” smiles Hammer. “Why do I have the feeling I’m going to be getting this a lot?” His suspicion is correct. A peach figures only briefly in the rhapsodic gay coming-of-age story Call Me by Your Name, but that hasn’t stopped the scene in question defining the picture in the minds of those who see it. It is Elio (Timothée Chalamet), the precocious 17-year-old son of an American professor, who uses the fruit as a masturbatory aid; his older lover, Oliver (Hammer), who is staying with the family in northern Italy as the professor’s research assistant, merely raises it to his lips afterwards, perhaps contemplating TS Eliot’s question from The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock (“Do I dare to eat a peach?”) or wondering whether it’s going to count as one of his five-a-day. Though Call Me by Your Name is deliciously sunny and sensuous, it has a proper sensitivity toward the pain, as well as the pleasure, of first love, as might be expected from Luca Guadagnino, the director of I Am Love and A Bigger Splash. Hammer seems dazed by the uniformly ecstatic notices the film has received. “I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop,” he says, pulling up a chair. Practically the only criticism so far, however, came last month from the actor James Woods, who expressed his disapproval by tweeting: “As they quietly chip away the last barriers of decency. #NAMBLA.” (The hashtag referred to North American Man/Boy Love Association, a paedophile advocacy group.) The next morning, Hammer replied: “Didn’t you date a 19-year-old when you were 60 …?” Miaow. Hammer is joined by Chalamet, who is 10 years his junior. After all they’ve done on screen, it’s no surprise to see them goofing around and exchanging big, unembarrassed smackers. When asked if he has ever experienced the sort of love chronicled in the movie, Chalamet assumes a wistful tone: “I have, actually. It was the summer I was working with this actor named Armie Hammer …” Several hours later, I get Hammer to myself. He shakes my hand hesitantly; he is recovering from having recently torn off his pectoral muscle while working out. Indeed, his Instagram feed is a catalogue of injuries and hospital visits, among the snaps of how much legroom he has in first class and assorted portraits of “the Hammily” (as he refers to his wife, the TV host Elizabeth Chambers, with whom he runs a chain of Texan bakeries called Bird, and their two children). Playing Oliver, he tells me, didn’t come entirely naturally. “I’m not sure I could have done it unless I’d reached a certain level of understanding with Luca. It was really a matter of him beating it all into my thick skull. There were all these kinks and fetishes that I didn’t understand. Like, why does he want to eat the peach? Why does he say ‘Call me by your name and I’ll call you by mine’? If I didn’t understand those things, I wouldn’t have the character.” When explanations didn’t do the trick, Guadagnino resorted to film clips. For one scene, he showed Hammer a few minutes of Debra Winger in Bertolucci’s The Sheltering Sky: there is a lost look she gives that he felt was well-suited to the scene after Oliver and Elio have had sex for the first time. “I didn’t take it as ‘I want you to do it like this,’” Hammer explains. “It was more: ‘Do you see what’s going on in her head? Do you see her loss and confusion? That’s what I want you to feel. That’s what I think Oliver would be going through. Do you agree?’ I was, like: ‘I really do. Let me see how I can interpret that.’” Oliver is Hammer’s third gay role, following Clyde Tolson in Clint Eastwood’s J Edgar and the writer James Lord in Final Portrait, but if that represents a risk, no one seems to have told him. “None of my team has ever said: ‘I don’t know if it’s gonna be good for you to play a gay character.’ So I can only assume we are working our way through that stigma,” he says. Then again, he has a history of following his instincts. Though he hails from “old money” (his great-grandfather, Armand Hammer, was an art collector, philanthropist, Republican party donor and head of Occidental Petroleum), he defied his parents’ wishes by pursuing an acting career. Were they angry? “Yeah.” How did that feel? “I was committed and I was prepared to deal with whatever the consequences of that might be. I mean, they weren’t ever not taking my phone calls or anything. I just had to prove to them that my reason for becoming an actor wasn’t so that I didn’t have to carry on going to school.” Did they want him to go into the family business? “Or college, at least, you know?” he laughs. There was disappointment early on when George Miller’s proposed 2007 Justice League movie, in which he had been cast as Batman, fell apart. Depending on who you listen to, you can blame the writers’ strike, or the fact that Christopher Nolan didn’t want a parallel Batman running around on screen while The Dark Knight was still a going concern. But Hammer’s break came eventually with his dual portrayal of the Winklevoss twins, squaring off against Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network. Left unmonitored, Hammer’s preppy quality can shade into blandness, as it did in The Man from UNCLE and The Lone Ranger, but his choices are usually too offbeat to allow that to happen. He was part of the shoot-’em-up ensemble of Ben Wheatley’s Free Fire (and will shortly be seen fighting subterranean monsters in the same director’s Freakshift), while his bright, Tom Cruise-esque gnashers were hidden entirely as Amy Adams’s aloof husband in Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals. His enthusiasm for discussing Call Me By Your Name is understandably boundless but I wonder how the experience of universal acclaim compares with those times when it was withheld. After all, Hammer has starred in two pictures that were, for very different reasons, among the most vilified of recent years. First, he played the title character in The Lone Ranger alongside Johnny Depp as Tonto. Disney shut down production when the budget ballooned; by the time it was back on track, the smell of blood, or rather turkey, was in the air. The idiosyncratic western was never really given a chance by most critics, though the late Philip French called it “handsome, exciting, affectionate” and compared it favourably to Buster Keaton’s The General. Hammer sighs when I ask him to compare its reception to Call Me By Your Name’s. “It’s apples and oranges. Different kinds of movies, different kinds of monsters. That being said, this has been terrific, so to be part of a project like this, I’m happy for myself, for Timmy, for Luca…” He goes on to list several other people for whom he feels happy. Does he have faith that The Lone Ranger will be rediscovered or reclaimed in years to come? “I don’t know, man.” Another sigh. “That’s really beyond my scope of consciousness. I got to make the movie, it was one of the best times of my life. It’s like someone says in Call Me By Your Name: ‘You got to have the experience. Whatever comes after …’” He trails off. Was The Lone Ranger simply too strange to ever enjoy the kind of success needed to justify a $215m budget? All he will say is: “It’s quirky, for sure.” Maybe he’s simply learned to live with the anger he felt when he accused critics in 2013 of deciding “to slit the jugular of our movie.” The civil rights drama The Birth of a Nation, in which Hammer played a slave owner, died for entirely different reasons. Its reception at Sundance in 2016, where it was bought by Fox Searchlight for $17.5m, was every bit as positive as the one afforded there this year to Call Me By Your Name. Then details emerged of the 1999 rape accusation against its star and director, Nate Parker. Though Parker was exonerated, his accuser later took her life. What had been a surefire Oscar contender was hastily buried in the light of this revelation. Surely Hammer has some feelings or opinions about the film’s fate? “I don’t really know because I haven’t followed everything that’s been going on. I haven’t really been reading anything. I’ve been busy. We’ve been kinda doing this thing. I know that we got to make a movie that at the time felt like it was something very important. I don’t even really know what happened. There are people over at Fox Searchlight who are paid to worry about that sort of thing.” He doesn’t exactly say “I only work here”, but the implication is clear. “Actors come in at the 11th hour and we just stand in front of the camera and do our job,” he says. Another big grin – or is it the same one he’s been wearing all along? – and he’s off. Call Me By Your Name is at the London Film Festival 9-11 October and released in the UK 27 October. • This article was amended on the 29 September 2017.

On Thursday, gone were the niceties of previous “negotiation” rounds, in which both parties set out their desired priorities and provided assessments of each other’s progress towards them. Instead, the latest public showdown between David Davis and Michel Barnier provided the awkward spectacle of the Frenchman marking his own homework as well as that of his rival. “It will take weeks or maybe months before we are able to say, yes, there has been sufficient progress on the principles of an orderly withdrawal,” said the EU’s chief negotiator, in words that made clear Britain would not get to talk about its own desires for a long time to come. Ironically, things were much less tetchy. There was no talk this time of “ticking clocks”. It wasn’t necessary. Instead there were warm words for Davis’s boss, Theresa May, whose speech in Florence last week went part of the way toward meeting the demands of the EU on money and citizens’ rights. “The prime minister’s speech created a new dynamic,” said Barnier, stressing that she was moving closer to him, rather than the other way around, but still not fast enough. “Of course this is a proper negotiation,” insisted Davis, when asked whether he was now merely being asked to pass a series of tests set by the EU. “We are here every round with 100 officials,” said the Brexit secretary, who had himself spent much of the week visiting other EU leaders, frantically trying to find chinks in its apparently impenetrable positions. There was once talk of the negotiations being held alternately in London and Brussels. Now Barnier makes no bones about this being a game played on his turf, by his rules, and that Britain should keep coming back, and back, until it provides the right answer. “Let’s leave it here,” he concluded. “We will pick up in the week of 9 October, where we left off this week.” The brutal unevenness of their respective leverage does not mean of course that a deal will not be struck, or that the British will put up with this forever. For now, Downing Street is edging steadily closer to where Brussels wants it to be. May has conceded the principle that no EU state will be financially worse off as a result of Brexit; Barnier just wants to ensure the promise lasts longer than the first two years. The prime minister’s commitment to honouring past financial commitments was also welcomed. Next, the EU wants the UK to spell out precisely which commitments those are. On citizens’ rights, the UK has also moved, even if the EU has not. Barnier welcomed the offer of making their Brexit deal binding in UK courts, using EU legal principles. He still insists, however, that the European court of justice gets to decide if this is the case in practice. But British demands for these sticking points to get wrapped into a wider discussion about future relations were given short shrift. “Being very frank, I see no logical and coherent link between a discussion we will have as soon as possible about the future … and a discussion about the separation issues and commitments entered into in the past,” Barnier said. With article 50 not only invoked, but a quarter spent, perhaps there is little the British delegation can do. Barnier hides behind the notion that his hands are tied, but he is responsible for telling other EU leaders whether he thinks “sufficient progress” has been made to move to the next stage. With efforts to open a second front in other European capitals running into the sand, the government may soon face a stark choice between folding on the remaining points – ceding more money and control to Brussels – or facing rising demands from within the Conservative party to walk away without a deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/18/people-paying-tashkent-gentrification-mahallas","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T06:30:02Z","webTitle":"Tashkent City: is 'progress' worth the price being paid in Uzbekistan?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/18/people-paying-tashkent-gentrification-mahallas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/18/people-paying-tashkent-gentrification-mahallas","fields":{"headline":"Tashkent City: is 'progress' worth the price being paid in Uzbekistan?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Abdujalil Azimov sits on a stool listening to Uzbek pop on a transistor radio as his sheep graze contentedly in the evening sunshine on a strip of grass in the centre of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. In front rises a line of gleaming white marble blocks containing opulent new flats. Behind him sprawls Olmazor, a centuries-old higgledy piggledy settlement of wattle-and-daub houses that harks back to the ancient history of this central Asian city that was once a pitstop on the Silk Road. Azimov, a retired factory worker in his early sixties, was born in Olmazor, like his father, grandfather and great-grandfather before him. “My great-grandfather died here in 1934, at the age of 106,” he states proudly. But unlike his ancestors, Azimov (a pseudonym, names have been changed to protect anonymity) will not live out his days in his birthplace: Olmazor is slated for demolition. His house, where he lives with his wife, children and five grandchildren, will be bulldozed along with hundreds of other homes. In their place will rise a glitzy development of silver skyscrapers housing business centres, luxury apartments, hotels, offices and leisure facilities that the government hopes will put Tashkent on the international map. In the ambitious vision outlined by Uzbekistan’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who came to power a year ago following the death of his dictatorial predecessor Islam Karimov, the new development, called Tashkent City, will become a magnet for foreign investors, kickstarting an economic revolution to transform the Uzbek capital into a business hub for central Asia and beyond. With 2.4 million inhabitants, Tashkent is the region’s largest and most populous city, and in the Russian and Soviet colonial eras was central Asia’s political and cultural heartland. But during Karimov’s long rule, from before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 (which propelled Uzbekistan into independence) until his death last year, the Uzbek capital became a sleepy backwater, shunned by investors put off by basket-case Soviet-style economic practices and the government’s track record of grabbing their assets. Now, Mirziyoyev has embraced sweeping reforms intended to polish Uzbekistan’s reputation as an investment destination – and Tashkent City is all part of the plan. It’s “a tangible sign that says: we are open for business”, as Bakhtiyor Nishanov, an analyst at the Washington-based International Republican Institute, puts it. To build Tashkent City, the government has earmarked land around the size of a hundred football pitches slap bang in the city centre, near the Chorsu market, one of central Asia’s oldest and most vibrant bazaars, an area where mediaeval mosques and madrasahs rub shoulders with Stalin-era neoclassical edifices. Such juxtapositions embody Tashkent’s eclectic architectural heritage, which runs the gamut from glittering turquoise-domed mausoleums to the showy white marble structures favoured in post-independence Uzbekistan – a style critics deride as “dictator chic”. The tsarist colonialists left their mark in imposing rusty-hued brick structures, as did the Soviets in grandiose civic buildings and drab prefab tower blocks, livened up here and there with colourful murals depicting Uzbek motifs. The history of Tashkent (meaning “stone city”) dates back over two millennia, but most of its ancient architecture has been destroyed by upheavals both manmade and natural: from the sacking of the city by Genghis Khan in the 13th century to a devastating earthquake that razed swathes of it in 1966. Throughout all this, Tashkent’s close-knit Uzbek communities have lived on – in the Eski Shahar (Old Town) beloved by foreign tourists near Chorsu bazaar, where some houses date from the 14th century (although most are much more modern), and in the areas slated for demolition to build Tashkent City a stone’s throw away: Olmazor (“apple orchard”) and Oq’chi (meaning “fletcher”, harking back to a distant past when arrows were made here). Situated near Tashkent’s flying saucer-shaped Soviet-era circus and the squat Pakhtakor metro station, the mud-brick houses dotting the meandering lanes of Olmazor and Oq’chi reveal little from outside, but open on to airy courtyards where vines trail and fruit is laid out drying for the winter in the warm autumn sunshine. Most families have lived here for generations – but now they will have to go. “Tashkent City is going to extend from up there down through all these mahallas,” says Dilnoza Ikramova, a housewife wearing a pink hijab (most Uzbeks are Muslims, though not all practising), using the word for “neighbourhood”. “They’re going to knock all this down.” Uzbeks have a strong sense of family and community, so the breakup of the mahalla will be tough. “It’s a shame, of course. I’ve lived on the street all my life. My three brothers live in these houses with their families,” she says, gesturing down a narrow lane as a couple of boys kicked a dogeared football nearby. “I was born here, but what can you do? It’s the state that decides.” Like many others, she hopes the authorities will rehouse her extended family together, but so far official information is sparse. Bureaucrats are totting up how many people live here – but “no one knows”, shrugs an official sitting in the district council office. Rehousing the inhabitants will be a mammoth task: 12 people from three generations live in Ikramova’s house, which is fairly typical. Back in 2008, it was estimated that 10,000 people would need resettling from these districts, which have long been earmarked for demolition under an urban regeneration strategy that involves replacing mahallas like Olmazor and Oq’chi – which look like mediaeval villages in the heart of a 21st-century city – with modern dwellings and business developments. Most people here believe they will be offered flats in the suburbs, as their neighbours were when an adjacent district was knocked down several years ago. Ikramova is keen to move to an apartment with modern conveniences and running water, which the homes here lack – but others are resistant, both to moving out of the city centre and to being cooped up in a flat. “I don’t want to live in a box,” says an indignant Nilufar Aripova, who was sweeping the street outside her house, dusty after Uzbekistan’s long hot summer. “I’ve lived in Olmazor all my life, for 52 years. I was born a few streets away and moved here to my husband’s house as a kelinka [a young bride].” “I don’t want to leave this mahalla, but if I have to I want to be given another house big enough to keep us all together,” adds Aripova, who lives with her husband, three children and several grandchildren. The state may offer land instead of a flat – but the inhabitants would likely have to build their own houses on it at their own expense. They “will be offered various alternative options” that are yet to be decided, says Bahrom Rizayev, an official in charge of attracting investment for Tashkent City, but the planners are determined to “make sure they all get satisfactory new housing”. So far, despite Mirziyoyev’s investor-friendly reforms, western entrepreneurs are not queuing up to flash their cash in Uzbekistan. However, Rizayev says Turkish and Chinese investors have expressed interest in Tashkent City, and “the list will gradually grow”, adding, “great positive changes are taking place in our economy, so we believe our project will be a success”. Tashkent City will change the face of Uzbekistan’s capital – and turn upside down the lives of the people living in these old mahallas, whose eviction is the price to pay for gentrification. Azimov, the man tending his livestock in Olmazor, supplements his meagre pension by keeping a few sheep at home, grazing them outside to fatten them up before selling them. “I won’t be able to this when I’m living in a flat,” he says, with a wry smile. But some of those facing eviction are looking on the bright side. “We’ll be resettled or given compensation,” says Feruza Ahmetova, a smartly turned-out fiftysomething housewife with a row of gold teeth – a status symbol in Uzbekistan – and elegantly coiffed silver hair. “This is being done for all of us, for all of Uzbekistan. I hope Uzbekistan prospers, and I hope Tashkent prospers too. It’s progress.” This article was produced in collaboration with Eurasianet Do you live in one of the Stans cities, or have you spent time there? We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences.

He is also one of a select handful of writers who also appeared in the Observer’s 100 top novels. When he died in 1745, Swift was buried in his native Dublin with the celebrated epitaph “ubi saeva indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit” (where fierce indignation cannot further tear apart his heart), inscribed on his tomb. Fierce indignation was undoubtedly the chief inspiration for Swift’s blistering Juvenalian satire A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland, from Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country; and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick, one of the most savage and powerful tracts in the English language, a masterpiece of sustained, even relentless, irony. Swift published it anonymously, but his authorship soon got out. Besides, it bore the unmistakable marks of his style: “It is a melancholly Object to those who walk through this great Town [Dublin], or travel in the Country; when they see the Streets, the Roads, and Cabbin-doors crowded with Beggars of the Female Sex, followed by three, four, or six Children, all in Rags, and importuning every Passenger for an Alms.” Juvenal aside, scholarly debate about the inspiration for the Modest Proposal fingers several classical sources, particularly the Roman essayist Tertullian’s Apology, a satirical attack against Roman persecution of the early Christians. Some critics suggest that Swift saw major similarities between the plight of the Irish poor and the helpless Christians, and note that he felt an obvious affinity for Tertullian. But, finally, this approximately 4,000-word essay exhibits Swift at his merciless best, satirising his society’s heartless indifference to the plight of the poor as well as the long-term cruelty of the British government’s policies towards its Irish neighbour. Swift’s opening is a brilliant rhetorical feint, apparently inviting the reader into a well-researched examination of Ireland’s social conditions, especially among its beggars. After Swift’s painstaking calculations about the numbers of destitute children, their cost to the state, and the likely poor return on their potential sale into slavery, his conclusion is a both a stunning coup de théâtre and a brilliantly shocking reversal, which he offers very “humbly” in the hope that it will “not be liable to the least Objection”. He goes on: “I have been assured by a very knowing American of my Acquaintance in London; that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether Stewed, Roasted, Baked, or Boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a Fricasee or a Ragout.” From here – with his readers gasping – he develops his argument with logical precision and macabre brilliance. Swift proceeds to suggest that the indigent Irish might improve their economic prospects by selling their children as food for the rich, elaborating the idea with pitiless forensic zest. He cleverly concludes this outrageous case before the reader has wearied of the conceit. His final paragraph makes a wonderfully ironic conclusion: “I profess, in the Sincerity of my Heart, that I have not the least personal interest, in endeavouring to promote this necessary Work; having no other Motive than the publick Good of my Country, by advancing our Trade, providing for Infants, relieving the Poor, and giving some pleasure to the Rich. I have no Children, by which I can propose to get a single Penny; the youngest being nine Years old, and my Wife past Child-bearing.” A signature sentence “Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants.

The two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellites were launched on 17 March 2002 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, in north-west Russia. They fly in formation, about 140 miles (220km) apart, and measure the gravitational field of the Earth. The pull of gravity changes as water moves around the planet in seasonal patterns, and as ice deposits change thickness. With its monthly gravity map, Grace has revealed rapid ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica and mapped seasonal changes in water levels in the Yangtze river in China. On 4 September, one of Grace’s battery cells stopped working and its satellite ceased communication with ground controllers. The link was restored four days later, and the battery was found to be back to a workable voltage, but it was a clear sign that the twin spacecraft are ageing. Grace is now on its final data collecting run and in November both spacecraft will be sent onto different orbits and rendered inert. The separate orbits will ensure that they do not collide and create space debris. They will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and burn up early in 2018, with only small fragments expected to make it to the ground. Nasa says these pose a very small risk to people, and are well within their safety requirements for re-entering spacecraft. The mission’s end comes just a few months before its replacement, Grace Follow On, is due to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg air force base, California."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/sep/29/too-many-talented-women-still-languish-junior-whitehall-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T06:08:17Z","webTitle":"Too many talented women are languishing in junior public service jobs | Siobhan Benita","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/29/too-many-talented-women-still-languish-junior-whitehall-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/29/too-many-talented-women-still-languish-junior-whitehall-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Too many talented women still languish in junior Whitehall jobs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As a former senior civil servant who championed diversity initiatives, I am heartened to see that progress has been made on getting more women into senior public service leadership positions in G20 countries. The 2017 index of female leaders in senior positions in G20 countries, which this year also includes information about the 28 EU member states, shows the progress that has been made since data was first collected in 2013. In the past four years, the average number of women in these positions has risen by 6.9%. In the five top-ranked countries – Canada, Australia, South Africa, UK and Brazil – the average proportion has risen by 5 points and now stands at 41%. This progress is welcome – but it is not sufficient. Women remain underrepresented in senior civil service positions across all G20 countries. The average proportion in senior positions is a disappointing 26.4%. Across the 28 EU member states, the picture is better with the average proportion of women in senior positions standing at 40%. Even here, however, only five of the 28 countries have more women than men in these leadership roles. Achieving and maintaining gender equality is difficult. When I worked with the then cabinet secretary, Lord O’Donnell, on the UK civil service diversity strategy, he oversaw a comprehensive package of initiatives. These included: top-down targets for permanent secretaries, bottom-up networks and champions as well as numerous training programmes aimed at removing barriers to women’s progression. The issues of gender equality was brought to the fore and progress was made. Despite this intense focus, however, in 2013 – a year after O’Donnell had left the service – women still held only 35% of senior roles. In the past year, in the UK, the proportion of women in senior positions has risen by just 1.4 percentage points. Thankfully, it is not all too little, too slow. Two countries have made outstanding progress. In the past year, France has achieved the biggest improvement of any country, with an increase of 6 percentage points, leaping from 28% to 34% of women in senior roles. This is rivalled only by Mexico, which has more than doubled its female representation in senior roles, from 14% to 34%, achieving the overall highest rate of growth in the Index. Mexico and France have one key factor in common – they have both introduced quotas for women in senior civil service appointments. Despite resistance to quotas in the past, France now imposes gender quotas in many areas including corporate boards, professional organisations, sports federations, most elected political bodies and government ministries. In 2012, France also passed a law requiring that by 2018, 40% of nominations for executive posts in public services should be women. The European parliament has reported [pdf] that the target is likely to be met early. Back in 1997, the socialist government changed the constitution so that positive-action measures for women were given constitutional legitimacy for the first time and also established a specific unit, the “parity observatory” to oversee and monitor this area. In Mexico a national programme for equal opportunities and non-discrimination against women was established in 2013, which affects the executive, legislature and judiciary, as well as the three government layers, federal, state and municipal. The programme promotes equality and the representation of women in various decision-making positions. Quotas remain controversial, but it is time to accept that without them the pace of change remains unacceptably slow. Poor decisions continue to be made because of a lack of diversity at the top of departments, while talented women languish in junior roles. Affirmative action is required to elevate this talent and to create a generation of role models that will inspire both men and women for years to come. I would welcome the introduction of quotas at permanent secretary and director general level in the UK civil service, as this would force the pace of change and have a positive knock-on effect further down the organisation. It might also accelerate the appointment of the first female cabinet secretary. That really would signify progress.

Encircled by the arms of two women in summery cottons, he gazes steadily at the camera. The elegance is deceptive: it was taken when the family were living in poverty in a refugee camp in the Philippines, en route for the US, after being expelled from Vietnam. Vuong, the only child in the three-generation exodus, was two years old. A fellow refugee was bartering photographs for food. “That picture cost my family three tins of rice, according to my mother,” he says. “Each of us gave up our ration just to be seen.” His debut collection, Night Sky With Exit Wounds, is the work of a man with history on his back, even if he has had to imagine some of it into being again. He brings a mythmaker’s insistence on being seen and heard to subjects ranging from the death of Telemachus’s father, from Homeric myth, to the fall of Saigon and common-or-garden masturbation. Already festooned with awards when it arrived in the UK, the book went on to gobble up the Forward prize for best first collection. Observer reviewer Kate Kellaway described it as “a conduit for a life in which violence and delicacy collide”, while New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani was impressed by “a tensile precision reminiscent of Emily Dickinson’s work, combined with a Gerard Manley Hopkins-like appreciation for the sound and rhythms of words”. The poet mopping up all this attention is a small, androgynous figure who radiated a quiet charisma when he took to the vast stage of the Royal Festival Hall, in London, for the Forward prize readings. “Well,” he confesses later, “I don’t have any jokes and my timing is terrible, so I thought the only way to get through it was to hide in the poems. I just climbed into the book and lived there for a while.” In his telling, Vuong’s life story begins two generations before he was born, when his American grandfather, a Michigan farm boy who “wanted to be Miles Davis”, joined the US navy with his trumpet in his backpack and was posted to Vietnam, where he fell in love with “an illiterate girl from the rice paddies”. This translates, in a piece called Notebook Fragments, as: “An American soldier fucked a Vietnamese farmgirl. Thus my mother exists. Thus I exist. Thus no bombs = no family = no me. / Yikes.” In fact, he says, his grandparents were married with three daughters when his grandfather decided to visit his family in the US, and was wrong-footed by the fall of Saigon. “My life and my mother’s life wouldn’t have happened without the war. But despite all this, two people loved each other, and the big lesson for me as an artist is that life is always more complicated than the headlines allow; poetry comes in when the news is not enough.” Before the fall, Saigon had been known as the Paris of south-east Asia – “Nobody thought the apocalypse would happen.” One poem of exile evokes pigeons pecking at bits of bread from a bombed bakery: “Broken baguettes. Crushed croissants. Gutted cars.” Another plays with the surreal fact, relayed to him by his grandmother when he was small but only understood as an adult, that the start of the US evacuation was signalled by Irving Berlin’s White Christmas playing on Armed Forces Radio, in a country that didn’t know the meaning of snow. It became dangerous to be seen as a collaborator, so his grandmother put the three girls into different orphanages. Why the separation? “Because it was a humanitarian crisis and there was more chance of them surviving like that,” he explains. His grandmother was also worried they might be stolen and taken out of Vietnam. As the daughters of a US serviceman they would have been eligible for Operation Babylift, a project to evacuate children and put them up for adoption. If the girls had been together, they might also have provided a family ticket for dissidents hoping to travel to the US, he says. By the time the family were reunited, his mother was an adult. She had given birth to Ocean when she was 18, and was washing men’s hair in a Saigon salon when a policeman realised that she was of mixed race and therefore working illegally under Vietnamese law. The whole family was evacuated to the Philippines while the Salvation Army processed their claim for admission to the US. After eight months in limbo they were moved on to Hartford, Connecticut, where Vuong’s father quickly disappeared, leaving him to be raised by his mother, grandmother and aunt. One of the pleasures of his poems is the interplay of myth and reality. How, for instance, can his collection be so full of fathers when Vuong grew up in a household of women? “Western mythology is so charged with the father,” he says. “Personally, I’m always asking who’s my father. Like Homer, I felt I’d better make it up. The Japanese have a word for it: yugen, when you have so little you have to imagine it.” There is a bigger point in this: “I was thinking about Homer particularly, who wrote those two epic poems out of a historical event that happened nearly 400 years in the past. I admired that audacity to invent. In inventing he preserved history.” Although Vuong lost his father, he regained his grandfather, who was by then married to a university academic and living in Florida. So from one household of women who couldn’t read but were constantly telling stories, he would fly across the country to another in which a scholarly quiet reigned. “There was this tensile silence as they turned the pages. It was so potent that I felt whatever is in there I’ve got to find out.” But he was “a terrible student”, who was propelled by his family’s ambition to stick it out at a rough school, where “being a slight, queer, yellow boy, it was very easy to be picked on”. Reading was particularly hard, and he suspects that dyslexia runs in his family, though he says now: “I think perhaps the disability helped me a bit, because I write very slowly and see words as objects. I’m always trying to look for words inside words. It’s so beautiful to me that the word laughter is inside slaughter.” Vuong was expecting to follow his mother into work at a nail salon, but was persuaded to enrol at the local community college, where his life changed course on the very first day. “This woman said, ‘We’re going to read Foucault, and a lot will go over your head but some of it will stick and you’ll get it.’ That first day we were offered the gift of potential, and not only offered it – it was demanded of us.” By the time he left he was reading Baudelaire and Langston Hughes, and knew that he wanted to be a poet even if it was destined to be a dream deferred as he worked out a way to support his mother. He signed up for a degree in international marketing at New York’s Pace University, but walked out after eight weeks “because I was so tired of learning how to lie”. For months, he recalls floundering, sleeping on friends’ couches, unable to tell his mother that he had dropped out. But gradually he began to discover “the lush literary life”, going to open mic sessions and mixing with writers. Then someone told him that to be a poet he needed an English degree (“I said, ‘But I already speak English’”). More by luck than judgment he won a place at Brooklyn College, where he walked into the English faculty to find himself face to face with portraits of two of his heroes: Allen Ginsberg and John Ashbery. “I found my people. I was seen for the first time.” After graduating, he led “the life of any young poet – you just cast your little poems around and hope for the best”. He was living in a cheap New York apartment, down a long, narrow hallway, which he papered with poems, moving them around into different sequences. “Each poem was a little room. I could see how they grew and started to gain resonance and meaning.” He put together Night Sky With Exit Wounds for an open competition that promised to send a personal rejection to every entrant. “I said, ‘Oh my, a personal rejection. Maybe that’ll give me some tips and push me back out there with a better idea.’” Instead, he received an offer to publish it from the Seattle-based indie Copper Canyon Press. Today he is no longer “any young poet” but an award-winning 28-year-old writer with a novel in the works, and an assistant professorship on the MFA programme at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, down the road from where Emily Dickinson once lived. “Because of the precarious nature of my own history I don’t like to be confined to any genre, given any label. Ultimately, we’re all just writing sentences and telling stories,” he says. “In New York everyone’s in your way until you talk to them – the writer only needs to pay attention. What I do know is that when you’re telling stories it’s very hard to hate each other.” He shares a little house nearby with his partner of 10 years, Peter, an ex-lawyer and the one good thing to have come out of his eight weeks at business school. Best of all, he says, he has just bought his mother a house. “I went about it in a roundabout way and it did take longer, but I did it. She always wanted a garden – and she got it through poetry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
