Spectacular, actually, especially against a bright blue sky with clouds as fluffy as George Washington’s hair. The bad news is that you can’t clamber all over the giant sculpture, getting up Teddy Roosevelt’s nose or hiding in Abraham Lincoln’s beard as if you’re in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1959 thriller North by Northwest. They just don’t let tourists get that close. But the views from the approach roads and public paths are great nonetheless, and it’s an obvious place to start a visit to South Dakota. On first thought, South Dakota might appear too big and too obscure a state for a week’s vacation. But that’s where Hitchcock and Hollywood come in handy. Pick from decades of movies set in South Dakota and you’ll find legendary towns, incredible wildlife and tumultuous history, all within easy driving range. Think of Dances With Wolves, Little Big Man, How the West Was Won, Calamity Jane, Hidalgo, Badlands, Thunderheart – all the anti-westerns, crime thrillers and murder mysteries. They make an excellent, if eccentric, unofficial travel guide. There is a notable exception. For reasons to be examined later, you can ignore The Revenant, despite Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning turn as a mountain man mauled by a bear in South Dakota, whose tale of human survival became a legend. So. Start in Rapid City, which is small and does not move rapidly, but where some good food and the performing and fine arts can be found. Check off Mount Rushmore and the nearby Crazy Horse Memorial of a figure on horseback being slowly carved into another mountain. Crazy Horse was one of the great Lakota Native American leaders who, along with the Nakota and the Dakota, comprise the First Nation the US came to call the Sioux. From the mountains, head for buffalo country. The buffalo, also known as bison, were almost extinct by 1900 but just about hung on, and can now be seen wandering in certain parts of South Dakota – if you know where to look. Driving south from Mount Rushmore is already a lovely experience of meandering country roads, meadows, forests and craggy hills with fantastic overlooks. And on the aptly named Wildlife Loop road I saw my first buffalo of the trip, staring at me placidly from the edge of the woods. Eager to see more, I ventured on a whim up a random dirt side road, not far from Wind Cave national park, and hit the bison jackpot. A mile or two along the track, I pulled over and saw dozens of buffalo lumbered over the brow of a tree-lined hill. Their aroma pungent and with dust falling from their thick coats, they tramped right by the car towards the setting sun, huffing and snorting as they went. It seems unexpected to find them in woodland, but it’s a miracle they are here at all. To the east of Rapid City, the flat landscape that leads to the Badlands is dotted with old homesteads and ghost towns amid modern farms and ranches. Out of level terrain, a 50-mile wall of jagged rock suddenly rears up, dividing the prairie with a wide, high rocky barrier, where it’s searing hot all summer and devoid of water and shade (hence the name). The area’s a national park now and it makes for a weird hiking experience. In the past, it was a dreaded obstacle for wagon trains. This was also where the Lakota tried to escape from the advancing US army in 1890 but were pursued south to a barren place where their last hope of resisting the white man died in the massacre at Wounded Knee, where hundreds of Lakota men, women and children were shot in cold blood. The 1992 movie Thunderheart, with Val Kilmer and Graham Greene, is set in the Badlands, are both good for scenery and insight. As a visitor to the Badlands now, there’s a bleak allure to the topography, especially when sunrise and sunset bring out the orange and red layers of the rocky pinnacles and bighorn sheep are silhouetted on the tops of little buttes. Hiking into the heart of the outcrop is just freaky. Hot as hell, dry as a bone and full of rattlesnakes. But somehow the remoteness and tranquility are calming. Or, I was calm, until a large snake in the tough grass beside the narrow trail reared up and shook its rattle at me angrily. I leapt into the air with a shriek. The warning signs posted at the trailheads aren’t joking. Beside the road circling the park, it’s easy to spot pronghorn antelope and thousands of prairie dogs. There are even small owls, which live in abandoned prairie dog burrows and sit next to the holes in broad daylight, staring unblinkingly at the passing motorists. You can experience both sides of the American coin in the Badlands. On the north side is the tiny, tourist trap town of Wall with its locally-famouslabyrinthine drug store full of trashy food and souvenirs. And just a few miles away at the Minuteman Missile site, now a national historic site with a visitor center, you can see where fingers were poised above nuclear triggers, ready to dispatch ICBMs from silos during the cold war. The south side is a sharp contrast – miles of inhospitable land where the routed Lakota were bundled on to reservations. There are few attractions there and the impoverished towns are dispiriting. But on a lonely rise near Pine Ridge and the Nebraska border is an evocative spot. Here stands a pathetic, ragtag little cemetery that’s about the only memorial to the Wounded Knee massacre. Oddly, Johnny Depp said in 2013, around the time of his controversial outing as Tonto in the Lone Ranger, that he wanted to buy the Wounded Knee site and give it to the Lakota. But it’s never happened. “Their land was lost to them, replaced by the wretchedness of the reservation, and the buffalo were all gone,” reads a quote from the book Spirit of the Plains People, which is printed prominently on a display board in the Prairie Edge store in Rapid City, which sells excellent Native American arts and crafts from the region. The remote hilltop at Wounded Knee and the surrounding Pine Ridge Reservation are certainly a far cry from the lush Black Hills mountains further north, where the Lakota used to roam freely. “Take me back to the Black Hills, the Black Hills of Dakota, to the beautiful Indian country that I love,” Doris Day sang sweetly in the title role of the 1953 classic Calamity Jane. Or was it “that I stole”? When gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the early 1870s, prospectors, gunslingers, soldiers, hucksters and bandits had driven the Lakota out ruthlessly. Your heart may bleed at the travesty even as you can’t resist retracing the steps of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok to the bars and casinos of the Black Hills canyon town of Deadwood, where they lived it up, died and are buried in a large, leafy cemetery on a hill above main street. If Doris Day’s screen number is too dated and ridiculous to whet your appetite, think instead of HBO’s dramatic series that simply took the title, Deadwood. The cult TV hit was brutally killed off a decade ago at the end of its third season. But legions of fans are still wistful for its raw depiction of a potty-mouthed, drunken Jane and her ilk in the poker dens of the feral town. Recent talk of a big screen version refuses to die. Wild West tourist schlock notwithstanding, hiking in the vast area covered by the Black Hills is superb. There’s even a sign down one tiny road near the town of Spearfish that declares that scenes from Dances With Wolves were shot there, even though most of the action in that movie takes place on the plain. And so to The Revenant. Here’s the thing. The movie interprets the real life story of Hugh Glass, who was almost killed by a bear while on a trapping expedition near what is now Lemmon in northern South Dakota. He was abandoned by his fellows and defied death by crawling a hundred miles then rafting down a river towards safety. It’s an extraordinary tale, graphically depicted on the silver screen amid sumptuous scenery. The problem is, all that gorgeous countryside was filmed in Canada and Argentina, not South Dakota. And a quick Google search showed me that the journey from Deadwood to Lemmon would be long, with nothing very interesting to see or do when I got there, and not worth the pilgrimage. What to do instead? No-brainer. I turned to a different page, figuratively, from my unofficial Hollywood handbook and drove a short way into eastern Wyoming, to Devils Tower. This huge rock formation has always been beloved but became world famous when depicted as the landing site for the alien spaceship at the climax of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In the decades since that 1977 mega-hit, Devils Tower could easily have become Disneyfied and there are plenty of green-alien fridge magnets to buy around there. But the rock itself is protected as a national monument so it’s relatively unadulterated – and out of this world. And it was such an easy, pleasant drive back to Rapid City. Even after a busy week I’d barely seen a fraction of South Dakota, which covers a daunting 77,000-plus square miles. But with a population under a million and the vast majority of it flat as a pancake, I knew I’d seen the most interesting fraction. The camera doesn’t lie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/15/roy-lichtenstein-in-the-car-dramatic-close-encounter","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"Roy Lichtenstein’s In the Car: a dramatic close encounter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/roy-lichtenstein-in-the-car-dramatic-close-encounter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/roy-lichtenstein-in-the-car-dramatic-close-encounter","fields":{"headline":"Roy Lichtenstein’s In the Car: a dramatic close encounter","bodyText":"Dot dot dot An early work derived from comic strips, this features Lichtenstein’s recreation of the mass media’s Ben-Day dots printing process.

They are not faceless City institutions. Many are small shareholders who had invested substantial sums, presumably in the belief the Rock was a solid north-east institution run by a competent board, and lost the lot. The problem with the compensation idea, however, is that it doesn’t stand up. Yes, it is probably true that the Rock was not insolvent, just suffering an extreme liquidity crisis. After all, the Treasury is set to make a clear profit from the run-off of the mortgage book. But those profits are not evidence of unfair confiscation. Taxpayers assumed a risk the Rock was unable to bear because it had been running a risky and reckless funding model that couldn’t withstand the crisis. For a bank, lack of liquidity can be a life-threatening event. Regulators at the Financial Services Authority were asleep, but that doesn’t alter the compensation argument. If the Rock had fallen into administration rather than being nationalised after a fruitless search for a buyer, shareholders would almost certainly have been wiped out anyway. The independent expert decided zero compensation was due and his judgment was upheld on appeal. The campaigners’ other point is that the owners of Royal Bank of Scotland were treated less harshly. Again, that is factually correct, but so what? Taxpayers took 89% control of RBS, rather than 100%, because the Treasury wanted to maintain a stock market listing and keep the bank subject to outside pressures. With hindsight, that decision was probably a mistake, but it doesn’t imply the Rock had to be treated the same way. Sadly, the chance of the campaigners securing compensation through moral suasion is extremely low. Indeed, it is about as likely as the former Rock chairman Matt Ridley, now Viscount Ridley, treating readers of his Times column to his 10th-anniversary thoughts on what went so spectacularly wrong in the boardroom. We’re still waiting for that important piece. ‘Drama’ on Threadneedle Street At last, drama at the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee … or rather the promise of it. The majority for doing nothing immediately on interest rates was a same-again at 7-2, but the seven would like to you know they’re jolly serious about changing their vote one of these days. They even put a date on the possible big moment – November, alongside the Bank’s next quarterly inflation report. The warning that rates could rise sooner than expected is plainly more forceful than previous limp hints. It would also be odd if the Bank wasn’t contemplating action. Inflation last month was 2.9% and has been above the 2% target since February. The jobless rate stands at a 42-year low, even if increases in wages have been feeble, and economic progress since August paints a slightly stronger picture than anticipated, say the minutes. What we don’t know, obviously, is what would qualify as a sufficient surprise to keep the Bank on pause. A fall in inflation to, say, 2.6%? A bad jobs report? Softer wage growth? All are possibilities. Both outcomes are plainly possible in November, but you can’t blame the doubters for concluding they’ll believe the rate rise when they see it. The Bank has conducted a long dance, and it’s a maestro at stretching things out. Next feels more confident Judge Simon Wolfson’s mood by his willingness to run share buybacks. Next’s chief executive turned them off in March because there was too much uncertainty in the air. Now he’s turning them on again. He’s feeling more confident, thus a modest 1% tickle to his profit forecast for the year provoked a 13% rise in the share price. Fair enough. Another reason for investors’ enthusiasm may be the fact Wolfson gives them useful information, in this case an analysis of the effect of the rise of internet shopping. Next’s stores would generate £1bn of cash over a decade even on the gloomy assumption that their like-for-like sales declined by 6% every year. That, in large part, is because of the flexibility offered by leases with relatively short durations. Such analyses should be compulsory for mature retailers. Could the supermarkets and Marks &amp; Spencer offer the same comfort? Even if they can’t, investors deserve to see the arithmetic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/14/fanfictions-writing-wrongs-who-would-you-trust-to-continue-a-favourite-book","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:06:45Z","webTitle":"Fanfiction's writing wrongs: who would you trust to continue a favourite book?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/14/fanfictions-writing-wrongs-who-would-you-trust-to-continue-a-favourite-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/14/fanfictions-writing-wrongs-who-would-you-trust-to-continue-a-favourite-book","fields":{"headline":"Fanfiction's writing wrongs: who would you trust to continue a favourite book?","bodyText":"I have to admit to a certain level of awe before the fandom of the author Lawrence Kelter for the film My Cousin Vinny. Kelter loves the 1992 film so much that – as highlighted by MobyLives on Thursday – he managed to convince its screenwriter, Dale Launer, to let him write a novel continuing the story of Vinny and Lisa (first played by Marisa Tomei and Joe Pesci). “I said, ‘How about I take a crack at Vinny and Lisa and move their life forward in a book series?’” Kelter told the New York Post. After convincing a reluctant Launer, he then had to convince the Writers Guild and 20th Century Fox to let him acquire rights in the characters, a process he described as “gruelling”. Kelter published book one of the My Cousin Vinny series earlier this year. The blurb explains: “Hot on the heels of rescuing his cousin Bill and Bill’s friend Stan from an Alabama electric chair, our wildly inappropriate hero Vincent Gambini heads home to Brooklyn, where he attempts to establish a successful law career … Meanwhile, Lisa aches to have a wedding band placed around her finger and her biological clock is still ticking away like mad.” My Cousin Vinny isn’t the story I’d long to see continued, but surely this is the dream of all fanfiction writers: to have their work recognised and given the stamp of approval by the person who originally dreamed the characters up? I wonder how many of these writers get such green lights? I’d say Kelter is in a tiny minority – and good for him. I’d imagine that Kelter, and other My Cousin Vinny fans, will respond this news much as I did when I learned that Robin Hobb would be revisiting the lives of Fitz and the Fool in her most recent trilogy. Yes, Hobb is the original author, but she’d finished these beloved characters’s stories in a pretty definitive way at the end of Fool’s Fate. And she has been very clear about her views on fanfiction: no. Discovering that she’d be returning to their lives more than 10 years on was pretty fantastic (and yes, the trilogy absolutely lived up to every hope I’d had for it). Are there other stories I’d like to see continued? Oh yes: I would return to the worlds of The Talisman and The Dark Tower in a heartbeat, but only under the aegis of Stephen King. I’d revisit His Dark Materials and the story of Lyra Belacqua – but only in the hands of Philip Pullman. (Hurrah, then, for La Belle Sauvage.) These are books and characters that have a place deep in my heart – and I don’t want them messed with by others. When it comes to characters whom I like, but don’t feel so protective of – such as Lisbeth Salander (David Lagercrantz continuing Stieg Larsson) and Philip Marlowe (Raymond Chandler’s latest ghost writer being Benjamin Black) – then I’m always up for a fresh sequel.

Calling for “a radical revolution of values”, King concluded: “We must rapidly begin … the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” There is a contemporary ring to King’s call. The giant triplets that he warned about are resurfacing, accompanied by a retreat into resentful nationalism. The gaps between the rich and everyone else are now wider than ever, and across much of the world the drive to achieve full employment with strong welfare provision was thrown into reverse gear decades ago, as governments reinvented themselves as “enablers” rather than “providers”. The resulting sense of collective anxiety has been compounded by a growing fear that robots and rentiers are taking precedence over the livelihoods of working people and their aspirations. By contrast, finance has been in euphoric mood. Its expansion from the early 1980s, resulting from market deregulation and enhanced by the reach of information technologies, spawned a myriad of new products to entice lenders and extended credit into every corner of economic and social life. But instead of channelling resources into the more creative and productive activities needed for long-term growth, it encouraged short-term, speculative behaviour by banks, businesses, and households. That behaviour produced a gathering financial storm that began a decade ago and eventually broke with devastating force on Lehman Brothers, sending investors into a panic, bringing hard times to the high street and spreading out across the global economy. In response to that crisis, governments pumped trillions of dollars into their financial sectors and closed down the most egregious loopholes and toxic products; but however good their intentions, the reality is that few who caused the crash have been held accountable for their actions, and little has been done to tackle its root causes. Unlike the textbook concept of pure competition, our hyperglobalised world has been accompanied by a considerable concentration of economic power and wealth in the hands of a remarkably small number of people. This need not necessarily constrain growth, but such growth tends to rest on fragile foundations, relying on rising levels of debt and speculative asset markets to keep it going. It also generates political tensions that clash with wider public and social interests. Indeed, since Adam Smith more clear-headed supporters of “the market”, have warned of the political dangers that can follow the concentration of economic wealth. It is therefore hardly surprising to find a popular backlash against a system that is perceived to have become unduly biased in favour of a handful of large corporations, financial institutions and wealthy individuals. The real threat now is to the underlying trust, cohesion and sense of fairness that markets depend upon in order to function effectively. Against this, insisting that “there is no alternative” is yesterday’s political slogan. People everywhere desire much the same thing: a decent job, a secure home, a safe environment, a better future for their children and a government that listens and responds to their concerns. They want a different deal from that offered by hyperglobalisation. Prosperity for all cannot be delivered by austerity-minded politicians, rent-seeking corporations and speculative bankers. What is urgently needed now is a global new deal. Three elements – recovery, regulation and redistribution – remain at the heart of any such deal. Ending austerity is a basic prerequisite of any new deal. It implies not only using fiscal policy to manage demand conditions, and making full employment a central policy goal – but also using monetary expansion to finance public investments that create inclusive and sustainable results. But if recovery is to be sustained, “organised money” will need to be challenged; regulatory oversight over restrictive business practices will need to be strengthened; legislative action will need to be taken in support of a living wage and against tax avoidance; and communities ravaged by health and security problems will need to be repaired. Many of the imbalances inhibiting sustainable and inclusive growth are global in nature, so “lifting all boats” requires greater international cooperation. The United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, codified in a series of goals, targets and indicators, points in that direction. What is still needed are ambitious policies and bold political leadership. Some elements of the strategies and solutions that helped rebuild the global economy after the second world war are once again receiving attention: a 21st century makeover of these strategies can attract a new generation more in tune to King’s call for a “radical revolution in values”, determined to build a better world. • Richard Kozul-Wright is director of the globalisation and development strategies division in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

It was good to see him in such fine form because, just over 20 years ago, when he was playing Mercutio for the RSC in Stratford, he had an encounter with the devil on the banks of the Avon.

Any moment, he may reach into a holster concealed in his jacket and … and what? Whip out the script of a lecture, ready to deliver edification to a bunch of grey-haired lit graduates? No, this graphic biography is not interested in that Nick Cave. It’s interested in the crazed outlaw who screams, “Hands up who wants to die!” and attacks the front row with a bloodspattered microphone stand. Cave endorses the book, noting that it’s woven together from “half-truths and complete fabrications” but applauding its vision. “Closer to the truth than any biography, that’s for sure!” A typical example of the liberties Kleist takes is the scene where Tracy Pew, the bassist of Cave’s early 1980s band the Birthday Party, first dons his signature cowboy hat. In truth, it was given to him by a friend to wear in a music video. In Kleist’s version, Pew steals it from a liquor store when he and Cave go on a spree of shoplifting and destruction. No opportunity is spared to emphasise what bad seeds these young punks were. The book veers between reality and phantasmagoria. When Cave as a lonely astronaut sends a paper plane love note down to his girlfriend on Earth, it’s corny but touching too. Then we’re back to a conventional historical account of the ambitious Australians forming their group, outgrowing the audience in Melbourne and relocating to London where they find that promoters are dismissive and punk is passé. In these scenes, the dialogue can be leadenly expository. “I didn’t come to England for this,” laments guitarist Rowland Howard. “I thought it would be different!” Yet such spoonfeeding is preferable to Kleist’s attempts to tease out the deeper significance of Cave’s career decisions. “There’s that fear of standing still, the unbridled compulsion to travel new paths,” he glosses when Cave is about to break up the Birthday Party and form the Bad Seeds. “To tear the old into pieces. To kill that which clings. And plant the seeds of something new in its ashes.” As with I See a Darkness, Kleist’s graphic biography of Johnny Cash, there’s a dogged focus on the big themes of destiny, self-destruction and the redemptive power of song. Cave’s real-life trajectory has been towards sobriety, meditation and domesticity, but Kleist gets round this by adding a narrative frame in which the characters from Cave’s past works – the lynched Euchrid Eucrow from the novel And the Ass Saw the Angel, the murdered Elisa Day from his duet with Kylie Minogue “Where the Wild Roses Grow”, et al – come back to berate him for his maltreatment of them. “I’m merely your wayward likeness, and then you punish me for it by killing me as it pleases you!” declares the electrocuted prisoner from “The Mercy Seat”. While high-flown archaism has long been one of Cave’s fortes, something has clearly gone awry here in the shifts from his rhetoric to Kleist’s German imitation of it to Michael Waaler’s translation of Kleist back into English. The real strength of Mercy on Me is the artwork. In his Johnny Cash book, Kleist was often tempted to remould Cash’s burly physique into a more spidery shape. Cave genuinely is that spider and Kleist relishes every gangly pose. Moreover, he’s enthralled by Cave’s face and captures its expressions with panache. Among many highlights are a full-page portrait of the teenage Nick sullenly determined to escape bourgeois conformity, and a superb evocation of the shock-haired exile typing his gothic novel in a Berlin garret just big enough to accommodate his wasted body, piles of papers, some booze and a gun. Kleist does equal justice to the older Cave – thin-haired, wrinkle-browed and strangely dignified. Indeed, Kleist pours so much love into his hero that there seems little left for the other players. Rowland Howard was God’s gift to caricaturists but is oddly bland here, as is Cave’s longtime paramour Anita Lane. Lydia Lunch and PJ Harvey are unrecognisable. As in I See a Darkness, spectacular natural phenomena – storms, rain torrents – symbolise Road-to-Damascus epiphanies and mental crises. The orgy of drug abuse and sleepless obsession that went into the composition of And the Ass Saw the Angel is reimagined as Cave drowning in a whirlpool, ink injected into his veins, while Anita rows towards him in a canoe, vainly trying to pull him aboard. Aside from the nodding plastic dog on the dashboard of a stolen car, pirate Nick whittling his wooden leg, and a dancing rehab nurse, the book is not generously endowed with humour. Which is a pity, because Cave is such a funny writer and his wit has always been the crucial foil to his own myth-mongering. Mercy on Me offers plentiful visual delights and will no doubt be an essential purchase for ardent fans, but the less committed may find 328 pages of angst-ridden Bad Boy a stretch.

Bodegas’ resident cats are symbolic of the personable, one-to-one service and relaxed environment that people appreciate about their local corner store – the kind of service and ambiance it’s hard to replicate in a pantry for non-perishables. The Bodega entrepreneurs’ choice of logo, a cat’s face, was perceived to be just as inappropriate as their chosen name. In a Medium post published after the backlash on Wednesday, Paul McDonald, the cofounder and CEO of Bodega, clarified that their aim was not to put brick-and-mortar stores out of business – but did admit they “didn’t fully understand what the reaction to the name would be”. “When we first came up with the idea to call the company Bodega we recognised that there was a risk of it being interpreted as misappropriation. But it’s clear that we may not have been asking the right questions of the right people. “Despite our best intentions and our admiration for traditional bodegas, we clearly hit a nerve this morning, we apologise. Rather than disrespect to traditional corner stores – or worse yet, a threat – we intended only admiration.” Bodega cats being symbolic of community, it is fitting that one has formed around them. Rob Hitt, a web developer and record label owner based in Brooklyn, has been collating snapshots of them @bodegacatsofinstagram. The account is followed by more than 110,000 users, with people submitting shots taken at their local convenience stores the world over. Hitt started the account after getting a positive reaction to a few photos he’d posted on his personal Instagram. “The corner store always felt like a little piece of home to me,” he says. “It’s where you could go to say hi to a familiar face, hear the neighbourhood gossip, or run into the neighbour cat.” Many critics of the Bodega startup had pointed to Hitt’s account as evidence of what they held dear about their local corner store. There is “something intrinsically personal” about the exchange, he says. “When we walk into our corner store we don’t just go to a store, we go to our corner store. It’s personal – you know the person working, they know your neighbourhood, in essence, it’s a part of you. “The cat may belong to the store but when you walk in you feel it’s partly yours too.” Socks, the resident cat at Fairfield Food Market in Cleveland, Ohio, was recently featured on Hitt’s account. Her photograph was submitted by Parker Warren, who had stopped into the store on Fairfield Ave about a month ago. “She came right around the corner and started purring and rubbing against my shins.” Warren says Socks is very friendly and well known in the neighbourhood for her many toes, caused by a genetic mutation called polydactylism. “She is a real crowd pleaser – the Pamela Anderson of cats. She knows what she has and flaunts it,” he says. “I stop in for La Croix cans but mostly just to see her.” People connect these cats with not just their local stores, but their entire neighbourhoods, says Hitt. When Takela the kitten was stolen from Kensington’s Moon Mini Mart last week, many New Yorkers felt rage “as if it were our own being stolen”. “These little felines represent your community in addition to just the cute photo we see,” he says. “I think that’s the point that really gets to us when we see an organisation imply they’d want to drive a bodega out of business.” Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.

Thousands of Juggalos – the name given to fans of Insane Clown Posse – are expected to descend on the capital as they attempt to change the FBI’s designation of Juggalos as a “gang”, which they say has led to discrimination from police and employers. The Juggalos have been planning their “Juggalo march” for more than a year, but its impact could be diminished after Trump supporters planned their own event on the same day, dubbed “the mother of all rallies”. Organizers of both events claim thousands of people will attend on what is shaping up to be a busy day in DC. The Juggalos will gather at the Lincoln Memorial at 1pm, while the Trump supporters will be stationed a mile to the east. A Race to Beat Cancer 5km run is also due to take place on Saturday, and a couple – unaffiliated with either the Juggalos or the Trump crowd – will be getting married in the midst of it all. Insane Clown Posse fans from around the country are traveling to the capital, with many planning to wear the distinctive face paint worn by the band’s two members, Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. The protest stems from the FBI’s 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment, which referred to Juggalos – the name comes from the Insane Clown Posse song The Juggla – as a “loosely-organized hybrid gang”. “Many Juggalos subsets exhibit gang-like behavior and engage in criminal activity and violence. Law enforcement officials in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets, according to [National Gang Intelligence Center] reporting,” the assessment said. Insane Clown Posse say that designation has had negative consequences for Juggalos and other fans of the band. At the march, some Juggalos will share personal testimony of how they have been profiled by police or otherwise suffered because of their allegiance. “It’s about civil rights and what has been going on for the last seven years,” Jason Webber, director of public relations at Insane Clown Posse’s record label, Psychopathic Records, told the Guardian in July. Webber said various people who commit crimes could often be said to be fans of certain musicians. “It’s not really fair that Juggalos are considered a loosely organized hybrid gang and Lady Gaga’s Little Monsters are just considered harmless kids,” he said. A number of Juggalos, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan and Insane Clown Posse themselves, have attempted to overturn that description in the courts, but have twice had cases thrown out. An appeal is currently pending. The pro-Trump “mother of all rallies” was planned months after the Juggalo March, and the Juggalos have been keen to distance themselves from the pro-Trump crowd. “It’s apolitical,” said Jason Webber, director of public relations at Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse’s label and a march organizer. “We’re not doing this to espouse any sort of political event.” The people behind the mother of all rallies, meanwhile, are attempting to distance themselves from the white-supremacist Unite the Right demonstration that sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. That event – nominally organized to prevent the removal of a Robert E Lee statue – led to the death of Heather Heyer, who was hit by a car allegedly driven by a white nationalist, James Fields. Organizers of Saturday’s rally, which will be held near the Washington Monument, insist that it is simply an event to support the president, rather than a far-right gathering. Tommy Gunn, who is involved in planning the rally, said people with Confederate flags or Nazi or KKK memorabilia would not be allowed into the fenced-off space. “We only need one flag that unifies us all, and that’s the red, white and blue,” he said. Gunn, who declined to give his real last name but asked to be referred to as an “online personality”, said attendees would be people who “support American values, the constitution, the America first agenda for Americans”. He said: “We actually picked the date because it’s the weekend following the 9/11 memorial, and the weekend following the 9/11 attacks we were more unified than we’ve ever been. “It’s really just a day of celebrating our traditional culture, and not early 1900s culture, just American culture and agenda – the idea behind it.” Sign up for weekly news updates about the protests and activism in the US"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/15/uks-largest-disco-soup-attracts-1000-people-to-london-market","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T16:50:16Z","webTitle":"UK's largest 'disco soup' attracts 1,000 people to London market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/15/uks-largest-disco-soup-attracts-1000-people-to-london-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/15/uks-largest-disco-soup-attracts-1000-people-to-london-market","fields":{"headline":"UK's largest 'disco soup' attracts 1,000 people to London market","bodyText":"Visitors to a community food market and bar in south London on Friday were presented with an unusual combination of pleasures: a soup disco. Volunteers and customers at Mercato Metropolitano in Elephant and Castle gathered to chop vegetables and tear basil leaves while professional chefs directed them and DJs from the nightclub Ministry of Sound spun records in the background. The event was part of a new global movement called “disco soup”, which aims to inspire action against food waste. Each disco soup event sees hundreds of kilos of unused vegetables taken from markets, bakeries, farms and restaurants to be recycled. The produce is then turned into a huge soup free of charge for all of the attending customers at a disco, with any surplus soup going to charities. More than 1,000 people were expected to take part in Friday’s event in London, organised by Feedback and thought to be the UK’s largest ever disco soup, as the events are named. It took about 100 volunteers more than a month to put everything together. Cooking was overseen by British chef Samuel Hodges and was scheduled to go on until 11pm. The market was spread into a number of areas, including “feast preparation and chopping”, a crafts centre and a “feast kitchen”. The vegetables were boiled in a number of soup pans, each up to 250 litres, and stirred with a giant wooden spoon. The disco soup concept started five years ago in Berlin as a “protest soup” against food waste, and fed 8,000 people. It has since become an international phenomenon. Andrea Rasca, the founder of Mercato, said: “Disco soup is a global movement that celebrates delicious solutions to food waste. It’s fun with a serious message. “We will be collecting surplus food from companies and farms both in London and within surrounding counties which would otherwise be wasted, and creating a delicious meal which is free for all, to demonstrate that surplus food can be turned into something wonderful. “It’s fortunate that our next-door neighbours happen to be Ministry of Sound, and when we told them about the concept, they were delighted to offer their DJs to come and spin some tunes, so everyone can bop while they chop.” About a third of food produced every year – equal to approximately 1.3bn tonnes – is never eaten because it is spoiled after harvest and during transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers. Saving 25% of it would be enough to feed the more than 800 million people who go to bed hungry every night, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Campaigners say reducing food waste would also help to fight climate change as discarded food ends up in landfill where it rots, releasing harmful greenhouse gases, while the water, energy and fuel needed to grow, store and transport it is wasted. Pascale Robinson, the event coordinator at Feedback, said: “The ethos of disco soup is that through chopping, cooking together, you can show how important and easy it is to tackle food waste. Tristram Stuart, the founder of Feedback, once said that in order to save the planet you have to throw a better party than the people who are ruining it. “So the aim of today is to show all of the creative ways that we can tackle food waste. That’s through a delicious shared meal but also through workshops, drop-in sessions, a panel discussion, a kids parade, a pop quiz, and having a dance at the end as well.” Hodges said the event was about sustainability and familiarising people with the materials. Hodges runs a research project and restaurant called The Brick Kitchen, where a group of independent chefs work together to circulate knowledge about food through the public. “If people are more engaged it makes the food more real, it attaches the mind to it. “If I told you the nettles in your garden were anti-inflammatories and a lot of disorders are considered inflammations and your nettles would help, you would suddenly place value on them. I had no love for nettles two years ago and now one of my kitchens makes nettle broth. The whole idea is about inspiring people.” Sarah Hicks, 25, was one of the volunteers at the event. She said: “Recently I’ve been reading a lot of books about the environment and I’ve become vegan because of all the research I’ve been doing. I thought I have to get involved in food waste. I hope today will spread the word, and I wanted to learn as well. I didn’t know you could go to farms and pick food that would go to waste, for example. It’s becoming cool now, all my friends are keen to do this sort of thing.” John and Linda Corbett, 64 and 62 respectively, were walking past on Friday afternoon when they happened upon the disco soup event. “I think it’s very worthwhile, there’s a lot of food wasted and this just highlights that,” said John. “They wouldn’t do anything with this food, there’s people on the streets, in shelters, who could use it,” Linda added. “Why does it have to be thrown away when there’s nothing wrong with it? When we were kids, our parents took us to markets where they bought waste like broken biscuits from companies and sold them. You don’t get that any more.” In April of this year, tens of thousands of people across five continents feasted on food saved from the bin at a number of parties as part of World Disco Soup Day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/01/chinese-firm-behind-essex-nuclear-plant-refuses-to-reveal-security-information","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T17:17:28Z","webTitle":"Chinese firm behind Essex nuclear plant refuses to reveal security information","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/01/chinese-firm-behind-essex-nuclear-plant-refuses-to-reveal-security-information","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/01/chinese-firm-behind-essex-nuclear-plant-refuses-to-reveal-security-information","fields":{"headline":"Chinese firm behind Essex nuclear plant refuses to reveal security information","bodyText":"The Chinese state-owned company planning a nuclear power station in Essex refused to share the security arrangements for a Chinese nuclear plant with the British authorities, it has been revealed. Inspectors from the UK nuclear regulator visited the China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) in Shenzhen earlier this year, as part of the four-year approval process for the reactor the company wants to build at Bradwell. A green light from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) would be a huge boost for China’s aspirations for exporting nuclear technology and Bradwell would be the first Chinese reactor to be built in a developed country. Overall the ONR welcomed the “high level of expertise and commitment” shown by the Chinese, according to a report of the visit on 13-16 March, released to the Guardian under freedom of information rules. However, CGN said it could not share material about security measures to protect its nuclear plant in Fangchenggang, China, which Bradwell could be modelled on. “With regard to the sharing of information, such as the security plans for FCG [Fangchenggang] Unit 3, CGN stated that these were protected documents under Chinese regulations,” the UK authorities wrote, in a glimpse of UK nuclear regulation rubbing up against Chinese state secrecy. But the ONR insisted that it was commonplace for foreign nuclear companies not to share sensitive documents around national security during the UK nuclear approval process, known as the Generic Design Assessment (GDA). It added that it was the arrangements for Bradwell that were relevant, not Fangchenggang. A spokeswoman said: “It is routine for site security plans to be protected, and is not unexpected. It will in no way restrict our assessment of the UK HPR1000[the Chinese reactor design].” During the visit, the regulator told the Chinese that the UK’s formal assessment of the reactor would be a “long journey” and would require China to be forthcoming with a “sufficient description of the design” so nuclear safety claims could be checked. The UK said it could only maintain its staffing levels for the approval process if the Chinese did not delay providing the necessary information. There is no suggestion the UK nuclear regulator would approve the Chinese reactor without receiving the documentation it required. In a statement, the ONR said: “The purpose of the GDA process is to ensure that the design meets the robust safety and security standards required in the UK, and our regulatory focus is on the arrangements and design of the UK HPR1000, planned for Bradwell.” Antony Froggatt, a nuclear expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “The ONR clearly highlight to the Chinese partners that there are resource adequacy implications and risks, and I would be more blunt and say their ability to adequately do their job, if not being provided with sufficient material.” GCN said the company was committed to working with the ONR in a transparent way, including sharing all information needed. “This is no difference to the approach taken for any other would-be operator, whether it be American, Japanese, Chinese or British. As you would expect, all nuclear companies around the world protect sensitive information concerning the security of their own national nuclear sites, and regulators understand and support such essential precautions,” said Robert Davies, CGN UK’s chief operating officer. CGN put up a third of £18bn cost towards EDF’s project to build French-designed reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, in return for developing its own plant at Bradwell in Essex. The Bradwell B project is two thirds owned by CGN and one third EDF. The government paused approval for Hinkley for several months last year, because of concerns over China’s stake. CGN is becoming an increasing central player in Britain’s atomic plans, having recently confirmed it is considering buying Toshiba’s troubled NuGen project to build a nuclear power station in Cumbria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/15/fatbergs-flag-waving-and-a-fancy-probiotic","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T16:33:17Z","webTitle":"Fatbergs, flag-waving and a fancy probiotic | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/15/fatbergs-flag-waving-and-a-fancy-probiotic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/15/fatbergs-flag-waving-and-a-fancy-probiotic","fields":{"headline":"Fatbergs, flag-waving and a fancy probiotic","bodyText":"I watched police vehicles rushing to Parsons Green underground station to try to protect us from people intent on pursuing their interests with bombs.

Dubbed the Wolf of Walthamstow, the schoolboy had 11 employees working across three schools before his operation was shut down. It’s entrepreneurial spirit we don’t expect to see in children. But it’s not as rare as you might think. I’m fronting a campaign by cloud accounting software company Xero that has found while children as young as seven receive an average of £570 a year from pocket money and gifts, nearly half of them go on to earn more from side businesses. From selling old toys on eBay to cleaning their neighbour’s cars, it’s a remarkable start for the third of British kids (32%) who say they would like to be a business owner themselves when they grow up. When child entrepreneurs came into the Den it was always a big moment. Last year 15-year-old Arminder Singh Dhillon came in with his mum to pitch Boot Buddy, his own invention that cleans muddy boots and shoes. He walked away with £60,000 from Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and Touker Suleyman – the youngest ever entrepreneur to receive investment in the Den. But while kids are clearly savvy when it comes to earning money, it seems they aren’t so shrewd when it comes to saving their earnings. The Xero research found that half of parents (49%) admit their children understand the idea of saving, but rarely do it. With poor cashflow management cited as the reason why two thirds of small businesses (65%) fail in the first five years of trading, and 27% of small business owners admitting (pdf) they don’t keep proper track of the time and materials spent on a client’s assignment, it’s more important than ever to instill budgeting and cashflow sense in our entrepreneurs of the future. I think it’s vital to teach children an understanding of good money management as soon as they start handling it themselves. Every school should teach enterprise – it is so relevant to every aspect of life. Sadly, in UK, many teachers don’t have the time, support or knowledge to discuss money management with the kids. Something else always takes priority. But it is vital to teach these skills to our children. As this research shows, our relationship with money is set as early as seven years old. Starting a business has certainly become a more acceptable career choice than it used to be, but we need to teach our children how to realise this burning ambition. It’s good to get started young – when I was 11, I delivered 181 papers for £1.81 (1p per paper) and was earning £1 an hour in a local cafe at 13. While I quickly learned there were better ways to make money, that work ethic has never left me. I have no idea whether my children will choose to become entrepreneurs – they certainly talk about it – but my job is to equip them with as many tools as possible to make the right decisions when the time comes. Shouldn’t all of our children have that chance?

Schumer continued: “Here’s what I told him: I said, ‘Mr President, you’re much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction, you’re boxed.’ He gets that.” The snatch of conversation came after a White House dinner of honey sesame crispy beef and chocolate cream pie to which McConnell was pointedly not invited. Instead Schumer, along with House counterpart Nancy Pelosi, enjoyed red and white wine, while the teetotal president sipped Coke.

There was also a furious backlash from some in the Trump base, including a photo of a “Make America great again” hat going up in flames on the rightwing website Breitbart. But the unorthodox manoeuvre also raised questions over how far Democrats should go to court him without alienating their own grassroots. What remained unclear was Trump’s strategy – if he has one. His motives for “step right, step left” appear various. He has fallen out with the leaders of his own party, McConnell and House speaker Paul Ryan, especially after their failure to to pass healthcare legislation. He instinctively gravitates towards Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, and towards pragmatic deal-making rather than ideology. Not least of all, he is basking in positive media coverage after months of being hammered. Last week, after working with Schumer and Pelosi on a three-month extension for the national debt ceiling, he called Schumer, who recounted to the New York Times: “He said, ‘This was so great!’ Here’s what he said: ‘Do you watch Fox News?’ I said, ‘Not really.’ ‘They’re praising you!’ Meaning me. But he said, ‘And your stations’ – I guess meaning MSNBC and CNN – ‘are praising me! This is great!’” Trump’s addiction to the cable TV news channels seems intact, but he is spending less time in the rightwing fever swamps of the internet, according to the website Axios. John Kelly, the chief of staff, has reportedly restricted the number of articles that staff print out from sites such as Breitbart and bring to his attention. “The dramatically different information Trump receives daily under chief of staff John Kelly is an under-looked factor in Trump’s decision to double down on his partnership with the Democratic leaders,” Axios said. This, along with the replacement of press secretary Sean Spicer by the less gaffe-prone Sarah Sanders, and the ousting of bomb-throwers Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, have given some hope that the administration is finally professionalising and steering towards a middle course. But even as political pundits pondered the dawn of a new era and talked of a “pivot” or “bipartisan” president, Trump’s reliably twitchy thumbs signalled there was no meaningful shift in behavior on the horizon. In a characteristic early morning tweet-storm, Trump suggested on Friday that the perpetrators behind the Parsons Green terrorist attack were already “in the sights” of Scotland Yard – prompting a rare rebuke from British prime minister Theresa May. Trump also seized on the moment to reaffirm the need for his travel ban against certain Muslim-majority countries, arguing it should be “far larger, tougher and more specific”, while adding: “but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!” His tone was equally inconsistent while touring parts of Florida on Thursday left devastated by Hurricane Irma. In one moment, he was Trump the deal-maker, relishing in several opportunities to speak to reporters about his negations with Democrats. But at another turn, when asked about a meeting he held with Tim Scott, the Senate’s only black Republican, Trump once again declared that “both sides” were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. While Schumer and Pelosi spent the immediate moments following their dinner with Trump crafting a statement about a potential deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), the president was by contrast more preoccupied with tweeting about “Crooked Hillary Clinton”. He also made a series of comments and tweets that sowed confusion over what had been agreed. The shifting sands leave mainstream Republicans, hardline Trump supporters and Democrats all scrambling to find their footing. McConnell and Ryan have tried to be circumspect despite what might be seen as public humiliation. The House speaker said pointedly: “I think the president understands that he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution.” Congressman Pete Sessions, a Republican from Texas and the chair of the rules committee, told reporters: “Typically a president of our party would work with our party on a proposal that we would be supportive of and so we’re learning now how he wants to operate. As the country adapts itself to Mr Trump’s leadership we’re learning more about what that leadership means.” Other conservatives were more outspoken. Straight after Wednesday’s dinner, Iowa congressman Steve King tweeted: “Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.” The conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeted: “At this point, who DOESN’T want Trump impeached?” And Breitbart, run by Trump’s former chief strategist Bannon, ran the headline “Amnesty Don”. But the base is no monolith. Fox News and conservative broadcaster Rush Limbaugh praised Trump for his negotiating nous. The crowds who pour into his raucous rallies are unlikely to lose faith over horse trading on Capitol Hill, especially with their hostility towards Republican elites. For Democrats, too, the moment of opportunity is fraught with risks. Trump is seen by many of their supporters as a demagogue, misogynist and white nationalist to be resisted at all costs. He is also notoriously opportunistic, improvisational and mercurial, prone to change like the wind in response to a headline or slight. Some on the left warn that anyone who gets too close to him is likely to be burned. Norman Solomon, a Bernie Sanders delegate from California to last year’s Democratic national convention, said: “It’s extremely likely that Trump will sucker-punch ‘Chuck and Nancy’ – and it would be surprising if that doesn’t happen fairly soon. Trump is holding on tight to so many odious policies that it’s tempting to rejoice when he decides to loosen his grip on one or another, once in a while. But the problem is not only that Trump is an expert at praising people and then shafting them.” Solomon, coordinator of the online activist group RootsAction.org, added: “What’s also a huge danger in the current bipartisan foreplay is what could be called ‘the optics’ of Democratic leadership making nice with a symbolic and actual representative of massive greed and oligarchy. If Democrats want to oppose Trump as the heartless corporate monster that he is, then making nice with him in photo ops and boasting that he likes them is not good groundwork for winning working-class votes in the next few years.” Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill are aware of the limitations posed by working hand-in-hand with Trump. One Senate Democratic aide, who did not wish to be named, said the goal was to address a set of issues requiring immediate attention – namely the fate of Daca recipients and legislation to stabilize the health insurance markets. With a new deadline of mid-December to fund the government and raise the debt limit, the aide said, Democrats have a limited window to use leverage under Republican control. Trump’s erratic behavior, the aide cautioned, “makes the price of our cooperation very, very very high”, adding: “I think that you have to weigh what you’re able to achieve. “It’ll be pretty apparent that he’s not a normal president. But if he’s willing to give you 100% of what you’re asking for, you take it, and then you continue to go after him where he’s wrong.” Trump’s fluid loyalties have provided fresh fodder to comedians. Columnist Andy Borowitz wrote in the New Yorker: “In his most stunning deal yet with Democratic leaders, Donald Trump agreed on Friday to be impeached by the end of 2017... ‘Chuck and Nancy and I got a deal done on impeachment,’ Trump said. ‘It was a good deal and it was a fast deal.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/15/uk-exporters-have-hoarded-gains-from-fall-in-sterling-says-ons","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T17:59:34Z","webTitle":"UK exporters have 'hoarded' gains from fall in sterling, says ONS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/uk-exporters-have-hoarded-gains-from-fall-in-sterling-says-ons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/15/uk-exporters-have-hoarded-gains-from-fall-in-sterling-says-ons","fields":{"headline":"UK exporters have 'hoarded' gains from fall in sterling, says ONS","bodyText":"Britain’s manufacturing exporters have “hoarded” the gains from last year’s fall in sterling by putting up prices rather than increasing output and sales. The Office for National Statistics said exporters could have allowed their prices to decline in line with the fall in the pound, making their products more attractive to foreign buyers, but chose to boost their profits instead. Illustrating the uncertainty following the Brexit vote, which has made exporters nervous about expanding production, analysis by the ONS shows that UK companies increased export prices by 12.7% year on year in the months after the referendum in response to a 16.9% fall in the exchange rate. The figures will disappoint Brexit campaigners who have urged exporters to make the most of the fall in sterling by expanding production and increasing employment. The ONS said export volumes improved last year, despite exporters’ price increases, due to the improving global trade situation. But the rise in exports was matched by an increase in imports, offsetting the benefits of higher prices. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Exporters have responded to the pound’s depreciation by raising their sterling prices, with the result that their profits have surged but their goods haven’t become much more competitive. “Although export volumes have increased, so too have imports; both have been boosted by a rebound in world trade, rather than sterling’s plunge. “What’s more, exporters have hoarded cash – understandably, given Brexit uncertainty – rather than reinvested their bumper profits or dispensed it to shareholders. As a result, sterling’s depreciation has hit consumers hard but it has done little to help the economy rebalance.” Large businesses were quick to increase prices in response to the fall in sterling, with small and medium-sized businesses following the same policy. ONS analysts said it was difficult to estimate the impact of higher import prices on profits without a more detailed study of the cost of raw materials used to manufacture goods. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, landed himself in hot water after he accused firms of being too “fat and lazy” to expand exports beyond Europe and their existing customers. After the Brexit vote, he said it was the duty of exporters to use the currency’s revaluation to expand output. “What is the point of us reshaping global trade, what is the point of us going out and looking for new markets for the United Kingdom, if we don’t have the exporters to fill those markets?” This year the prime minister, Theresa May, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and several senior cabinet members have joined a succession of trade missions. May recently visited Japan to prepare the ground for a free trade deal with the world’s third largest economy. Hammond’s most recent trade mission was to India, where he talked to businesses about expanding links across the Indian subcontinent. Fox’s deputy, Mark Garnier, said last year: “The government has put trade at the heart of its agenda with the creation of the Department for International Trade and we are working hard to help UK companies take advantage of the global demand for British goods and services.” It will also be seen as a missed opportunity after a rise in sterling over recent months in response to speculation that UK interest rates will increase before the end of the year. A speech by one of the Bank of England’s longstanding advocates of low interest rates indicating that a hike is imminent sent the pound to fresh highs for the year. Gertjan Vlieghe, in comments that largely echoed the Bank’s message a day earlier, suggested it could raise rates as soon as its next meeting on 2 November. Britain continues to suffer from a large trade deficit in manufactured goods despite the fall in the pound and rise in exports, largely as a result of the rise in imports. The most recent trade figures show that UK exporters have struggled to win contracts in new markets beyond the European Union’s border. Official figures for July showed the UK’s deficit in the trade in goods with non-EU countries widened by £2.4bn while exports to the EU grew to cut the trade gap by £1.3bn. In the three months to July, compared to the previous quarter, the total trade in goods deficit increased by £1.1bn to £34.4bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/sep/18/10-best-new-art-exhibitions-europe-autumn-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T05:30:01Z","webTitle":"10 of the best new art exhibitions in Europe for autumn 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/sep/18/10-best-new-art-exhibitions-europe-autumn-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/sep/18/10-best-new-art-exhibitions-europe-autumn-2017","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best new art exhibitions in Europe for autumn 2017","bodyText":"William Kentridge: Thick Time – Installations and Stagings, Salzburg Get immersed in the imaginative work of South African artist William Kentridge at Salzburg’s Museum der Moderne.

There are parkour-style action sequences in crowded streets, snipers whose gun barrels emerge from billboard hoardings, cheesy emotional freeze-frames on expressive faces, a jazzy-melancholy sax theme, a scene in the subway which involves actually running on the tracks ahead of the train, and an old-fashioned jet-ski chase down a city river. The film is based on the Japanese pulp novel Hot Pursuit by Juko Nishimura, and particularly its cult 1976 movie adaptation starring the much-admired Ken Takakura (who played a yakuza in Ridley Scott’s Black Rain, among many other credits), who died in 2014 and to whose memory John Woo has offered this remake in homage. The original was about a cop who goes on the run after being fitted up on a corruption charge; Woo now makes him a maverick lawyer and also makes him Chinese – perhaps in tribute to the original movie’s colossal popularity in China. It is set in Osaka, where Du Qiu, played by Hanyu Zhang, is a Chinese-born lawyer who has just quit his job as a top-ranking consigliere to hatchet-faced big pharma boss Sakai (played by another Japanese icon, Jun Kunimura) and his creepy, deadbeat son Hiroshi (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi). Sakai suspects this man knows rather too much about the firm’s shady dealings and needs to have him taken out. He already employs two contract killers, both addicted to the company’s PCP-style product: Dawn (Angeles Woo, daughter of John) and Rain (Ha Ji-won), who uncork a ferocious slaying at the top of the movie. Rain meets and slightly falls for Du Qui as they banter knowingly about old films. Du Qui is framed for murder when he wakes from a drugged sleep to find a dead woman in bed next to him. He goes on the run, and two officers are on his trail: Yamura, played by Masaharu Fukuyama (also to be seen here in Toronto in The Third Murder) and his wide-eyed partner, Rika, nicely played by Nanami Sakuraba. But there is someone else taking an interest in Du Qiu – a mysteriously flirtatious woman (Stephy Qi) who is the widow of a scientist employed by the corporation, a man driven to anguish by the hideous properties of the top-secret drug he was forced to develop. It is this woman’s backstory that offers the most uproarious and surreal moments. Her late husband’s death coincided, in the most macabre way, with their wedding and, like an action-movie Miss Havisham, she now keeps her bloodstained white gown in a shrine-like room. Manhunt zooms and crashes along like a stick-shift car, with Woo at the wheel careening between action set pieces, broad comedy, champagne-swilling party scenes, flashbacks and swoony emotional moments. Of course it is a little absurd, and audiences are entitled to ask how Du Qui has not been implicated in Sakai’s drug conspiracy, especially as the bad guy clearly thinks that his lawyer knows enough to require taking out. But this film offers something that is never in sufficiently plentiful supply: fun. Manhunt was showing at the Toronto film festival with UK and US releases dates yet to be announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2017/sep/17/war-of-words-two-battle-rap-films-go-head-to-head","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T13:00:41Z","webTitle":"War of words: two battle-rap films go head-to-head","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/sep/17/war-of-words-two-battle-rap-films-go-head-to-head","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2017/sep/17/war-of-words-two-battle-rap-films-go-head-to-head","fields":{"headline":"War of words: two battle-rap films go head-to-head","bodyText":"Back in the 1990s, there was a major pop culture war in which it was impossible to not take sides, and the side you took revealed what kind of person you were. What? – Blur v Oasis? Friends v Frasier? Get out of town. We’re talking, of course, about the 1998 asteroid-disaster-movie war, in which you were either lovely emosh Deep Impact (yay!) or loud explodey Armageddon (boo!). Nineteen years later, and we’re all going to get the chance to relive those thrilling times as the world readies itself for not one, but two battle-rap films in quick succession. The filmic dust-up is also a transatlantic affair. In the red corner, there is Bodied, produced by Eminem, written by Canadian battle MC Kid Twist and directed by pop-promo veteran Joseph Khan. And in the blue, the BBC-backed VS, which stars the UK’s most successful rap battler, Deadmau5-collaborator Shotty Horroh, and boasts Brit battle bigwig Rowan “Eurgh” Faife as its chief consultant. Rap battle, for the uninitiated, is an artform in which two or more opponents insult each other, in rhyme and almost always a capella, and at the moment it is insanely popular, both in English-speaking countries and, oddly, in the Philippines, where the top battlers routinely rack up tens of millions of YouTube views. Lyrically, no angles of attack are off limits – battles may frequently be offensive but they are egalitarian as well. Bodied has already harvested rave reviews after it debuted at the Toronto international film festival, but is still awaiting distribution in the UK. Its story, about a middle-class student (Calum Worthy) discovering an unexpected talent for battling, has been hailed for its subversive streak, as it makes points about race relations, cultural appropriation and, above all, white privilege, while featuring a who’s who of US and Canadian battlers. VS, meanwhile, seems on first glance to be a rather more straightforward tale: newcomer Connor Swindells plays an angst-stricken teenager who battles his demons by becoming a battling demon. Interestingly, the films have arrived while the UK battle scene is in something of a tailspin, with Faife’s market-dominating Don’t Flop league disintegrating in a cloud of recriminations, allegations of staff non-payment and general social-media four-letter abuse. While it may seem uniquely British that an organisation founded on horrific insults should end because staff fell out with each other, it does at least pave the way for a new generation of battlers inspired by Bodied and VS, ensuring that mothers everywhere need not fear they will miss out on a comprehensive dissing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2017/sep/17/for-the-record-this-weeks-corrections","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"For the record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/17/for-the-record-this-weeks-corrections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/sep/17/for-the-record-this-weeks-corrections","fields":{"headline":"For the record","bodyText":"A panel accompanying our profile of Aung San Suu Kyi said she was born in Myanmar on 19 June 1945, which, we claimed, was “just weeks after the end of the Second World War”.

Campaign groups say they will be left unable to speak out for vulnerable and marginalised people in society because the law has a chilling effect on freedom of speech. The Lobbying Act restricts what non-governmental organisations can say in the year before a general election. As a result of an outcry from the charities sector, the government commissioned a review of the recommended amendments. Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts called for the scope of the act to be reduced to include only activity intended to influence how the public vote. The Conservative peer also called for the period during which its rules apply to be reduced from a year. But the Cabinet Office has said in a statement it would make no changes to the law. In a statement the Cabinet Office said: “The rules on third-party campaigning in elections ensures that activity is transparent and prevents any individual, company, or organisation exerting undue influence in terms of an election outcome. “We recognise and value the role that charities play in our society and are keen to work with voluntary bodies to ensure the rules are well understood.” Charities and NGOs said this amounted to a blanket rejection of recommendations made by by Hodgson’s review. The Cabinet Office decision comes a few weeks after more than 100 charities sent a letter to the civil societiy minister Tracey Crouch to put pressure on ministers to overhaul the act. The charities and campaign groups who signed the letter represented a wide range of domestic and global issues including health, social care, global poverty, human rights, environment, and vulnerable groups. They included Greenpeace, Girlguiding, Deafblind UK and Action for Children. Greenpeace was the first NGO to be fined under the Lobbying Act. Tamsyn Barton, chief executive of Bond, the UK network of organisations working in international development, said: “How are charities supposed to speak up for the most vulnerable and marginalised people in society, both here and globally, when they are at risk of being penalised by the Lobbying Act? The government is legislating the sector into silence at a time when our voices are needed the most. This is a terrible day for British democracy.” The Conservative government led by David Cameron passed the act as a result of high-profile corporate lobbying scandals. It amended existing rules on non-party organisations introduced in 2000, requiring groups to register with the electoral commission if they plan to spend more than £20,000 in England or £10,000 in the rest of the UK on so-called “regulated activities”. Critics say the government’s definition of these activities is so broad it can include any activity that could be interpreted as political. Vicky Browning, chief executive of the charity leaders network Acevo, said of the government’s decision: “Charity leaders will be dismayed by the Cabinet Office’s decision to ignore wholesale Lord Hodgson’s recommendations to reduce campaigning restrictions. This decision is in direct contradiction with the views of not only Lord Hodgson but the cross-party Lords select committee on charities and over 100 charity leaders from across the country. “Lord Hodgson insisted that his reforms would ensure the clarity and definition of campaigning boundaries. Without them, the Lobbying Act’s restrictions remain deeply intimidating.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/15/wayne-rooney-legend-manchester-united-return-jose-mourinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T21:35:00Z","webTitle":"Wayne Rooney deserves legend’s welcome at United, says José Mourinho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/15/wayne-rooney-legend-manchester-united-return-jose-mourinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/15/wayne-rooney-legend-manchester-united-return-jose-mourinho","fields":{"headline":"Wayne Rooney deserves legend’s welcome at United, says José Mourinho","bodyText":"José Mourinho believes Wayne Rooney’s record 253 goals for Manchester United may be impossible for his replacement Romelu Lukaku to overhaul.

[Also] the difference between the top teams and the others [and] the profile of the competition. Now it’s much more defensive and more difficult.” Mourinho believes Rooney will receive the reception he is due. “I think he’ll get the welcome he deserves,” the United manager said. “Sometimes the word legend comes too easily but he’s a real legend of the club. The number of appearances, goals, trophies – clearly he’s one of the most important players in the history of Manchester United. I think the stadium will show him the respect he deserves. I hope before the match and after but not during it.” Rooney played 559 matches for United and won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League, the FA Cup and three League Cups, and was voted the 2010 PFA and Football Writers’ player of the year. Last season he lost his starting place under Mourinho. Yet the manager would not be drawn on whether Rooney, who is now a regular at Goodison Park, has benefited from his move. “He is an Everton player but I’m not going to speak more,” he said. “He’s a legend, he deserves to be welcomed that way but during the match he’s an Everton player.” Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored 28 times for United last season before suffering a serious knee injury. Lukaku’s strong start suggests he can emulate the Swede though Mourinho is unsure if the striker can propel United to a 21st title. “Last season we had a very good striker for two thirds of the season and it was not enough to win the title. It’s only the second year [of my tenure],” he said. “Romelu has a better team than Zlatan had. He plays a different style and the confidence levels are different. But he deserves credit for that start. The way he plays, the way he’s committed, his overall contribution, we couldn’t be happier.” Mourinho did not wish to consider parallels between Ibrahimovic and Lukaku. “I’m not going to compare,” he said. “It’s very stupid to compare. When players are so different there is no point.” Last season Mourinho repeatedly called on Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Juan Mata to add goals. Of the quartet only Mkhitaryan has scored this season and the manager said: “I’m very pleased with the contribution but I want more goals. The way the team plays I think they have to, when a team doesn’t create a lot, doesn’t have the ball, when it’s just a reactive team, it’s more difficult. When a team makes decisions and puts players in attacking areas, they have to score goals.” In last December’s fixture at Goodison Park Marouane Fellaini conceded an 88th-minute penalty which Leighton Baines scored and the game finished as a 1-1 draw. Yet the Belgium midfielder’s importance to Mourinho was underlined in him coming on for the injured Paul Pogba and scoring the opener in Tuesday’s 3-0 Champions League win over Basel. “His mistake last season was the kind of mistake that I accept in a player. I accept the goalkeeper that concedes a bad goal. I accept the player who misses a penalty. I accept the player who makes a mistake and gives a penalty away. I accept all these individual mistakes that are part of the game and part of football players. What I did with Marouane is what I do normally with every player. “Like Phil Jones, he made a bad mistake for Stoke’s second goal [in last week’s 2-2 draw]. Did I kill him? No. Will he be on the bench on Sunday? No. So life goes on, and that’s the way I did it last season with Fellaini. When players make one individual big mistake and everybody knows that they did it, the players are the first to know they did, and they don’t need any more criticism from the manager that they get from the fans or the media. It’s just being pragmatic and showing common sense.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/17/put-the-wheels-in-motion-for-movable-statues","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Put the wheels in motion for movable statues | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/put-the-wheels-in-motion-for-movable-statues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/put-the-wheels-in-motion-for-movable-statues","fields":{"headline":"Put the wheels in motion for movable statues","bodyText":"As liberal America froths over its monuments to southern racism, in Glasgow a sweeter memory will be cast in stone later this year. On 17 November, outside Govan subway station, the unveiling of a statue of Mary Barbour, one of the most important figures in the city’s modern history will be unveiled. Barbour was the key figure in the fight by working-class women to oppose draconian and arbitrary rent increases during the First World War. In 1915, this daughter of Govan spearheaded months of peaceful protest and civil disobedience as property barons attempted to exploit women whose sons and husbands were facing slaughter on the fields of France. The absence of so many men of working age left massive gaps in essential industries, which attracted workers from Ireland and some of the UK’s outlying areas. Owing to the higher than average wages these jobs paid to meet the national emergency, landlords eyed an opportunity to cash in. First, though, they would have to remove economically vulnerable families made more fragile still by the absence of their breadwinners. Barbour and her army of women stopped them by taking their fight in their thousands to the steps of Glasgow sheriff court and the city chambers. Their heroism led to legislative protection that was copied by other cities throughout the UK and in America. Astonishingly, Barbour will become only the fourth woman Glasgow has deemed worthy of being honoured in this way. For more than 100 years, the city has instead specialised in scattering stone memorials to men who specialised in enslaving, killing and exploiting vulnerable people. Many possessed only the most tenuous connections to the city. The values they represented and championed were the antithesis of those that motivated Barbour. Some of the most distinguished – and dubious – reside in the city’s George Square right in front of Glasgow city chambers, the place where Barbour’s army gathered 102 years ago to fight capitalist exploitation. Among them are Prince Albert, Robert Peel, Queen Victoria, Lord Clyde and William Gladstone, the captains and rulers of an empire built on exploiting the poor of hundreds of defenceless communities overseas. In other parts of Scotland, there are imposing stone effigies to men even more infamous and notorious than the political and aristocratic elite who populate George Square. At the summit of Beinn a’ Bhragaidh at Golspie in Sutherland is an imposing statue that depicts George Granville Leveson-Gower, the first Duke of Sutherland, a notorious landowner who was responsible for some of the most brutal and ruthless of the Highland clearances in the 19th century. Anyone who has ever set foot in Edinburgh will also have seen the statue of the controversial 18th-century politician, Henry Dundas, the first Viscount Melville. You can scarcely miss it; it stands 140ft above the lawns of St Andrew Square. In his day, this old aristo more or less ran Scotland. As well as standing tall over the heads of Edinburgh’s citizenry, Dundas also stands accused of attempting to delay legislation in parliament to end the slave trade. Edinburgh city council is now considering the wording of a new plaque at the statue that would highlight his shady role in the slave trade. Yet this has become a more nuanced debate with the intervention of Bobby Melville, the 10th Viscount Melville, who has mounted a spirited defence of his 18th-century antecedent. Far from opposing abolition, he says, Henry Dundas simply sought to adopt it in stages so that it would have a better chance of succeeding. It was a tactical approach to gain the right outcome in the end, according to Bobby Melville. This intriguing little Edinburgh rammy highlights the moral ambiguity about pulling down or altering monuments that were erected in the midst of an unlovely period in Scotland’s history. I’m concerned about where this will finally take us. In Glasgow, if we were to start pulling down statues according to how queasy we felt about the politics and values they conveyed we’d have to start considering altering the names of streets commemorating the city’s connection to the slave trade. And why stop there? Glasgow’s Merchant City area is replete with marvellous old civic buildings paid for from the profits of trafficking slaves. So let’s demolish them too. Instead, I’d be for adopting a more innovative approach to dealing with those monuments we now consider to be dodgy. To start with, I’d put casters underneath all statues so that they can be wheeled in and out of view depending on the public whim at the time and perhaps be located at a moment’s notice to more appropriate locations. I’d also consider replacing some of them with those human statues you now see on many of the UK’s main urban spaces. This could also double as a condign community service order for social miscreants. And future statue making should move with the times. In 500 years of building statues, it’s perplexing that they all remain stationary. I’d commission mechanical ones whose heads, legs and arms could all be moved into different positions by remote control. The late, great comedian and social visionary Eric Morecambe pioneered this in a memorable Christmas special with Diana Rigg. I think it’s now an idea whose time has come. Instead of criminalising those who insist on placing a traffic cone on the statue of the Duke of Wellington at Glasgow’s Royal Exchange Square I’d make an annual ceremony of it, perhaps to mark the date of one of his adventures of empire in Europe. In the same way, we could garland other monuments to shady aristocratic dealings in a similar fashion. What about sticking a grass skirt on old Henry Dundas? It’s easy to march up to an old statue and pull it down while posing for a selfie. Each year, though, in a land of plenty, we meekly accept the modern slavery of inequality, low wages, premature death and a government that erroneously and wickedly targets foreigners in its haste to leave Europe. Leave the old slave traders alone and pull down these modern ones instead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/15/peter-king-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T15:47:57Z","webTitle":"Peter King obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/15/peter-king-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/15/peter-king-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peter King obituary","bodyText":"My friend and former colleague Peter King, who has died aged 95, was one of Britain’s foremost scholars of Dutch studies. After teaching Dutch at Cambridge University in the 1950s and 60s, in 1976 he moved to the University of Hull to lead its newly established Institute of Modern Dutch Studies. There, as professorial director, he set out what “modern Dutch studies” should constitute, and came up with a definition that went well beyond the study of language and literature. The institute began offering an undergraduate degree in 1980, and, taking inspiration from area studies rather than traditional philology, it fostered a profound knowledge of the speakers of Dutch in both the Netherlands and Flanders. Those who took the degree not only studied Dutch language, literature and history; they spent a year abroad in a combination of university study and work placement. As such, Peter was in the vanguard of developments in university language studies which have now become commonplace. Born in Wimbledon, south-west London, to Berkeley King, a bank clerk, and his wife, Beatrice (nee Bedwell), Peter was educated at King’s College choir school in Cambridge and Ardingly college, West Sussex. During the second world war he joined the Royal Navy, acting for a time as liaison officer on a Dutch submarine. This aroused his interest in Dutch language, literature and culture. After the war he studied Dutch at Bedford College, London, and in Groningen, where he met his future wife, Margaret Leeflang. After an MA at Bedford College he joined Cambridge University, where he taught Dutch as a lecturer. At this time he also became a lay reader in the Church of England, and took an active part in preaching, leading confirmation classes, running a youth group and a choir in the parish in Suffolk where he and Margaret lived. He also gave guidance to people seeking ordination and served on both the Diocesan and the General Synod. Peter was one of the movers behind the national William and Mary tercentenary celebrations in 1988, the year of his retirement from Hull, and was made Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Margaret died in 1995. Peter is survived by his daughters, Kate and Gabrielle, sons, Michael and Christopher, 13 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/15/journalism-under-fire-from-abuse-and-trolls","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T16:33:35Z","webTitle":"Journalism under fire from abuse and trolls | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/15/journalism-under-fire-from-abuse-and-trolls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/15/journalism-under-fire-from-abuse-and-trolls","fields":{"headline":"Journalism under fire from abuse and trolls","bodyText":"What with Donald Trump’s bombastic disparagement of journalists and British politicians’ do-little disregard of those who heckle and troll working journalists for their “awkward” questions, it cannot be long before vituperation begets violence. BBC chairman David Clementi nailed the problem at the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge in highlighting the abuse suffered (particularly by women journalists such as the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg and Emma Barnett) in reporters’ honest pursuit of news coverage in the current highly charged political atmosphere (BBC calls for politicians to stop attacks on reporters, 14 September). When danger is perceived in war zones, front-line war correspondents are afforded the embedded protection of friendly forces; where ugliness has threatened sports writers – either from management or supporters – editors have abandoned coverage until such behaviour is moderated. The safety of political and other journalists is no less important than their duty and their right to ask, on behalf of the public, uncomfortable questions of politicians holding public office. When heckling is allowed to get out of hand on the hustings what trusted, neutral body can organise a (hopefully temporary) boycott as a punishment? Ipso? Ofcom? The Society of Editors? David Banks (Daily Mirror editor, 1992-94), Crookham, Northumberland • In the same edition, you report the BBC’s call for politicians to stop attacking its reporters, the editor of the Evening Standard satirically wishing death on the prime minister and the BBC planning a drama series in which it “shreds” the print media.

She seems to have forgotten he’s also making £650k a year working one day a week for BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager. The former chancellor began there in February while still an MP. Osborne continues too as unpaid chair of his thinktank, the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. He’s clearly a man of many roles; which makes it even harder than Hinsliff says to guess his motivations.

The Washington Capitals star winger issued a written statement through the team on Thursday confirming he would not compete for Russia at the Pyeongchang Games. “I said every time I was asked since last Olympics that nobody is going to tell me I can’t play because my country was going to be allowed to ask me,” Ovechkin wrote. “Now the IIHF and NHL say my country is not allowed to ask anybody in the NHL to play – and there is nothing to talk about any more.” The NHL had accommodated a break in the regular-season schedule for every Winter Olympics since 1998, allowing the world’s best players to compete for their national teams. But the league announced in April that it will make no such concession for 2018, saying it yields no tangible benefit for shutting down for three weeks despite practically uniform enthusiasm from the players to participate. The International Ice Hockey Federation, world ice hockey’s governing body, had initially hoped to broker a deal with the league, agreeing to foot the cost for the players’ travel and insurance after the International Olympic Committee refused. But the NHL sought even further concessions, said to be marketing opportunities tied to the Olympics comparable to that of a top sponsor. Whatever hopes lingered of an eleventh-hour deal after months of silence were scuppered on Tuesday when IIHF president Rene Fasel said it was “practically impossible” to hash out in time for the Pyeongchang Games, which will take place from 9-25 February next year. “I can say that this is now gone. We can tick that off the list,” Fasel told Reuters. “We will have to look ahead to China and the Beijing 2022 Winter Games because there is an interest of the league and we have noted that. “But logistically it is practically impossible for Pyeongchang. That train has left the station.” Ovechkin, who turns 32 next week, had been the among the most vocal advocates in favor of participation, even saying he would compete with Russia if he were the only NHL player to travel to South Korea, a statement lent credibility by the public support of Capitals owner Ted Leonsis. But the IIHF’s assurance to the NHL that no players under contract will be permitted to suit up has effectively closed that avenue. “NHL players in the Olympics is good for hockey and good for Olympics,” Ovechkin wrote. “It sucks that will we not be there to play!!” The Soviet Union, later the Unified Team, won eight of a possible 10 Olympic gold medals from 1956 through 1992, often deploying their top domestic professionals before the NHL granted permission to their players for the Nagano Games in 1998. Ovechkin has participated in the last three Olympics, failing to reach the podium as Russia finished fourth in 2006, sixth in 2010 and fifth on home ice in Russia three years ago. His dissatisfaction with the league’s decision was echoed by his NHL brethren on social media, in particular Russian players looking for a chance at redemption after their underwhelming showing in Sochi. St Louis Blues winger Vladimir Tarasenko, who played alongside Ovechkin in 2014, said players “get pride playing for their country” and expressed frustration that executives took his and others’ Olympic opportunity away. Evgeni Malkin recently told the Sovietsky Sport newspaper that he hoped the Pittsburgh Penguins would let him go to the Olympics, adding of the NHL’s decision: “There’s nothing good about this at all.” Other NHL players have expressed similar discontent. “It’s disappointing,” said Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid, a first-choice player for Canada if healthy. “I’ve never got that chance. I would love to be able to play in Olympics. I’ve heard that they’re real fun.” Said Chicago Blackhawks winger Patrick Kane, who won a silver medal with the United States in 2010 and played in Sochi: “You always relish the opportunity to play for your country, and you don’t want to miss too many of those opportunities, especially when it’s at the caliber of the Olympics. “It would’ve been fun to go to South Korea and to play in the Olympics. Obviously it’s not going to happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/12/the-forgotten-story-of-the-colourful-xi-tragedy","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T09:30:37Z","webTitle":"The forgotten story of … the Colourful XI tragedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/12/the-forgotten-story-of-the-colourful-xi-tragedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/12/the-forgotten-story-of-the-colourful-xi-tragedy","fields":{"headline":"The forgotten story of … the Colourful XI tragedy","bodyText":"Edu Nandlal couldn’t sleep. Many of the other passengers on Surinam Airways flight 764 from Amsterdam Schiphol to Paramaribo Zanderij had decided to get some rest on the 12-hour journey. But this was the first time Nandlal had returned to Suriname since leaving for the Netherlands after the military coup in 1980. He wanted to see home as the plane approached. Most were still sleeping when the flight began its descent, in the early hours of Wednesday 7 June 1989. Nandlal looked out of the window and saw lights from houses in the jungle shining. Then he felt something hit the plane. And then something else. “Shit,” he thought, “I’m dead.” ‘Everything was good when we left’ The Colourful XI was the initiative of Sonny Hasnoe, a Dutch-Surinamese social worker based in Amsterdam. Hasnoe frequently worked in the most deprived areas of the city, where many fellow immigrants lived. Hasnoe noticed children in these areas tended to benefit hugely from football: their behaviour was generally better and they were more likely to engage and connect with wider Dutch society. Thus he decided to try raising money and awareness of their plight and the profile of Dutch-Surinamese footballers by bringing together a team of such men who would play some exhibition games. The first was in 1986: a few were played in the Netherlands, in Enschede and Hengelo, without huge national fanfare but that was only half the point. The games had a festival atmosphere, with food and Surinamese music. Players such as Regi Blinker and Ken Monkou made appearances for what became known as the ‘Kleurrijk Elftal’ – the Colourful XI. In 1989, plans were made to take the games home. The team would take part in a mini-tournament with three other teams in Paramaribo, Suriname’s capital, and the hope was that some of Dutch football’s biggest names would take part. The previous year’s European Championship-winning squad featured a number of players from a Surinamese background: Aron Winter, Gerald Vanenburg, Frank Rijkaard and of course Ruud Gullit. If some of those Dutch heroes would make the trip, the team’s profile would grow enormously. But, perhaps predictably, their employers weren’t so keen. Gullit and Rijkaard played for Milan, who weren’t happy for their stars to make an ‘unnecessary’ transatlantic journey at the end of a long season. Similarly Henk Fraser, who had made his international debut earlier that year, joined Winter, Bryan Roy, forward Henny Meijer and goalkeeper Stanley Menzo in being denied permission to travel by Ajax. Menzo and Meijer ignored these instructions and flew out to Suriname separately on 5 June, ostensibly going ‘on holiday’ but with the intention of playing anyway. On 6 June, the rest of the squad gathered at Schipol airport. The atmosphere among the 17 players, plus coach Nick Stienstra, was celebratory. The stars might not have been there, but plenty of talent was: FC Twente defender Andy Scharmin decided to go rather than play in the Toulon tournament, at least in part so he could take his mother and aunt on the trip home; Steve van Dorpel was about to sign for Roda JC after tearing Ajax apart earlier that season; Andro Knel was a rising star and colourful character who would regularly rollerskate to training. Nandlal, by his own admission, wasn’t the most talented player in the world, more a workhorse, a midfield grafter who forged a decent career in the Netherlands since arriving in 1980, aged 18. He played for Utrecht under Dick Advocaat but was told he wasn’t tough enough. After moving to Emmen, he was then sold to Vitesse Arnhem, with whom he won promotion to the Eredivisie. “This was the first time I’d been back to Suriname since leaving,” he says now, speaking to an English publication for the first time since 1989. “All my friends were saying they were going to sleep, but I wanted to stay awake to see the landing.” The flight was delayed by 12 hours because the plane, a 20-year-old DC8 called the ‘Anthony Nesty’, named after the Surinamese swimmer who won gold at the 1988 Olympics, was late arriving from Miami. Still, the mood was cheerful. “Everything was good when we left,” says Nandlal. “There was a band, the Draver Boys, who played music on the plane. The whole flight over the sea was perfect.” The footballers played cards, the Draver Boys sang, and anyone who could sleep through all that got some rest. As they approached Zanderij airport, about 45km south of Paramaribo, Nandlal looked out. “I could see the lights of the small houses in the jungle,” he says. “It was dark, so that’s all I could see.” About 20 minutes before landing, the cockpit received a weather report which told them visibility was at around 900m because of fog: this, apparently, took them by surprise as visibility was previously judged at about 6km. Captain Will Rogers decided to deploy the instrument landing system (ILS), designed to help planes land in poor weather, despite not being cleared to do so by the control tower at the airport, who told them to follow the standard beacon to the runway. “Legally, we don’t have ILS,” said co-pilot Glyn Tobias. “We have to use it,” said Rogers. The version installed at Zanderij hadn’t been properly developed and wasn’t supposed to be in use yet. Two attempts at connecting with the ILS were unsuccessful. “I don’t trust that ILS,” said Tobias, as they tried for a third time, eventually managing to connect. But the information provided by the ILS wasn’t reliable, giving an incorrect approach angle. Yet Tobias said he could see the runway, and what he could see more or less aligned with the ILS information. As they descended, they passed through some low cloud. “Tell ‘em to put the runway lights bright,” said Rogers, twice. An altitude warning alarm sounded, but it was ignored, the crew deciding to trust the ILS. They descended to 300 feet, 200 feet, 150 feet. It was only then they realised they were coming in too low. “Pull up!” said the flight engineer, Warren Rose. On the cockpit recorder, the sound of the first impact was audible. “Pull up!” said Rose again. Then: “That’s it. I’m dead.” The plane was coming in so low that one of the wings hit the top of a tree, not visible from the plane because of the fog and cloud. “We were going down, then I felt something hitting the airplane,” says Nandlal. “I thought: ‘Shit. Something’s happening.’ Everyone started waking up.” Then the other wing hit a another tree, and the plane flipped over and crashed into the ground, upside down. Most of the 187 on board (178 passengers, nine crew) were killed on impact. Ortwin Linger, a defender for FC Haarlem, survived for three days but died later in hospital. In total, only 11 survived (almost all because they were thrown from the wreckage), plus one dog. Inevitably, the dog was subsequently named ‘Lucky’. Fifteen of the 18 Colourful XI party died. Nandlal survived thanks to a mid-flight act of courtesy to a man who wasn’t even supposed to be on the flight. Jerry Haatrecht was a midfielder who started his career in Ajax’s youth ranks, but had slipped down a few levels and had been playing amateur football. His brother Winnie, a professional who played for Heerenveen, was invited but could not travel because of his club’s involvement in promotion play-offs, so suggested Jerry. During the flight Haatrecht, a rangy midfielder, was one of those who wanted to get some sleep: Nandlal, a shorter man, offered up his seat which was near the emergency exit, so had more legroom, and they swapped. “I felt pain in my head, pain in my ear,” says Nandlal. “It was totally dark. It was a complete blackout. They found me at 5am. My seat was in the middle of the airplane. I didn’t have my seatbelt on, and when they found me I was near the cockpit.” He was discovered by the emergency services about an hour and a half after the crash. Remarkably, the man who heard his cries for help recognised him. “He said: ‘Hey, Edu – I know you. You were in my class at school.” But even with the debris around him, Nandlal didn’t comprehend what was happening. “He said the plane has crashed, and I said: ‘No, why are you telling me that? We’re here to play football.’ You can tell I was in deep shock. I could smell gasoline. I heard people screaming ‘I’m dying, help me!’ I could hear children screaming. But still all I could think was: ‘This is not true, it’s a dream, we’re landing. We’re going to play football.’” Nandlal had broken his back. He spent five days in hospital in Paramaribo, before being flown back to Holland. He spent 14 months in rehab, some of which spent in a wheelchair, and was told he would never walk again. “I prayed to God. I said to him: ‘Can you let me walk a little? Only a little. Then I’ll feel better. I don’t have to play football, but let me walk a little.’” In the end it was probably more medical expertise than divine intervention, but he eventually did recover. These days he has a limp, but is broadly fine. The two other survivors from the team were Sigi Lens and Radjin de Haan. Lens, a tall attacker who played for Fortuna Sittard and is the uncle of Sunderland winger Jeremain, never played again but went on to become an agent. “I often wonder: what would become of those players?” he said in a 2014 interview to mark the 25th anniversary of the disaster. “Andy Scharmin was a great talent. He could have gone to the tournament in Toulon with Jong Orange, but chose Suriname because his mother had not been there for a long time. Florian Vijent. Lloyd Doesburg. Jerry Haatrecht. Fred Patrick. Fred was like a little brother to me.” De Haan was the only one who played after the crash. Seven months later he returned to football, but didn’t last long. He became a coach, working at home and abroad, including a stint in Libya. “I never do much on 7 June,” he said in a rare interview last year. “I was 19 and had a lot of luck. I broke my third vertebrae, tore my shoulder blade and had a lot of bruises. But because I was so young, I was able to work on my recovery very quickly.” The 15 who died were Scharmin, Van Dorpel, Knel, Haatrecht, Stienstra, Fraser, Linger, Heracles defender Ruud Degenaar, Lloyd Doesburg (an Ajax goalkeeper), Frits Goodings (a team-mate of Nandlal’s at Utretcht), Virgall Joemankha (the only member of the team to play outside Holland, for Cercle Brugge), Willem II full-back Ruben Kogeldans, Fred Patrick of PEC Zwolle, De Graafschap winger Elfried Veldman and Telstar’s Florian Vijent. Just as some Chapecoense players did before their crash in 2016, in the days before the flight several of those involved felt uneasy. “Nick Stienstra’s wife told me she woke up one night, and he was lying on his back like he was in a coffin,” says Iwan Tol, who wrote Destination Zanderij, a book about the team and the crash. “Andro Knel said a few days before to his mother: ‘This is strange to say, but just know that I love you.’” In reality the cause was more prosaic. “Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong,” says Tol. “Sigi Lens said that when he stepped on to the plane, he could see it was very old. Some things were just held together with tape.” Rogers, the pilot, was a 66-year-old American who should not have been able to captain the flight: Surinamese regulations disqualified anyone over 60 from taking charge of a commercial airline. Additionally, Rogers had recently been suspended from flying after landing on the wrong runway, and his co-pilot Tobias had false identity papers. The crew were hired via a separate company by the airline, SLM, but the relevant checks were not properly carried out. They ignored alarms from the ground proximity warning system that told them the plane was coming in too low, turning off the alarm after a few seconds. Assorted protocols, including use of the ILS, were not observed. The commission which investigated the crash concluded that “as a result of the captain’s glaring carelessness and recklessness the aircraft was flown below the published minimum altitudes during the approach”, while also placing blame on the airline who failed “to observe the pertinent regulations as well as the procedures … concerning qualification and certification during recruitment and employment of the crew members.” ‘It’s always about the footballers but lots of people died’ Of course, this isn’t purely a football tragedy. Maurice Lede is a Dutch TV presenter and Andy Scharmin’s cousin. In 2014, to mark the 25th anniversary of the disaster, Lede went to Suriname to make a documentary about the crash, and he found a country that has not, and almost certainly will not, forget. “Everybody in one way was involved,” says Lede. “Everybody lost a family member, or someone [close]. It was intense. A lot of people weren’t willing to talk about it because it was really emotional. A lot of people were crying, just when I talked about it. The impact was huge. For a lot of people it felt like yesterday. It’s quite a difference to here in Holland. Here it became known because of the football players, but over there it’s known as the disaster of the country.” And because it’s primarily known because of the footballers who lost their lives, the other victims are often forgotten. Most were Surinamese people living in the Netherlands, but three top-ranking military officers – Suriname army Chief of Staff, Major Raymond Lieuw Yen Tai, air force commander Major Eddy Djoe and army Chief of Operations, Captain Armand Salomons – were on board too. “So many more people were on the plane,” says Lede. “Young children who were travelling to see their grandparents. A couple who were on their honeymoon. If the football players weren’t on the flight, it wouldn’t have got as much attention. People say: ‘It’s always about the football players but a lot of people were killed.’” The crash site is now a curious combination of national mourning hub and grave. Two monuments have been erected, but much of the debris was simply buried in the ground where it fell. “They dug a hole and put parts of the plane in it,” says Lede, “but because many years have passed everything pops up. It was quite intense – painful and weird.” While the crash is a national tragedy in Suriname, and a fairly well-known story in the Netherlands, it’s not thought of in the same way as the Munich air disaster, or Superga, or Chapecoense, or the Zambia team wiped out in 1993. This is partly because none of the players who died were household names: unlike those four examples, this was not a young, talented team on the verge of greatness. But it’s also probably because many of the victims were immigrants, two cultures bridging thousands of miles. “In Holland, they say it was a disaster that happened far away,” says Tol. “It’s somewhere between the two lands, and nobody takes responsibility for it. We don’t have a culture of thinking of our heroes like they do in England. The only thing we knew was a few pictures on television of the airplane. It’s well known by football fans, but it’s not like the Busby Babes.” ‘The biggest problems are in your mind’ After his physical recovery, Nandlal tried to start a normal life. “After the crash I don’t worry about football,” he says. “The biggest problems are in your mind. You need five years, 10 years to feel calm. To come to terms with it.” Survivor’s guilt was inevitable, having escaped the crash that killed so many compatriots. “At the beginning, I always thought about my friends, the ones who died. I felt guilty.” He’s still friends with Sigi Lens, but also Winnie Haatrecht, whose brother died after swapping seats, and their sister. He scouted a little for FC Utrecht, but in 2002 he started a cleaning company which he still runs, employing people who might otherwise find getting a job more difficult: immigrants, those with criminal records, people with learning difficulties. The guilt lingered, but a decade after the crash it disappeared. He had a son, Riva, but when he was five-years-old, he was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour. Nandlal received the news, with the implausible cruelty that only a random universe can bring, on 7 June. Riva died in April 2002. “I always said to myself that if you survive an airplane crash, you know what lucky is,” says Nandlal. “But then when my son died, I know what the opposite is. I know both. I know what lucky is, but I also know what shit is. I know the pain. From that day, I felt better [about the crash]. After my son died, I no longer felt guilty.” Talking to Nandlal, a man who has endured physical and emotional trauma that nobody should have to, it’s notable that he speaks about his life with no anger: at the pilot, the airline, the universe, as he justifiably could. “I don’t feel angry. The pilot made a big mistake,” he says, matter of factly. “I know what life is.” “Every 7 June, I always think about the people who died. Not just the football players. All the people who died.” Last year Nandlal went back to lay flowers at the scene of the crash. “It made me feel better because I could see they still think about the families over there,” he says. “They don’t forget.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/16/chelsea-arsenal-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T08:30:07Z","webTitle":"Chelsea v Arsenal: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/16/chelsea-arsenal-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/16/chelsea-arsenal-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea v Arsenal: match preview","bodyText":"Arsenal have not won a league game at Stamford Bridge in six years.

Among the many knock-on effects from the vote to leave the EU came an unwanted development for shoppers – the cost of buying groceries went up. The prices of butter and fish have soared since last summer and grocery prices across the board have increased well ahead of the rate of inflation. What does that mean for the average shopper? Bigger bills at the checkout first of all, as retailers have also cut back on promotions. But shoppers have been quick to react and many are now spending less and being more cautious about what they buy as inflation bites. High-street stores have seen a drop in sales while more people go online to shop around. Three simple must-dos 1 Only buy what you need Before you shop, stop and question yourself – do I really need this? Vouchers, special offers and deals can work in your favour, but are there to make sure you spend more. “Never buy something you don’t need just because it’s on offer,” says the Money Advice Service. It’s simple but still good advice – supermarkets are there to make people spend; hold off buying anything unnecessary. If the item is needed, look for a better offer from another retailer. 2 Avoid brand premiums Flashy packaging, brand names and the accompanying higher price do not necessarily mean that a product is better than its cheaper rivals. Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert has long championed the “downshift challenge” – dropping down one “brand level” on all goods and then seeing if there is a difference in the quality. If there is not, then stay with the cheaper one and bank the savings that come with it. This prevents spending money for no reason. There are four descending “levels” of brands – from premium to branded, own brand and value – according to Lewis. Try moving down from one level to the next in one of the items you buy in the supermarket – for example, buy one packet of branded pasta along with another packet of your standard pasta – and see if you can spot the difference. 3 Get ready to haggle Haggling is not just for fruit stalls in the local marketplace. There is frequently leeway on price tags, especially when buying electronics. While trying to argue a price down may not come easily to some, it can lead to huge savings. Consumer group Which? advises shoppers to seek out the most senior person in a shop, be polite and make sure that you show you are serious by saying that you are ready to buy the product in question there and then. Bring evidence of better deals that you may have seen and be flexible – if you can’t get a reduction in the price then perhaps you will be able to get some accessories for free or at a reduced price. But don’t be afraid to walk away if you can’t get the deal you want. Five easy ways to save 1 Switch your supermarket Any consumer hoping to save a few quid in goods or services should be well used to the idea of switching – changing providers to get a better deal. This is not confined to broadband contracts; the same principle can be applied to your supermarket shop. Price comparison site mySupermarket looks at the prices for goods across the major supermarkets and updates the site daily with the latest prices and promotions. Users can fill their online baskets in the normal way and are then offered the option of going to the cheapest supermarket. The site also suggests item swaps to cheaper alternatives. 2 Watch out for reduced items Look for the yellow vouchers in supermarkets that mark out those goods being sold to clear at sometimes greatly reduced prices. When and where to find the best bargains can be a tricky game – they are not advertised and can crop up on different goods at different times of the day. MoneySavingExpert says that the first stickers can appear in supermarkets mid-morning, while the more extreme price drops often happen later in the day. But the same core rules stand no matter how much a product is reduced – if you are unlikely to eat something, don’t waste your money, no matter how small it is, just to bag a bargain. 3 Buy online from China Look east. Ever increasing numbers of British people are buying from China via sites such as Alibaba, LightInTheBox, DHGate and Everbuying. And there are bargains to be had – mobile phone cases for less than a pound and a woman’s belt for under 20p among them, both with delivery included. Buying from China comes with its drawbacks – delivery times can be up to six weeks and you run the risk of an additional bill for VAT and customs charges, depending on how much purchases are valued at. In order to avoid extra charges or if you are wary that some of the goods – especially electronics – may not be what you want or faulty, then keep your spend under £15. Don’t assume that just because prices seem cheaper you can’t get a similar deal from European outlets. 4 Buy more to save on delivery With more shopping being done online, there are an increasing number of ways to save. Firstly, use shopbots to find the cheapest price for a product. Like comparison sites, they trawl the web for the best price and list off all of the options. Among the main sites are Twenga and Kelkoo, while MoneySavingExpert has a tool that searches through all the big sites. The bane of online shopping can be delivery charges – £20 being the minimum threshold of purchases for free delivery in the case of Amazon. Add smaller, less expensive items to your cart to push it over the threshold and it could mean you save on the larger cost of paying for delivery. Amazon Prime carries a monthly charge but there is a 30-day free trial in which you can avail of the free delivery that comes with the paid-for service. 5 Apps that prevent waste Get the money-saving apps. Too Good To Go links users up with local restaurants that have food at the end of the day and sell it at reduced prices. Aimed at saving food waste, a specific time window is given to pick up the food. Prices range from £2 to the maximum of £3.80. Another app, Olio, aims for households to share produce that is going to be unused – from food nearing sell-by dates in the local supermarket to items in your own fridge. Users put up a picture, a description and a time to collect. Advanced money-saving tip Search the web for coupons Using voucher codes can drastically cut the cost of your shopping basket, both online and in the supermarket. Sourcing vouchers from across the internet, extreme couponing, has become a pursuit for eager savers. Jordan Cox, MoneySavingExpert’s Coupon Kid, once got £600 worth of groceries for 4p after rounding up scores of coupons. Holly Smith, from Great Yarmouth, has almost a million followers on her Facebook page, where she posts the best coupons she has found; she once bought £1,164.39 worth of shopping for £0, and gave it all away to charities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/16/nuclear-power-plants-lib-dems-vince-cable-wind-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power plants may not keep Britain's lights on, say Lib Dems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/16/nuclear-power-plants-lib-dems-vince-cable-wind-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/16/nuclear-power-plants-lib-dems-vince-cable-wind-energy","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power plants may not keep Britain's lights on, say Lib Dems","bodyText":"New nuclear power stations may not be the best option for keeping Britain’s lights on and meeting the country’s carbon targets, the Liberal Democrats have said. The party said there were legitimate concerns over nuclear’s cost and the risks it would not be delivered on time, just days after windfarms secured state support far more cheaply than the Hinkley Point C atomic power station. However, the party, which voted in support of nuclear four years ago after decades of opposition, said the technology should still be considered an option in the UK’s future energy mix. “Nuclear power should be kept open as an option – but there is a risk that it may not be able to keep the lights on and that it may not be the lowest-cost option,” said the Lib Dems in a new report, authored by the former coalition minister Lynne Featherstone. Vince Cable, the party’s leader, said this week that the breakthrough low subsidy prices for offshore windfarms should prompt a “radical reappraisal” of how Britain is powered. If the Lib Dems were to go so far as opposing atomic power again, it would mark a break in the pro-nuclear cross-party consensus of the three main parties. Senior Lib Dems believe the party has an opportunity to seize the momentum on environmental issues, with Labour constrained on issues such as nuclear power because of its close association with trade unions. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP and former energy minister who was pivotal in the party’s support for nuclear, said of the report: “It’s not about taking nuclear off the table. It’s responding to the evidence of the last two years. “It’s a recalibration off the back of the fact nuclear is not proving to be a practical, affordable technology. It’s not saying never [to nuclear], but the costs are coming down fast with renewables.” The report also backed an acceleration of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater flexibility of the energy system through storage and interconnectors with other countries. The party accused the Conservatives of “unravelling” progress on climate change made by the Lib Dems during the coalition government years. “What worries me about the Tories is they have taken CCS off table, they’re not pushing forward with renewables,” said Davey. The report concludes that the UK is on course to miss its contribution towards the Paris climate agreement aspirational target of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C. To get back on track, the Lib Dems are calling for the Climate Change Act’s target of an 80% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 to be brought forward by five to 10 years. Last year the government’s climate advisers warned that the UK lacked policies to meet half of the carbon reductions required by 2030. Ministers have produced a blueprint on how to close the gap, the Clean Growth Plan, which could be published as soon as next week. Before the party’s annual conference in Bournemouth this weekend, Cable said the world would “soon reach a tipping point beyond which catastrophic global warming will become irreversible” and Britain had a responsibility to set an example. “Instead, these past two years the Conservatives have done their best to trash our green industries and undo the progress made during the coalition years,” he said. “This report shows that becoming carbon-free by 2050 will be crucial if we are to meet the Paris agreement’s ambitious target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Furthermore, it sets out how this ambition can be delivered.” The party will also hope to burnish its environmental credentials in the coming months with the debate over Heathrow expansion, which it opposes. The majority of Labour MPs are in favour of expansion, as is the Unite trade union, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are against further expansion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/17/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-bubble-he-would-know-banking","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T07:16:09Z","webTitle":"Don’t dismiss bankers' predictions of a bitcoin bubble – they should know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/17/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-bubble-he-would-know-banking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/17/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-bubble-he-would-know-banking","fields":{"headline":"Don’t dismiss bankers' predictions of a bitcoin bubble – they should know","bodyText":"When the boss of Wall Street’s biggest bank calls a bubble, the world inevitably sits up and listens, albeit with a sense of historically weighted irony: of course an investment bank boss would spot disaster after his industry presided over the last one. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, said last week that the ascendancy of the virtual currency bitcoin – which has risen in price from just over $2 in 2011 to more than $4,000 at points this year – reminded him of tulip fever in 17th-century Holland. “It is worse than tulip bulbs,” he said. “It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up. I am just shocked that anyone can’t see it for what it is.” Dimon’s comments are an open invitation for derision from those who, rightly, point out that although JP Morgan may be top of the Wall Street heap, that heap is far from being the moral high ground. Under Dimon’s leadership, it has agreed a $13bn settlement with US regulators over selling dodgy mortgage securities – the instruments behind the credit crunch – and its run-ins with watchdogs include a $264m fine last year for hiring the children of Chinese officials in order to win lucrative business in return. But it doesn’t make him wrong. Even the most basic description of bitcoin – an intellectual test on a par with describing a collateralised debt obligation – elicits mental images of a digital back-alley shell game. A bitcoin is a cryptographic solution to a complex equation. It is not as recognisable to you or me as a unit of value as, say, a dollar bill or a prize conker. There is no central authority validating the creation of bitcoins – instead, they are recorded on a public electronic ledger called a blockchain. If you regard the Bank of England as an all-powerful insurer for the pound, there is no such institution behind bitcoin. This lack of a central authority is one of the reasons why Dimon cavilled in such strong terms last week. In the interstices of unregulated finance lurk ne’er-do-wells. “If you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars,” he said. “So there may be a market for that, but it would be a limited market.” Hyperbole aside – murderers don’t necessarily need a digital wallet to fulfil their ambitions – Dimon is referencing a well-trailed link between bitcoin and narcotics. The currency is also vulnerable to hackers. Without a backstop central bank, heist victims stand to lose everything, as with the collapse of the MtGox bitcoin exchange in 2014. Taking out a mortgage denominated in bitcoins is not advisable and, luckily for those stupid enough to try it, you won’t find a high street bank willing to underwrite it. But some of the perceived flaws behind bitcoin that alarm Dimon – no central authority, a public ledger of transactions – point to the foundations of a new financial establishment. In his jargon-busting lexicon of finance How to Speak Money, the author John Lanchester described how the high priests of ancient Egypt controlled agriculture – and by extension the economy – through a closely guarded flood measurement system known as a nilometer that was hidden behind a load of mumbo jumbo. Dimon, a modern high priest, faces a rival value system in bitcoin. It has no temple, no central authority and uses a rubric over which he has no control. In other words, it is an alternative financial establishment, whose popularity is inextricably linked with the ebbing of trust in the global system that was triggered by the credit crunch. If bitcoin fails, or is discredited, another system will rise to take its place, without the imprimatur of Dimon or his peers around the altar. First-time buyers beware: this rate rise could just be the start House owners, and would-be house owners, beware. Change is coming. The majority on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee against raising interest rates seems huge, confirmed at 7-2 last week. But the language is tightening around the nation’s finances. Spare capacity in the economy – unfilled jobs and unspent money – is being whittled away more quickly than previously thought and inflation is still likely to overshoot its 2% target over the next three years. Yes, wage growth is running below an inflation rate that has now hit 2.9%, but all signs now point to that 7-2 split flipping the other way come November. As the Bank said, “some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months”. This was firmed up the following day by Gertjan Vlieghe, previously the most anti-rise MPC member, when he said the bank was “approaching the moment” for an increase. Market punters now think there is a 42% chance of a rise in November, and more than 50% in December. The current split on the MPC masks the weighing of trade-offs – between economic growth and inflation, post-referendum stability and curbing consumer debt – which is ever delicate and close to a tipping point. A rate rise from 0.25% at present to 0.5% will be no disaster and would merely represent a return to the previous record low, which had lasted from 2009 to the EU vote. But what should sharpen borrowers’ minds is the thought of further increases – as hinted by Vlieghe. Inflation remains stubbornly high; something will have to be done to temper a consumer lending surge growing at 10% a year. Households might cope with a move to 0.5%, but if a rate increase augurs a sustained move against cheap borrowing and persistent inflation, then a wider rethink of ambitions, from getting further up the housing ladder to buying a new car, will be needed. And for those not on the housing ladder, hopes of a step up could be extinguished altogether. Disney hopes its Star Wars choice will use the force wisely Disney’s choice of creative talent in recent years has been impeccable, having handed the Avengers franchise to Joss Whedon and employed Lin-Manuel Miranda to co-write the music for Moana. But its decisions over the Star Wars universe have unravelled of late. The director of Rogue One, Gareth Edwards, was sidelined during reshoots, while the directing duo behind the new Han Solo film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, were fired altogether shortly before shooting finished. Most recently, Jurassic World helmer Colin Trevorrow was yanked off the final Star Wars instalment before filming began. Last week, Disney announced it was handing the final film in the latest Star Wars trilogy to JJ Abrams, the creator of Lost and director of The Force Awakens, the film that launched this Jedi triptych. Abrams is a conservative choice, by Disney’s recent standards. But what the studio needs right now is a safe pair of hands on the lightsaber."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/sep/15/restorative-justice-is-the-way-forward","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T16:34:51Z","webTitle":"Restorative justice is the way forward | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/sep/15/restorative-justice-is-the-way-forward","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/sep/15/restorative-justice-is-the-way-forward","fields":{"headline":"Restorative justice is the way forward","bodyText":"Jeremy Cushing’s excellent explanation of referral orders and restorative justice is timely indeed (Letters, 12 September).

Resale of football tickets is illegal in the UK, but Cologne fans told The Guardian they were able to secure seats in the home end via Craigslist, independent ticket touts and websites such as Viagogo and Ticketbis, owned by StubHub. One Cologne fan, who asked not to be named, said he bought his tickets via Craigslist from somebody who had several seats to sell. “I got a phone number and messaged with that guy via WhatsApp,” he said. “It was £100 for a seat near the away block of the Cologne supporters. “He sent me my ticket as a PDF via email and I paid him via PayPal. I also gave out his number to a couple of fans who were looking for tickets as well so I guess he had plenty to sell.” He added that friends had picked up tickets bearing the names of Arsenal members in the reception of the Thistle hotel in Kensington Gardens. “These were real plastic permanent tickets with a name on them. They made the deal via Craigslist, paid upfront and had the tickets sent to their hotel in London. After the game, they had to return the permanent tickets to the hotel reception until midnight,” he said. Adverts offering tickets for the game were still up on Craigslist the day after the game, some including telephone numbers, seat information and details of where to meet the seller. Another Cologne fan told The Guardian that he bought his ticket from a man in the Little Wonder Cafe, opposite the south west corner of the Emirates Stadium. “There were two old men at the table. I bought from a guy named Herbie, he had five or six tickets alone,” the fan said. Screenshots taken from the Viagogo and Ticketbis websites suggest that the ticket platforms were also offering seats, despite laws preventing football ticket resale. A cached version of the Viagogo website showed the game as having sold out. Viagogo, which has an office in London’s Fenchurch Street, declined to comment. Spain-based Ticketbis, owned by online auction firm eBay via its tickets subsidiary StubHub, said: “We take fan segregation seriously. We make it clear to buyers using our website that visiting fans must only purchase tickets for and be seated in the designated area for visiting fans and that access to the stadium may be denied by the club where a visiting fan attempts to enter the home fan section of the stadium.” Independent tout websites also appear to have sold hundreds of tickets. One Madrid-based site, footballticketnet.com, boasted that it sold 416 tickets for the game. The website, which did not return a request for comment, claims that it is a member of the ticket touts’ trade body, the Association of Secondary Ticketing Agents (ASTA). But a spokesperson for ASTA said the site’s membership lapsed four years ago and that ASTA members would not resell football tickets unless authorised by a football club. Ticketing expert Reg Walker, of Iridium Security, said there had been a “monumental intelligence failure” on the part of police for failing to realise so many Cologne fans would be able to get their hands on tickets. Walker said the chaotic scenes at the Emirates, which saw some Cologne fans barred from entry while others had seats in the Arsenal supporters’ sections, were the “direct result of touts reselling tickets”. “It brings home why we have this legislation” he said. “Clearly ticket touting is rife around that stadium and it’s not being addressed as a priority.” Users of the FC Cologne fan forum EffZeh, said “thousands” of tickets had been advertised online and criticised Arsenal for failing to make more tickets available officially. One forum member said: “For months, everyone in Cologne has talked of nothing else but playing in the Europa League, getting tickets, buying flights and celebrating this historic day. But then the Arsenal corporate office was so unprepared? What sort of amateurs work there?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/15/francis-bacon-pope-painting-auction-christies-45-years-hidden-away","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T14:52:46Z","webTitle":"Pope painting by Francis Bacon to go on sale after 45 years hidden away","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/francis-bacon-pope-painting-auction-christies-45-years-hidden-away","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/francis-bacon-pope-painting-auction-christies-45-years-hidden-away","fields":{"headline":"Pope painting by Francis Bacon to go on sale after 45 years hidden away","bodyText":"The pope’s body is a spiralling heap of sausages wrapped in white and pink robes.

Francis Bacon’s Study of Red Pope 1962. 2nd Version 1971 is as close to a new painting by the great Soho bohemian painter who died in 1992 as we are ever likely to see. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1971, six months after Bacon finished it, and was shown in Düsseldorf the following year. Since then it has been locked away by a private collector, who never lent it or showed it. The gold-framed explosion of velvety red and rose on raw beige canvas has been hidden away for 45 years, said Jussi Pylkkänen, the president of Christie’s. Pylkkänen will be auctioning this choice cut of raw artistic beef in person early next month, when the world’s art collectors converge on London for the Frieze art fair. Bacon painted Study of Red Pope 1962. 2nd Version 1971 – probably not his best title – at the most intense moment of his life. It was the best of times and the worst of times for the Irish-born artist. He was about to put on a massive one-man exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris. As a francophile who was friends with Paris intellectuals including the surrealist Michel Leiris, he cared deeply about how he would be received there. Yet, Pylkkänen said, Bacon faced a problem. He wanted to include his renowned 1962 painting Study for Innocent X but its owner refused to lend it. With just six months to go before the most important exhibition of his life, Bacon shut himself in his cramped studio at 7 Reece Mews, Kensington to create a new version of a masterpiece. He was facing a personal as well as artistic crisis. As Bacon painted, his relationship with George Dyer, the small-time East End criminal who was the love of his life, was getting ever more futile. Dyer had descended into an alcoholic malaise, unable to live as Bacon did in a giddily creative permanent champagne high. He was vanishing from Bacon’s life, but invades this painting. As the pope squirms like a giant silk-clad turd, sitting not on a papal throne but a 1970s swivel chair, the glass booth that encloses him morphs into a mirror in which he sees the figure of George Dyer. This is not the decaying man Dyer had become by 1971. It looks more like the handsome, well-dressed young thug he was when Bacon first met him in a pub in 1963. Wearing a smart suit and tie, his hand elegantly clenched in a proud fist, Dyer is upright, strong and a bit cocky. Is the slumping pope whose formless body is capped by a drunk’s red nose in fact a portrait of Dyer drunk, looking at a last vision of his former self? Pylkkänen thinks Bacon was working at an artistic and emotional peak when he painted this furious bloody mary cocktail of artistic ambition and private sorrow. “There’s something about it that tells me – ‘I’m going to paint a great picture for this show, the last of my popes, with my muse George Dyer in it,’” he says. Bacon succeeded, at least artistically. The exhibition at the Grand Palais would be the greatest triumph of Bacon’s career, raising his reputation to the sublime level it has held ever since. Yet as Bacon got ready for the opening, Dyer killed himself with a drug overdose in their hotel room. Notoriously, there was a conspiracy of silence for two days so the death wouldn’t spoil Bacon’s vernissage. “We’re talking about £60m,” says Pylkkänen. That’s actually quite a bit less than Bacon’s record of £89.3m for Three Studies of Lucian Freud, so the estimate may be exceeded if bidders get excited enough by the painting’s intense combination of aesthetic and human drama. “It’s got all the elements that collectors are looking for,” says Pylkkänen. The president of Christie’s is by definition a good salesman – but his excitement is justified. This modern Baroque marvel proves Bacon was the Caravaggio of the 20th century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/15/west-bromwich-albion-west-ham-united-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T13:35:42Z","webTitle":"West Bromwich Albion v West Ham United: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/15/west-bromwich-albion-west-ham-united-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/15/west-bromwich-albion-west-ham-united-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"West Bromwich Albion v West Ham United: match preview","bodyText":"Slaven Bilic gained a reprieve when his side beat Huddersfield on Monday but his future will be thrust back under the spotlight should West Ham lose at West Brom.

Labour joined welfare charities in calling for the planned roll-out of the benefit to be paused in the light of mounting evidence that design and administration problems are causing financial hardship for vulnerable and low-income households. One in four new universal credit claimants waited more than 42 days for a first payment, while nearly half of families said moving on to the benefit had led them to fall behind with rent for the first time. Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government’s flagship universal credit programme is in total disarray. It is unacceptable that one in four claimants are waiting more than six weeks to receive support, alongside mounting debts and arrears among recipients. “I have written to the secretary of state requesting that he immediately halt the roll-out of universal credit to contain the misery being caused by the disastrous mishandling of this programme.” The work and pensions select committee has launched an inquiry into universal credit after hearing evidence from landlords, charities and tenants about extensive problems associated with it. Frank Field, the committee chair, said: “Everything I have seen so far, on the committee and in my constituency, points to fundamental flaws in the operation of universal credit, which must be resolved before the full service roll-out proceeds.” The Department for Work and Pensions evaluation found that 42% of all claimant families surveyed said the wait for a first universal credit payment to be processed and DWP administrative errors were the cause of their rent arrears. Four in 10 households were in rent arrears eight weeks after the claim was made, with nearly one in three still in arrears four months later. One in five owed £1,000 or more. Four out of five said they had never been in arrears before. Half of new claimants needed a DWP loan to help pay for living expenses such as food and gas bills while they waited for a first payment, while nearly one-third borrowed cash from family or friends. About one in 10 took out loans with payday or doorstep lenders. The department pointed to encouraging findings in the evaluation suggesting that overall, families moving on to universal credit were coping well with monthly payments and happy with the support provided by jobcentre staff in helping them find work or increase their working hours. A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal credit is getting more people into work than the old system. It mirrors the way most people in work are paid, helping to ease the transition into employment. “The majority of claimants are comfortable managing their budgets, and for people who need extra support, advance payments are available.” However, the evaluation found the experience of universal credit was much less positive for low-income families, workers with irregular work patterns, lone parents, claimants with a disability or long-term illness, and people who had difficulty accessing or using the internet. The government study confirmed Citizens Advice research published this week that found universal credit could push claimants into serious debt. The charity’s chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: “It is clearer than ever that the government must pause the roll-out of universal credit and fix the problems with this benefit.” Universal credit was introduced in 2013 to simplify the social security system by rolling six main benefits into one. However, management failings and IT problems have left it years behind schedule, while budget cuts mean millions of working families moving on to the benefit will be worse off. New universal credit claimants wait a minimum of 42 days for a first payment. This comprises a seven day “waiting period” before a claim can be made, a one-month assessment period to determine how much the claimant should be paid, and a further week for the payment to go through. In practice, however, charities say many claimants wait even longer for a first payment. People on low incomes often have few or no savings to tide them over during the waiting period, forcing them to turn to debt and food banks. The DWP has stood by the 42-day wait, arguing that it is needed to get claimants on to a monthly payment schedule, and newly unemployed claimants should expect to have one month’s salary to fall back on. However, charities say one in four workers are not paid monthly, meaning they have to survive for at least six weeks on two weeks’ pay. Earlier this year, the Trussell Trust reported that food bank referral rates were running at more than double the national average in areas where universal credit had been rolled out. The trust said benefit delays led to debt, mental illness, rent arrears and eviction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/15/nikon-photography-camera-women","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T15:49:09Z","webTitle":"One PR campaign, 32 photographers, no women.

The Japanese camera giant chose 32 professional photographers across Asia and Africa to test-drive and promote its new camera, the D850. Of the 32 photographers chosen, Nikon managed to pick zero women. What is so obvious to me – a professional photographer – as well as colleagues, photography bloggers and social media users, was not obvious to Nikon. Instead, it seemed to have worked on the campaign, from the concept stage through to development, marketing and public relations, without a thought for its female clients. A photograph – as Nikon should know – speaks a thousand words. The image Nikon used to promote its new camera shows that companies still don’t value women in photography, and that professional photography remains a boys’ club. As one photography blog snarked: was the camera made specifically for men? Based on its research, is Nikon saying only men are buying cameras? Or that the market for women is so insignificant Nikon has chosen to overlook them? If that’s the case, the problem is even greater than Nikon’s omission. Photography is a reflection of our society – and if one group of people controls the narrative, millions of stories will go untold. Female photographers in Asia or Africa, for example, are uniquely positioned to shine a light on women who have no voice or power. When I’ve worked on important and sensitive stories about the plight of women in Asia, I’ve only been able to gain access because I’m a woman. Here’s just one example from an assignment in Pakistan: Paula Bronstein’s entire body of work – including her portraits of victims of acid violence – or Smita Sharma’s work on rape victims in India perfectly illustrate this argument. I could name dozens more. In response to the backlash, Nikon responded, weakly: “Unfortunately, the female photographers we had invited for this meet were unable to attend, and we acknowledge we have not put enough of a focus in this area.” Women made up just 11% of Nikon’s workforce this year. Nikon, perhaps I can help. As vice-president of the Women Photojournalists of Washington, a non-profit created to promote the role of women in photojournalism, foster their professional success, and mentor emerging photographers, our mission is, sadly, critical. You know this already: you give us generous funds to support our mission. With over 400 members in the DC area, our members include renowned war photographers, Pulitzer prize winners, political photographers, and video journalists covering the biggest news stories around the globe.

The president’s growing willingness to work with his opponents has sown confusion, threatened to upend the balance of power and provoked a rare backlash from elements of his populist base. Trump’s remarks on immigration unfolded in characteristically haphazard fashion, with a series of tweets and off-the-cuff remarks to reporters as he flew from Washington to Florida to visit those affected by Hurricane Irma. Seeming to confirm the framework of the agreement described by senior Democrats on Wednesday night, the president said: “We’re working on a plan for Daca” – Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – which he cancelled last week. The deal would include “massive border security”, Trump added. “Daca now and the wall very soon, but the wall will happen.” Construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border was a central tenet of his election campaign, but the president has made little progress toward making it a reality. After his return from Florida, Trump told reporters the wall would be a part of negotiations with Democrats. “If the Democrats aren’t going to approve it then we’re not going to do what they want,” he said. Asked in the morning if he favored amnesty for the 690,000 young undocumented migrants with Daca status, which protects against deportation and gives access to work permits, Trump shouted back: “The word is Daca.” Later, on Air Force One, the White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters rejected the idea Trump was calling for amnesty for the so-called Dreamers. “As we have said in the past, there will be no amnesty,” Walters said. “Absolutely by no means will this White House discuss amnesty and the president has made it clear how he feels about no amnesty.” After landing in Florida, Trump said: “We’re not looking at citizenship. We’re not looking at amnesty. We’re looking at allowing people to stay here.” The twists and turns began when the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, dined on Chinese food and chocolate pie with Trump at the White House on Wednesday night. The pair said they reached an agreement that included increased border security, but excluded additions to the border wall between the US and Mexico. In four tweets on Thursday morning, Trump echoed details of the agreement he was reported to have reached but denied it had been finalized. “No deal was made last night,” he wrote, before explaining why Dreamers should be protected and referencing increased border security. In a joint statement on Thursday morning, Schumer and Pelosi said Trump’s tweets were “not inconsistent with the agreement reached last night”. “We agreed that the president would support enshrining Daca protections into law and encourage the House and Senate to act,” they said. “What remains to be negotiated are the details of border security, with a mutual goal of finalizing all details as soon as possible. While both sides agreed that the wall would not be any part of this agreement, the president made clear he intends to pursue it at a later time, and we made clear we would continue to oppose it.” They added that possible border security proposals discussed included “new technology, drones, air support, sensor equipment, rebuilding roads along the border and the bipartisan McCaul-Thompson bill”, an immigration measure. Speaking later at a weekly Capitol Hill press conference, Pelosi said “amnesty” was not discussed. She also reiterated that the president had agreed to use the bipartisan Dream Act as a legislative framework. “We’re not having two different kinds of people live here,” Pelosi said. “It’s not even second-class citizenship because it isn’t citizenship.” Earlier Trump said he had spoken to the congressional Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell about the proposals, and they were both “on board”. Ryan and McConnell – who were frozen out just last week when Pelosi and Schumer brokered a deal on the debt ceiling and disaster relief – seemed less certain. At his weekly press conference, Ryan, the House speaker, said: “The president wasn’t negotiating a deal last night. The president was talking with Democratic leaders to get their perspectives.” He insisted: “There is no agreement. I think the president understands that he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution.” In a statement, McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he looked forward to receiving “the Trump administration’s legislative proposal”. “As Congress debates the best ways to address illegal immigration through strong border security and interior enforcement, Daca should be part of those discussions,” he said. There is broad public support for action to protect Dreamers. In a Politico-Morning Consult poll last week, 54% said Congress should pass legislation that allows Daca recipients to stay and be granted a path to citizenship. However, on Thursday, the hard-right Breitbart website, run by Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, ran the headline “Amnesty Don”. The conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeted: “At this point, who DOESN’T want Trump impeached?” The Iowa Republican Steve King, one of the most vocal opponents in Congress of immigration reform, told CNN the president was going back on “a straight-up promise all the way through his campaign”. “What it means is that the base will leave him,” he said. Democratic leaders held the line against a border wall. “We’re for sensible border security,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “There are a lot more effective ways for securing the border than a wall. It’s a medieval solution for a modern problem – a Game of Thrones idea for a world that is a lot closer to Star Wars.” It was Trump who extended Wednesday night’s invitation to Schumer and Pelosi, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Assuming all Democrats in the House were in favor of any Daca deal, a bill would still require the support of 121 Republicans – half the Republican conference. A coalition of Latino organisations went ahead with a small march and rally outside the White House on Thursday and were skeptical about claims of a deal. Juan Cartagena, president and general counsel of Latino Justice, said: “Like my people, I’ve lost any confidence in what Trump says. It goes in different directions. I think at the end of the day he’s trying to make deals because his popularity is so low he has to show some effectuality.” Jessica González-Rojas, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, said: “We are optimistic there are conversations happening but we will continue to fight for a clean Daca without any compromises over deepened border security or a wall. “We understand there are some compromises on the table – we’re not going to stand for it. We are going to hold our democratically elected representatives accountable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/14/nicola-adams-las-vegas-debut-alexandra-vlaik-golovkin","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T21:30:15Z","webTitle":"Nicola Adams in jackpot mode as she prepares for Las Vegas debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/14/nicola-adams-las-vegas-debut-alexandra-vlaik-golovkin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/14/nicola-adams-las-vegas-debut-alexandra-vlaik-golovkin","fields":{"headline":"Nicola Adams in jackpot mode as she prepares for Las Vegas debut","bodyText":"Professional boxing is not a business that encourages much levity, but Nicola Adams is so unrelentingly content and smilingly happy that it is tempting to wonder if she realises what she has got herself into. Adams, the double Olympic gold medallist, makes her Las Vegas debut on Saturday night on the undercard of Gennady Golovkin’s showdown with Saul Álvarez, and she is taking the assignment seriously. Yet in the lead-up to only her third paid fight at 33 – at super-fly against the seasoned 17-fight Hungarian Alexandra Vlajk – she talks with relish of knocking her opponent out, of putting on a show and giving the fans what they have paid to watch, excitement. As we chat in the MGM Grand, a short ride from the venue on Saturday night, the T-Mobile Arena, she remains endearingly overjoyed about her circumstances. “Wow,” she says as she looks at the serried ranks of fight writers, and the big screens at either end of the large hall. But she is very much still inside the hermetically sealed bubble. She has not even been outside the hotel since arriving midweek. Hers will be a four-rounder, way down the bill, but that is of little concern to Adams. She admits she has not watched film of her opponent and the first time she will set eyes on her will be at the weigh-in on Friday. But her only concern was getting on the bill in the fight capital of the world. “Frank [Warren, her promoter, whose BoxNation will show the whole programme] said there was the opportunity to box on the undercard of Canelo-GGG and I was like, ‘Hell yeah! Definitely.’” She speaks in many exclamation marks, excited by every new opportunity. So far as a pro, she has looked relaxed in two straightforward wins, the last one a stoppage. “It would be really special to headline in Vegas one day. Just to be on the undercard of this fight, the best fight of the year as far as I’m concerned, two of the biggest fighters coming together and it’s all on the line: I can’t even put into words just how happy I am.” So, will she be able to quell her ecstatic mien for a while on Saturday night and find her inner fighting beast? She has no doubts. “I’ve got it in me. I have to bring it out of me now. In the pro game it is about entertaining the crowd. The crowd loves the knockouts so I would love to be able to give them that. In the ring, it’s game face, pretty much as soon as I get in the ring. The bell goes and that’s it, I just want to win. You have to go for the finish. That’s something I am going to have to do. “I have been boxing for so long now. All the way through the amateurs you get to know what you are capable of, what your strengths are, what your weaknesses are, and I feel a lot more rounded fighter now. Especially going through two Olympic cycles, I know what it is like to be at the top, stay at the top and having the pressure of being No1 and everybody coming after you. “Learning the pro style and technique is taking quite a long time to really get into the groove and master everything. But I’d like to say I’m not too far from a world title shot. Maybe some time next year. I’d like to box a couple more times this year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/poem-of-the-week-origin-of-the-mimeo-by-siobhan-campbell","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T11:25:56Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: Origin of the Mimeo by Siobhán Campbell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/poem-of-the-week-origin-of-the-mimeo-by-siobhan-campbell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/poem-of-the-week-origin-of-the-mimeo-by-siobhan-campbell","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: Origin of the Mimeo by Siobhán Campbell","bodyText":"Origin of the Mimeo What do guns when they are not in use? In the dead of night they double and divide, naming new owners, finding a new ruse. Carry a gun on stage, it must be fired. Deterrent only lasts until undone. Better they are counted out of mind. List the ways to frame a decommission, a car-park graveyard covered with cement. Which stay on stasis is sufficient? Marking each as put beyond use. Keeping their provenance as you would art. Rocking the replicas back to their false start. It’s got to be efficient. A suggestive metaphor from thermal imaging technology provides the title of Siobhán Campbell’s new collection, Heat Signature, and sustains its resonance in this week’s poem. The invention of the mimeograph, an early copying machine, dates back to the 19th century. It was supplanted by the photocopier some time ago. But the reader doesn’t need to remember the mimeograph to get the reference, since imitation (as in mime) is spelled out in the word itself, and emphasised in its implied cohabitation with “original”. The double summoning of the past, including the recent past, is surely apt. Campbell’s larger focus is the contemporary “matter of Ireland”. Unusually, there’s little sense of a north-south border, or at least one that can’t be freely trampled. The Dublin-born Campbell seems comfortable with the uncomfortable, a native not of the south or north but of the problematic, including the peace process and its vicissitudes. This poem challenges assumptions about the value of de-commissioning. Replication undermines the pledge to put a weapon “beyond use” (line 10 quotes the formula) and mocks the burial: the dead weapon in its “car-park graveyard” proliferates. These guns are not only undead: they “double and divide”. Terseness predominates in Campbell’s syntax as the phrasing of the opening questions signals. Not: “What do guns do when they’re not in use?” but “What do guns when they’re not in use?” This usage heightens the notion of the guns’ sparky animation. The weapon has a sinister life of its own, and can find its own combatants and reasons for use. The rhyming of “use” and “ruse” is eloquent. The second stanza introduces Chekhov’s famous dictum about theatrical guns and broadens the poem’s frame of reference. Campbell herself, in her thesis “From There to Here”: writing out of a time of violence, reads Origin of the Mimeo as a poem about poetry. Chekhov’s rule highlights the contract of author and auditor, and could apply to any significant object, and to other literary genres than drama. The rule might be extended to embarrass the concept of the weapon as a deterrent: if it exists, it will be used. But Campbell is interested in the question at the level of this specific poem: having introduced the gun on to the stage of the poem, is she obliged to fire it? Campbell’s lines are mostly in trochaic pentameter; they have a terse orderliness but are never leisurely. Her single-sentence, single-line statements are perhaps meant to be verbal gunshots. Or perhaps it’s the curtailed last line that fires the gun. In stanza two, the moral clincher of the third line plays on the verb in apposition, “counted out” and its transformation into “counted out of mind”. Previously, the italics of deterrent remind us of a word claiming too much for itself. In the third stanza the idea of the list is raised and mocked by the image of “ a car-park graveyard covered with cement”. There are too many ways to “frame a decommission”, beginning with the interpretation of “frame”, no doubt. The phrase has an odd echo of Elizabeth Barratt Browning counting the ways of love, possibly hinting at Campbell’s resistance to lyric sentimentality. Lyrical grace may be suspect, the terza rima casually plaited, but there’s an energy in the language, buried metaphors, gleams of wordplay that are more than mere lace (“stay on stasis”, “rocking the replicas back to their false start”). The latter is particularly interesting. Campbell points out the Yeats connection with “rocking” in her thesis: presumably it’s primarily The Second Coming which is invoked. Only the decommissioning of the mind will put the gun beyond use. Meanwhile, the very word gun is potent, a disturbing image in three coiled letters. Perhaps the poem itself is mimetic, a small, loaded object with underground connections, its own forms of subterfuge and escape. The thought is often complex. To keep a gun’s provenance “as you would art” suggests the placing of a high value on the original. This may of course be an allusion to historical responsibility. In “rocking the replicas back to their false start”, it’s the term “false start” that suggests the possibility of beginning afresh. The throwaway last line can be read in several ways. It looks back to the earlier lines of the quatrain, that powerful triad of gerunds, which answered the command to “list the ways to frame a decommission”: “Marking each as put beyond use. / Keeping their provenance as you would art. / Rocking the replicas back to their false start.”) And, grammatically, the pronoun “it’s” refers to the “stay on stasis”. There’s a complicating idiomatic twist in the line. “It’s got to be efficient” can mean “it’s sure to be efficient” or “it will need to be efficient”. Then there’s the (attractive) potential for irony – “none of this is at all efficient”. The poem decommissions neither optimism nor pessimism. It’s a finely balanced piece."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/19/fake-netflix-email-scam-bank-details","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Watch out for Netflix email scam that looks like the real deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/19/fake-netflix-email-scam-bank-details","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/19/fake-netflix-email-scam-bank-details","fields":{"headline":"Watch out for Netflix email scam that looks like the real deal","bodyText":"Your readers should be aware of a convincing scam Netflix email that almost caught me out.

Figures for household debt show that since 2012 households have added to their debt mountain and the trajectory puts the ratio of household debt to GDP heading back towards the peak seen in the boom years before the financial crash. In March 2012, total household debt stood at £1,518.5bn in today’s prices compared with £1,630.1bn in March 2017. So in the past five years household debt has increased by an inflation-adjusted rate of 7.3%. It is not a surprise to many analysts that with wages growth adjusted for inflation (and excluding bonuses) crawling ahead by just 0.7% over the same five-year period, consumers are turning to credit to buy essential items. Ultra-low interest rates may have kept the cost of mortgage loans lower than expected by the government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. But there are concerns that borrowing on loans, credit cards, overdrafts and second mortgages has rocketed. Making matters worse, many households have doubled up on their debts by getting into arrears on their monthly bills, especially council tax. Unsecured credit In 2007 unsecured consumer debt – mainly on credit cards, store cards, loans and overdrafts – peaked at 45% of household income. In the years immediately following the financial crash, households were more inclined to kick their credit habit. Saving increased and borrowing declined, as the level of unsecured debt fell to 35% of income by 2012. But since 2012 households have increasingly failed to clear their credit and store card bills at the end of the month. High interest rates on those cards had sent their debts rocketing and the OBR now predicts unsecured household debt will reach 47% of income by 2021. Bank of England figures show unsecured consumer credit jumped 4.9% in the past year when adjusted for inflation. The total increased from £192bn (in today’s money) in July 2016 to £201.5bn in July 2017. This marks a slowdown on the previous two years when growth hit 12% and inflation was almost non-existent, but maintains the trend for UK GDP growth to come almost entirely from an increasing population and consumer spending with borrowed money. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, once predicted that the UK’s economic revival would be built on the foundations of business investment, higher exports and an improvement in productivity that would lead to higher wages. It didn’t materialise. Instead a mix of low wages growth, government cutbacks on welfare and public services, and more recently the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote have forced millions of households to borrow to buy essentials. Car finance Loans linked to car purchases have rocketed in recent years driven by loans in the form of personal contract plans (PCPs). These plans cover the depreciation on a car over three to five years, making them cheap to finance on a monthly basis. Deposits can also be as low as a few hundred pounds. As a result PCPs have grabbed 86% of the new car market, which means more than 1m cars a year are bought with this new style of finance. Another measure of its success is the rise of auto-finance from dealerships - when the funds are provided by car makers - which has more than doubled in the past five years from £14.6bn in 2011, in today’s money, to £31.7bn in new credit issued in 2016. But the industry does not produce figures for the level of total debt on PCP loans. It also fails to publish the level of sub-prime lending to the poorest households. The lack of transparency about the scale of lending in recent years and how much was directed at people who might not be able to keep up their payments in a downturn, has fuelled fears that the rapid growth in specialist car loans is a repeat of the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. PPI was a previously niche product that was widely adopted by the finance industry before leading to a wave of compensation claims from customers. The industry says lending to people with poor credit histories is low and the credit is offered against an asset - the car - which can be repossessed in the event the owner cannot pay, protecting the lender from defaults. Mortgages The government helped to revive the mortgage market after the banking crash with its Help to Buy scheme, which subsidised the deposits of first time buyers. It also backed a Bank of England project to support lenders offering cut-price mortgage rates to buyers and re-mortgagers. Critics of the schemes believe they have encouraged thousands of people who could not afford a mortgage under more normal conditions to take on huge debts. More than 40% of mortgage borrowers have never experienced an increase in interest rates and the fear is that many in this group would be unable to cope. Some might only be able to make repayments with dramatic cutbacks in other spending, but this has knock-on effects for the economy. Others might face repossession or need forebearance by their lender, increasing the lender’s liabilities. A rise in the Bank of England’s 0.25% base rate is now possible before the end of the year after one of Threadneedle Street’s policymakers who is renowned for wanting to keep rates low, Gertjan Vlieghe, said he felt the time was nearing for a hike. Many economists believe the first rate hike could come in November. Students Student debt has soared in recent years following sweeping changes to the way universities are funded. Until 2013, the majority of university funds came from central government. A hike in fees to £9,000 and then £9,250 this year, has shifted the burden to students, who borrow from the Student Loan Company (SLC). The most recent figures to the end of March show outstanding debt on loans jumped by 16.6% to £100.5bn, up from £86.2bn a year earlier. The government expects to write off around 40% of the total, though critics of the scheme expect that figure to rise to 60%. Low wages growth over the next couple of decades, rising taxes to cope with an ageing population and the shift to insecure working practices and the gig economy are likely to make it more difficult for graduates to repay their loans in full. Arrears Council tax arrears have increased 12% in the past five years. Data from the water industry shows that the total level of unpaid bills increased from £1.9bn to £2.2bn in the four years between 2010-11 and 2014-15 (in 2014-15 prices). This is an increase of about 17% over four years. Outstanding debt on electricity and gas bills added another £1.24bn to the arrears total in 2016-17. But there is little clear data to show the extent of rent arrears and arrears on other household essentials, such as broadband services and mobile phone contracts. Citizens Advice said its greatest concern was the rapid rise in arrears as households struggle to maintain payments for basic services. The debt advice charity said many families are unable to make ends meet and arrears were a reflection of this dire situation as much as consumer finance debts. Councils and other government agencies have gained a reputation for taking a harder line with arrears than high street banks, which are more likely to agree a debt management plan to repay debts. they will often write-off at least some of the debt. Councils, though, will employ debt collectors at an earlier stage, racking up bailiff bills and legal costs, which are then added to the arrears. UK: the international perspective A country’s debts have four elements - household debt, corporate debt, government debt and the trade balance, if it is in deficit. The US and the UK are the two G7 countries that have fuelled GDP growth with increasing amounts of consumer debt in recent years. The UK also runs a large trade deficit and operates with a shortfall in government spending. Corporations, on the other hand, have hoarded cash and as a group have the healthiest balance sheets in modern times. Continental European countries have been more circumspect in allowing household debt to increase. Banks in Germany and France have been more reluctant to lend, though partly in response to their own failure to deal with bad debts left overhanging from the 2008 crash. Just to give the full comparison with the UK, Germany has a large trade surplus, a government budget surplus and a bouyant corporate sector with relatively few borrowings Canada has a particular problem with household debts relative to disposable incomes after a property boom that has pushed house prices to record levels. The UK’s trade deficit, which is the largest in the G7, shows that not only are consumers spending more than they earn each year, they are spending it on imports and borrowing from foreigners. In Japan the high level of household debt illustrates a more general reluctance among the population to put up with meagre wage growth. The growth in Japanese consumer spending is higher than wages growth and tax receipts are lower than government spending, leaving household and government debt to rise. This year Japan’s public sector debt to GDP ratio is expected to breach the 250% mark, compared to the UK’s 89% and Germany’s 68%. Japan survives by virtue of its huge trade surplus, which its declining population must work increasingly hard to maintain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/14/flying-us-iphone-x-cheaper-than-buying-europe-illegal-hmrc-vat","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T12:45:32Z","webTitle":"Flying to US to get an iPhone X is cheaper than buying in Europe.

It's also illegal","bodyText":"The price of the new iPhone X is so high in Europe that it’s led thousands to eye-up transatlantic flights to see if it’s cheaper to fly across the pond to buy it. And it is, even with the cost of the flight, but there’s a catch: you would become an international electronics smuggler in doing so. In the UK, the 256GB iPhone X costs £1,149; across the Eurozone it’s even more, €1,319 (£1,186). In the US, meanwhile, it costs just $1,149 (£869.33) – a saving of almost £280. With Iceland’s WOWair offering return flights from London Gatwick to Newark for £278, it looks like you can pay for the cost of travel to New York with the savings on the iPhone. There are some catches: while British and European prices are quoted inclusive of VAT, American prices don’t include sales taxes, which are no higher than 11% but vary by state. In New York, the tax-included price of the iPhone is actually $1,249, thanks to the state’s 8.75% sales tax, though a canny customer could cut the cost back to $1,149 by taking a $40 six-hour return bus trip down to Wilmington, Delaware, one of four states with a 0% sales tax. So if you want to take a budget airline flight to New York with a one-hour layover in Reykjavik, then hop on a coach for six hours, you can experience the joys of a trip almost paid for by the savings made on the most expensive iPhone Apple produces. If you’re in the market for a new MacBook Pro meanwhile, such as the 13in model with 512GB of storage, you could save enough from the difference – almost £400 – to pay for your accommodation and meals too. The downside is doing so is illegal, and doing it the legal way eats up all the savings you make – and then some. HMRC is fairly explicit about what you can and can’t bring into the country from outside the EU. Each passenger has a personal allowance of £390, and any goods worth more than that are landed with applicable import duties and taxes, for the cost of the whole amount. Contrary to popular belief, there’s no exception for personal use, which means that an iPhone bought overseas is legally due a 20% import VAT, pushing the savings to just £40. At least phones and computers are not subject to any import duty. You might not be stopped at the border by customs, but that doesn’t mean what you’re doing is legal; it just means you’re an effective smuggler. There are some cross-border gimmicks that do work. People from the Republic of Ireland save if they head to the UK to buy their phones, and don’t have to pay duty when they bring them back. A similar thing applies for those near the Danish/German border, or, thanks to its low sales tax, any country bordering Luxembourg. If you live in Mexico, the difference in prices from the US is so stark that it’s actually still worth bringing one down south even after you declare the phone at the border and pay import taxes. But for Brits and Europeans hoping for a “free” holiday to the US, you’re out of luck if you want to stay on the right side of the law.

It is in many ways a poisoned chalice: its effects are incredibly complex and capable of causing bitter divides among ministers. It is being negotiated haphazardly and will demoralise the party for years to come. I don’t write this as an embittered “remoaner”. I used to be a hard Brexiteer – I even worked on comunications close to the heart of Vote Leave. But I’ve now converted to a soft Brexit position. My version of our departure from the European Union is largely based around the Flexcit pamphlet, comfortably the most useful and comprehensively researched body of work on Brexit yet produced. As a result I fall into what appears to be a niche category of leave campaigner: I try to be as pragmatic as possible about our departure. What interests me is how keen this government is to be led by a strain of the Tory party intent on a hard Brexit, no matter how damaging. Since the crash in 2008, the Conservatives have fancied themselves as the party of economic strength. They continually assert that Labour can’t be trusted on the economy, which in recent years may have been true, but their mantra will collapse from under their feet if they force Britain out of the single market. They will be exposed and the country punished for their rashness. Some of the rhetoric surrounding the issue is quite staggering. Brussels is not “trying to bully the British people” in negotiations. The EU is a rules-based organisation and thus its negotiators need to uphold the integrity of the single market. They are not able to replicate its trading terms outside of full participation, even for the sake of a smooth transition. David Davis thinks Britain can emulate European Economic Area (EEA) participation without formal membership. This is a fantasy and arrogantly overlooks the legal realities of treaty withdrawal. The result of all this is that I’m likely to vote Labour at the next general election. I have soured against a Tory party that is extremely close to wrecking a political endeavour I will defend until my dying day. You will often hear leavers argue that to stay in the single market would merely be to retain EU membership by stealth, and that support for the EEA is nothing but a cynical remain ploy. Well, I’m arguing we should stay in the single market and I’m as committed to Brexit as I’ve ever been. I don’t want to stay in the EU surreptitiously, which is ironically what the government’s proposed series of transitional arrangements look like. Furthermore, Iceland, a country in the single market, could not be described as an EU member in all but name. It retains sovereignty, an independent trade policy and avoids ever closer union. My change in position is largely due to the fact that I am now more acutely aware of the difficulties posed to our trade by any manner of hard Brexit. A no deal Brexit, which we may end up falling into, eschews negotiations with the EU entirely and will lead to an explosion in customs and documentation checks at external borders. There will be nothing in terms of customs cooperation to plaster over our status as a third country. Paperwork at the border will not suffice and ships and lorries will cram ports and motorways, unable to proceed with goods in transportation. Trade agreements don’t fare too much better. Switzerland has spent years cobbling together more than 100 bilateral deals, sector by sector, and still doesn’t even remotely enjoy the terms of trade that single market participants do. Because the single market is a regulatory union, members benefit from full, free and frictionless trade whereby goods travel unimpeded by bureaucracy. Non-tariff barriers have significance to exporters far beyond the tariffs they would otherwise be forced to pay. Regulatory barriers to trade can rack up extortionate direct and indirect costs. It is here where a hard Brexit poses most risk. But in all this there is opportunity: to switch tack and opt for pursuit of European Free Trade Association membership, as advocated by the Efta president, Carl Baudenbacher. If Labour was to do so, they could highlight the absurd hypocrisy in the Tories claiming to be the party of economic strength whilst they drive us unnervingly towards a cliff edge. It’s a move that would attract huge support in more metropolitan and remain-supporting pockets of the country – precisely the areas Labour will need to appeal to if it is to have a chance of a majority at the next election. Business will also take note, bewildered at the very real prospects of a default no deal or stunted trade flow that a Tory Brexit might cause. The Norway option is Labour’s chance to restore public faith in its capacity to build a strong economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/14/bbc-political-influence-weak-defending-laura-kuenssberg-bodyguard","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T11:50:04Z","webTitle":"The BBC’s political influence is weak.

That’s worth defending","bodyText":"The BBC is often bad at defending itself. As the nation’s crucible, upholding an idea of fair reporting in the turmoil of these bitterly divided times, its journalism comes under ferocious and unjustified attack, so it was good to hear its chairman David Clementi standing up for its journalists at the Royal Television Society convention on Wednesday. He protests at politicians who give their approval for increasingly “explicit and aggressive” abuse directed at BBC journalists. Politicians “stand by and watch”, giving tacit support to hecklers at press conferences trying to intimidate BBC reporters asking tough questions. From right and left, pro- and anti-Brexiteers in the red mist of increasingly ferocious national debate, hard questioning by BBC journalists is taken as proof of bias. The first female political editor, arriving at such a fraught time, was bound to attract most abuse, just as female politicians and journalists of all stripes draw a particularly vicious strand of misogynist hate. How shocking that Laura Kuenssberg has needed a bodyguard. Despite the murder of Jo Cox and death threats against MPs, particularly against women, this sharp and incisive questioner hasn’t buckled. Walking the BBC line of unbiased reporting is becoming harder by the week, as both leave and remain supporters tear apart every word of every story. Nor does being attacked by both sides guarantee that they always get it right. But on Brexit questions of fact versus fantasy, how are BBC journalists supposed to balance reporting on actual bad effects happening now – the tumbling pound, finance HQs moving to EU capitals, Euratom and the medicines agency departing, vanishing EU nurses, imminent chaos at the ports – against vanishingly few putative Brexit benefits? BBC reporters are not obliged to split the difference between flat-Earthers and round-Earthers – or, these days mercifully, between climate deniers and climate change evidence. Making judgments on the likely truth of what they report is part of their job. Mounting abuse of the BBC could in the end destroy it: it only survives on the trust and affection of most citizens. Those on the left joining in the attack, dismissing the BBC as part of an “MSM” plot, fuel the right’s aim to dismantle and privatise it. Murdoch and his press seize every chance to attack it, mainly for commercial reasons. He has always argued for the BBC to lose the licence fee, and to become a small subscription service. Today his bid is referred to the Competition and Markets Authority: if he takes over Sky, he will push next to abolish laws obliging broadcasters to be unbiased, Foxifying our news networks. Where does that leave the BBC? The political animus against the BBC runs through the right of the Tory party, indignant at the very existence of a publicly funded organisation that is phenomenally successful, its every triumph an affront to their anti-public service dogma. At every opportunity, they chip away at it: George Osborne sliced away a third of its funding. Its governance is frequently reinvented, its charter renewal and licence fee rattled as a threat. Successive governments lean on it politically, mainly but not exclusively Tory: Blair blasted it over the Iraq war, while Harold Wilson boycotted it. But usually the bullying comes from the right: recently Liam Fox demanded a meeting to protest that the BBC was putting out anti-Brexit propaganda. As a national beacon, the BBC is first to be attacked for national failings others share – paying its women less, over-paying its managers, or on Wednesday from Ofcom for its “woeful” lack of diversity on and off screen. It has a tough moral duty to be best at everything, so it’s bound to fail sometimes. All polling shows the ardent support the BBC still commands, one of the few unifying icons of national pride, along with the NHS. The envy of the world, its news is trusted as no other. But here’s a perplexing question: if we have this great national broadcaster, why is British political knowledge and understanding so weak? Shouldn’t we have the best-informed democracy? Why has the BBC not had a greater measurable cultural and educational impact? Polls show consistently how little people know about the basic facts on which to make political judgments. But that may demand too much, as if the BBC could correct all the fundamental ills in the society it reports and reflects. Even now a supposedly declining press has a stronger pull on the nation’s psyche than our national broadcaster. The BBC is still a weak voice to rebalance a political landscape grossly distorted by a dominant far-right press for the near-century of the BBC’s existence. That’s all the more reason to defend its journalism against raucous assault in a country more viscerally divided than ever before. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/15/degas-martin-boyce-this-week-best-exhibitions-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T08:30:02Z","webTitle":"Degas and Martin Boyce: this week’s best exhibitions in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/degas-martin-boyce-this-week-best-exhibitions-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/15/degas-martin-boyce-this-week-best-exhibitions-uk","fields":{"headline":"Degas and Martin Boyce: this week’s best exhibitions in the UK","bodyText":"1 Basquiat Jean-Michel Basquiat replaced the jazz improvisations of Jackson Pollock with scrawled, death-haunted messages from the street. This raw style made him a sensation in 1980s New York. His death in 1988 at the age of just 27 only intensified that reputation. Now, with the US plunged into political and social disunion, Basquiat looks like a prophet of the country’s woes. He also looks like a remarkable painter who showed how youth and rebellion can electrify art. At the Barbican, EC2, 21 September to 28 January 2 Degas “Impressionist” is a woefully inadequate description of this artist of obsessive voyeurism, almost frightening observational power and erotic imagination. Degas lived in a solitary world of his own while moving endlessly through the public spaces of Paris, from the ballet to race tracks and circuses. His studies of women sublimate sexual fascination into images of strange poetic intensity. At the National Gallery, WC2, 20 September to 7 May 3 Martin Boyce The reality of modern cities is potently recreated by this 2011 Turner prize-winning Glasgow artist in works that seem abstract yet are full of poignant associations. His installations are like frozen playgrounds where something terrible has happened and the swings are off-limits. He creates melancholic sculptural prisons from decaying public spaces, brutalist shopping centres and dreary parks. At the Modern Institute, Glasgow, 18 September to 4 November 4 Arte Povera For once, the Estorick Collection abandons its obsession with minor futurists and puts on an exhibition that actually matters. The 1960s Italian group Arte Povera was the first art movement to confront environmental crisis. At a time of dramatic urbanisation and economic growth in Italy, artists such as Mario Merz chose natural materials over the plastic world of pop. Here their influence on British artists from Richard Long to Gavin Turk is mapped. At the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art, N1, 20 September to 17 December 5 Nature Morte Mat Collishaw and Gabriel Orozco are among the contemporary artists revisiting the still life tradition here. Ever since eye-fooling bowls of fruit were included in ancient Roman frescoes, the still life’s frozen perfection has represented both life and death. It lends itself remarkably well to conceptual reinventions, including Collishaw’s eerie reconstructions of last meals on Death Row.

Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, has told MPs on the Treasury select committee that publication of information in the report could be a criminal offence under the Financial Services and Marketing Act. In a letter to Nicky Morgan, the conservative MP who chairs the committee, Bailey said publishing the report could also undermine the regulators’ ability to supervise firms because reviews are conducted on the basis that they will remain private. That promise of privacy, he said, meant firms don’t try to withhold information and the watchdog doesn’t have to use its legal powers to force its release. “I am very keen that this situation should continue and that it would not be in the public interest to limit the effectiveness of this process,” Bailey said. The FCA told the bank, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, to commission the report after allegations were made about the way its business restructuring unit – the global restructuring group (GRG) – treated small business customers. Instead of helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. Morgan wrote to Bailey to ask for the report, which was completed last year, to be published after it was leaked to the BBC earlier this month. She said the leak strengthened calls for it to be published in full, rather than just the detailed summary the FCA had previously promised to release. “The report is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. If closure is ever to be brought to this long-running issue, parliament and the public need the account ordered by the regulator … we consider that the public interest in publication in this specific case is overwhelming.” she said. The committee has the power to demand the report, which it could then publish, but it has not resorted to this. RBS attempted to draw a line under the long-running dispute with small businesses last year by putting aside £400m to pay compensation. This has not, however, dimmed the anger of some of the business who have been complaining for years about GRG’s treatment. Bailey and colleagues will be called next month to give evidence to the new committee, which held its first meeting since the general election on Thursday. They will face questions about the GRG report. A leak inquiry is under way and Bailey said the FCA had asked RBS, the consultancy Promontory Financial Group, which was commissioned to do the report and the accountancy firm Mazars which wrote it, to do the same. Bailey said a detailed summary of the report, known as section 116, will be published and that the FCA has appointed outside lawyers to analyse it. Approval from RBS and Promontory is needed to publish. He hopes to avoid Maxwellisation, the process by which individuals named in reports have an opportunity to comment on any criticism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/14/anti-doping-agencies-tell-ioc-ban-russia-2018-winter-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"Anti-doping agencies call on IOC to ban Russia from 2018 Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/14/anti-doping-agencies-tell-ioc-ban-russia-2018-winter-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/14/anti-doping-agencies-tell-ioc-ban-russia-2018-winter-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Anti-doping agencies call on IOC to ban Russia from 2018 Winter Olympics","bodyText":"The world’s leading anti-doping agencies have come together to demand Russia be banned from the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang next year and to warn the International Olympic Committee it must stop paying lip service to the fight against doping. In strongly worded comments after a meeting in Colorado between 17 anti‑doping agencies, which included the US Anti-Doping Agency and UK Anti‑Doping, the organisations also warned the IOC that its continuing reluctance to hold Russia to account for what it called “one of the biggest scandals in sports history” at the Sochi Winter Games in 2014 threatens the future of the Olympic movement. The fact that UK Anti-Doping is one of the voices calling for Russia’s exclusion is particularly significant given that it took charge of testing in Russia in early 2016, and has previously not put its name to statements condemning the country. In a joint statement the national anti-doping leaders said: “The IOC needs to stop kicking the can down the road and immediately issue meaningful consequences. The failure to expeditiously investigate individual Russian athlete doping poses a clear and present danger for clean athletes worldwide and at the 2018 Winter Games. “We have serious doubts that the 2018 Games will be clean due to the incomplete investigation of massive evidence of individual doping by Russian athletes at the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games and given the inadequate testing evidence of Russian athletes over the past four years. A country’s sport leaders and organisations should not be given credentials to the Olympics when they intentionally violate the rules and rob clean athletes.” The national anti-doping organisation leaders also urged Russia to take public responsibility for what it called “its fraudulent actions” detailed in the Richard McLaren report, which claimed that more than 1,000 Russian athletes had benefited from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015. Nado added that Russia need to take a number of other steps to prove it was serious about reforming. Those included “a systematic effort to interview Russian athletes, officials and other witnesses exposed by the McLaren Report as having been potentially involved in the doping conspiracy” as well as turning over electronic data, “including servers, testing instrument data files, computer files, and email and text message archives from the time period of the Russian conspiracy, as outlined in the McLaren report. “The IOC and the World Anti-Doping Agency must insist Russia turn over this key additional evidence,” said the Nado leaders. “A full account and justice for clean athletes cannot be achieved without this information.” Nado’s toughest words came for the IOC, which it said had not done nearly enough to follow up the damning revelations in the McLaren report by banning guilty athletes and officials. “The failure to properly investigate and prosecute free of sport-political influence those who violated anti-doping rules, breaks the trust with millions of clean athletes around the world,” they said. “This dereliction of duty sends a cynical message that those of favoured, insider nations within the Olympic movement will never be punished or held accountable, violating the fundamental covenant of fairness on which sport is based,” the leaders said. During the two-day meeting, the leaders also heard from the Russian whistleblowers Vitaly Stephanov and Yulia Stephanova, as well as Johann Olav Koss of the independent foundation Fair Sport. They did, however, keep open the door for some Russians to compete in South Korea as neutral athletes, provided they have been subject to robust anti-doping protocols, consistent with precedent established by the International Association of Athletics Federations. They were also in no doubt the IOC needed to make a strong statement by banning Russia from the Winter Olympics – especially given this week the New York Times revealed that of 96 cases among athletes implicated in the Russian doping programme, 95 have been closed due to a lack of hard evidence. “Those appear to have been shut prematurely before the IOC or international federations have obtained complete evidence from the Moscow laboratory or interviewed the relevant witnesses” said the Nado leaders. “The mishandling of this Russia doping crisis has left the athletes of the world wondering if global anti-doping regulations have teeth and whether their fundamental right to clean sport matters. “It’s time for action. Athletes want to see results – not more lip service – that actually support their decision to compete clean.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/21/judy-collins-on-stephen-stills-i-said-its-such-a-beautiful-song-but-its-not-winning-me-back","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T14:00:35Z","webTitle":"Judy Collins on Stephen Stills: ‘I said, it's such a beautiful song, but it's not winning me back’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/21/judy-collins-on-stephen-stills-i-said-its-such-a-beautiful-song-but-its-not-winning-me-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/21/judy-collins-on-stephen-stills-i-said-its-such-a-beautiful-song-but-its-not-winning-me-back","fields":{"headline":"Judy Collins on Stephen Stills: ‘I said, it's such a beautiful song, but it's not winning me back’","bodyText":"Nearly five decades ago, Judy Collins and Stephen Stills sparked a romance that was passionate and volatile enough to enter rock’n’roll lore. Their private connection became public after Stills, rejected by Collins, put his pining into classic songs such as Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Helplessly Hoping, both of which turned up on the first Crosby Stills and Nash album in 1969. Three years later, Stills recorded another piece about their relationship, So Begins the Task, which addressed the hard labour of accepting rejection. Collins recorded and released her own version of that song less than 12 months later. Then, in 1975, Collins wrote Houses, which finds her haunting the places Stills resides in without her. That dense knot of history adds delicious context to a current joint tour for the two stars, which recently made a stop at the NYCB Theatre at Westbury on New York’s Long Island. Throughout the night, Collins and Stills meet each other’s eyes with easy empathy, reflecting the sweet kinship they struck and maintained after their romance ended. “The reason we stayed friends all these years is because we married other people,” Stills says from the Westbury stage. “In fact, Stephen married several other people,” Collins adds. This rapport has not only resulted in this tour but in their first joint album, Everybody Knows, whose title cheekily refers to their famous liaison. Both the show and the album feature the same clear subtext: friendship trumps romance. “That’s a good message to send,” Collins says, several days after the Long Island show. “When we started rehearsing for the tour, Stephen said to me: ‘My God, we should have done this instead of the romance.’ And I said: ‘But then you wouldn’t have written Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, so that wouldn’t have worked.” The pair perform part of the song at the show while, on the album, they include compositions that, essentially, recast their entire story. New versions appear of So Begins the Task as well as Houses, along with Sandy Denny’s Who Knows Where the Time Goes. The last number not only speaks to their shared history, it indicates the original “scene of the crime”. The pair met in 1968 when Stills’s band, Buffalo Springfield, had just collapsed and Collins was preparing to record a new solo album, to be titled Who Knows Where the Time Goes. One night at the Whiskey a Go-Go in Los Angeles, Stills spied Collins in the audience and made his move. “I was drinking beer because I couldn’t afford whiskey,” Stills says on stage in Westbury. “I wanted to meet her. I used to listen to her albums before I went to sleep. I went up to her and kissed her hand.” Collins says she “didn’t know Stephen from Adam back then”, even though he had just scored a top 10 hit for Buffalo Springfield with For What It’s Worth. Collins had recently had her own hit, with Joni Mitchell’s Both Sides Now. “I was so deeply involved in my own career, I had no idea of much of what was going on,” she says. Undeterred, Stills lobbied Collins’s producer, David Anderle, to hire him to play on the Who Knows sessions. “For years, I thought it was Anderle who begged him to play,” says Collins. “Only later did I find out it was the other way around.” Once Stills showed up for the recording, things moved fast: “I was smitten. He was awfully good-looking. The relationship began as soon as he came in the band.” Stills helped give Collins a more rocking sound, and brought in a song that became a staple for her, a cover of Ian Tyson’s country-rock ballad Someday Soon. As seamless as the recording process was, the relationship became fraught. “It was fireworks,” says Collins. “It was much too frantic for my speed at the time.” There was also a long-distance issue to navigate. “My centre was in New York and his in LA,” explains Collins. “He hated New York and he hated therapy. And I was in both.” Egos also got in the way. “We both needed to find out where we were going next in our careers. Also, I had just gotten my son back after three or four years of losing custody of him. It was a very intense period.” Back in New York, Collins met the actor Stacy Keach and they wound up living together for the next five years. While Stills wrote about their breakup straight away, Collins’s song about him, Houses, didn’t come out until six years later. He only found out the lyric was about him when Collins chose to include it on the new album. “I don’t think he was listening to my albums as much as I was listening to his back then,” Collins says. “He was very touched by the song when I played it for him. He was [touched] that it was the counterpoint to Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.” Collins recalls the first time Stills came to her hotel room to play her his now-classic song: “Afterwards, we both cried – and then I said: ‘Oh, Stephen, it’s such a beautiful song. But it’s not winning me back.’” She says she didn’t feel exposed by the song’s title. “I’ve always understood that people have to write about their lives,” Collins says. “Most of all, I felt the song was flattering and heartbreaking – for both of us. Neither one of us walked away from that relationship relieved. We were feeling like, ‘Whoa, what happened?’” It wasn’t until years after the relationship evolved into a friendship that yet another song surfaced that addressed their romance. Unbeknown to Collins back in 1968, Stills was spending unused studio time during the Who Knows sessions to record demos of some new songs. During those sessions, he cut his earliest, solo versions of Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Helplessly Hoping and a song called Judy. The demos were lost, however, and did not resurface until 2007, when a studio worker found the tape and returned it to Stills. Rhino issued the recordings as Just Roll Tape, in the process offering a trove for historians and fans. For the new Stills-Collins album, the pair recorded their own version of Judy. Despite the depth of their connection, the new album might never have happened had Crosby, Stills and Nash not come to a fractious impasse over the past two years. Each of the three has said they will never perform together again. However, Collins swats away the notion that she’s a surrogate for Crosby and Nash. “I’m the original girl,” she says. “I was there before any of them.” In the meantime, Collins believes her new music with Stills completes a circle – both for themselves and for the fans. “When people hear us together they’re reminded not only of our story but of their own. People return to their youthful love affairs. It spins out like a double helix with many purposes.” One of them is to provide an object lesson in how to turn passion into camaraderie. “People always say to me, ‘I wish I could find a way to stay friends with people I was intimate with,’” Collins says. “My secret is to always say ‘I love you’ – and always say ‘I’m sorry.’” Everybody Knows by Stephen Stills and Judy Collins is out 22 September in the US, and 2 March 2018 in the UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/im-attracted-to-older-men-and-it-feels-like-a-fetish","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"I’m attracted to older men and it feels like a fetish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/im-attracted-to-older-men-and-it-feels-like-a-fetish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/15/im-attracted-to-older-men-and-it-feels-like-a-fetish","fields":{"headline":"I’m attracted to older men and it feels like a fetish","bodyText":"I am a woman of 30 who is attracted to older men.

The company’s engineers greeted the royals with hors d’oeuvres, craft beer and bottles upon bottles of Columbia Valley rieslings and syrahs. In the corner of the lounge stood a vintage Asteroids arcade game; on the wall hung an American flag alongside the grand duchy’s own red, white and blue stripes. Between the two flags was a prototype of a spacecraft designed to roam the galaxy, prospecting asteroids for precious natural resources that would someday – at least in theory – make the shareholders of Planetary Resources very wealthy earthlings indeed. The nation of Luxembourg is one of Planetary Resources’ main boosters. The country’s pledge of €25m (£22.5m) – which includes both direct funding and state support for research and development – is just one element of its wildly ambitious campaign to become a terrestrial hub for the business of mining minerals, metals and other resources on celestial bodies. The tiny country enriched itself significantly over the past century by greasing the wheels of global finance; now, as companies such as Planetary Resources prepare for a cosmic land grab, Luxembourg wants to use its tiny terrestrial perch to help send capitalism into space. Space exploration has historically been an arena for grand, nationalistic operations that were too costly, dangerous and complex for civilians to take up without state backing. But now, private companies want in, raising questions that, until recently, have seemed like mere thought experiments or hypotheticals: who can lay claim to an asteroid and all of its extractive wealth? Should space benefit “all of humankind”, as the international treaties signed in the 60s intended, or is that idealism outdated? How do you measure those benefits, anyway? Does trickle-down theory apply in zero-gravity conditions? Space is becoming a testing ground for these thorny ethical and legal questions, and Luxembourg – a tiny country that has sustained itself off of regulatory intricacies and tax loopholes for decades – is positioning itself to help find the answers. While major nations such as China and India plough increasing sums of money into developing space programmes to rival Nasa, Luxembourg is making a different bet: that it can become home to a multinational cast of entrepreneurs who want to go into space not for just the sake of scientific progress or to strengthen their nation’s geopolitical hand, but also to make money. It already has a keen clientele. Space entrepreneurs speak of a new “gold rush” and compare their mission to that of the frontiersmen, or the early industrialists. While planet Earth’s limited stock of natural resources is rapidly being depleted, asteroid miners see a solution in the vast quantities of untapped water, minerals and metals in outer space. And the fledgling “NewSpace” industry – an umbrella term for commercial spaceflight, asteroid mining and other private ventures – has found eager supporters in the investor class. In April, Goldman Sachs sent a note to clients claiming that asteroid mining “could be more realistic than perceived”, thanks to the falling cost of launching rockets and the vast quantities of platinum sitting on space rocks, just waiting to be exploited. “[Mining asteroids] is not a new idea, but what’s new is state support of the idea,” says Chris Voorhees, the chief engineer of Planetary Resources. “Everyone thought it was inevitable but they weren’t sure when it would occur.” Now, he says, Luxembourg is “making it happen”. The grand duchy – which has all the square footage of an asteroid and, with a population of half a million, not all that many more inhabitants – has earmarked €200m to fund NewSpace companies that join its new space sector; to date, six have taken it up on the offer. It has sent officials to Japan, China and the UAE to talk about space exploration partnerships, and appointed space industry veterans, including the ex-head of the European Space Agency, to advise them. In May, it took out a glossy supplement in Scientific American magazine to signal it is committed not just to helping businesses, but to advancing research as well. And in July, the parliament passed its law – the first of its kind in Europe, and the most far-reaching in the world – asserting that if a Luxembourgish company launches a spacecraft that obtains water, silver, gold or any other valuable substance on a celestial body, the extracted materials will be considered the company’s legitimate private property by a legitimate sovereign nation. The presence of royalty at Planetary Resources HQ ahead of the passing of the law was a canny part of the country’s space incursion. The young couple was there to dazzle, charm and lend gravitas to the operation – European aristocracy doesn’t show up in suburban office parks any old day – but the mission’s greater aim was to impress upon Silicon Valley executives, the bemused Luxembourgish press and space scientists around the world that mining asteroids was no longer science fiction. To that end, the royals were accompanied by about 40 of their subjects, all of whom had a role to play in this emerging industry. Etienne Schneider, Luxembourg’s congenial deputy prime minister, led the delegation. With his easy manner, excellent English and penchant for fancy cars, he cuts a Macronian figure: a product of European socialist political parties, sure, and a social liberal to his core – Schneider is married to a man – but one who will willingly play handmaiden to global capitalist interests should the right opportunity arise. He announced recently that he would be running for the role of prime minister in 2018. With Schneider came a delegation of scientists, trade attaches, bankers, lawyers and local journalists who switched between German, English, French and the local language, a consonant-heavy mix of Flemish and German with the occasional foreign word thrown in to supplement: “meeting”, “framework”, “brunch”. (“We don’t have all the words,” a member of the delegation told me sheepishly.) In French, the language is known as Luxembourgeois, which pretty much says it all; the duchy’s 500,000 citizens, who have a GDP per capita of $104,000 (£78,800), are the wealthiest in the world after Qatar’s, according to the International Monetary Fund. The Planetary Resources team took their benefactors on a tour of the labs where its hardware is built. The company isn’t mining asteroids yet, but to benefit from Luxembourg’s concessions, it opened an office in the grand duchy this year. Up close, its Arkyd 6 spacecraft – which is ready for launch – looks just like satellites look in the movies, only smaller. It had multiple flaps and appendages, including an infrared sensor, a star tracker to orient the craft in space and a GPS unit, which works only in the earth’s orbit. Once the tour was complete, cocktail hour began. Schneider, who owns a vineyard, bounced from one conversation to another, brimming with enthusiasm. To end the visit, Chris Lewicki, the CEO of the company, gave a toast praising Luxembourg’s contributions “to an abundant future for all of humanity”. As a parting gift, he presented her royal highness with a necklace. Instead of jewels, it was studded with tiny fragments of asteroids. * * * It is reasonable to wonder what, exactly, a marginal European monarchy, egged on by a vivacious gay socialist, was doing telling American entrepreneurs on the cutting edge of innovation that their hamlet-sized state could propel humanity – and capitalism – into deep space. The grand duchy has no national space agency, no launching sites, and only modest research capabilities. It opened its first and only university in 2003 and its military consists of 1,008 troops. Luxembourg does not fit the image of a spacefaring nation; in fact, some have questioned whether it should even be a nation at all. Yet Luxembourg’s very essence – as a speck in the heart of Europe – allows, even requires, it to partake in such ambitious ventures. Its national motto is “We want to remain what we are” and, over the centuries, this independent spirit has endured occupations by the dukes of Burgundy, the kings of Spain and France, the emperors of Austria and the king of the Netherlands. Today, the state, which only gained full independence in 1867, occupies a curious position in the global imagination: a country with an outsized economic influence that everyone has heard of, but that no one can quite locate on a map. According to Gabriel Zucman, assistant professor of economics at UC Berkeley, the country is hard to miss in the financial world. “Luxembourg has private banks like Switzerland, it has a big mutual fund industry like Ireland’s, it’s used for corporate tax avoidance like Bermuda or the Netherlands, and it also hosts one of the two international central depositories for securities, so it’s active in euro bonds,” he says. “It’s the tax haven of tax havens, present at all stages of the financial industry.” Tony Norfield, a former banker in the City of London who now writes on global finance, has described Luxembourg as “a paragon of parasitism”. The story of how a marginal and relatively powerless country has survived world wars, economic crises and cataclysmic technological advances to become a banking and finance powerhouse tells us a lot about how far a small country can go if it devotes itself to anticipating and accommodating the needs of global capital. It’s a contentious business: for every happy shareholder praising Luxembourg’s business-friendly rules and money-saving loopholes, there’s a critic condemning Luxembourg’s willingness to expedite the regulatory “race to the bottom”. Then again, there aren’t many options for a country like Luxembourg besides exploiting its most valuable resource: its national sovereignty. And Luxembourg has done this more and better than any other country in the world. By crafting innovative rules, laws and regulations that only it could (or would) put on offer, Luxembourg has attracted banks, telecommunications companies and consulting firms before any of these industries came to dominate the global economy. Now, by courting asteroid miners before anyone else takes them seriously, it may very well end up doing the same thing for the commercialisation of space. Luxembourg’s first significant attempts at liberalisation began in the late 1920s and early 1930s. As radio grew popular, the grand duchy decided not to create a publicly funded radio service like its neighbours. Instead, it handed its airwaves to a private, commercial broadcasting company. That company – now known as RTL – became the first ad-supported commercial station to broadcast music, culture and entertainment programmes across Europe in multiple languages. “By handing the rights to a public good to a private company, the state commercialised, for the first time, its sovereign rights in a media context,” notes a 2000 book on Luxembourg’s economic history. The title of the book, published by a Luxembourgish bank, is, tellingly, The Fruits of National Sovereignty. Then, just three months before the stock market collapsed in 1929, Luxembourg’s parliament passed legislation exempting holding companies – that is, parent firms that exist solely to own parts of or control other companies – from paying corporation taxes. In the first five years after the law’s passing, 700 holding companies were established; in 1960, there were 1,200, and by the turn of the century, some 15,000 “letterbox” firms – one for every 18 citizens – were incorporated in Luxembourg. (In 2006, the European commission found that this exemption violated EU rules, so Luxembourg promptly created a new designation, the “family estate management company”, that complied with the country’s EU treaty obligations while offering many of the same money-saving advantages.) Throughout the first half of 20th century, Luxembourg’s main industry was steel, but by 1980, that business all but collapsed. Even before its iron ore mines shut down, though, the grand duchy came to represent a discreet but powerful regulatory freedom. A homegrown economic model began to take shape: over the next decades, it would make a name for itself by passing legislation “designed to tempt the world’s hot money,” notes the Tax Justice Network, an anti-tax-evasion advocacy group. The country’s policymakers also realized that less could really be more. According to Georges Schmit, a lifelong civil servant who has played a big role in shaping the country’s economy since he joined the ministry of the economy in 1981, a key component of Luxembourg’s early success was the fact that it did not have its own central bank. The country had been in a monetary union with Belgium since 1921, and didn’t impose reserve requirements on financial firms. This meant banks could lend or spend the money that they would have had to keep on deposit in other jurisdictions. In Schmit’s words, Luxembourg’s biggest draw “wasn’t our doing; it was the lack of our doing anything”. Over the years, the government managed to coax over foreign financial institutions, from complex securitisation vehicles to Islamic banks. And on the consumer level, the state’s low taxes drew Europe’s tax-averse petty bourgeoisie. Starting in the 1960s, “Belgian dentists” and “German butchers” – the prevailing stereotypes cited in the international financial press – began taking daytrips to the grand duchy to deposit money to avoid tax at home. The Luxembourgish state even lowered fuel costs to attract the daytrippers, and in 1981, introduced legally binding bank secrecy comparable to Switzerland’s. In the next century, the dentists would give way to Qatari princes, Chinese princelings and other global members of the global super-rich – or at the very least, their investments. “When a country is small, the rest of the world is big,” says Schmit. “Since independence we needed to find larger economic spaces, be they regional or continental.” By serving as a hub for investors, companies and markets during decades of rapid deregulation and globalisation, Luxembourg turned itself into an indispensable cog in the machinery of international finance. * * * In 2009, Schmit embarked for California to continue his life’s work: finding new ways for his country to attract money, this time as the general consul and trade envoy in Silicon Valley. Since he had joined the ministry of the economy to devise new innovation strategies almost three decades earlier, his country seemed to have defied all odds and made virtues of its apparent weaknesses. Its small size had not prevented it from becoming the largest centre for investment funds in the world after the US. Its tiny population had not deterred multinationals and EU institutions such as the court of justice from basing their headquarters there. It had parlayed its status as a neutral country and founding member of many European organisations into sending three of its politicians – more than any other country – to preside over the European commission. And by marketing its easy access to Europe, an educated workforce, bank secrecy (which it voted to end in 2014 under pressure from other countries and the OECD) and myriad regulatory advantages, the country built an outsized financial sector. Crucially, Luxembourg never seemed to let an opportunity pass it by. Following its support for commercial radio 50 years prior, the country was the first in Europe to privatise satellite television. In 1985, the grand duchy granted a company called Société Européenne des Satellites (SES) the right to broadcast TV directly to viewers’ homes from a satellite positioned in space. “The big innovation is that this was a privatisation of space,” says Schmit, who served for 17 years on the SES board. “All the other operators were owned by governments through international agreements. This was the first commercial company that set out to use space for broadcasting.” When SES grew profitable, Luxembourg’s bet paid off: the tiny country became home to a telecoms giant, and, as an early investor, received a piece of the pie. In the early 2000s, Luxembourg pounced at the chance to court retailers such as Amazon and Apple with tax incentives. There were the perks the state was happy to publicise – the lowest VAT in Europe, for instance – and there were case-by-case deals with large companies that it kept rather quieter. The companies flocked in, but in the aftermath of the financial crisis, with awareness of wealth inequality growing and austerity measures bruising ordinary Europeans across the continent, Luxembourg could only keep these arrangements under wraps for so long. In late 2014, the grand duchy went from relative obscurity to complete infamy when the details of these “tax rulings” – versions of which were also carried out by Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands – were disclosed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Known as the “Lux leaks”, the massive trove of leaked data revealed that, from 2002 to 2010, the country’s tax agency approved a series of confidential deals that allowed AIG, Ikea, Deutsche Bank and more than 300 other large firms to save billions of dollars they might have otherwise owed to other countries. The rulings weren’t necessarily illegal, and they weren’t unique to Luxembourg, but they did cause a scandal, provoking damning reports in the media, protests around Europe and promises for tighter regulation from within the EU. Investigations on both sides of the Atlantic on related matters followed, and lawsuits revealed information on more companies still. (One memorable detail: Amazon’s 28-step tax-restructuring arrangement in Luxembourg was named Project Goldcrest after the country’s national bird.) Around this time, Zucman, a recent Paris School of Economics PhD who studied with Thomas Piketty, began looking into Luxembourg’s role in international tax avoidance and evasion. His focus was not on the multinationals, but on Luxembourg’s thriving fund industry, which through niche regulations and loopholes allowed investors to avoid certain taxes, too. Luxembourg was a well-known financial centre, but the statistics Zucman dug up while researching his book, The Hidden Wealth of Nations, took him aback: in 2015, national data showed $3.5tn worth of shares in Luxembourgish mutual funds were domiciled in the grand duchy, while data from other countries accounted for only two of those trillions. The missing $1.5tn suggested to him that the money – which, he notes, was probably accumulating interest by the day – had no identifiable owner. That meant the countries to whom tax was owed on these ungodly sums were unaware of their existence. Globally, Zucman calculated almost $8tn in financial wealth – which does not include real estate, luxury goods, gold or other commodities – has been stolen from countries and taxpayers in this fashion thanks to “secrecy jurisdictions” such as Luxembourg, the Virgin Islands or Panama working “in symbiosis”. In his book, Zucman described Luxembourg as an “economic colony of the international financial industry” and challenged its right to its greatest asset: its sovereignty. “Imagine an ocean platform where the inhabitants would meet during the day to produce and trade, free of any law or any tax, before being teleported in the evening back home to their families on the mainland,” he wrote, referring to the country’s unusual demographics: 47% of Luxembourg’s 500,000 residents are foreign, and 44% of the workforce commutes in across nation-state lines each day for work. “No one would dream of considering such a place, where 100% of its production is sent abroad, as a nation. “The trade of sovereignty knows no limits,” Zucman continues. “Everything is bought; everything is negotiable. Luxembourg is not the only country that has sold its sovereignty, far from it … but it is the one that has gone the furthest.” * * * Scrutiny of Luxembourg’s tax practices – from the press, the public and the EU – spread at an awkward time. At the end of 2013, the country elected a new prime minister, Xavier Bettel, whose coalition government of democrats, socialists and greens wanted to distance themselves from the economic policies of former prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker and play by the EU’s rules. “Honestly, I am fed up with being accused of being a defender of a tax haven and a hotbed of sin,” Bettel said in a speech to the Luxembourg Bankers’ Association shortly after taking office. “We need to work on our image … we have much changed in the last years, now it is time to make sure that everybody knows.” Etienne Schneider, then economy minister, was part of this effort, too. But instead of being applauded for breaking with the past, from the moment they took power the politicians were constantly reminded of their country’s indiscretions. The new government needed to square the Luxembourgish model of economic development with new political realities. It had to keep looking ahead. Most of all, it wanted to change the conversation. A curious possibility had emerged the previous summer, when Georges Schmit visited Nasa’s Ames research centre in Palo Alto and found himself in conversation with Pete Worden, a former director of the centre. Over coffee, Worden told Schmit about the emerging NewSpace sector and about his dream of finding life on other stars and planets. Schmit sensed Worden would hit it off with Schneider, so he introduced them. At first, asteroid mining struck Schneider as crazy. “I listened to him and wondered what this guy might have smoked this morning; it sounded like complete science fiction,” he recalled. But the more he listened, the more it made sense. Worden persuaded Schneider that “it’s not if it will happen, it’s when it’ll happen. And the countries who’ll be the pioneers will be the ones that’ll get the most out of it later on.” From 2014 to 2016, a series of meetings between the Americans and the Luxembourgeois took place. If they resembled April’s trade mission, they will have involved tedious tours of technology companies, self-aggrandising speeches about how space would bring about Earth’s “third industrial revolution”, and many hours stuck in traffic – but also genuine wonder at what might happen if humankind made space their own. Schneider hung his hopes – and his political future – on the stars. Here was a chance to change the conversation away from taxes and towards space; to establish an industry for Luxembourg’s future; to contribute to science and human knowledge, even. Besides, in such trying times, who didn’t like talking about the wonders of exploring the great unknown? NewSpace companies were certainly eager to work with Luxembourg. They were thirsty for funds and attention, and felt invisible in the US. Luxembourg was a place where they could get meetings with high-level politicians in minutes; where everyone spoke great English; where the bureaucracy was minimal, and the promise of low taxes remained. As one NewSpace executive told me this year: “We just want to work with a government who won’t get in the way.” The only catch was the ambiguity of space law: companies wanted assurances that the fruits of their extraterrestrial labour would be recognised here on Earth. This is not a given. Unlike on Earth, where a country can grant a company a mining concession, or a person can sell the right to exploit their land, no one has an obvious legal claim to what’s outside our atmosphere. In fact, the Outer Space Treaty, signed by 107 countries at the UN in 1967, explicitly prohibits countries from claiming sovereignty over celestial bodies. The question now is: if nobody owns or governs the great unknown, who is to say who gets to own a little piece of it? Since the emergence of the NewSpace sector, individual countries have attempted to lend some clarity to eager entrepreneurs, reasoning that the prospect of private property in space will encourage hard work and innovation. The American Space Act, passed in 2015, is the first “finders, keepers” law that recognises ownership of space resources, but it only does so for companies owned by US citizens. In October 2015, Luxembourg commissioned a study on whether it could fill that legal void. The report, completed in 2016, noted that “while legal uncertainty remains, under the current legal and regulatory framework, space mining activities are (at least) not prohibited” and concluded that Luxembourg should pass legislation that gives miners the right to keep the extraterrestrial bounty they extract. Such a law was drafted shortly after the study’s completion, and on 1 August 2017, it went into effect. Luxembourg’s bill does not discriminate by nationality, or even by the location of a company’s headquarters. In fact, the law indicates the country’s willingness to serve as a sort of flag of convenience for spacecrafts, allowing them to play by one country’s futuristic rules in the absence of universal, binding agreements. Rick Tumlinson, of Deep Space Industries, another space exploration company in which Luxembourg has invested, told me that there was value in Luxembourg’s law because it saw no citizens and no borders: just one blue planet from high above. * * * Six weeks after the trade mission in California, I disembarked from a tiny plane on the runway of Luxembourg City’s airport in a melee of grey suits and black carry-on roller bags. I walked past large wealth-management and equity-fund advertisements into the car park, where I caught the bus into the city centre, passing dozens of huge new building projects, a tramline under construction and two enormous yellow towers that, in the afternoon light, resembled twin gold bars reaching for the sky. Within an hour, I was sitting at a table outside a dive bar opposite the old city’s bathhouse with Lars Schmitz, 29, and Gabrielle Taillefert, 21, two members of a local theatre and art collective called Richtung22 (Direction22). Over the past few years, the group has staged a series of performances lampooning their country’s mercenary modus operandi. Instead of writing their own scripts from scratch, the collective makes dramatic collages almost entirely out of primary documents: laws, press releases, speeches, transcripts from parliament, promotional videos and so on. One of Richtung22’s early works satirised Luxembourg’s nation branding committee, which was set up in March 2013 to promote the country abroad. The play, which was financed in part by the culture ministry, was entitled Lëtzebuerg, du hannerhältegt Stéck Schäiss (Luxembourg, Vicious Pile of Shit). Since then, Schmitz says, state funds for Richtung22’s work have dried up. In his spare time, Schmitz, who is slight of build with cropped blonde hair, works on antifascist and anti-capitalist organising. He has the droll resignation of a leftwing activist operating in a country whose politics are so abstract and so global that grassroots resistance must necessarily come in the form of farce. Richtung22’s latest play savages the country’s efforts to attract the NewSpace industry. Its title is Luxembourg’s Private Space Explorevolutionary Superfancy Asteroid Tailoring. Schmitz sees space mining as a high-tech spin on an age-old scam: selling sovereignty. “The country’s business model is hidden,” he said. “It’s making laws that companies want, and taking a risk on those companies. But the government uses it to say ‘This is how modern we are! This is something new!” Zucman shares Schmitz’s view. “Adapting this strategy to the business of space conquest is what being an offshore financial centre means,” he says. “It’s not diversification. It’s just extending the logic of being a tax haven to new area.” On stage, the entire space enterprise is portrayed as a cynical, money-grubbing, reputation-redeeming debacle dictated by private-sector interests. “We feel bad that our country does this to the world, and no one else here talks about this stuff,” Schmitz told me. He ran off a dozen or so Luxembourgish transgressions, including but not limited to aiding and abetting tax evasion and weaseling its way out of EU banking regulations. In such a small country, it’s hard to be so outspoken against the national interest. “People think we’re traitors,” he said. Was there anything good about his country, I asked. “It’s beautiful,” Schmitz conceded. He was right: Luxembourg is beautiful, and was particularly charming on that balmy May evening. The city rests on two levels; the smaller “low” city’s quaint little streets and sidewalk cafes skim the river, while the “high” city centre is home to a lively main drag with pricey boutiques, fancy chocolate shops and chains such as H&amp;M. Cafes advertise crémant – a local bubbly wine – and local dishes that borrow their richness from the French and their stodginess from the Germans. The next day, I went to meet Marc Baum, an MP from the democratic socialist party déi Lénk (the Left). He handed me a policy paper his party published criticising Schneider’s space-mining proposal: they believe his law is inconsistent with Luxembourg’s outer-space treaty obligations, that it creates opportunities for billionaires to further enrich themselves and could be harmful to the environment. Even worse, it enshrines the notion of “competition instead of cooperation” between states. “It’s infinite capitalism!” Baum exclaimed over a cold beer on a terrace. Baum, as it happened, is an actor, too. When we met, he was preparing to perform Eugène Ionesco’s Rhinoceros, an absurdist play about a town whose protagonists speak exclusively in cliches and end up turning into rhinos on account of their unquestioning conformity. Over the course of the drama, the townspeople justify their decision to “go rhino” by declaring that “humanism is dead, those who follow it are just old sentimentalists”. The play’s sole hero, Berenger, resists succumbing to “rhinoceritis”, but fails to save anyone else: he ends up being the only person in the whole town who does not grow a horn. The analogy between that and Baum’s own predicament seems a little on the nose. He was one of just two politicians who voted against the space law in July. * * * In June, about a month before his signature legislation was passed by the parliament, Schneider and some of his associates flew to New York for yet another sales pitch – this time, for the benefit of venture capitalists on the east coast. His speech focused on the financial aspects of Luxembourg’s space race, and the country’s intention to get in on the ground floor of commercial space exploration. “Under the US Space Act, your capital has to be majority US capital,” he said, referring to US willingness to recognise property rights in space for its citizens. “We don’t really care where the money comes from in our country, as long as the money is clean.” On Schneider’s telling, Luxembourg could do for the space-resource trade what it had done for the eurodollar market, international holding companies and multinationals: provide a safe, reliable base where they could operate in tandem with a keen and cooperative – or, by his detractors’ assessment, pliable and sycophantic – state. Schneider announced that after passing its law, Luxembourg would create its own space agency. This would not be a copy of Nasa, but would instead “focus only on commercial space resources”. He told the audience that Luxembourg would solicit private funding to capitalise NewSpace companies, and seek the advice of venture capitalists to decide what companies to invest in. If asteroid mining does, in fact, take off, Luxembourg will be what Schneider’s friends in Silicon Valley might call an “early adopter”. It’s a gamble, for sure. But it’s difficult to imagine where Luxembourg would be had it not deployed this ingenious development strategy continuously over the past century. The global economy offers few alternatives than to serve it, and rewards its enablers richly. Perhaps a mercenary spirit is what it takes to succeed as a small country in the world – and that “we want to remain what we are” is just Luxembourgeois for the old French saying: plus ça change. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/14/poor-diet-is-a-factor-in-one-in-five-deaths-global-disease-study-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T22:30:17Z","webTitle":"Poor diet is a factor in one in five deaths, global disease study reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/14/poor-diet-is-a-factor-in-one-in-five-deaths-global-disease-study-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/14/poor-diet-is-a-factor-in-one-in-five-deaths-global-disease-study-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Poor diet is a factor in one in five deaths, global disease study reveals","bodyText":"Poor diet is a factor in one in five deaths around the world, according to the most comprehensive study ever carried out on the subject. Millions of people are eating the wrong sorts of food for good health. Eating a diet that is low in whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds and fish oils and high in salt raises the risk of an early death, according to the huge and ongoing study Global Burden of Disease. The study, based at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, compiles data from every country in the world and makes informed estimates where there are gaps. Five papers on life expectancy and the causes and risk factors of death and ill health have been published by the Lancet medical journal. It finds that people are living longer. Life expectancy in 2016 worldwide was 75.3 years for women and 69.8 for men. Japan has the highest life expectancy at 84 years and the Central African Republic has the lowest at just over 50. In the UK, life expectancy for a man born in 2016 is 79, and for a woman 82.9. Diet is the second highest risk factor for early death after smoking. Other high risks are high blood glucose which can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI) which is a measure of obesity, and high total cholesterol. All of these can be related to eating the wrong foods, although there are also other causes. “This is really large,” Dr Christopher Murray, IHME’s director, told the Guardian. “It is amongst the really big problems in the world. It is a cluster that is getting worse.” While obesity gets attention, he was not sure policymakers were as focused on the area of diet and health as they needed to be. “That constellation is a really, really big challenge for health and health systems,” he said. The problem is often seen as the spread of western diets, taking over from traditional foods in the developing world. But it is not that simple, says Murray. “Take fruit. It has lots of health benefits but only very wealthy people eat a lot of fruit, with some exceptions.” Sugary drinks are harmful to health but eating a lot of red meat, the study finds, is not as big a risk to health as failing to eat whole grains. “We need to look really carefully at what are the healthy compounds in diets that provide protection,” he said. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, said the studies show how quickly diet and obesity-related disease is spreading around the world. “I don’t think people realise how quickly the focus is shifting towards non-communicable disease [such as cancer, heart disease and stroke] and diseases that come with development, in particular related to poor diet. The numbers are quite shocking in my view,” he said. The UK tracks childhood obesity through the school measurement programme and has brought in measures to try to tackle it. “But no country in the world has been able to solve the problem and it is a concern that we really need to think about tackling globally,” he said. Today, 72% of deaths are from non-communicable diseases for which obesity and diet are among the risk factors, with ischaemic heart disease as the leading cause worldwide of early deaths, including in the UK. Lung cancer, stroke, lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) and Alzheimer’s are the other main causes in the UK. The success story is children under five. In 2016, for the first time in modern history, fewer than 5 million children under five died in one year – a significant fall compared with 1990, when 11 million died. Increased education for women, less poverty, having fewer children, vaccinations, anti-malaria bed-nets, improved water and sanitation are among the changes in low-income countries that have brought the death rate down, thanks to development aid. People are living longer but spending more years in ill health. Obesity is one of the major reasons. More than a billion people worldwide are living with mental health and substance misuse disorders. Depression features in the top 10 causes of ill health in all but four countries. “Our findings indicate people are living longer and, over the past decade, we identified substantial progress in driving down death rates from some of the world’s most pernicious diseases and conditions, such as under age-five mortality and malaria,” said Murray “Yet, despite this progress, we are facing a triad of trouble holding back many nations and communities – obesity, conflict, and mental illness, including substance use disorders.” In the UK, the concern is particularly about the increase in ill-health that prevents people from working or having a fulfilling life, said Newton. A man in the UK born in 2016 can expect only 69 years in good health and a woman 71 years. “This is yet another reminder that while we’re living longer, much of that extra time is spent in ill-health. It underlines the importance of preventing the conditions that keep people out of work and put their long term health in jeopardy, like musculoskeletal problems, poor hearing and mental ill health. Our priority is to help people, including during the crucial early years of life and in middle age, to give them the best chance of a long and healthy later life,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/14/pentonville-inmate-murdered-in-battle-for-prison-smuggling-route","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T11:47:39Z","webTitle":"Pentonville inmate 'murdered in battle for prison smuggling route'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/14/pentonville-inmate-murdered-in-battle-for-prison-smuggling-route","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/14/pentonville-inmate-murdered-in-battle-for-prison-smuggling-route","fields":{"headline":"Pentonville inmate 'murdered in battle for prison smuggling route'","bodyText":"A 21-year-old inmate was murdered at a north London prison in a battle over control of the wing’s contraband route, a court has heard. Jamal Mahmoud was killed at Pentonville prison on 18 October last year in an attack of such “calculated brutality” that it shocked even hardened prisoners, a prosecutor told an Old Bailey jury on Thursday. Basana Kimbembi, 35, Joshua Ratner, 27, and Robert Butler, 31, are charged with murdering Mahmoud, a new father, to take control of the smuggling route into the wing. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said: “He [Mahmoud] was killed with calculated brutality by a group of men armed with weapons that went to find him and those with him. “That lethal violence was quite deliberate and expected. When it happened, both sides knew that it was going to happen and were prepared to engage in it. In the event, the level of it was shocking, shocking to those who lived in that place.” Harewood said another shocking aspect of the death was that it took place on a wing that was populated with people and overseen 24 hours a day by staff. “The sheer determination of the killers is indicated by the fact that neither the location, the security or the presence of prison staff served to stop it or deter the violence or the weapons used to drive it home,” he said. The lawyer told the court that the defendants armed themselves in advance and went to confront Mahmoud and his associates who were also armed. “They did so to make their point and to succeed in resisting the others and getting control of part of the lucrative contraband route on to that wing of the prison,” he said. “In doing so, they acted together, intending to use the weapons to cause really serious, even lethal harm – to confront.” The defendants have denied murder as well as wounding a second man, Mohammed Ali, with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm. The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"small-business-network/2017/oct/16/theyll-be-around-as-long-as-people-shake-hands-why-business-cards-wont-die","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T06:37:52Z","webTitle":"'They'll be around as long as people shake hands': why business cards won't die","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/oct/16/theyll-be-around-as-long-as-people-shake-hands-why-business-cards-wont-die","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2017/oct/16/theyll-be-around-as-long-as-people-shake-hands-why-business-cards-wont-die","fields":{"headline":"'They'll be around as long as people shake hands': why business cards won't die","bodyText":"Your business card says a lot more about you than you think, as anyone who has watched the scene in American Psycho, where bankers compare their expensively made yet largely indistinguishable cards, will know. While most saw this as the ultimate display of absurd masculine competition on 1980s Wall Street; for one company it was market research. Black Astrum produces diamond-encrusted business cards for a select number of exceedingly wealthy clients. The company’s concept director, Sufian Khawaja, says: “Looking beyond the diamonds, when developing the Signature card, we spent more than six months searching for the perfect material. We tested the material’s scratch resistance, how much it weighed, how it looked and felt in the hand, even how it sounded when it was dropped.” The cards cost between £300 and £1,500 each, depending on the number of diamonds included in the design. Clients include members of the royal family in the Middle East, as well as business people in Europe and China. Khawaja says: “For many of our clients, wealth is no longer a distinguishing factor in the circles in which they move. In an ever-increasing digital world, people still like to leave a lasting impression and our cards allow our clients to do just that.” While Black Astrum supplies a very niche market, business cards still play a role in corporate life, despite the digital revolution. Richard Ellis, chairman of the Original Cottage Company, says he regularly uses them with owners of holiday homes and his financial advisers alike. “It’s got your email address, mobile number, the company you work for. It’s an incredibly cost-effective, simple way of passing over details, without standing there and typing lots of information into your smartphone.” Having this information on a physical object helps trigger the memory of a business acquaintance. Asi Sharabi, chief executive of the children’s book publisher Wonderbly, says: “You can always go back and dig in your box of business card memories, and find some lost gems; or some people that you didn’t really think would come in handy.” Ellis agrees: “If you file it electronically, it’s invisible, you have to go and actively remember who it is and search it out. I don’t remember people’s names necessarily, or the company. I remember I met someone at that exhibition, I’ll have his business card, I’ll remember it when I see it. I wouldn’t remember enough information to go on to my smartphone and search.” The physical nature of business cards also enables creative designs, such as the divorce lawyer’s card designed to be torn evenly in two; or a card for a personal trainer made from stretchy material that requires you to exercise in order to read the text. Ironically, it was the digital revolution that sparked a more creative approach to business cards. In 2006, British company Moo came onto the scene with its graphic, multi-coloured versions, which could carry a different image on every single card thanks to the digital printing press. Last year, Moo printed almost 200m business cards, helping generate revenues of £75m. It has customers in more than 190 countries and employs 500 people across six offices in the UK and US. Toby Hextall, director of product design at Moo, is unsurprisingly bullish about the future of the physical business card, even in the digital age. “Business cards are still such an important part of business networking that I think they will only go out of fashion when people stop shaking hands.” The company recently launched a range of eco-friendly cards made from cotton T-shirts. That is not to say that Moo has ignored the shift to digital. A new range of cards includes near-field communication technology that link directly to a web page or social media channel when tapped with a smartphone. Others are adding augmented reality (AR) tags to cards, so 3D objects emerge from the card when viewed with an app. Staff at AR company Augment have linked 3D images of themselves to their business cards. Coralie Desmarchelier of Augment says that they can be “very handy when you go to a trade show, for example, because you often remember faces but you might not remember names, and obviously it’s fun as well”. She adds: “We use it to showcase what Augment can do and to make it memorable because your business card stands out.” Some of Augment’s clients, meanwhile, link 3D images of products to their cards, or whole folders of images, so customers can go home and see how the products fit in their homes. However, these are just enhancements of the humble business card. There are alternatives that abandon the small, cardboard medium altogether. Back in 2009, digital business-card company Bump let smartphone users share data such as contact cards with one another by tapping their phones together. Five years later, Google bought it and the service was shut down soon after, as the people involved concentrated on Google products. There have been a number of apps since then that billed themselves as a business-card killer. None has broken through to the mainstream. These days, business people looking for a digital option will invariably send an email on the spot to share their details. In China, business people rarely swap cards but instead scan each other’s QR codes, which link directly to their WeChat profiles. WeChat is a ubiquitous social network in China that can be used for everything from booking hotels to transferring money. Sharabi says: “I guess when there is a technology that is so prevalent, that everyone is using, then it’s easy. Outside of that context, I haven’t seen anything that is somehow standardised.” It is this lack of standardisation that has helped keep the physical business card alive and well. Sharabi says: “As far as I can tell, there is no technology or an app that can fully replace business cards. There’s lots of different things, but I think the fact that business cards survived a good 10 years of digital just tells you something about behaviour.” Looking to print your own business cards?

The list now includes more than 25,000 species at risk of extinction and the scientists warn that species, such as the American ashes and five African antelopes, that were thought to be safe, are now disappearing faster than they can be counted. The new red list declares the Christmas Island Pipistrelle bat extinct, but also reports that conservation efforts have improved the prospects for snow leopards and the Rodrigues flying fox from Mauritius. In July, scientists reported that a “biological annihilation” of wildlife in recent decades means a sixth mass extinction in Earth’s history is under way and is more severe than previously feared. Half of all animals on the planet have been lost in the past 40 years, due to the destruction of wild areas, hunting and pollution as the human population grows. “Our activities as humans are pushing species to the brink so fast that it’s impossible for conservationists to assess the declines in real time,” said Inger Andersen, IUCN director general. “Even those species that we thought were abundant and safe – such as antelopes in Africa or ash trees in the US – now face an imminent threat of extinction.” “Conservation action does work, conserving the forests, savannas and other biomes that we depend on for our survival, [but] it is simply not a high-enough funding priority,” she said. “Our planet needs urgent, global action, guided by the red list data, to ensure species’ survival and our own sustainable future.” The six most common ash tree species in North America, representing nine billion trees, have entered the red list for the first time, with five assessed as being in the most at-risk category of critically endangered. They are being destroyed by the fast-spreading emerald ash borer beetle, which arrived in Michigan from Asia in the late 1990s in infested shipping pallets. The beetle has already killed tens of millions of trees and can wipe out a whole forest in six years. Climate change is also helping the alien invader enter new areas that were previously too cold. One of the affected species, the once-plentiful white ash is one of the most valuable timber trees in North America, used for making furniture, baseball bats and hockey sticks. Ash trees are a key member of North American forests, providing habitat and food for birds, squirrels and important pollinators such as butterflies and moths. “Their decline, which is likely to affect over 80% of the trees, will dramatically change the composition of both wild and urban forests,” said Murphy Westwood, member of the IUCN Global Tree Specialist Group who led the assessment. Millions of tiny parasitic wasps were released in 24 US states in May 2016 to try to combat the beetle. In Africa, five species of antelope previously thought to be safe are declining drastically, including the world’s largest antelope, the giant eland. It is now classed as vulnerable, with no more that 14,000 left. “Antelopes have been declining as human populations continue to grow, clearing land for agriculture, unsustainably harvesting bushmeat, expanding their settlements, extracting resources and building new roads,” said David Mallon, from the IUCN Species Survival Commission’s Antelope Specialist Group. While more than 150 new endangered species have been added to the new Red List, the prospects of some have improved. New data on the snow leopard of the high mountains of central Asia has moved it from the endangered to vulnerable category. “To be considered ‘endangered’, there must be fewer than 2,500 mature snow leopards and they must be experiencing a high rate of decline. Both are now considered extremely unlikely, which is the good news,” said Tom McCarthy, from wild cat conservation group Panthera and a member of the IUCN assessment team. “But it does not mean that snow leopards are ‘safe’ or that now is a time to celebrate. The species still faces ‘a high risk of extinction in the wild’ and is likely still declining – just not at the rate previously thought.” The flying fox that lives on the Mauritian island of Rodrigues has also moved categories, from critically endangered to endangered. The improvement follows reforestation programmes and better legal protection and enforcement against hunting. But the pipistrelle bat found only on Australia’s Christmas Island has been declared extinct. Just one was left in August 2009, and it disappeared later that month, with no trace since despite extensive searches. The reasons for extinction are unclear, but may have been a combination of predation by introduced rats and cats and the impacts of supercolonies of invasive yellow crazy ants on the insects the bat ate. Overall the IUCN Red List now contains 87,967 species, of which 25,062 are endangered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2017/sep/15/my-boss-became-my-stalker-personal-assistant","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'Stop stalking me'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/sep/15/my-boss-became-my-stalker-personal-assistant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/sep/15/my-boss-became-my-stalker-personal-assistant","fields":{"headline":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'Stop stalking me'","bodyText":"I should have walked out on my first day. In fact, I should have walked out the moment you looked at me and said “I normally have a no flirting rule in the office, but I can tell that I will not be able to stick to that with you!” I was nineteen, had recently lost one of my parents to cancer – you were in your 60s, a business owner and the person who signed my pay cheque each month. But I needed the job, I wanted the job, and I thought that I could manage you. I was wrong. Within those first six months, you went from telling to me pin my hair, because the way it framed my face was distracting, to visiting me unannounced in my home where you met my cat – and making inappropriate comments afterwards about my “puss”. And yet I stayed, resolutely ignoring your advances, and worrying about disappointing my family, who had recommended me to you. One time you asked me to join you for a “business trip” which ended up being some strange sightseeing holiday. It was only when you insisted on that hour-long walk around the local lake to discuss the details of the trip – where you asked me to lie to your wife about who you were going with – that I realised that I could not carry on, and cancelled the trip. I will never be sure what pushed me over the edge. The time you spent telling me the many ways in which I was more attractive than my flatmate? Or when you cried to me about how you wish you had met me before you met your wife? Anxious to not antagonise the man who could withhold my pay cheque, and to be honest feeling incredibly guilty about whether your inability to behave professionally was my fault (as if a 19-year-old woman is responsible for the conduct of a 60-something man), I came up with an excuse that I had to focus on my studies and said I could no longer work as your assistant. A while afterwards, you contacted me asking me to come back. You said you had hired two other women to do my job, and since the business was expanding, you needed my help. You made a point of mentioning how because of the new staff I would never be alone in the office with you. I agreed, thinking it safe. On my first day back, you suddenly and angrily fired the other staff, leaving us alone again. You did not do anything chauvinistic at first. It was only small remarks, toeing the lines of normal office conduct. A remark about how brilliant I was. How nice my outfit was. Insisting that I had lunch in the office, paid for by the company, but then berating me when I helped myself to food. Your insults became increasing and more frequent. For those last six months, I found myself either crying or vomiting before work. I would arrive late, not because I did not leave on time, but because I had to spend ten minutes trying to persuade myself to get aboard the second bus I had to take to get to the office, knowing that it would inevitably lead me to you. In the end, I stood up to you and left for good. You got your revenge by withholding the money you owed me. At that point, I had no more fight in me, so I decided to just let you have the money. But you never quite gave up. Every couple of years, you telephone my family to ask for my latest telephone number. When they refuse, you ask for my address. When they hang up, you send a Christmas card for me to my parent’s address with a full page detailing what you have been up to lately. What makes you think that you have the right to harass me still? But I did learn something from you. Because of your behaviour, I know how to recognise bad bosses and have stayed clear of them ever since.

Donleavy, who has died aged 91, was much under the influence of James Joyce at the time, and The Ginger Man is a dense book, with a stream-of-consciousness narrative that dips in and out of the first and third persons. But the wit and invention soon take hold. It chronicles the adventures, in love and liquor, of a likable rake, Sebastian Dangerfield (based on Donleavy’s friend Gainor Crist, who read it with great pleasure, never realising he was the model for the hero). A score of publishers in Britain and the US turned down the novel in one or other of its early drafts. The breakthrough came when sections were published in the Manchester Guardian, which described the book as a “comic triumph”. Then Brendan Behan tipped Donleavy off about a small publisher of English-language books in Paris, which had Samuel Beckett on its list, and Donleavy packed off his sheaf of pasted-together pages to Olympia Press, unaware that, although they did indeed publish Beckett, the main thrust of the business was pornography. It is not altogether fair to Olympia’s proprietor, Maurice Girodias, to say that he accepted The Ginger Man because of its Rabelaisian erotic content. Even at the time – the novel was submitted in 1954 and published the following year – The Ginger Man could hardly have been mistaken for a dirty book (unlike, say, Lolita, which Girodias also published). It was the avant garde element in Donleavy that aroused Girodias, but the author himself refused to see it that way. In his 1994 memoir, The History of The Ginger Man, he described his reaction on receiving his first advance copy of the novel and finding a list of pornographic titles advertised on its endpaper: “I smashed my fist upon its green cover format, published as it was in the pseudonymous and pornographic Traveller’s Companion Series, and I declared aloud, ‘If it’s the last thing I ever do, I will avenge this book.’” Which he did, engaging in a legal battle that was finally resolved when Donleavy took over the Olympia Press and wound it up. The Ginger Man was republished in Britain, in a slightly abridged edition, in 1956, but the unexpurgated text would have to wait another seven years until it came out as a Corgi paperback. Donleavy was not a man with whom to pick a fight. He had studied boxing, and The History of The Ginger Man contained many accounts of street brawls, in which Donleavy was invariably the victor. One story involved the novelist Ernest Gébler, the writer Edna O’Brien’s first husband, whom Donleavy apparently rescued from a scrap with seven Irishmen: “It was positively delicious to land hooks, bolos and uppercuts into this pack of persecutors.” Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in the Bronx, James Patrick Donleavy was the son of immigrants from Ireland, Margaret and Patrick Donleavy. His father was apt to say of the home country, “they haven’t got a pot to piss in”, but Donleavy claimed nevertheless that his upbringing instilled “the subtlety of Europe” in him. His mother was from a wealthy background, and Donleavy remained acutely class-conscious throughout his life. A person’s dress, or choice of university, told Donleavy much of what he wanted to know about them. Social mobility is the mainspring of much of his fiction. Donleavy arrived in Dublin to study bacteriology at Trinity College in 1946. His first short story, A Party on Saturday Afternoon, was published in 1950 in the Dublin little magazine Envoy, which also featured Beckett and Behan. He crossed the sea to London a few years later, clutching the early drafts of The Ginger Man, and began to frequent writers’ pubs such as the George in Great Portland Street, popular among BBC journalists from nearby Broadcasting House. One acquaintance from those days recalled Donleavy as a powerful personality in a group that might have included the drama producer John Gibson, the journalist Murray Sayle, and Behan, “quietly dominating the scene, without having to speak much”. The Ginger Man affair left Donleavy with a lifelong fascination for the slow shiftings of the law. Friends of later years who visited the house at Levington Park, near Mullingar, County Westmeath, where he lived from 1972, were apt to be struck by bookshelves bearing few books other than legal tomes. “Writers are brilliant at law,” Donleavy said, “naturals. They use words, and they can take those words and ruin you.” In his memoir, he revealed his method for dealing with a legal adversary: say as little as possible. “Only for the moment am I saying nothing” was his motto. The hero of his highly acclaimed second novel, A Singular Man (1963), who has problems not unlike those of the proprietor of the Olympia Press, receives such a letter on the first page. Donleavy published 13 novels, including The Saddest Summer of Samuel S (1966), The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B (1968) and The Destinies of Darcy Dancer, Gentleman (1977). None achieved the success of The Ginger Man. As his taste in titles suggests, Donleavy tended to rely on formula. One of the charming tricks of The Ginger Man is to have each chapter end with a ditty (“God’s mercy / On the wild / Ginger Man”), but as it was repeated in book after book, it became an affectation. There was something cultish about Donleavy’s reputation. He stood apart from his American contemporaries — John Updike, Philip Roth, Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin. One came to expect variety in the output of those writers, while Donleavy stood by the goose that laid the golden egg. At one stage, he was linked to the Angry Young Men, and even, by association, to the Beats, but in reality he had little in common with either group. Donleavy’s heroes use accent and breeding to get what they want, which is often wealth and women; and when they have those, they use them to take a further step upwards. The comedy of the books comes from the obstacles encountered along the way, but there is usually someone on a lower rung to take a hefty kick at. A certain bitterness at lack of continuing success set in. Donleavy became something of a recluse, and he was not unaware that the writer who does that is in danger of running out of material. There are exceptions (Beckett is one), but Donleavy was not among them. Some of his work is quite thin. A novella published in 1997, The Lady Who Liked Clean Rest Rooms, was snobbish and lascivious. Donleavy took the opportunity to aim a hook, bolo or uppercut into what by then seemed a different “pack of persecutors”, his more successful literary colleagues, “on-the-scene male novelists … merely a bunch of repressed homosexualists using their pricks as pens”. He also hit out at what he saw as pernicious political correctness, especially feminism. He was proud of the fact that the novels featuring his foul-mouthed theatrical impresario Schultz were “very anti-feminist”. He deplored the censorious aspects of feminism, and at public readings could be amusing on the subject, but there was a crustiness about it as well, an out-of-date desire to see women as objects of beauty or else cunning foxes. Donleavy’s writing methods were singular, too. He wrote on separate sheets of paper, sometimes just a few words on each, which were then pasted together to form a screed about 10 metres long. He then made notes and revisions on different sheets, which were pasted on to the first lot, and so on. The draft of a chapter could thus run the entire length of a room. A library at Levington Park was devoted to his manuscripts. In 1968 Donleavy had become an Irish citizen. This was less the product of a romantic longing to re-establish roots, as he candidly admitted, than a purely practical desire to simplify his tax problems. By the end of the 1960s, he was at the height of his financial success. He had three houses in London and one in New York, and other obligations resulting from the failure of his first marriage, to Valerie Heron, with whom he had two children. He wrote a book about Ireland (called, with that bedevilling gimmickry, A Singular Country, 1989) and was proud of his estate in County Westmeath, but he was not greatly interested in the country or its inhabitants. The Ginger Man had been banned in Ireland and continued to be resented for many years afterwards, and Donleavy could not forget the slight. He claimed he was more sought after by Americans for his views on the country than any native, even though he knew little about the place. “I read the Daily Telegraph and I may as well be living in Timbuktu for all the number of times I go outside those gates,” he told one visitor. Levington Park was a peculiar place, grand and run-down at the same time. There was a grand piano in the living room beside piles of tatty cushions and old newspapers. Donleavy kept up a smouldering peat fire as he regaled guests with tales of wily publishers and beautiful women. In later years he employed the services of a housekeeper and secretary. The latter worked in a separate wing of the house and often the two did not see one another for days. When I visited him there in 2004, we drove to Lough Owel, a mile away – all the land was his – and took a walk along the shore. Donleavy was a charming host. I was there to interview him and, having expected to occupy two hours of his time, spent half a day with him. As we drove to a little pub in the hills, he claimed not to have been outside his own gates for two weeks. When he emerged from his solitude, Donleavy had the power to seduce an audience. He read his work – sometimes without relying on a text – with precise amounts of intimacy and aloofness, wrapped around with mischievous humour. His fondness for correctness and proper manners led him to write a witty, self-mocking book on the subject, The Unexpurgated Code (1975). He was also an enthusiastic painter. He exhibited and reckoned he had sold hundreds of pictures. Although he claimed that his personal favourite among his novels was A Singular Man, there is no doubting his gratitude to The Ginger Man. It sold many millions of copies (the Irish Times estimates 50m), and was made into a successful play in 1959, staged in the West End of London and in Dublin, with Richard Harris in the title role, but while the film rights were optioned many times (most recently for a version starring Johnny Depp), plans came to nothing. Donleavy could never be described as a one-book writer, but certain of his later books – Are You Listening, Rabbi Löw (1987), for example, and De Alfonce Tennis (1984) – will be unfamiliar to many readers, even by name. The author had the final say in the long battle with the Olympia Press, but perhaps the wily French publisher’s comment should be added as a postscript (and as a warning to any writer tempted to get involved in litigation): “You may wonder,” Girodias said, “why Donleavy never turned out to be the writer everyone expected him to be when he wrote The Ginger Man. The reason is simple. He spent his life in legal action with me.” After the end of his marriage to Valerie, Donleavy married Mary Wilson Price, from whom he later separated. He is survived by his son, Philip, and daughter, Karen, from his first marriage, and by his sister, Mary Rita. • James Patrick Donleavy, writer, born 23 April 1926; died 11 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/14/talking-horses-best-bets-for-day-two-of-doncasters-st-leger-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T10:02:03Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: best bets for day two of Doncaster’s St Leger meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/14/talking-horses-best-bets-for-day-two-of-doncasters-st-leger-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/14/talking-horses-best-bets-for-day-two-of-doncasters-st-leger-meeting","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: best bets for day two of Doncaster’s St Leger meeting","bodyText":"After an opening day that does not really cut it as a “Festival” card, the serious action gets under way at Doncaster this afternoon with two Group Two races, the TV cameras in attendance for Thursday’s action for the first time in a while and, quite possibly, a live runner at a big price in one of the feature events. There are eight runners in the May Hill Stakes, which is ideal for each-way purposes, and while Nyaleti, Billesdon Brook and Laurens all have solid Group-race form, the claims of 16-1 chance She Believes (2.25) might just have been overlooked. Sylvester Kirk’s filly has been running in nurseries and has plenty to find on bare ratings but she has improved with every race so far and took another big step forward when successful at Goodwood last time out, finishing six lengths clear and recording a good time. If her progress continues at anything like the same rate, she is a big price to make the frame, at least. Renfrew Street (4.35) could also be overpriced in the last race on the card. What A Home is certain to start favourite for William Haggas after getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Chester in late July. She has plenty of scope for improvement, but also looks very short on her bare form to date while Renfrew Street put up a career-best performance at Chelmsford last time out. At around 11-2, Mark Johnston’s runner is the obvious bet to beat the even-money favourite. Natural Scenery (3.00) and Clubbable (1.50) should also go very close on the Doncaster card, while at Chepstow, Glory Of Paris (3.55) also catches the eye at a decent price. He was only fifth of seven at Salisbury last time out but the form may be better than it looks as three of the horses in front of him are winners since. C’Est No Mour (3.10) should follow up his recent win when he returns to Epsom for the annual Jump Jockeys’ Derby Handicap, while Ed Vaughan has chosen Epsom’s 10-furlong handicap (from three entries this week) for the lightly-raced Swaffham Bulbeck (3.45) to make his handicap debut and the hint may be worth taking.

Skrein quit the reboot of the comic-book adaptation earlier this month after his casting as Major Ben Daimio, a character who was drawn as Japanese American in the original comics, prompted accusations of whitewashing. In a statement the actor said he was stepping aside “so the role can be cast appropriately”. It has since been announced that Korean American actor Kim, best known for his appearances in Lost and Hawaii Five-0, will replace Skrein in the role. In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, the actor confirmed that he would be playing Daimio and praised Skrein for handling his departure so “elegantly”. “I’m excited to confirm that I’ve officially joined the cast of Hellboy. Thank you for all the supportive tweets and comments, especially in light of the recent events surrounding its original casting,” he said. “I applaud the producers and, in particular, Ed Skrein for championing the notion that Asian characters should be played by Asian or Asian American actors. He could not have addressed the issue more elegantly and I remain indebted to him for his strength of character.” Skrein has received widespread praise for his original statement, in which the actor said that it was important to “honour and respect” ethnic minority voices. “It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voices in the arts,” he wrote. “Representation of ethnic diversity is important, especially to me, as I have a mixed heritage family. It is our responsibility to make moral decisions in difficult times and to give voice to inclusivity. It is my hope that one day these discussions will become less necessary and that we can help make equal representation in the arts a reality.” Skrein’s departure from Hellboy comes at a time when the issue of whitewashing in Hollywood is in the spotlight, following a number of controversial casting decisions, such as the casting of Scarlett Johansson in the US remake of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell, and Tilda Swinton’s appearance as Tibetan character The Ancient One in Marvel superhero movie Doctor Strange. Stranger Things actor David Harbour will star in the forthcoming Hellboy reboot, which will be directed by The Descent film-maker Neil Marshall. The film marks the third appearance of the demonic superhero on the big screen, following a pair of Guillermo del Toro-directed films that starred actor Ron Perlman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/14/nasas-cassini-spacecraft-poised-to-begin-mission-ending-dive-into-saturn","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T13:56:48Z","webTitle":"Nasa's Cassini spacecraft poised to begin mission-ending dive into Saturn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/14/nasas-cassini-spacecraft-poised-to-begin-mission-ending-dive-into-saturn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/14/nasas-cassini-spacecraft-poised-to-begin-mission-ending-dive-into-saturn","fields":{"headline":"Nasa's Cassini spacecraft poised to begin mission-ending dive into Saturn","bodyText":"After one last look at Saturn and its moons, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft will call time on its 20-year mission on Friday when it dives headlong into the giant planet and burns up in the atmosphere. And so a man-made meteor will streak across Saturn’s sky soon after 11.30 am UK time, though confirmation of the spacecraft’s demise more than a billion kilometres away, and on the wrong side of the asteroid belt, will not reach Earth for another 83 minutes, when the signals beamed home from the probe fall silent. The moment will mark the end of an eight billion kilometre journey that began at Cape Canaveral in Florida in 1997 and took Cassini around Venus and Jupiter en route to its destination. There it circled Saturn nearly 300 times and made observations that transformed scientists’ understanding of the most distant planet visible to the unaided eye. For its swansong, the spacecraft will gather data on Saturn’s clouds as it hurtles towards them at 112,000 km/h. At that speed, even in the wispy vapours 1,500km above Saturn’s cloud tops, Cassini’s thrusters will struggle to keep its antenna pointed towards Earth. When they can no longer hold the spacecraft steady, it will start to tumble, communication will be lost, and the probe will burn to a cinder. At Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California, scientists and engineers, some of whom have been on the mission since its conception in the 1980s, will gather in the early hours of Friday morning to witness Cassini’s final moments before joining other missions, perhaps to Jupiter or Mars. “It’s going to be tough to say goodbye, but I’m very proud of all Cassini has accomplished and to have been part of the mission from the very beginning, ” said Linda Spilker, project scientist at JPL, who began work on Cassini in the 1980s. “It’ll be a mixture of sadness and pride and joy at having worked on the mission and saying goodbye to my Cassini family.” Some offices have already emptied as staff found posts on Nasa’s Juno mission around Jupiter, the agency’s Mars 2020 rover or the Europa clipper, which aims to find out whether the Jovian moon is habitable. Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004 and spent 13 years observing the planet with a suite of instruments. It is now known to have millions of rings, thought to be the remnants of a moon that strayed too close and was torn apart by Saturn’s immense gravitational field. Stunning pictures captured Saturn’s weather, a once-in-30-years storm that engulfed the globe, and the changing of its seasons. Over the mission, the northern hemisphere shifted from a bluish hue to the more familiar golden tones as the shadows cast by Saturn’s rings moved south. But this was a rarity in space adventures: a mission to a planet where the moons were the stars. Carried onboard Cassini was a European lander, named Huygens, which set down on Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. It was the first ever touchdown on an alien world beyond the asteroid belt. On Titan, bright and feathery methane clouds float in the sky and dump rain on the surface, at times producing terrific floods. Hydrocarbon rivers carve canyons on the ground and feed three hydrocarbon seas and hundreds of lakes. And then there is Enceladus, a Saturnian moon a mere 500km wide. From 23 flybys, Cassini made the extraordinary discovery that beneath its icy surface, Enceladus harbours a global ocean of liquid water bearing salts and simple organics that spray into space from its southern pole. Hydrothermal vents are thought to warm the hidden ocean’s floor. On Earth, such vents are havens for life. It is Titan, Enceladus and other Saturnian moons, including Mimas, whose giant circular pit makes it look worryingly like Star Wars’s Death Star, that sealed Cassini’s fate. Fearful that the spacecraft might crash-land and contaminate one of the pristine moons, mission controllers set Cassini on a collision course with the planet itself. Saturn is an enormous ball of gas with no discernible surface, and when Cassini plunges in the probe will become a fireball. Any tiny fragments that survive the inferno will sink, melt, and ultimately become diluted in the planet’s interior. Funded with £3bn ($3.9bn) from Nasa, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency, the mission honours Giovanni Cassini, the 17th century Italian astronomer who spotted four of Saturn’s moons, and Christiaan Huygens, his Dutch contemporary who discovered Titan and was first to propose that Saturn had rings. It has already produced 3,948 research papers, but scientists will ponder the data for years to come. In recent weeks, Cassini has beamed back information on Saturn’s enigmatic rings that could answer fundamental questions about their make-up. One question the probe may answer on its death plunge is how old the rings are. “I can’t wait to dive into the incredible ring data,” said Spilker. “What would it look like if I could hold a ring particle in my hand? Would it look like a fluffy snowball or an icy shard?” Cassini found fluffy lumps of material the size of mountains in two of Saturn’s rings. The huge outer “E” ring forms from the icy plumes that spray from the unexpectedly active Enceladus. Spilker is part of a Nasa team that proposes to go back to Enceladus to look for signs of life. One idea is to fly through the salty plumes and capture material in case stray microbes are blasted out with it. “Cassini didn’t have the instruments to make the measurements, to see if there might be organisms coming out with that briny spray,” she said. “I’d love to answer that question in my lifetime. Does the ocean of Enceladus have evidence of life?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/15/north-korea-latest-missile-test-south-talk-engagement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T10:21:59Z","webTitle":"Latest North Korea missile test ends South's talk of engagement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/15/north-korea-latest-missile-test-south-talk-engagement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/15/north-korea-latest-missile-test-south-talk-engagement","fields":{"headline":"Latest North Korea missile test ends South's talk of engagement","bodyText":"North Korea’s latest missile launch may be the latest in a long line, and widely predicted, but familiarity is not reassuring. The 2,300-mile (3,700km) flight of the missile – further than any missile tested by the regime – over Japan only serves to sharpen the policy choices facing the rest of the world. The most immediate diplomatic impact, apart from another call for an emergency meeting of the UN security council, is that Pyongyang’s decision has put paid to South Korea’s lingering interest in reviving talks with its northern neighbours. “Dialogue is impossible in a situation like this,” the president, Moon Jae-in, told his national security council. Moon, elected on a policy of engagement with his northern neighbours, warned the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that “we have the power to destroy North Korea and make it unable to recover”. He promised to closely analyse and prepare for new possible North Korean threats, like EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) and biochemical attacks. The evolution in his stance will be welcome in Japan, America and London. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, speaking before the latest missile launch, had pointedly said at a joint press conference in London with Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, on Thursday that “now was not the time to send other hares running about attempts at engagement”. In a further statement after news of the latest missile test, Johnson again called for the international community to unite. The Foreign Office thinks China has done more than it might have been expected to do, but it is still insufficient. Tillerson himself turned the issue back to China and Russia, as the US has repeatedly done in the past. “China supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labour,” he said in a statement. “China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.” In London on Thursday, Tillerson had admitted that the latest round of sanctions passed by the security council only on Monday had stopped well short of what the US and its allies had been seeking. “We had been hoping for a very much stronger resolution”, he admitted, even if he praised the complete prohibition of textiles as representing a loss of $700m annual income to North Korea. The very fact that the UN security council had remained united was important, he added, more lamely. Unity at the UN had been bought at the expense of dropping US calls for a complete ban of oil exports to North Korea, the one measure China will not so far countenance, and the one measure that would bring the North Korean economy to the brink of collapse in a matter of months. Tillerson added: “I hope China as a great country will decide on its own to take upon itself to use that powerful tool of oil supply to persuade North Korea to reconsider its approach. It is a very powerful tool which they alone really have the ability to assert. It has been used in the past.”The immediate reaction from the Chinese foreign ministry did not suggest a change in its opposition towards military action against North Korea, which could trigger a refugee crisis. The ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying again emphasised diplomatic solutions. Hua said China had made enormous sacrifices to implement UN security council resolutions and that its sincerity could not be doubted. In a sign that Trump may be willing to use more than Twitter to cajole the Chinese, the president said he would travel to China, as well as Seoul and Tokyo, before the end of the year to discuss the crisis. It would be a sign of respect, and put some of the bluster to one side. In the words of the US diplomat Christopher Hill, the visit could provide the chance the US and China need to agree a strategy. For some diplomats there is a fear that mounting sanctions are not deterring Kim, and are only incentivising him to speed up his programme. The danger is that North Korea’s physicists are working to an altogether different and faster timetable than the New York diplomats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/15/hrt-hormone-replacement-therapy-wont-kill-you-but-menopausal-women-still-face-a-difficult-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T15:05:48Z","webTitle":"HRT won't kill you - but menopausal women still face a difficult decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/15/hrt-hormone-replacement-therapy-wont-kill-you-but-menopausal-women-still-face-a-difficult-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/15/hrt-hormone-replacement-therapy-wont-kill-you-but-menopausal-women-still-face-a-difficult-decision","fields":{"headline":"HRT won't kill you - but menopausal women still face a difficult decision","bodyText":"Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), possibly the most controversial medicine ever invented, will not kill you. That was the conclusion this week of a big, respectable study in the United States that was one of the first to flag up the risk of breast cancer. Women who took the tablets to alleviate the hot flushes and night sweats that assail them, prevent them sleeping and can make life intolerable were no more likely to be dead 18 years later than women who did not. That’s good news and it was loudly celebrated. Gynaecologists who have been frustrated and dismayed by the bad press HRT has had, leaving them groping in the dark for something else to give the distressed woman in the consulting room who doesn’t want hormones, said this is proof of its safety. The risks are low. Women must be told about them, but they should not be deterred by any thought that HRT could shorten their life. And yet. The long-term results from the Women’s Health Initiative study are about mortality. In one way they don’t change a thing. HRT still increases the chances that a woman will get breast cancer and ovarian cancer and possibly heart disease and stroke in those over 60 – she just won’t die as a result. Treatment is better these days. But that woman sobbing in the doctor’s consulting room, waking up in bed soaked with sweat, trying to get through a meeting at work with heat pounding her body and afraid everybody must be noticing her flushed face, still has a difficult decision to make. HRT works. It can be like magic for women who feel their life is wrecked. Mariella Frostrup said she got her life back and hit out at “the shroud of secrecy and shame” around the menopause that prevents women getting the relief of HRT. Woman’s Hour presenter Jenni Murray, however, who developed breast cancer after ten years of HRT following an early menopause, said she would never have taken it if she had known then what she knows now. Most women go through the menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, although for some it happens prematurely and others are thrown into it by cancer treatment to stop the body producing oestrogen, as the hormone feeds breast and ovarian cancers. The first oestrogen pill was introduced in 1942, and HRT became available to women in the UK in 1965, without the sort of trials that would be done today to look at the side-effects. The rationale was clear: the pills replaced the oestrogen women were losing. The sales pitch was paternalistic and played on women’s fears of ageing. Without any evidence, the suggestion was planted that HRT would restore both vigour and beauty. “When a woman develops hot flashes, sweats, wrinkles on her face, she is quite concerned that she is losing her youth – that she may indeed be losing her husband,” said a drugmaker’s promotional film in 1972. New York gynaecologist Robert Wilson, who had links to the manufacturers, published a book called Feminine Forever, calling women who did not take hormones “castrates”. The science came later and caused much dismay. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) was a huge study of nearly 162,000 women launched in 1991. The UK-based Million Women Study began in 1996. Both found an increased rate of breast and ovarian cancer. Thousands of women stopped taking HRT. Thousands more were anxious about starting it. The pendulum has recently swung back the other way, with guidance from Nice, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, in November 2015. Millions of women should no longer have to suffer in silence, it said. An estimated 1.5 million women in the UK – 85% of all those going through menopause – suffer common symptoms such as hot flushes, insomnia and night sweats. Yet they don’t always get the help they need to manage the symptoms. HRT worked, Nice said, and should be considered. And now the WHI study has published its long-term findings showing women do not die from taking it. “Data showing that mortality overall is not increased in all age groups is a very reassuring finding,” said Haitham Hamoda, consultant gynaecologist at Kings College Hospital and spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Hamoda is also on the medical advisory council of the British Menopause Society which has lobbied for HRT and disputed the risk findings in the past. Hamoda says the breast cancer risk is not high. The WHI study puts it at one more case in 1,000. He prefers that to the observational Million Women Study, funded by Cancer Research UK, which says it is two women in 1,000. One in 1,000, Hamoda says “in medical and statistical terms is a small number. It is similar to the [breast cancer] risk of drinking a glass of wine a night.” The risk of breast cancer from being overweight is four times higher. A more recent study, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, found last year that among the 100,000 women taking part to look at the causes of breast cancer, those on HRT had a 2.7 times higher risk than those not taking hormones. “We found risks that were slightly higher than other people had been reporting,” said Dr Michael Jones of the ICR’s genetics and epidemiology unit. “Part of that we think is because we have good quality data and were able to tell when women started and stopped HRT.” The risk is higher for woman taking the combined oestrogen and progesterone pill and lower for oestrogen only – but women need progesterone to protect against womb cancer unless they have had a hysterectomy. Gynaecologists like Hamoda understand the need. “We see about 2,000 patients a year. The number of patients who come in saying it’s affecting my relationship, I go to a meeting and my brain goes blank. It really affects women’s lives. The average duration of symptoms is seven years but one in three go beyond that. There are no markers to show who will have the symptoms for six months and who is going to have them for 20 years,” he said. Author Jeanette Winterson described two years of mental breakdown. She, like many others, decided to seek treatment with “bioidentical” hormones rather than those the NHS provides, which their supporters claim are natural. She wrote of the “impossible choice” that women have to make, between mental and physical wreckage and flooding their bodies with synthetic hormones. But conventional doctors say there is no difference. Women are given oestrogen in the form of estradiol on the NHS, which Hamoda says is bioidentical – identical – to that made in the female body. The progesterone that most women get is synthetic, but bioidentical micronised progesterone, made from plants, is also available on the NHS. The advice from the NHS is that each woman should sit down with her GP and talk through the options, based on what they know of her individual risk. There are no easy answers. Women at high risk of breast or ovarian cancer or those who have had them will not be advised to take HRT. For everyone else it is something of a guessing game. The odds of cancer are low and reduced if a woman takes the pills for a shorter length of time (no help to those who have symptoms for 20 years), but the risk exists. There is a glimmer of hope on the horizon though. Maybe more than a glimmer. In April this year, the results of a trial of a new drug were published by Imperial College London. It involved women who were having seven or more hot flushes a day; the drug cut the number of hot flushes by 73%. Oestrogen deficiency causes a chemical in the brain called neurokinin B to increase and this causes menopausal flushing - the drug blocks neurokinin B from working, eliminating menopausal flushing. It was a small and early study carried out with taxpayer’s money, funded by the Medical Research Council because the drug had already been tried and failed in other uses. But Big Pharma can now see the potential and has swooped to develop the molecule. Astellas paid $500m to buy Belgian biotech firm Ogeda, which was running a trial with similar results to Imperial’s. Professor Waljit Dhillo, an endocrinologist and one of the leaders of the trial at Imperial, said they have been inundated with emails from women wanting the drug since news emerged of the results. “They are miserable and not sleeping and it is usually at a time when women are right at the top of their career and they are drenched in sweat and can’t go into meetings,” he said. HRT works and is very effective, he said, but there is a huge interest in an alternative for those who cannot or will not take it. It will be a couple of years before the new drug is on the market, but if the results of further trials are as good as theirs, it is going to do very well indeed. The alternatives Mood swings, hot flushes, night sweats and other unpleasant symptoms of the menopause are caused by the loss of oestrogen in the body as the ovaries run out of eggs in mid-life and stop producing it. HRT replaces that oestrogen. Too much oestrogen can cause endometrial cancer so to protect the lining of the womb, combined HRT is given which contains progesterone as well. None of the alternatives offers an instant and complete end of the symptoms. They help some women and not others. They fall into three groups: the non-drug options, medicines designed for other conditions which have been found to reduce menopausal symptoms as a side-effect and alternative therapies, which are largely untested. Non-drug: • Yoga. The combination of relaxation and exercise helps some women, particularly with the mood swings that the menopause can bring and also in coping with what are technically called vasomotor symptoms – in other words, the surges of heat that cause the body to sweat and the skin to flush red. Stress makes the symptoms worse. • Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Several studies have shown that CBT can help women cope and reduce the symptoms. • Lifestyle changes and weight loss. Getting fit, taking exercise and becoming healthier helps all medical conditions. Losing weight is good for bone health, which can be impaired by the loss of oestrogen during the menopause. • Dietary changes. Caffeine, alcohol and spicy foods have all been known to trigger sweating and flushes. Giving up smoking can also help, according to NHS Choices. Other medicines: • Clonidine. This is a pill to treat high blood pressure, ADHD and anxiety, but among the side effects that have been found is a (small) reduction of menopausal flushing. • Antidepressants. These are said to help reduce hot flushes, in a lower dose than is used for depression. Venlafaxine and other drugs of the SSRI class (of which Prozac is a member) are generally prescribed. • Gabapentin. This is a drug against epilepsy. As a side-effect, it has been found to help hot flushes in some women but may cause tiredness and other side effects. Alternative therapies: • A variety of herbal medicines have been found to help some women, although not in formal randomised clinical trials. Nice mentions that there is some evidence for black cohosh and isoflavones, like soy, which are derived from the bean family and are phytoestrogens. But it warns that in the different strengths and packs available, their safety is uncertain and that they can interact with conventional medicines. Evening primrose oil, angelica, ginseng and St John’s Wort (effective for depression but interacts with other medicines) are all also sold in health food shops to alleviate menopausal symptoms. • Acupuncture. A study last year found that it cut the numbers of hot flushes some women experienced, but not others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/15/prism-review-robert-lindsay-jack-cardiff-movies-terry-johnson-hampstead-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T11:47:31Z","webTitle":"Prism review – Robert Lindsay brings Jack Cardiff's movie memories into focus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/15/prism-review-robert-lindsay-jack-cardiff-movies-terry-johnson-hampstead-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/15/prism-review-robert-lindsay-jack-cardiff-movies-terry-johnson-hampstead-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Prism review – Robert Lindsay brings Jack Cardiff's movie memories into focus","bodyText":"Jack Cardiff, the celebrated cinematographer who is the subject of Terry Johnson’s new play, once wrote that if you submitted your life to a decent script editor, it would be rejected on structure alone. While Johnson’s play is a bit bumpy, it movingly records the fragmentation of Cardiff’s Alzheimer’s-affected memory and yields a riveting performance from Robert Lindsay. We see Cardiff in his declining years when his son, Mason, has set up the garage of his dad’s Buckinghamshire home as a sanctum where he can finally write his memoirs. Copies of Cardiff’s favourite paintings and lustrous images of the female stars with whom he worked adorn the walls. But although Mason engages a young woman, Lucy, to act as both carer and typist, Cardiff prefers to re-enact the past rather than record it. Not only Lucy and Mason but also Cardiff’s wife, Nicola, increasingly become figures from his crowded cinematic memory leading at one stage to a re-creation of the hazards of location shooting for The African Queen. Most people’s minds, as they grow older, become a jumble of past and present: Johnson suggests this is doubly so if they have had a career like Cardiff’s and also have Alzheimer’s. The problem is that because Cardiff worked so much with the famous, the play doesn’t inspire the immediate empathy of a work like Florian Zeller’s The Father, with its more mundane hero. If it finally touches our hearts, it is because it reveals the cost to those close to Cardiff of his final decline and because of its recognition that no life achieves a perfect narrative arc, and is instead more akin to shooting a film than watching one. Lindsay is amazing to watch. He evokes the casual charm that made Cardiff magnetic to the women he worked with as well as the professional obsessiveness that led him to experiment with prisms and seek to reproduce the textures of a Vermeer or Renoir on screen. Above all, Lindsay’s performance has a humanity that suggests Cardiff’s cinematic memories are accompanied by a spasmodic grasp of reality. Claire Skinner shifting between Cardiff’s wife and his idealised Katharine Hepburn, Rebecca Night as the carer who becomes his memorialised Marilyn Monroe and Barnaby Kay as the son who turns into Humphrey Bogart and Arthur Miller, also show the pangs of becoming part of someone else’s disordered dreams.

Two left. Congrats to Essex on topping the table! Attention turns to the bottom of Div 1 and top of Div 2 now. Eight days of cricket left, and plenty to play for. I’ll be back on Tuesday to take you all through it. Do join me. Results: Division One: The Champions Essex beat Warwickshire by an innings and 57 runs Somerset beat Lancashire by 7 wickets Surrey drew with Yorkshire Middlesex drew with Hampshire Division Two: The leaders Worcestershire beat Leicestershire by 6 wickets Northants beat Glamorgan by 7 wickets Kent drew with Gloucestershire Derbyshire beat Sussex by 45 runs The tables are here, by the way. Until next time! All over at Hove! Podmore gets Wiese and Derbyshire win by 45 runs! 55 required... Wicket! Podmore gets Garton, and Sussex are nine down. But it also ruins Hardus Nails’ 10! George Garton goes 6, 4 off Podmore and Sussex need 58 to win... Sussex probably aren’t going to chase 390. It’s all on Wiese now, at 319 for eight. All eight have fallen to Hardus Viljoen, who took seven in the first innings! 15 in the game! The Division One table is an extraordinary thing right now. Surrey are third, but are only 13 points above relegation. Hampshire are a point below them. The main stoush is between Middlesex (123), Yorkshire (124), and Somerset (123). Here it is. Right, I’m back. Match drawn at Bristol! Kent 12, Gloucestershire 11. The end of Kent’s promotion hopes, you’d have to think Be back shortly. Surrey get 12 points, Yorkshire – who are a point above the relegation zone – 10. Match drawn here, as the players head through to shake hands. Whoop! Covers going on. This match is a draw, whether they announce it now or in 15 minutes. Sussex six down now! Wright gone for 80 and it’s over to the tail... Viljoen has 13 in the match. 118 to win, four in hand. I suspect the aim of the game here is to wait until 4.20 and then call it off. The light is fine! Brown gone first ball! Nails’ 12th of the match. Decent effort, that. Five in hand, 119 required. Sussex have lost a wicket, and still need 123. Van Zyl gone, for 85. Wright still there on 76, with Ben Brown. 30 overs left. Match drawn at Uxbridge! Thank the lord. Nine points for Middlesex, eight for Hampshire. On games won, Middlesex are in the relegation zone. One point will separate Yorkshire (124), Somerset (123), and Middlesex (123). Anyone remember where we were a year ago? Quite literally the only reason I want the players to return here at the Oval is because I made G.Ballance the captain of my fantasy team this morning and there are easy runs to be had. But I’m more than happy to sacrifice them in order for Yorkshire to hit the road and avoid the worst of the traffic. Off for bad light! Oh no, said no one. Lights are on at the Oval, but they may as well save on the electricity bills and call the game off. Rain at Uxbridge! What a shock. Northamptonshire beat Glamorgan by seven wickets! That didn’t take long. They take 22 points. They are third, but 29 points behind Notts. Finish them! Well the final session of this match is about to start. The umpires are on their way out to the middle, but they’ve no players with them yet. Bit dark, so maybe it’s just an inspection?Oh no, here come the players. Or should that be: Oh no! Here come the players. Northants need nine to win when play resumes at 3.30 in Cardiff. The baton has been handed over... Ashwin hits the winnings runs, and Worcestershire have bagged a maximum point win! They are top of Division Two by nine points, having played a game more than second-placed Notts. Worcestershire have lost Joe Clarke but require just eight for a big victory. Impressive one too, given they conceded 404 in the first innings of the match! Tea at Bristol too, where a draw looks likely. Be fun if Glosters dangled the carrot, because Kent would go for it. 41 overs in the game, Glosters’ lead is 232. Tea! Wahoo. When we return, I think we will have to play for 50 minutes before hands can be shaken. Yorkshire 277 for two. An over until tea here. Ballance has zipped his way to 23. Unlucky Sussex need their runs at about four an over, with seven wickets in hand. Wow. 165 required. Worcestershire need 29 runs to go top of Division Two... Inspection at 3pm at Cardiff. Tea at Uxbridge! Edwards bowled by Finn and Hampshire are all out for 146. 58 behind. Surrey have taken the new ball. Good news for Northants. Half an hour until tea here. I can’t wait, because it’ll be 20 minutes’ relief from this pitch. Are Sussex having a look? They are 192 for three, needing 198 from 47 overs. Would be a mental, monumental chase. Fell falls to Raine and the Woosters are three down needing 63 more against the Lesters. It is quite a funny rain delay. Northants will still win. Hampshire nine down. FULL BOWLING POINTS FOR MIDDLESEX. They and Somerset will be level on points (but Somerset above because they have won more games). How embarrassing for Alex Lees! He is actually out! Not before scoring 102 runs though. He’s been bowled by van den Bergh, trying to cut I reckon. Gary Ballance MARCHES OUT. Yorkshire 239 for two, and There are around about 110 minutes until this game can mercifully be put out of its misery. And 100 for Alex Lees! He gets there with a cut too, off van den Bergh for three. 198 balls, 14 fours. 100 for Shaun Marsh! Gets there with a lovely deft late cut off Meaker. That’s his 15th four, from his 226th ball. Yorkshire 223 for one. Kent can still win at Bristol, can’t they? Glos 201 for six, but a man down. 55 overs in the game. The lead is 200. A big old uh oh for Northants.... And they are back on at New Road. Oooohhh a rain delay at New Road with Worcestershire 81 from victory. Oh, no! Felix Organ, the newly-crowned best-named man in county cricket, goes to Harris. Hampshire are 101 for seven, still 103 behind. Middlesex couldn’t get among them could they? Oi oi Parky. At best, Kent are going to have quite a big chase to pull off in quite a short time. Hardus Nails has three, and Sussex are 147 for three in the unlikely pursuit of 390. Lol Two bowling points for Middlesex! Big. 92 for six, Finn gets Dickinson. And Yorkshire lead. Draw, incoming. Sack that, Marsh moves to 91 with a rather nice cut. Both batsmen on 87 here, and that’s about as interesting as its been all day. Worcestershire are one down in pursuit of about 120 against Leicestershire. Cal Parkinson gets his ninth of the match, B-Dolly. He might have played with intent, but he is out. Middlesex a wicket away from a second bowling point. Most importantly, Felix Organ is still there. As Shaun Marsh gets tucked into Ryan Patel, Yorkshire are nearly in the lead! 61 required for Northants as Kerrigan goes for a career-best 62. Great effort, they are just three down. Hampshire 46 for four! Finn gets Ervine. Essex’s social media is on point. Felix Organ is batting for Hampshire, and I am happy about this. Here come cricketers at the Oval. Lunchtime reading! A wicketless first session at the Oval. Boring. Yorkshire are doing well though and are now just 42 behind Surrey. Here’s where we are: Division One: Somerset beat Lancashire by 7 wickets! Yorkshire 394 &amp; 156-1 v Surrey 592 Hampshire 46-3 v Middlesex 204 Division Two: Sussex 271 &amp; 110-1 v Derbyshire 338 &amp; 322-8d Northants 310 &amp; 149-2 v Glamorgan 207 &amp; 320 Worcestershire 493 &amp; 4-0 v Leicestershire 404 &amp; 220 Gloucestershire 385 &amp; 156-4 v Kent 386 Enjoy your sarnies, particularly you Essexites... Middlesex have a bowling point! Good morning for them so far. Hampshire two down! Helm gets Weatherley. Seven wickets required... So Middlesex really need wickets. Eight of them, for three bowling points. Hampshire currently 46 for one. If Middlesex do get three bowling points, they will leave Uxbridge with nine points, which takes them level with Somerset on 123... That game at Taunton in the final week is huge! Before then there are two big’uns in London. Middlesex v Lancashire at Lord’s, and Surrey v Somerset at the Oval. Let’s hope the weather plays ball next week. Leicestershire 220 all out! Worcestershire need 132 to win. Ashwin with the final wicket, his third! This bloke is a great man. Ignoring the situation at the top, that is an enormous win for Somerset. They take 22 points from it, and are above both Yorkshire and Middlesex (for now), who are ambling towards draws... Here’s the current table. 50 for Alex Lees at the Oval, where there’s still nothing happening... Yorkshire 73 behind. Leicestershire have lost a wicket at New Road... Brown gets Chappell and Leicestershire’s lead is 125 with two wickets in hand. Bartlett smacks Parky for six. Three to win. Down the other end, Abell hitsParry for four and that is that! Ploughed through the legside! Somerset have won their last two, but more importantly ESSEX ARE THE COUNTY CHAMPIONS! Somerset need three to win! Kent still haven’t worked out how to get Cam Bancroft out... And now Newton gone! Northants two down... Northants are just one down and need 93 more to beat Glamorgan... 15 to win... Love that delayed reaction! Middlesex have a wicket! Helm gets Adams. They want eight more. That would mean they take nine points from the match. Abell survives the hat-trick ball, with a tidy flick to leg for three... 19 needed... Another wicket! Parkinson gets Hildreth first ball! Caight by Hameed close in. They can’t can they? He’s on a hat-trick... Parkinson has got Trescothick out now! Looks like he’s swept him hard to square-leg or midwicket. Ball before went for six and Somerset need just 21... Tom Helm and Steven Finn with the new ball for Middlesex; a rarity for both. Somerset are halfway there... 50 for Shaun Marsh! His second of the match. Both these sides are interested in him next year. Audition. Spin from both ends at Taunton. Tres pushes Parry’s first ball away for one, and it’s 26 for one after 5.1. 42 required... Play to resume at New Road with three overs lost. Leicestershire are effectively 85 for three... Tres sweeps Parkinson and, thanks to some ropey fielding, that’s four! 24 for one, 44 required. Rain at Worcester... Middlesex 204 all out! They really want three bowling points today. Really want it. Wicket! Parkinson has bowled Lord Byrom with a loop leggie that might just have taken the inside edge... 19 for one, 49 still needed. With Somerset 19 without loss, Lancashire turn to Matt Parkinson... After a couple of slightly ropey overs from Mason Crane, Middlesex have a batting point! Now Tres is in on the act! He cuts Jarvis and Somerset are 19 for none... There are some very angry clouds just west of the Oval. Batting is easy, and Yorkshire trail by 100... Great scenes. Bit of car sickness kicking about... Two cut fours in the over for Lord Byrom off McLaren! 11 without loss Somerset. Morning Stuie! Looking very much that way... Somerset 3 for 0 chasing 68 after two overs. Zak Chappell and Lewis Hill are building Leicestershire’s lead. It is 76 with three wickets in hand against Worcestershire... Bit of cloud about at the Oval, where very little is happening. Well, Rikki Clarke is bowling to Shaun Marsh, so something is happening. McLaren kicking things off for Lancashire, against Tres. Lord Byrom waiting at t’other end. Somerset are away with a single to fine leg. Middlesex nine down as Fidel pins Helm in front. In comes the Watford Wall. They are 28 shy of batting point, and poor old John Simpson is still there. He’s always still there. The last wicket was taken by Coverton, pinning Tom Bailey – who has assumed Shiv Chanderpaul’s stance – lbw. Somerset went bananas. They need 68 to win. And if they do ... Essex win the title, and Somerset will pick up 22 vital points in the relegation race. At Taunton, Craig Overton is bouncing Matt Parkinson. It’s all a bit unfair. You can watch this stuff! Somerset v Lancashire is here! Surrey v Yorkshire is here! Glamorgan v Northants is here! Hampshire have another wicket ... Crane catching Rayner at square-leg off Abbott. 168 for eight and in grave danger of failing to get a batting point. That would be careless. Sussex one down in their chase of 390. Gus Robson gone to Hardus Nails. There goes Jarvis. Coverton has become a properly superb bowler. Stevo’s been busy at Bristol! Two wickets in an over... Glos 67 for two. Good point. He’ll be at the crease soon. I thought he should have been just now, when Scurran had a huge lbw shout against Lees. Looked very out, but no dice. Wicket at Taunton! Coverton bowls Jarvis and Lancashire are nine down, with a lead of 56! So Derbyshire declared overnight, setting Sussex 390 to win. Wells and Robson opening. Underway at Taunton too, with Leach bowling to Jarvis. Scurran bowling to Lees, then. First ball cut, just short of point... Yorkshire’s football is done. Ballance mucked up a nice one on one (he’s a bit ungainly; don’t know how much football they play in Harare or at Harrow), while Hodd scored that brilliant overhead kick. Play about 2 minutes away. Good morning. Today should be the day. Lancashire are in all sorts of trouble at Taunton, where there’s rain on the way. When they fail to win that game – which, surely, surely they won’t win – Essex will be the County Champions for the first time since 1992. To be honest, Essex better win because I have already written 1,000 words on them doing so. So I’m Will Macpherson and I’m at the sun-drenched Oval to tell you about all that and more. Here, Surrey have Yorkshire following on. Will the pitch break up? Can they force a win? I don’t know if it mean anything, but Andy Hodd just scored a superb overhead kick in Yorkshire’s football match. There’s Div 1 action at Uxbridge too. It’s a tussle for points. Middlesex currently have none. There’s plenty afoot in Division Two, too. Worcestershire can take their latest decisive step towards promotion – or even just about seal it – with win over Leicestershire. Kent are going to draw (the wait goes on), while Sussex have a big chase and Northants a testing one. Here’s the scores: Division One: Essex beat Warwickshire by an innings and 56 runs Lancashire 133 &amp; 247-8 v Somerset 335 Middlesex 162-7 v Hampshire Yorkshire 394 &amp; 59-1 v Surrey 592 Division Two: Derbyshire 338 &amp; 322-8 v Sussex 271 Northants 310 &amp; 42-1 v Glamorgan 207 &amp; 320 Gloucestershire 385 &amp; 67-0 v Kent 386 Leicestershire 404 &amp; 111-7 v Worcestershire 493 Reading! Yesterday’s report is here, and the big bit is here: You can contact me! Do so! I loved hearing from all the Essex sorts yesterday about your pride in your team.

As so often, I had as much – if not more – fun meeting readers and authors from other countries as I did talking at my own events. Highlights also included whale watching, being taken on a day’s excursion around the local sights and avoiding eating the local delicacies of foal, whale and puffin. On the Sunday night I had dinner with Yrsa Sigurðardóttir and, as you would expect of one of Iceland’s top crime writers, she was a fund of great stories. As well as keeping me up to speed on ever more inventive ways of killing people with household appliances, Yrsa told me that Iceland’s main mortuary is now so full of tourists whose bodies have gone unclaimed that the authorities are planning to build an extension. Unfortunately for fans of Icelandic noir, there is no great mystery to these bodies. Many have failed to remember that Iceland is near the Arctic Circle and have gone out into the countryside unprepared for the weather. The reason they are unclaimed is because Iceland is fiendishly expensive and their relatives can’t afford to pay the storage charges and have their bodies flown home. Tuesday In a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Britain ranks seventh in the league table of depression. While I am obviously thrilled that my current state of anxiety, which is often a precursor to a bout of depression, might have helped push Britain above France, Greece, Poland and Slovakia in the rankings – if it gets much worse we could nudge ahead of Iceland, Ireland and Germany – I have my reservations about the data. In many cases mental illness goes undiagnosed as so often it relies on patients self-reporting their condition. So a country with fewer people identifying themselves as depressed might actually be a worse place to live for those suffering from a mental illness, as the pressure to try to pretend everything is OK might be far greater. I’d rather be living in a country where being depressed was no big deal than in one where I was expected to suffer in silence. Wednesday Britain has been criticised for its slow response to the devastation caused throughout the Caribbean by Hurricane Irma. Whether residents of the British Virgin Islands actually wanted a visit from Boris Johnson – there are few bad situations the foreign secretary hasn’t been known to make worse – is open to question, but they did belatedly get one, along with some rather grudging offers of financial assistance from the UK government. With so much rebuilding required and comparatively little cash seemingly available, it is surprising that some MPs haven’t put their hands into their pockets to help out. Both Nicholas Soames and Andrew Mitchell have benefited from having offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and it shouldn’t be beyond them to find a few quid to replace the buildings that housed their accountants. The Cayman Islands, where Jacob Rees-Mogg has an offshore company, also did not escape unscathed, so perhaps the Tory leadership hopeful might think about paying for one of the food banks of which he has recently become so fond. Thursday It’s been revealed that Theresa May’s decision to call a snap election cost the country £140m that could have been better spent elsewhere. Personally, I am quite happy to have contributed £2 to an election that destroyed her strong and stable majority, but I can see that not everyone might feel the same way. Given the outcome, you might have thought the prime minister would now think twice about spending other people’s money on pointless vanity projects, but apparently not. The latest waste of money is a two-and-a-half-minute animated video explaining why Brexit is going to be brilliantly simple, which has appeared on No 10’s official Twitter feed. Not only is the video ludicrously amateur and upbeat – it wouldn’t be out of place alongside one of those 1960s public information films explaining how to survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a table – it also suggests we’re only going to bother to trade with one country in Africa and a couple in South America, and manages to overlook the fact that Croatia is a member of the EU. It’s you who’s paid for all this. So that’s alright then. Friday Simon Rattle’s return to Britain to take over the baton of the London Symphony Orchestra, after a 15-year spell in charge of the Berlin Philharmonic, has come with a lot of hype. The Barbican Centre has been taken over with large “This is Rattle” signs and there are large portraits of him on almost every spare piece of blank wall. But the first concert more than lived up to expectations and Rattle and the orchestra fully deserved the five-minute standing ovation they received at the end. For me, the undoubted highlight was Elgar’s Enigma Variations, which can sound like a classic Last Night of the Proms old familiar but in Rattle’s hands reached moments of sublime beauty. At my father’s funeral nearly 20 years ago, the organist played the Nimrod variation – quite badly – and it left me almost unmoved: I couldn’t think why my dad had asked for it. But last night, the opening bars seemed to emerge as if from another world and grew into something powerfully transcendent. My whole body came out in goosebumps, tears came to my eyes and I felt closer to my father than at any time since he died. Thank you, Simon. And welcome home.

But while Peter Hall was instrumental in setting up and running the biggest theatres – first the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the National Theatre – Peter Brook set himself up to run away from them. He spent the last five decades of his career at a theatre of his own in Paris, where he worked on long and idiosyncratic projects that would come to the UK only as a date on a world tour. But, despite this long absence, which he disliked being described as an exile, Brook’s impact on the theatre of his home country was huge. Directors, especially of the classics, are often at their best with either the visual or the verbal aspects of theatre, but Brook was brilliant at both. His two key Shakespearean productions in England placed the most musically nuanced speakers of their generations – Paul Scofield and Alan Howard – in stagings of King Lear (1962) and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1970). The productions were chromatic opposites: the tragedy looked dark, bleak, doomy (Brook rejected Technicolor for his 1971 movie version) while the comedy, famously staged on a set of circus trapezes, was bright, white, light. Generations of younger directors learned from Brook the possibility of respecting the poetry while ignoring the stage directions, to create an experience that somehow simultaneously has both nothing and everything to do with Shakespeare. These achievements were usefully encapsulated in a short but thought-packed book, The Quality of Mercy: Reflections on Shakespeare (2013), which characteristically combined practical stagecraft with literary and psychological insights. Brook’s lasting effect on theatre has been even greater through his 1968 book The Empty Space, which remains in print and much-studied. It offered a challenge to the postwar British fashion for building massive drama factories with multiple stages. In the book Brook discusses four types of theatrical performance that he categorises as “deadly”, “holy”, “rough” and “immediate”. Deadliness encompassed most of what was on offer in the commercial theatre and the stuffier productions in subsidised houses – work done conventionally for conservative audiences – while holiness represented the potential of the best theatre to achieve some level of transcendence for both performers and audiences. Roughness encouraged the absence, in some circumstances, of elaborate preparations and props; the director had been much affected by an improvised theatrical performance staged after the second world war in the bombed ruins of the Hamburg Opera House. Because Brook did not always achieve in print the clarity that was his signature on stage, immediacy was a more elusive concept, involving the bringing together of tradition and innovation, but it has been interpreted as another argument against being bounded by a building. The preference among subsequent British directors such as Michael Grandage and Kenneth Branagh for temporary residences or pop-up venues reflects Brook’s vision of creative freedom. Although Brook had regular premises in Paris – the Bouffes du Nord, described by Richard Eyre as “the most congenial theatre I know” – he used this base for theatrical explorations without borders which, he hoped then to take around the globe. The Mahabharata, on which Brook worked with his frequent collaborator Jean-Claude Carrière for at least a decade, was based on a Sanskrit epic, and sought to achieve a universal comprehensibility through image and gesture. The same aim led to The Conference of the Birds, based on a 12th-century Persian poem, and Tierno Bokar, a bio-drama about a Malian sufi. Brook’s conviction that he would have been artistically and temperamentally unsuited to presiding over government-funded behemoths such as the National Theatre and the RSC was certainly true in the area of new writing. Brook’s interest in living dramatists of his own nationality was more or less limited to a production of Caryl Churchill’s Far Away. One of his most successful later stage productions was an adaptation of Oliver Sacks’ The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and he made an impressive film version of William Golding’s novel Lord of the Flies (1963). For him, the key modern dramatists were the Irish-French Samuel Beckett and the French Antonin Artaud. The “theatre of cruelty” promoted by Artaud shaped two pieces of new writing on which Brook worked in the mid-60s: Marat/Sade (1964), by the German dramatist Peter Weiss, and US (1966), an improvised anti-Vietnam protest play. Highly controversial at the time for their scenes of nudity and violence, including the burning of a butterfly, these works are now generally seen as embarrassingly of their period. Brook’s interest in eastern cultures extended to regimes of diet and exercise that kept him physically and mentally vigorous into his 90s. He remained a guru for directors who had stayed on the other side of the Channel, wrestling with English tastes and funding. The published diaries of Peter Hall and Richard Eyre, describing their years running the National Theatre, both featured entries in which they took the plane or train to Paris to discuss difficulties with Brook, clearly envying the apparent ease and comfort of his professional and private arrangements there. Some other British directors, in private conversation, felt Brook had failed to do his duty to arts in the UK. Brook was bemused by this criticism, convinced that he had left the British artistic directorships to people much better equipped to do them. Another criticism was that the leisurely rehearsal periods and messianic receptions available in France sometimes edged his work towards pretension and self-indulgence. There were two sides of Brook’s creative personality – Shakespearean and shamanistic – and doubters tended to prefer the former to the latter. Brook’s final works continued to reflect this dichotomy. His book The Quality of Mercy: Reflections on Shakespeare (2013) was a brilliant compression of a lifetime’s intellectual and practical theatrical insights into England’s greatest playwright. Its subject matter and tone sometimes suggested a valedictory volume, but Brook found the time and energy to extend the shelf with a work about the power of words, Tip of the Tongue (2017), and another about the uses of music, Playing by Ear (2019). However, his last stage productions in his home country – both co-directed with Marie-Hélène Estienne, the major collaborator of his later years – suggested that Brook’s non-Shakespearean theatre was now better in theory than practice. The Prisoner, which poignantly visited the National just a week after the memorial service for Peter Hall, was a meditation on crime and punishment that contained some thrilling ideas and images. But, tellingly, a scene featuring a real fire but an imagined rat hinted that Brook’s directorial imagination was now butting up against stricter theatrical safety regulations. Similarly, in the previous work with Estienne, The Valley of Astonishment, a piece about synaesthesia seen at the Young Vic in 2014, a key moment was described, rather than shown, because it was not actable. This must have been frustrating for Brook, but was for the audience as well. His next theatre piece, Why?, was atypically retrospective and self-reflective, featuring three favourite actors exploring the life and ideas of the Russian theatrical innovator, Vsevolod Meyerhold, who greatly influenced Brook. Starting in Paris, it toured Europe and the US. To launch Playing by Ear, Brook, in late October 2019, defied failing sight and physical frailty to enthral a National Theatre audience with 45 minutes of brainy but playful thoughts on the performing arts. A disapproving silence fell when Brook described the butterfly-burning moment in his show US, until the director revealed that theatre-goers had been fooled: the blazing insect had been made of paper, substituted by last minute sleight of hand for a real creature that was not harmed. The next month, Brook was given a lifetime achievement award at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards in London, but, hospitalised in Paris after a fall, was unable to travel, his daughter Irina receiving the trophy, and a grateful ovation, on his behalf. Histories of 20th century British theatre will contain numerous references to the two Peters. Hall’s immense achievement was to create the cultural cathedrals in Stratford and London, and make UK culture unthinkable without them. Brook, though, had greater influence on the imaginations of the directors who work inside those buildings and, following another of his examples, increasingly outside them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2017/sep/15/parsons-green-tube-explosion-closes-london-district-line-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T18:05:54Z","webTitle":"Parsons Green tube explosion: May says threat level remains at severe - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2017/sep/15/parsons-green-tube-explosion-closes-london-district-line-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2017/sep/15/parsons-green-tube-explosion-closes-london-district-line-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Parsons Green tube explosion: May says threat level remains at severe - as it happened","bodyText":"The live blog continues here: This live blog is now closed. Here are the key developments from Friday. 29 people were injured at Parsons Green underground station in west London after an improvised explosive device partially exploded on a tube carriage. It has been declared a terrorist incident. Theresa May condemned the attack as “cowardly”. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, the prime minister said the terror threat level would remain at severe – but under review – despite the bomber being at large. A massive search is under way for whoever planted the homemade device. Detectives are examining CCTV from the London Underground network to determine where the perpetrator entered and exited the tube system. The Met police have asked anyone with information about the attack to contact them on 0800 789 321. They have asked members of the public with images of the scene to upload them to www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk. Read the full story here: That’s all from me. Have a peaceful evening. Hammersmith and Fulham council has said Parsons Green residents are returning home. Chelsea FC have announced extra security measures for their match against Arsenal on Sunday. Parsons Green is near Chelsea’s stadium. Find the full statement here: The safety of all fans and visitors to Stamford Bridge is of paramount importance to the club. Following Friday morning’s incident at Parsons Green, and in order to help us fully prepare for the game, the majority of the Stamford Bridge site will remain closed until Sunday morning. This includes Stadium Tours, the Museum, Megastore and the Chelsea Health Club &amp; Spa, while the ticket office will be operating via telephone and online only. During that time, entrance to the site will be via the Stamford Gate entrance only. On Sunday, we urge supporters to arrive at least one hour before kick-off to allow for extra security measures. We also request that supporters do not bring bags as this will delay your entry to the stadium. The club continues to monitor events and liaise with the police and relevant authorities on supporter safety. Donald Trump has spoken with Theresa May to convey his sympathies and prayers for those injured in the explosion, the White House said in a statement. The president pledged to continue to collaborate closely with the UK to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism, the statement continued. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “President Trump called the prime minister earlier today to offer his condolences over this morning’s cowardly attack in London.” As of 5.30pm on Friday, NHS England said it had treated 29 patients in relation to the explosion. Of these, 21 remained in hospital and eight had been discharged earlier in the day. Transport for London says the District line between Earl’s Court and Wimbledon will remain closed for the rest of the day due to the explosion at Parsons Green. Here’s an updated version of where things currently stand: While there’s relief in Parsons Green that no one died today, a difficult weekend lies ahead for many people caught up in the attack. Visibly anxious parents have been collecting children from Lady Margaret school which was on lockdown most of the day and face trying to reassure some distraught teenagers, especially those who travel by tube. But some of the joys of life are also returning. A wedding that was due to take place today in the parish church of St Dionis, which is inside the cordon, is now under way in a neighbouring parish church, according to the Rt Rev Dr Graham Tomlin, bishop of Kensington. He told the Guardian: We had to move quite quickly because moving a wedding is a slightly complicated legal business, but we managed to make it work so the couple could get married in All Saints church, in the parish next door, and that’s going on right now. It’s a bit of a sign that life can continue and good things happen even in the middle of something really deeply evil like this. The bishop, whose diocese includes Grenfell Tower, reflected on London’s summer of bad news. While he labelled the attempt to kill children and elderly people today as “evil”, he called for greater efforts to understand terrorists’ mentality. It has been a really tough summer in London when you think of the London Bridge attacks, Grenfell Tower and this as well. The aim of something like this is either to cause death and injury or to cause fear and to stop people living life normally or to cause division in our communities. We saw an awful lot of division over Grenfell for very different reasons, and the aim of this sort of thing is to cause the same division. We can’t afford that. It is important that whatever this is doesn’t divide communities against one another. There is too much division in our world right now and we don’t need more. He continued: Sadly this is something that has become part of life in London. While you never want to get used to it, you have to recognise these things are going to happen. Today we are deeply thankful the device didn’t go off in the way it was intended to. We must not normalise it. We have to do everything we can to support the security services and those trying to stop this. There is a serious step to be made to try and get to the bottom of the mentality that is feeding acts like this. When someone sets out to kill, injure or maim, that is an act of evil. I don’t believe there are irredeemably evil people. But there are evil acts. As a Christian I am told to pray for my enemies and so I do pray for the person who caused this and how their mind and their heart might be changed. There were lots of children and elderly people on that train and the thought of someone setting out to try and injure and kill children is just hard to get your head around. Carina Heidrich, who works in Old Street, injured her feet while trying to escape the station. She said: I just moved to Parsons Green last week. I was actually 10 minutes earlier than normal today for my commute to work. I was on the tube when suddenly there was a bang to my left and it looked like something burning was flying towards me. It seemed to come from three carriages down from where I was. Then panic erupted and everyone just tried to get out of the tube. There were screams everywhere. I was standing near the door so I was one of the first people to step out. There were children who were crying and who looked lost. I was wearing slippers, which weren’t the best footwear to run in, and someone stepped on my foot while trying to push past me and scraped the skin off. I just kept running and jumped the barrier. I didn’t turn around until I reached Fulham Road. At the time I didn’t know what happened and was trying to rationalise it. I found it quite scary to have the helicopters circling for hours this morning but I think they’ve gone now. All eight patients who were treated at St Thomas’ hospital have been discharged. Another eight are being treated at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and three each at St Mary’s - which has been stood down from “major incident status” - and the Central London community healthcare walk-in centre in Parsons Green. Pupils from Lady Margaret girls’ school, which is about 100m from Parsons Green underground station and has been locked down inside the police cordon, have been let out after a highly distressing day. Emanuella Mensah, 16, described the panic which started the day for many of the girls who travel to school on the train that was attacked: I was right outside the corner shop when people started running [from the station]. People were shouting ‘run, run’. I saw old people, people with their kids. Then someone shouted ‘terrorist!’. More people kept coming out of the station. There were people sitting on the pavement crying and in hysterics. Schoolgirls were coming from all kinds of directions. The teachers came down and we started escorting people into school. She said the younger children were particularly shocked and scared and that the distress carried on throughout the day. Years seven, eight and nine, they were all on the phone trying to call their parents. People were crying everywhere. The teachers were putting them into rooms, giving them water and biscuits, trying to keep them calm. They tried to keep everyone going to their lessons but people couldn’t concentrate. Similar stories of distress have been emerging from the Lancaster Court community centre inside the cordon, where residents said about 60 people were being cared for after being evacuated from their flats amid fears of a continuing terror threat. Lauren Saul, 17, who has been volunteering at the centre with her family, said: People were distraught. I have never seen people so scared. They hadn’t been told anything. They didn’t know if they were going home or if they could contact family. Some didn’t know where their family were. I know someone whose grandson was on the train and he has only just started secondary school. The tensions were very high. In the wake of the Parsons Green incident, NHS England has highlighted its guidance for coping with stress after such occurrences. The latest statement by the Met says that an area 50 metres in radius around Parsons Green station has been evacuated as a precaution in case the bomb left on the tube train remains unstable. A spokesman said: The evacuation has been necessary whilst specialist officers secure the remnants of the improvised device and ensure it is stable. A small number of residents will be affected by the evacuation, which encompasses an area approximately 50 metres in radius. Parsons Green tube remains closed and the public are advised to continue to avoid the area. Here’s what May said about the decision not to increase the threat level to critical: The threat level remains at severe. That means that a terrorist attack is highly likely. But this will be kept under review as the investigation progresses. The public should go about their daily lives but remain vigilant. People who are travelling in London will see an increase armed police presence on the transport network and security will be increased. On counter-terrorism measures she said: The threat of terrorism that we face is severe. But by working together we will defeat them. We do need to ensure that we are dealing with, not just the terrorist threat but with the extremism and the hate that can actually incite that terrorism. That’s why we are looking very carefully at the powers that our police and security service have to make sure they have the powers they need. But it is also why we are working with the internet companies. The home secretary has visited Silicon Valley ... and next week I’ll be co-hosting a session with President Macron from France to talk about what more we can be doing to ensure that we deal with the terrorist propaganda with the hatred that is put out across the internet. Asked about the London mayor, Sadiq Khan’s call for more police resources, May said: We have protected police budgets. We also protected counter-terrorism policing and we have ensured that it is possible for the police to increase the number of armed police. I’m pleased to say that once again the emergency service, the police, and others responded immediately and were on the scene immediately and we thank them for their professionalism. Sky News is reporting that a suspect has been identified by police. A press officer at Scotland Yard said they had no knowledge of this. Another passenger on the tube was Lauren Wear, who had got on to the District line train at Parsons Green. She was at the rear of the train close to the explosion. She said: There was a flash from the top to the bottom of the carriage. Some people had their hair scorched and they were quite close to me.I saw people with burns on their face. When I came out if the station everyone was like looking after each other, asking if they were OK. The emergency teams were at the station very quickly. I was very shocked. I’m still shaken. Thankfully the train was still on the platform. The prime minister has condemned the suspected attack as “cowardly”. “This was a device intended to cause significant harm,” Theresa May said in a pooled interview. Speaking after chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee she added that the threat level will remain at severe, but this will remain under review. Some had speculated that the threat level would increase to critical because the suspected bomber is still at large. May also rebuked the US president, Donald Trump, over his Parsons Green comments on Twitter. She said: “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.” Here’s an updated version of where things currently stand: Louis Hather, 21, a programmer from London, hurt his leg in the scramble to escape the train. He said: I was facing away from the bomb when suddenly I heard screams; they were the kind of screams that tell you something serious had happened. I immediately thought: ‘There’s been a terror attack.’ There was something about the urgency in the way people were trying to get away that made me think that. It was sheer panic. I knew I had to get out as soon as I could so I ran towards the stairs but everyone was rushing and lots of people were falling along the way. I tried to stay up but was being pushed all over the place. There was a big crush on the stairs, with a pile-up about half way down. People were falling over each other and being stepped on. I tried to steady myself by putting my arm against the wall. But in the end I fell over and I lost a shoe and my bag in the rush. Somehow I managed to get out and into the street but my stuff was still inside. I heard someone say that there was a flash and a bang in the carriage and that a chemical covered the carriage. They said there was a burning smell, like burning plastic. When it was calmer I eventually went back to get my bag and shoe back. After that I left and sat in the park for a bit and got myself together and went home. I sprained my ankle, and my leg was cut from being dragged along the ground. I think that’s how most of injuries occurred. I know there was a guy standing near the bomb and he got away with a burnt coat and I imagine most of the injuries will be down to the crushing. I feel OK now. I have calmed down from earlier. I have realised it’s not as bad as it could have been and we are lucky. It’s something you don’t expect to happen to you. I was just on my normal commute in and the train was rammed. We were stuck in like sardines. There were so many children going to school on that train. We are so lucky that it seems the bomb did not go off properly. One possibility is that the detonator did not set off the main charge, causing the flash and the heat which inflicted burns on casualties but not a powerful blast which would have been much more destructive. This has happened before: on 21 July 2005 when a series of bombs hidden in backpacks and placed on tube trains by a network of Islamic militants failed to go off. That attack came just two weeks after 52 were killed in the 7/7 multiple suicide bombing in London targeting public transport. Police rapidly traced those responsible for the abortive attempt and detained them. Analysis found the home-made explosive they had manufactured had not ignited. The incompetence of terrorists has been one of the key factors that has spared hundreds of lives in recent years. The recent tragic attacks in Barcelona could have been much worse if the leader of the plot had not blown himself up – along with the network’s stockpile of bomb components – hours before they occurred. Among the many failed incidents in the UK are attempts to bomb a cafe in Exeter (that failed when a bomber set off his own device in a toilet); to bomb a nightclub in London with incendiary devices (that smouldered but did not burn), and to bring down a transatlantic passenger jet (with a bomb in a shoe that proved impossible to ignite). In the US, a massive blast was avoided in Times Square, New York, because the bomber programmed the wrong time, while in Yemen in 2000 an attempt to sink a US navy ship failed when a dinghy overloaded with explosives sank when it was launched. The same goes for attacks by extremists motivated by other ideologies. Well under a half of the 150 far-right plots recorded by the Anti-Defamation League in the US between 1993 and 2016 succeeded. In Columbus, Ohio, in April 2016 a rightwing extremist blew his own hands off while allegedly making explosive which authorities said was to be used as a diversion during a bank robbery. In an incident in Spokane, Washington, in 2011, the FBI arrested a white supremacist who planted a pipe bomb on the route of a Martin Luther King Day parade. It failed to detonate. Counter-terrorist specialists in the west recognise that the “Four Lions factor” – a reference to the 2010 black comedy by Chris Morris which shows the incompetent attempt by a group of Britons to launch a terrorist campaign – is one of the most important defences against attack. Putting pressure on safe havens overseas to limit the ability of terrorist groups to provide training, stopping militants from travelling to those that do still exist, increasing the pressure on local networks and limiting communication with expert handlers, while of course making it harder to obtain crucial ingredients for bombs all help ensure potential attackers remain without the means to realise their destructive ambitions. So too does the elimination of key individuals with high levels of expertise. Western and Middle Eastern intelligence agencies have been trying for years to kill Ibrahim al-Asiri, an al-Qaida extremist in Yemen responsible for a series of ingenious devices which have come close repeatedly to causing appalling destruction. One device would have brought down a passenger plane over the US in 2009 if the bomber had been able to ignite it. Asiri is at large, despite the decade-long effort to kill or capture him. And so is whoever was responsible for the device left on the tube train in London today. The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, expressed the city’s solidarity with London, pointing out that memories of last month’s terrorist atrocities in Catalonia were still fresh. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, tweeted: “I want to express Spain’s solidarity with, and support for, the British people and authorities. I hope those injured make a swift recovery.” London ambulance service nows says 19 people were taken to hospital (up from 18 earlier today). Earlier, NHS England said another four injured people had self-presented. It has since said only three people self-presented. Most of those treated had “minor injuries,” according to Natasha Wills, director of operations for the London ambulance service. This image was posted on Facebook less than an hour after the incident as staff a St Mary’s hospital in Paddington waited for the injured to arrive. Vanesa Garlo Rey wrote: “This is what our NHS looks like in response to a major incident. This is St Mary’s hospital today but I hold no doubt many other hospitals across London too. Once again hats off to the Met police and frontline emergency services. Proud to work with such amazing colleagues.” Two of the hospital trusts involved in the response – Guy’s and St Thomas’, and Imperial – have said their services are now running as normal. Supermarket Lidl has offered to help police after one of its bags was apparently used to hold the improvised bomb, PA reports. The German-owned grocery chain issued a statement just hours after social media photos of the affected District line carriage showed a still-burning bucket inside a Lidl-branded reusable bag. “We are shocked and concerned to have learned of an incident at Parsons Green this morning and our thoughts are with those affected,” Lidl UK said. “We will, of course, support the authorities should they need our assistance in their investigations. We are closely monitoring the situation as it develops over the course of the day.” Investigators have recovered what appears to be a circuit board from the scene where the device was placed. It is being examined for clues. The BBC security correspondent, Frank Gardner, says the security threat level could be raised from severe to critical if the intelligences services conclude that the suspected bomber is still on the loose. Scotland Yard has confirmed that no one has been arrested so far. The UK terrorism threat level is currently at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. If it goes critical this would mean an attack is expected imminently. The government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is meeting this afternoon. It is expected to make a decision about whether the threat level should change. Here’s more on Trump’s reaction to the explosion. Other world leaders used more diplomatic language. In the UK, leaders past and present have added their thoughts. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has condemned the suspected attack as “callous and indiscriminate”. More than 250 people were evacuated from a London Underground train not involved in the incident, the London fire brigade has revealed. Its director of operations, Tom George, said: “The brigade was called at 08:21 and firefighters were on the scene within three minutes. Fire crews assisted the London ambulance service in treating casualties on the affected train. “Firefighters also helped evacuate 253 people from a train not involved in the incident. We continue to support the Metropolitan police and other services at Parsons Green.” Both BBC and Sky News have been told that the IED had a timer fitted. The Guardian has so far been unable to confirm these reports. The official line from the Met is that a fire was caused by the detonation of an improvised device. No arrests have so far been made, Scotland Yard has confirmed. In its latest statement the Met said: So far there have been no arrests. We believe the fire was caused by the detonation of an improvised device, which is being forensically examined. Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, from the head of national counter-terrorism policing, said: “There are many urgent inquiries ongoing, with hundreds of detectives involved, looking at CCTV, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. “I am appealing for anyone who has information that would assist detectives to contact the hotline on 0800 789 321. I would also urge anyone with images or moving footage from the scene to upload them at www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk. “Today and over the weekend the public can expect to see a heightened police presence, particularly in crowded places and at transport hubs. “As always, we urge the public to remain calm but alert; if they have any concerns, see or hear anything suspicious then please contact the police on the confidential hotline 0800 789 321. In an emergency always call 999.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has told LBC radio: “There is a manhunt underway as we speak.” He said he was not allowed to say whether that meant a specific suspect was being sought. Earlier, speaking outside New Scotland Yard, Mark Rowley, the assistant Met commissioner, declined to answer questions about whether anyone was in custody. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has joined in condemnation of the attack: Once more people going about their everyday lives have been targeted in a callous and indiscriminate way. My thoughts are with all those injured and affected. The police and emergency services were quickly on the scene and I would like to pay tribute again to their professionalism and tireless commitment. I am receiving regular updates on what is an ongoing and active investigation. I would urge Londoners to remain alert and assist the police and emergency services as much as they can. A massive search is under way for whoever planted the home-made device on the tube carriage at Parsons Green. Detectives were examining CCTV from the London Underground network to determine where the perpetrators entered and exited the tube system. The tube network and London generally are well covered by CCTV cameras. The investigation, led by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and involving MI5, the domestic security service, will want to arrest those suspected of involvement in the attack before they can strike again. The improvised explosive device will be examined by forensic experts, and may provide clues from its construction and the chemicals used to make the explosive charge. Looking at why it did not fully detonate will give them clues as well. Counter-terrorism investigators are looking specifically for whoever carried the device, pictured on social media as being in a bucket, on to the tube carriage. They will also want to know how it was detonated – in person or somehow remotely? Furthermore, they will want to establish where the device was put together, and where the materials to make it were acquired from. Other key question are whether knowledge of how to build the device was obtained from a plethora of DIY guides on the internet, or from another person. Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said hundreds of detectives had been drafted into the investigation. The explosion at Parsons Green is the fifth terrorist attack to get through Britain’s defences since March 2017. Two in London and a bombing in Manchester were blamed on Islamist terrorism. A van attack in June was blamed on rightwing extremism. The terrorism threat level is set by the joint terrorism analysis centre (JTAC), which sits within MI5. In the immediate hours after the Parsons Green incident the threat remained at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. It was last raised to its maximum level in May for several days, after the suicide bombing attack on Manchester Arena, as investigators tried to satisfy themselves there were no bomb-making materials or suspects still at large, and thus intending and capable of attacking again. Similarly, after Parsons Green, senior counter-terrorism officials will want to gain control of any suspects and/or materials related to the attack. The Met has video of that Mark Rowley statement (see earlier for the text). NHS England said 22 people are now being treated by four hospital trusts across London. London ambulance service took 18 patients to hospital, while another four self-presented. South African Gillian Wixley, 36, who lives in Putney, was eight seats from the explosion. She said: I first heard a loud bang, followed by smoke and fire rising upwards. I was about eight seats away from where the explosion happened and immediately everyone started rushing off the train. It was chaotic: things were flying everywhere and people were falling over as they got off. There was lots of people panicking and people were injured due to the crush. It wasn’t a big explosion, more of a bang and then there was fire. It all happened very quickly. I heard a girl screaming, ‘Get off the train!’ Everyone rushed out and as I looked back I could see flames going up the wall. I was near the back of the train but toward the front people were running towards the exit. We were more worried about doing this because moving forward would mean moving past where the fire was. By the time I got to the stairs, for some reason they were not letting people down – maybe because of the crush of everyone trying to get out. But people were panicking and wanted to go know why they couldn’t move forward. One woman came up and I could see that the whole of her hair on one side was singed. She was holding her ear and saying: ‘I have to get out.’ Everyone responded very swiftly and moved aside so she could get down to get help. Everyone was very emotional. There was one boy maybe age 10 who was commuting to school on his own. He was sitting on the floor sobbing. He was obviously in shock and very scared. Everyone around him was trying to calm him down and help him. When I got out I sat on bench in the park. I was really in shock and everyone was just crying. I started to feel relieved I had escaped. I had not taken my normal commute route today. I was on my way to north London today to go on a volunteering day, working in a school for disabled children. I usually go to Bank station, so I don’t take the District and Circle line. I work in the City for a bank. I am very shaken up and still in shock about everything that happened this morning. Not looking forward to getting on a train again, but you have to just get on with things. The explosion happened on a platform, which is lucky – if you can say that. I am grateful it wasn’t worse. Stephen Cowan, leader of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham has described the attack as “disgusting” but praised the police and emergency services and appealed to the public for for calm. Speaking at the police cordon on Darlan Road, a couple of hundred of metres from where the Parsons Green attack happened, he said: “The police and all the emergency services have put in a very co-ordinated response. They were straight down there to reassure people and also to track down what had happened. “It is being treated as a terrorist incident as you would expect, but I would stress that people should remain calm and the situation is completely under control. I think that people that express themselves through terror, it’s atrocious and is anti everything we stand for and they should be tracked down and dealt with in the severest possible terms. The real issue is that London is a vibrant city and people are living side by side and working well and living well together and we should never let anyone do anything that threatens that culture. “Any terrorist attack is absolutely atrocious and a threat to the values we stand for, and it is disgusting what happened and that is why there has been a very co-ordinated response. The police and emergency services have once again acted extremely effectively and they have the area on lockdown and they are dealing with the incident ... We will never give in to this type of terrorism” Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust has activated a major incident plan. Police sources are playing down fears of a coordinated attack across the London transport network. On the train itself there is only one device being investigated. There is no second device. Sources also denied there was a knifeman on the train and said there was was no known further incident after the initial discovery of the IED. There is no belief that some sort of general bombing campaign of London’s transport network, such as 7/7 and 21/7 is under way. It is being treated as an isolated incident. Rory Rigney said he had just got on the tube train – one of the last to board – when the explosion happened only a few feet away. “I thought, ‘Did someone smash something?’ It sounded like a smash, then I heard a scream and thought ‘it’s someone having a fight’. Then I saw the fireball coming towards me – yellow or orange. My face still feels warm. I wasn’t hanging around to get a better look at it,” he told reporters. Rigney added: “It smelled like a fire extinguisher and there was this foam on the floor. It looked like foam from a fire extinguisher. And he described seeing “red wires” coming out of the bucket in the Lidl plastic bag. The 37-year-old from Dublin said he saw one woman who “looked like she had been burnt – they were pouring water on her face – and an older couple who weren’t as bad”. He described jumping off the train through the still-open doors as the fireball came towards him. The explosion, he said, “wasn’t massively loud but then there was a scream and then I looked down the corridor and there was a big flash of light coming down and my immediate reaction was just to jump”. Rigney told reporters: “The doors were still open, so I jumped out and tried to get as far away as possible, got on the ground and covered myself. I looked back and, obviously, there were so many people trying to get out they were falling on top of each other, so there was a bit of a crush at the door. People were just panicking getting away and there was a lot of screaming. “For the next, probably, 30 seconds, a minute, people were just getting on the ground. They didn’t know what to do, there was a lot of fear. I think about a minute or so passed, people [were] wondering actually what happened. We couldn’t say what kind of bang it was. There was still a smell ... No one was sure if it was an electrical explosion just from something on the train, so no one was – at that stage – thinking anything more sinister than that. “We just stayed around and people were grabbing their bags and phones from the train ... then we were being told to get off the platform, so that was ... up to five minutes till then and, at that stage, when we started moving down the stairs, we also saw the armed police coming up the other side. “When we got out, the emergency services were there ... and they were starting to cordon off the area and police were starting to take interviews from any people on the train who had information.” Donald Trump has urged the British police to be “proactive” in tackling terrorism. Here are his latest tweets: After the London Bridge attack in June, Trump criticised London mayor Sadiq Khan suggesting he was wrong to call for calm. Here’s what Rowley said: At 8.20 this morning at Parsons Green tube station there was an explosion on a tube train. Police have attended. We now assess that this was a detonation of an improvised explosive device. As you will have seen, there are reports of 18 injuries. I understand most of those to be flash burns. The scene currently remains cordoned off and the investigation continues. The investigation is being led by the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command. And there are many urgent inquiries ongoing now with hundreds of detectives involved looking at CCTV, forensics work and speaking to witnesses. This investigation is supported by our colleagues from MI5 bringing their intelligence expertise to bear on the case. Londoners can expect to see an enhanced police presence, particularly across the transport system across today. Any member of the public with any information about this incident should please call us as a matter of urgency. If they want to give us any background information they can call us on the anti-terrorism hotline on 0800 789 321. Anybody with images from the incident can contact us. I would ask the public to remain vigilant across London, but not to be alarmed. Asked if anyone was in custody, Rowley said: “It is very much a live investigation we are following down the lines of inquiry I said.” Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley says a suspected improvised explosive device, or IED, is thought to be responsible for the blast. Speaking at Scotland Yard he said more police would be deployed across London particularly on the transport network. He refused to say whether anyone had been arrested. Met police sources have said the device only partially exploded. Initial examination of the device by explosive experts have led them to conclude it was “viable”, meaning it was meant to explode more fully. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said he is praying for those caught up in the incident. Londoners have offered to “put the kettle on” for people affected by the explosion in Parsons Green, PA reports. As the station was evacuated and hordes of people flooded the area, Katy Dunn posted on Twitter: “If anyone is feeling shocked or confused at Parsons Green, I’m round the corner and the kettle’s on.” James Edge tweeted: “Anyone who’s now stuck in Parsons Green/Fulham drop me a line and I’ll get the kettle on!” Chelsea and Fulham Dentist, a five-minute walk away from the tube station, also offered people a place to shelter. Dentist Dahlia Sunba, who co-owns the practice with her husband, said: “I could see people wandering around aimlessly. “We can see helicopters overhead. It’s a little bit unnerving and people look slightly distressed. We have tea and coffee and biscuits. We’re more than happy to give them a cup of tea or coffee.” London ambulance service said 18 people had been taken to hospital following the explosion at Parsons Green. None were thought to be in a serious or life-threatening condition, it said in its latest update. It confirmed that its hazardous area response team was on the scene. Here’s a full report on what we know so far: Police forensic officers have been seen investigating trains where the explosion took place. Kevin Fitzgerald who lives next to the station witnessed the aftermath. I can see the tube platform at Parsons Green from my window where I live. As I was taking my son to school I opened my front door and suddenly heard lots of passengers screaming on the tube platform, which is above ground. My entire street filled with people leaving the station in a panic. Lots of people were running, some were crying and others were just walking really fast. They were all pouring out and I was worried something serious going on. I took my son back into the house to keep him safe and then went outside to find out more about what was happening. There was just so much confusion, some rumours were being spread about a knife man on the loose but I don’t think that was true. I live near the back end of tube so I am guessing most people were leaving via the front entrance. I have no idea how many people would have been injured but someone came out and said someone had been burned. There was one woman in floods of tears walking toward me and guy behind her on bike, and he was saying “it’s just an accident don’t worry”. No one knew what was happening and even though many people were leaving, some were still on the platforms. I don’t know whether they were hurt or witnesses but they were wandering up and down. Our street is now cordoned off and the police have told us to leave the house. My children are at school and we believe this is the safest place for them in the meantime. Olaniyi Shokumbi, 24, a fitness instructor, had joined the District line tube on the way to work. He said: “I had my headphones on and was listening to music. The train had got to Parsons Green. Some people had got off, some had got on. “I looked to my left and I saw hundreds of people running up. I heard shouting and screaming. I ran out as well. “It was tightly packed as we were all trying to get out of the station at the same time. People were pushing each other, falling on the floor. There were school kids. “I saw people jumping not caring where they landed or whether they broke bones. They were leaping over the barriers.” Amid the panic, he said he saw a woman on the floor. “I didn’t know whether she was breathing. There was a little boy on the train station, screaming and crying and saying he couldn’t find his little brother.” Shokumbi continued: “Coming out of the station, I initially thought it was an acid attack. I didn’t hear the explosion because I had my headphones on.” “I went to check my sister was alright at Lady Margaret school. Some girls had still not arrived and registered.” Shokumbi said the train had just started to move when the explosion occurred. “I just hope no one has lost their life. “I feel sorry for a lot of people. There was kids falling on the floor. It was crazy. It’s the time kids all go to school. “People started running from the back end of the train. I was about two or three carriages away. There was a lot of people running out.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the city “utterly condemns the hideous individuals who attempt to use terror to harm us and destroy our way of life”. He urged Londoners to “remain calm and vigilant”. A major incident has been declared at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington in response to the Parsons Green explosion. The United Kingdom terrorism threat level is at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. Since March 2017 at least three attacks blamed on an Islamist motivation have claimed lives in Britain, with officials saying that a further six plots have been thwarted. One attack in June was blamed on an extreme right wing motivation. On Thursday, reacting to news of a 68% increase in terrorism related arrests, the senior national coordinator for counter terrorism policing, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said:“There is no doubt that since March and following the attacks in London and Manchester we have seen a shift-change in momentum. But while the terrorist threat has increased in recent months, so has our activity; reflected by this significant increase in arrests. “We’re taking every possible opportunity to disrupt terrorist activity – be it making arrests for terrorism offences, intervening where there are signs of radicalisation, or working with communities to prevent terrorists operating in their area. “Police, together with the security services are determined to make the UK as hostile an environment for terrorists as possible.” Police say there have been a total of 19 foiled plots since June 2013. A police helicopter hovered low over Fulham Road which has been closed. Only ambulances and police cars are being allowed through. Buses that had their journeys abruptly terminated this morning are parked, empty, on the side of the road, beyond the security tapes. Flats and homes in a large area beyond the tube station are being evacuated. Peter, one of those injured in the incident, said his hair was singed and head burned by a “fireball”. Speaking to BBC News as he waited to be treated in a carpet shop in Wandsworth Bridge Road, he said: I heard a large bang on the other side of the tube train. Then this fireball above my head has come and singed all my hair. I’ve got burn marks to the top of my head. Everyone just ran off the train. It was quite scary. It was a really hot intense fireball above my head. There was a lot of people a lot worse than me. I saw a gentleman in a puffer jacket and the whole back of that had been burned. He had burn marks across his face which were a lot worse than mine. Mostly it was facial injuries, I didn’t see any blood as such. It was sheer panic. Everyone jumped off the train. New video shows passengers being evacuated from a tube train near Parsons Green. In a statement, Theresa May said: “My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and the emergency services who, once again, are responding swiftly and bravely to a suspected terrorist incident.” Theresa May is to chair a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee this afternoon to discuss the terrorist incident at Parsons Green, Downing Street announced. Neil Basu, Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, has confirmed this is a terrorist incident. In a statement the Met added that “a number of people” had suffered injuries. It said: It is too early to confirm the cause of the fire, which will be subject to the investigation that is now under way by the Met’s counter-terrorism command. The station remains cordoned off and we are advising people to avoid the area. Anyone who has information that would assist detectives is urged to contact the hotline 0800 789 321; if it’s an emergency always call 999. Anyone with images from the scene is asked to upload them to www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk We urge the public to remain calm but alert and if you have any concerns, see or hear anything suspicious then contact police. Police closed off the southern end of Kelvedon Road with tapes. Gautham Krishna was waiting at the tape to collect his daughter from Kensington Prep School which is behind the security cordon. “There’s a report of something else possibly in there,’” he said. “The girls and my wife are in there. They are doing great a security sweep.” The Metropolitan police have declared it a terrorist incident while investigations continue. British Transport Police has urged the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he is in contact with Scotland Yard about the incident. A young man, who declined to give his name, said he was on the tube at Parsons Green when the incident happened. He said: I left my flat this morning and walked down to the tube. It was about 8.15am. I got onto the first carriage of the train. It was heading into town, towards Earl’s Court. There was a terrible commotion and crying and stuff. They kept us on the train for five minutes and then they evacuated the station. I walked back to my flat [in nearby Kelvedon Road] but then the police came and told us to leave our homes. They have closed everything off. There are reports of another device. Passengers on the train behind the one that had the explosion witnessed terrified passengers sprinting away up the tracks, PA reports. They were then held in their train for over an hour before being evacuated on to the tracks themselves. Nicole Linnell, 29, who works for a fashion label, said: We saw people running down the tracks. About 30 or 40 people. They were running down the tracks outside our train. It was absolutely terrifying. Running on the tracks is the last thing you want to do so we were like ‘What’s going on?’ After about an hour we were evacuated off the train on to the tracks. About 10 to 15 people at a time. Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, S0 15, has taken the lead in the investigation, in an early indication about a possible motive. The inquiry into the explosion was initially led by British Transport Police [BTP]. A police source said a “major incident” has been declared by BTP. Sylvain Pennec, a software developer from Southfields, near Wimbledon, was around 10 metres from the source of the explosion when fire filled the carriage. “I heard a boom and when I looked there were flames all around,” he said. “People started to run but we were lucky to be stopping at Parsons Green as the door started to open.” He described the scene of panic as commuters struggled to escape the carriage, “collapsing and pushing” each other. Pennec stayed behind to take a closer look at what he believed was the source of the explosion. “It looked like a bucket of mayonnaise,” he said. “I’m not sure if it was a chemical reaction or something else, but it looked home made. I’m not an expert though.” Downing Street said Prime Minister Theresa May was “receiving regular updates” on the situation at Parsons Green. Passengers were seen being led off a train at Parsons Green, according to a series of images by Twitter user Laura G. Video has emerged showing a bucket on fire on a tube train as London Underground staff urged passengers to “get away”. Passengers reported seeing a device on a tube train at the station and hearing a bang during the Friday morning rush hour. One passenger, named only as Lucas, told BBC 5 live: I heard a really loud explosion - when I looked back there appeared to be a bag but I don’t know if it’s associated with it. I saw people with minor injuries, burnings to the face, arms, legs, multiple casualties in that way. People were helping each other. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has appealed for calm. Speaking to Sky News he said: I’m afraid my information is limited and it really is important not to speculate at the moment. Everybody should keep calm and go about their lives in as normal a way as they possible can. The British Transport Police, TFL are on it. And they will be updating their websites as and when we get more information. Witness Sham Shakil told BBC News that he saw several people “falling over themselves” as they tried to get out of Parsons Green station. London fire brigade said it had sent six fire engines and 50 firefighters to the incident. Fire crews from Fulham, Wandsworth, Chelsea, Hammersmith and other surrounding fire stations were in attendance, it said in statement. The tube service has been partially suspended in west London after reports of an explosion and injuries Parsons Green underground station. A Transport for London spokeswoman said the District line had been suspended between Earl’s Court and Wimbledon due to a security alert. The Metropolitan and British Transport police forces, including armed officers, were at the scene, along with the London ambulance service, though none was immediately able to provide further details on what had happened. A witness said there were injuries at the station after a “stampede” of passengers. BBC news reader Sophie Raworth said she had seen a woman with burns “from top to toe” being stretchered into an ambulance. Media technology consultant Richard Aylmer-Hall, 53, was sitting on the District line train bound for central London at about 8.20am when he said panic unfolded around him. “Suddenly there was panic, lots of people shouting, screaming, lots of screaming,” he said. “There was a woman on the platform who said she had seen a bag, a flash and a bang, so obviously something had gone off.” He added: “I saw crying women, there was lots of shouting and screaming, there was a bit of a crush on the stairs going down to the streets. Some people got pushed over and trampled on. I saw two women being treated by ambulance crews.” Armed police are at the scene. London Ambulance Service said it had sent multiple resources to the scene including a hazardous area response team. We will bring you more details here as soon as we have them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/15/story-of-our-fight-port-talbot-locals-play-steelworks-were-still-here","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T09:42:39Z","webTitle":"'The story of our fight': Port Talbot steel workers star in play about shutdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/15/story-of-our-fight-port-talbot-locals-play-steelworks-were-still-here","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/15/story-of-our-fight-port-talbot-locals-play-steelworks-were-still-here","fields":{"headline":"'The story of our fight': Port Talbot steel workers star in play about shutdown","bodyText":"The last acting part for Sam Coombes, a steelworker, was Robin Hood in the annual rugby club pantomime. Over the next two weeks he has a rather weightier role in a professional production telling the story of how he and his comrades at the Port Talbot plant in south Wales successfully battled a closure that threatened their livelihoods, their community and a whole way of life. “It’s a burden but a huge privilege,” said Coombes, who has been given unpaid leave to take part in the National Theatre Wales (NTW) play We’re Still Here. “This is a chance to tell the story from our point of view. It’s the story of our fight. It’s not gloom and doom. There’s a long way to go, but I do feel the fight is being won.” At the start of last year there was a distinct possibility that the Tata steelworks, which supports an estimated 18,000 jobs, would close. The people of Port Talbot did not roll over. A campaign called Save Our Steel was launched and after months of protests and talks a deal was reached that kept the plant alive, though at the cost of cuts to pension benefits. Journalists, industry analysts and academics continue to pore over the saga and its ramifications but this production, staged in a disused dockside factory, the Byass Works, is meant to tell the story through the voices of those directly involved. Writers and researchers from the NTW and the theatre company Common Wealth spent months interviewing Port Talbot people about the steel crisis and turned their stories into an energetic, vibrant, sometimes loud, punky and sweary production. “They have got the dialogue and banter bang on. It’s just like being in work,” said Coombes, a 29-year-old metallurgist, who followed his father and grandfather into the steelworks and will be back there at the start of October “unless Steven Spielberg comes calling”. Coombes said the stories of working-class heroes were not told often enough. “What happened last year is that we all got together and said: ‘No, we’re fighting for what is ours. Not just the steelworks but the whole community.’” While Coombes is part of the professional cast, the show also features members of the community appearing as themselves, among them Sian James, a college worker and the wife of Chris James, a steelworker, union rep and Labour councillor. She said the title of the piece summed up the mood of the town. “The community came together and is still together. There is still uncertainty – what happens in five years, what will happen if Tata sell. But whatever happens next, the community will be ready to fight.” Four teenagers also take starring roles. Dylan John, 15, said the last 18 months in the town had been intense. “The crisis made us picture a future without the steelworks. That was frightening,” he said. Dylan doesn’t see himself taking a job at the works – he would rather be an actor. “But it is crucial for the future of our town.” Evie Manning, a co-director of the play, said Common Wealth had been thinking about creating a piece about working-class leaders when the Port Talbot crisis blew up. “Media, politics and art are all being colonised by the middle and upper classes. It feels like the working class is being represented terribly,” she said. We’re Still Here is an attempt to begin to redress the balance. Up the road from the Byass Works, at the St Paul’s community centre, regulars have been fascinated to watch rehearsals in the function room. The centre’s administrator, Carol Powrie, said there was much more music and movement than she expected. “You don’t expect steelworkers dancing. That was a lot of fun. It’s a powerful story but I think people are still worried, still waiting for bad news. I don’t think people are confident.” Canon Nigel Cahill, rector of the Aberavon parish in Port Talbot, said he hoped We’re Still Here would boost the area in the same way as the NTW’s much-lauded production of The Passion, in which the Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, who grew up in Port Talbot, acted alongside local amateurs, did six years ago. “After the last production here in 2011 there was a marked improvement in people’s cheerfulness, hopefulness and general attitude. Partly I think it was confidence that people were taking an interest in their town.” Of course, it is true that there are those in the area who do not share the optimism and idealism of those directly involved. At the Aberafan shopping centre by a raised section of the M4, many were unaware of the production and gloomy for the long-term prospects for Port Talbot. Michael Cosker, who used to be a crane driver at the plant and now runs the Rolls Choice cafe, said he felt the workers sacrificed too much in the pension deal that kept the plant alive. “I think the men have given away more than they should have done,” he said. “Pensions like that are hard to come by.

Guardian Australia revealed in July that Medicare card details were offered for sale on a darknet auction site and that the vendor, provided with a journalist’s name and date of birth, was able to produce the requested Medicare number for a fee of 0.0089 bitcoin, or US$22. Another journalist at SBS repeated the experiment. Speaking at a Senate committee hearing into circumstances in which Medicare information has been compromised on Friday, Department of Human Services deputy secretary Caroline Edwards said she was confident the information had been accessed lawfully by a person at a medical service, who then used the information illegally by selling it online. “It was legitimate access to medicare numbers being used illegitimately,” Edwards said. “Happened to go through to the dark web, apparently, but we understand the vulnerability was a more traditional vulnerability, bad person doing a bad thing from a legitimate channel.” The Australian federal police has not completed its investigation of the security breach, but Edwards said it were confident the information was not accessed overseas. “We’re clear that this was not a cybersecurity breach,” she said. “We have always dealt with a situation where somebody steals 1,000 files at the local medical practice and goes and sells it down the pub. This is more akin to that circumstance.” Edwards said the department identified 165 people whose records may have been accessed illegally but did not find any evidence of false Medicare claims. Those 165 were notified and issued with new Medicare cards, but she added it was not necessarily connected to matters being investigated by the AFP. The darknet vendor told Guardian Australia they had sold the details of at least 75 Medicare cardholders, but the department said it had not confirmed that figure from its own systems. Medicare details can be accessed through the Health Professional Online Services (Hpos) scheme, which is run by the department of human services. It is set up to allow authorised users to search for a person’s Medicare details using their name, date of birth, and, if there are multiple results, their home suburb. Edwards said there were 163,000 authorised points of access to the Hpos scheme. The system keeps a log of all actions, which means that if a person knew roughly when their Medicare details were illegally accessed it would be possible to trace it back to a particular access point. The ability to purchase Medicare details on the darknet raised concerns about the security of Australia’s new My Health Record system, which will be rolled out on an opt-out basis to all Australians eligible for a Medicare card by the end of next year. The system is a digital repository of all the health information and records of registered patients. A Medicare number is one of five bits of personal information required to access the system, along with a person’s name, date of birth, gender and individual reference number. Australian Digital Health Agency chief executive Tim Kelsey rejected a suggestion by Greens Senator Richard di Natale that there was a direct link between obtaining Medicare details and potentially going on to obtain confidential medical records. Even if you had all the required information, Kelsey said, you would still need access to the software provided to authorised medical services and one of two forms of two-step verification. “You would have to have someone imitating you in your office, physically,” he said. “Obviously it’s never happened.” Online privacy advocates Paul Power, from E-Health Policy Australia, and software engineer Dr Robert Merkel, told the committee it was impossible to ensure the security of either the Hpos or My Health Record systems, because of the number of points of access. Power said the legitimate concerns of doctors and other healthcare providers that the scheme be easy to use and not restrict access to information and informed health care, particularly for vulnerable people who may not have the IT literacy to protect their own information or access to identification documents, had taken precedence over designing a secure system. “Serious security and privacy concerns for My Health Records are inevitable,” Merkel said. Merkel also criticised claims by both the government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners about the security of both the medicare system and security protocols used by GPs themselves, saying it was “not world class.” “Their system did not detect the access that was reported in The Guardian, so clearly it’s less than perfect.” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/19/australia-offers-pay-rohingya-refugees-return-myanmar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T23:02:51Z","webTitle":"Australia offers to pay Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/australia-offers-pay-rohingya-refugees-return-myanmar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/19/australia-offers-pay-rohingya-refugees-return-myanmar","fields":{"headline":"Australia offers to pay Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar","bodyText":"Australia is promising thousands of dollars to Rohingya refugees who agree to return to Myanmar, a country that has been accused of ethnic cleansing against the Muslim minority. Asylum seekers in the Australian-run detention centre on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island, have been pressured by officials to return to their home countries, even if they face violence. Papua New Guinea’s supreme court last year ruled the centre for around 800 people breached human rights, was illegal and must close. Australia has since ratcheted up efforts to clear the centre, offering up to A$25,000 to refugees agreeing to go home. Returning Rohingya to their country could put their lives at risk. Myanmar does not recognise the ethnic minority and has conducted military operations in Rohingya villages that the United Nations’ top human rights official branded “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. Close to 400,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, many with bullet wounds and stories of mass killings, as their villages burn. The Guardian understands up to seven Rohingya may be facing return from Manus Island and spoke to two refugees in PNG who said they were going back. Yahya Tabani, a 32-year-old Rohingya man who arrived in Australia in 2013 but was sent to Manus Island, said he had no choice but to return. “I don’t want to stay in PNG,” said Tabani, who used to sell mobile accessories. “I don’t want to die in PNG. I prefer to die in Myanmar. Probably Buddhist people are going to kill me as soon as I arrive in Myanmar … Australia doesn’t care if we live or we die.” He said he had been promised A$25,000 by the Australian Border Force. He had not yet received any money and does not have a bank account into which it can be paid. Tabani was waiting in the PNG capital Port Moresby for his travel documents. “I have no right to get citizenship and can’t go to school. I didn’t get any basic rights. Immigration [the Australian immigration department] said I have to live in PNG or go home.” He said he had been attacked by locals in PNG, who he claims killed another detainee, an Iranian man. They were looking for money, he said. Physical and sexual abuse has been reported on Manus, one asylum seeker was murdered by guards, while others have died from medical neglect and local residents and soldiers have stormed the centre. Another Rohingya refugee, currently held in Port Moresby ahead of a slated return to Myanmar, spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity for fear of recriminations against himself and his family. “I am going back because my family are being persecuted by the Myanmar government. My family are in a violent place. I need to save them and look after them.” He said he had been arrested in Myanmar previously, and feared further persecution upon return. “But the reason why I leave PNG is there is too much torturing, they treat us as prisoners and they kill us mentally. That is more scary for me, that’s what I decided to go back. Better is leaving PNG, I can see my parents before Australia and PNG authorities make me a fool mentally, or killed physically.” The Australian and PNG governments have vowed the Manus detention centre will be completely shut down by 31 October. Officials have been withdrawing basic services in different sections to force people out. “It would be unthinkable to send any Rohingya back to Myanmar – in the midst of the military’s ethnic cleansing campaign against them,” said Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch. “Sending them home right now would be a death sentence.” She said the move “speaks volumes about the dangerous conditions and hopelessness that refugees on Manus have had to endure, that Rohingya refugees would even contemplate going back in ... the midst of an ethnic cleansing campaign”. The Obama administration agreed to consider resettling in the US up 1,250 men, woman and children refugees sent by Australia to Manus Island and Nauru. But Donald Trump described the agreement as a “dumb deal” and in his first phone call with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, asked: “Why have you not let them into your society?... Maybe you should let them out of prison.” On the offshore detention islands, faith in the American agreement is fading. The US is not obliged to take a single refugee under the deal, only to consider them for resettlement, and 10 months after the deal was struck, no one has been accepted to go to the US. In Canberra the Australian government has resolutely maintained no one detained on Manus or Nauru will ever be resettled in Australia. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection referred questions to the government of Papua New Guinea. On Tuesday, when the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, was asked if Australia would consider taking any Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar, she said Australia wanted them to return to their country if possible. Speaking from New York, where she has been attending United Nations meetings, she said Australia was providing a further $15m in humanitarian support to ease the crisis, particularly to Bangladesh. “We want to see a ceasefire, an end to the violence, and then for the Rohingyas to be able to return to Rakhine state,” she told the ABC’s AM program. “That was the collective view around the table of ministers, that we wanted to see the Rohingyas return to their homes. “So I’m afraid there’s going to be considerable discussion here about the best way to achieve that. But nevertheless, the international community appeared to be united in its concerns to ensure that Rakhine state is stabilised and we can bring peace and security to it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/15/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-15-september","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:34:02Z","webTitle":"Politics Live – readers' edition: Friday 15 September","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/15/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-15-september","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/15/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-15-september","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live – readers' edition: Friday 15 September","bodyText":"I’m not writing my usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

Friday morning rush-hour commuters faced major disruptions as no trains were able to operate between Milton Keynes and Euston due to the overnight fire at a factory and offices. A trackside wall was damaged in the blaze and had to be dismantled and made safe before rail services could resume. Lines reopened at 1pm although an amended timetable was in place and passengers were urged to check for updates from their train operator or to visit the National Rail website before they travelled. More than 50 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a timber yard in Harrow, north-west London. A two-storey warehouse was destroyed. Social media users reported hearing explosions and London fire brigade said 12 people had been evacuated from nearby homes as a precaution. Fire station manager Jason Jones, who was at the scene, said: “We had a very well developed fire, which was extremely visible from quite a way out. There were propane cylinders involved so a hazard zone was set up as cylinders can explode when exposed to heat.” He said the crews worked hard at the site, which is next to Headstone Lane station, to bring the fire under control. The fire brigade was called at 11.47pm, and eight engines and 58 firefighters were sent to the fire. It was under control by 3.17am. Passengers on a London Midland service from London Euston to Milton Keynes were evacuated from a train at Headstone Lane. The cause of the fire is not yet known.Footage posted on Twitter on Thursday night showed the fire burning in the warehouse and an explosion. Annie Naz, who filmed the incident, said she saw smoke and flames as she was about to go to sleep just before midnight. She called the emergency services and “within five minutes, everyone was out of their houses”. She said she heard “three massive bangs”, which she attributed to the propane cylinders firefighters have since confirmed were inside the building."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/sep/15/sam-bradford-alex-smith-nfl-vikings-chiefs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Why Bradford and Smith may remain the NFL's most exciting quarterbacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/15/sam-bradford-alex-smith-nfl-vikings-chiefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/15/sam-bradford-alex-smith-nfl-vikings-chiefs","fields":{"headline":"Why Bradford and Smith may remain the NFL's most exciting quarterbacks","bodyText":"A year after Jared Goff and Carson Wentz were selected one and two overall in the NFL Draft, five months after the Bears traded up to take Mitchell Trubisky and days after DeShaun Watson made his NFL debut, it’s looking like the league may have a new batch of quarterback superstars. But it’s not any of those young quarterbacks who are taking the leap, at least not yet. No, the NFL’s new superstar QBs are ... Sam Bradford and Alex Smith? Really? OK. Sure. Bradford and Smith, with a combined 19 years of NFL service entering this season and exactly no one’s pick for breakthrough players, both put up eye-popping numbers in Week 1. Smith had a career game in the NFL opener last Thursday, throwing for 368 yards a four touchdowns in an upset of the Patriots at Gillette Stadium, and Bradford went for 27-for-32 for 346 yards and three touchdowns in Minnesota’s opening win on Monday night. Of course, many a terrible sports column has been written using a small sample size from early in a season. Remember the great Ryan Fitzpatrick rise of 2015? Yeah. That didn’t quite pan out. But there are legitimate reasons to think Smith and Bradford can continue to produce like this. Maybe not 350 yards and 3 TDs every week, but Top 10 or higher quarterback play over the full season – essentially the jump Matt Ryan made last year in his ninth NFL season. Entering the season, Bradford and Smith were seen as exactly average NFL quarterbacks. Nowhere near the Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers level that has television broadcasters fanning themselves after each pass, but also far from the punchline status of the warm bodies that occupy the QB positions for the Jets and Jaguars. Smith and Bradford are not players their teams have ever rushed to replace, nor are they guys who wouldn’t quickly be dumped if a clearly better option became available. As one (highly-esteemed) columnist once said of Smith, his NFL career could succinctly be described as: “¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.” But in the case of Bradford, at least, Week 1 was not some fluke or aberration. In fact, he has now thrown for three touchdowns in each of his last three games dating back to last season. Three games is still a small sample size, though, so let’s extend it all the way back to Week 9 of the 2016 season, when Pat Shurmur was named offensive coordinator in place of Norv Turner. Shurmur, Bradford’s coordinator in St. Louis in 2010 and Philadelphia in 2015, has helped his quarterback take the Vikings offense to heights not seen since Brett Favre was gunslinging all over the Metrodome in 2009. In Bradford’s 10 games under Shurmur in Minnesota, he has put up 15 touchdowns, four interceptions and 2,781 yards – numbers that project to 4,449 yards, 24 TDs and just 6 INTs over a full season. Not exactly mid-rate QB production. Despite Bradford now being in his eighth NFL season and nearing 30, we are really only now getting our first fair and extended look at the 2010 No1 overall pick. After playing in every game in his rookie season – and playing fairly well for a first-year QB, including breaking Peyton Manning’s record for rookie completions – Bradford missed nearly half of his second season with a high ankle sprain. The next year he posted solid numbers and then in 2013, after coming out of the gate strong with 14 TD and 4 INTs in just seven games, went down with a torn ACL. That same, surgically-repaired ACL, blew out on him again in the 2014 preseason, costing the whole season. Then there was a one-year stop with the Eagles during whatever Chip Kelly was trying to do to in Philadephia, followed by a surprising trade to Minnesota before the 2016 season. For all his NFL service, Bradford has had none of the health or stability a quarterback needs to really excel. He has that finally and, with receiver Stephon Diggs and Adam Theilen, two high-end receiver targets. Lack of stability has not been a legitimate excuse for Alex Smith. Despite missing just three games in his five seasons with the Chiefs, Smith’s claim to fame is being the first name that pops into football fans’ heads when hearing “game manager.” I’d say his picture would be beside the term in the dictionary, but photos feel too flashy for Alex Smith’s game. But once upon a time, this very same Alex Smith actually ran a high-flying offense. In his final year at Utah in 2004, Smith threw for 32 touchdowns to just four interceptions, and also ran for 631 yards and 10 TDs. He was so dynamic — yes, Alex Smith, dynamic — that San Francisco used the No1 overall pick on him in 2005. But since entering the NFL, and leaving Urban Meyer’s spread offense, Alex Smith has been the king of the conservative checkdown. That was, until last Thursday night in New England when Andy Reid and Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy decided to bust out some of the spread playbook to showcase the all-around abilities of playmakers Kareem Hunt and Tyreek Hill. But in doing so, we were all reminded what Smith is capable of in an offense that actually attacks. Kansas City’s Week 2 game in Philadelphia will tell us if Smith’s opening night performance was an aberration or a look at things to come. If the game plan goes back to being more conservative than a Fox News host, Smith will go back to being … well, Alex Smith. Considering the NFL track records of Reid and Smith, playing it safe might unfortunately be the path they choose. But if the dynamic offense is here to stay, Alex Smith, the NFL’s official game manager, could have his NFL breakout season at the young age of 33. And then the only question might be if he or Sam Bradford is the NFL’s most exciting quarterback."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/16/social-media-stars-face-crackdown-over-money-from-brands","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T23:26:40Z","webTitle":"Social media stars face crackdown over money from brands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/16/social-media-stars-face-crackdown-over-money-from-brands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/16/social-media-stars-face-crackdown-over-money-from-brands","fields":{"headline":"Social media stars face crackdown over money from brands","bodyText":"Consumer protection bodies in the UK and US are increasing their crackdown on Instagram “influencers”, in an attempt to rein in the big business being done covertly on social media. Instagram’s popularity with young people, and women in particular – in April it reported 700 million members – has led to a roaring trade between marketers and so-called influencers with large and engaged followings. Members of the Kardashian family, who promote a range of products from “detox” tea to waist-training corsets to their tens of millions of followers, can reportedly command as much as $500,000 (£370,000) per post. But even lower-profile celebrities can make a profit from the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. Elizabeth Olsen, who plays an influencer in the forthcoming film Ingrid Goes West, has attracted 745,000 followers since she joined Instagram for the first time in May, telling the LA Times: “Financially, it’s a brilliant opportunity. I was only hurting my opportunities by not participating.” With many paid-for promotions not disclosed, the blurry line between advertisements and heartfelt recommendations has led consumer protection bodies to take action against influencers for pushing brands they have received payment from. In the UK, influencers have had to identify advertisements with the hashtags “#ad” or “#spon” (sponsored) since 2014. In April, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found the makeup blogger Sheikhbeauty to have breached the CAP Code for non-broadcast advertisements by failing to clearly label a post about a herbal detox tea brand as an advertisement. This week the ASA ordered the reality television personality Sophie Kasaei to remove her own photo of the Flat Tummy Tea she had shared with her 1 million-plus followers in March. Though Kasaei had appropriately labelled the image an advertisement, the ASA upheld two issues with her post in its ruling on Wednesday. Kasaei’s assertion that the tea could reduce water weight was found to be in violation of rules for marketing containing nutrition or health claims. In the second part of the ruling, the name “Flat Tummy Tea” itself was found to have violated regulations because it did not make reference to a health or nutrition claim that was authorised on the EU’s register. A spokesman for the ASA said that a brand name, in an advertisement, cannot refer to health-related wellbeing without appearing alongside an authorised health or nutrition claim, “which Nomad Choice Pty did not provide us with”. He said the ASA was not asking that Flat Tummy Tea change its name, but its ruling did “make it very difficult” for it to be used in an advertisement. In recent years the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also ramped up its efforts to get influencers to “clearly and conspicuously” disclose their relationships to brands. Letters from the FTC to celebrities reminding them of their obligations noted that many disclosures had not been sufficiently clear. “Many consumers will not understand a disclosure like ‘#sp,’ ‘Thanks [Brand]’, or ‘#partner’ to mean that the post is sponsored”, it said. Last week the FTC was in contact again with 21 of the original group, who received letters seeking clarity about specific posts that had been identified as potentially non-compliant. Reuters reported that the models Naomi Campbell and Amber Rose and actors Lindsay Lohan, Vanessa Hudgens and Sofia Vergara were among those asked to respond by 30 September. The FTC also updated its staff guidance document on influencers and endorsements for the first time since 2015. Despite the US agency’s efforts to bring influencers to heel, much “#sponcon” remains unidentified. Analysis of the 50 most-followed celebrities on Instagram by the US marketing firm Mediakix in May found that 93% of posts promoting a brand were not compliant with the FTC guidelines. Instagram recently confirmed that it would soon begin rolling out use of a “Paid partnership with” tag to “more clearly communicate when a commercial relationship exists between a creator and a business”. It would be tied to the platform’s first-ever branded content policy, restricting the posting of sponsored content to accounts with access to the tag. In the meantime, the FTC hopes that its first action against individual social media influencers, settled last week, will send a message to others. On 7 September the American Trevor “TmarTn” Martin and the Briton Thomas “Syndicate” Cassell settled FTC charges that they had deceptively endorsed an online gambling service while failing to disclose that they jointly owned the company. The FTC had also alleged Martin and Cassell had paid gaming influencers between $2,500 and $55,000 to promote the company, CSGO Lotto, without requiring them to disclose the payments. Under the settlement the pair would be liable for hefty fines if found to have broken FTC rules in the future. Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting FTC chair, said consumers needed to know when influencers were being paid by the brands endorsed in their posts. “This should send a message that such connections must be clearly disclosed so consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/14/billy-vunipola-england-lions-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T19:10:14Z","webTitle":"England’s Billy Vunipola has no regrets over pulling out of Lions tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/14/billy-vunipola-england-lions-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/14/billy-vunipola-england-lions-injury","fields":{"headline":"England’s Billy Vunipola has no regrets over pulling out of Lions tour","bodyText":"Billy Vunipola has defended his decision to withdraw from the summer’s British &amp; Irish Lions tour because of a shoulder injury, saying that “otherwise I’d be letting people down” and insisting “there are more important things in life”. Writing in his new book, Wrecking Ball, Vunipola explains it was a long-standing shoulder injury that forced him to pull out of the touring squad, just hours before he was due to join a Lions training camp. Vunipola withdrew from the Lions squad the day after Saracens’ last game of the season against Exeter in May because of his shoulder injury. He was due to report for a training camp in Dublin but opted against travelling to Ireland, despite Warren Gatland asking him to do so. Instead, Vunipola underwent surgery and is expected to make his comeback ahead of schedule for Saracens against Newcastle in Philadelphia on Saturday. At the time it was considered a huge blow to the Lions’ chances in New Zealand but the squad, that featured Billy’s brother Mako, proceeded to claim an unlikely drawn series against the All Blacks. The 24‑year‑old No8, who would have been a likely starter on the tour, says he has no doubts over the decision and that it was not influenced by anybody else. “My conscience told me that I shouldn’t go on the tour because otherwise I’d be letting people down,” Vunipola writes in the book. “I’m not saying that from a selfish point of view, as if I wanted to go to New Zealand and be the star. But I didn’t think I’d be able to help the team in a positive way on the pitch. What was the point in touring if I was going to be a hindrance? “Having learned from so many experiences, I’m now at a stage where I’m confident in what I stand for and what I believe in, so I have no doubts that I made the right decision. “And it was my decision. It was important for me to show that I was mature enough to make the call myself and not wait for somebody else to do it for me. Sometimes my body just can’t keep up with all the demands I place on it, and that’s just the nature of the beast. The injury was something that happened a long time before the tour. I tried to tough it out but the timing wasn’t right for me on that occasion.” While Vunipola is yet to feature for Saracens this season, he did take part in England’s pre-season training camp in Teddington last month. Asked about the No8 during the camp, England’s head coach, Eddie Jones, described Vunipola as having “the potential to be the best player in the world”. Next Wednesday marks exactly two years until the 2019 World Cup and Vunipola has said that the prospect of taking part in the tournament in Japan has softened his Lions blow. “What helped me out massively was the realisation, which I’d had a couple of years before, that I should never define myself by rugby – there really are more important things in life,” he writes. “When I die, I don’t want to be remembered for whether I went on a Lions tour or not. I’d much rather be known for whether I was a kind or honest person. To me, that’s way more important. “There’s an absolute stack of rugby still on the horizon in any case, with a World Cup around the corner and loads more Six Nations and Saracens action to come. So I can’t look at it in any other way than I’m in a privileged position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/20/end-of-white-christian-america","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"We're at the end of white Christian America.

On the Christian Broadcasting Network last year, he summarized his own theological position with the phrase: “God is the ultimate.” And in the conservative mind, American Christianity has long been hitched to whiteness. The right learned, over the second half of the 20th century, to talk about this connection using abstractions like “Judeo-Christian values”, alongside coded racial talk, to let voters know which side they were on. But change is afoot, and US demographics are morphing with potentially far-reaching consequences. Last week, in a report entitled America’s Changing Religious Identity, the nonpartisan research organization Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) concluded that white Christians were now a minority in the US population. Soon, white people as a whole will be, too. The survey is no ordinary one. It was based on a huge sample of 101,000 Americans from all 50 states, and concluded that just 43% of the population were white Christians. To put that in perspective, in 1976, eight in 10 Americans were identified as such, and a full 55% were white Protestants. Even as recently as 1996, white Christians were two-thirds of the population. White Christianity was always rooted in the nation’s history, demographics and culture. Among North America’s earliest and most revered white settlers were Puritan Protestants. As well as expecting the return of Christ, they sought to mould a pious community which embodied their goals of moral and ecclesiastical purity. They also nurtured a lurid demonology, and hunted and burned supposed witches in their midst. These tendencies – to millennialism, theocracy and scapegoating – have frequently recurred in America’s white Christian culture. Successive waves of religious revival, beginning in the 18th century, shaped the nation’s politics and its sense of itself. In the 1730s, the preacher Jonathan Edwards sought not only the personal conversion of his listeners, but to bring about Christ’s reign on Earth through an increased influence in the colonies. As the religious scholar Dale T Irvin writes: “By the time of the American revolution, Edwards’s followers had begun to secularize this vision of a righteous nation that was charged with a redemptive mission in the world”. This faith informed the 19th-century doctrine of manifest destiny, which held that the spread of white settlement over the entire continent was not only inevitable, but just. The dispossession of native peoples, and the nation’s eventual dominance of the hemisphere, was carried out under an imprimatur with Christian roots. In the late 20th century, another religious revival fed directly into the successes of conservative politics. Preachers like Billy Graham and Jimmy Swaggart – in spectacular revival meetings and increasingly on television – attracted millions of white converts to churches which emphasized literalist interpretations of the Bible, strict moral teachings and apocalyptic expectations. In the south, the explosion of evangelical churches coincided with a wave of racial reaction in the wake of the civil rights movement. After being a Democratic stronghold, the south became solidly Republican beginning in the early 1970s. The Republican “southern strategy” used race as a wedge issue to attract white votes in the wake of the civil rights movement, but it also proffered a socially conservative message that gelled with the values of the emerging Christian Right. In succeeding decades, Republicans have used this mix to help elect presidents, put a lock on Congress, and extend their dominance over the majority of the nation’s statehouses. Leaders of the Christian right became figures of national influence, and especially in the Bush years, public policy was directed to benefit them. The author of The End of White Christian America, Robert P Jones, says it is “remarkable how fast” the trend is moving. In 2008, white Christians were still 50% of the population, so that “there’s been an 11-point shift since Barack Obama’s election”. According to Jones, there are two big reasons for this shift. One is “the disaffiliation of young people in particular from Christian churches”. That is, especially among the young, there are proportionally fewer Christians. If trends continue, that means that there will be fewer and fewer Christians. While two-thirds of seniors are white Christians, only around a quarter of people 18-29 are. To varying degrees, this has affected almost every Christian denomination – and nearly four in 10 young Americans have no religious affiliation at all. The “youngest” faiths in America – those with the largest proportion of young adherents – are non-Christian: Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. This reflects the second big driver of white Christian decline: both America and its family of faiths are becoming less white. The big picture is the steady erosion of America’s white majority. Due mostly to Asian and Hispanic immigration, and the consolidation of already established immigrant populations, white people will be a minority by 2042. This will be true of under-18s as soon as 2023. According to Pew’s projections, in the century between 1965 and 2065, white people will have gone from 85% of the population to 46%. Perhaps inevitably, this is being reflected in a more diverse religious landscape. Martin Luther King Jr once lamented: “It is appalling that the most segregated hour of Christian America is 11 o’clock on Sunday morning.” Even now, historically black denominations exist on parallel tracks with almost exclusively white churches, with little or no changes to their racial makeup. But other churches are beginning to reflect the country’s increasing diversity. The Catholic church provides a stark illustration. In the 1980s, white people outnumbered non-white people in Catholic churches by a 10-to-one margin. Now, thanks mostly to a large number of Hispanic parishioners, and the apostasy of young white people, Jones says that the church is “almost reaching parity”, and “in many areas of the country the church is majority Latino”. From the colonial period onward, explains John Turner, “the vast majority of white settlers would have considered themselves Protestant”. While the most ingrained narratives of North American history depict it as a haven for minority sects, this varied considerably by colony. “People talk about the US as a Christian nation, but a better description would be a white Protestant nation that often made life uncomfortable for other groups,” says Turner. He points to anti-Catholic nativism in the 19th century, which was driven by a belief that “the world is divided between Christ and anti-Christ, with Catholics on the other side of the divide”. This frequently led to violence. In 1834, a mob burned an Ursuline convent near Boston. On 6 August 1855, known afterwards as “Blood Monday”, 22 people died when another mob attacked an Irish Catholic neighborhood. In 1854 the American party – also known as the “Know Nothings” – won 42 congressional seats on a populist, anti-Catholic platform. Two years later, their presidential candidate, Millard Fillmore, got a fifth of the vote. Another example of Protestants making life uncomfortable for others was the persecution of America’s own Mormon church, founded in 1830. In the 19th century, Turner says, “many Protestant Americans rejected the idea that Mormonism was really a religion at all”. Early Mormon history was marked by a series of violent attacks by non-Mormons, and subsequent escapes to new gathering places. This repeated ostracism and violence led eventually to their overland trek to the Great Salt Lake, far from their often murderous Protestant antagonists, where they founded Utah. From the 1890s and especially during the Great Depression, Jews were the victims of both ambient antisemitic sentiments and violent hate crimes, especially in the cities of the north-east. The story of American Protestantism has not been all about persecution, of course. Protestant clergy and lay people have played a part in progressive struggles – from abolition, to the civil rights movement, to manning the barricades in Charlottesville. Many mainstream denominations have a decidedly liberal cast on social and economic issues. Politicized white Christian identity remains a potent force on the right. Jones points out that the Republican party’s base has remained “overwhelmingly white and Christian”, with their decline inside the GOP tent much less dramatic than in the nation as a whole: their share of the Republican voting coalition declined only slightly over the past decade, from 81% in 2006 to 73% now. Republican policies and priorities continue to reflect this influence. In the platform adopted at the nomination of Donald Trump, the party affirmed commitments to anti-abortion measures (including the defunding of Planned Parenthood), condemned the supreme court’s decision to allow same-sex marriage, and promised to “bar government discrimination” against individuals and businesses who refused service to same-sex couples. Trump himself has issued an executive order that prevents the enforcement of the so-called “Johnson amendments”, which stop organizations with tax-exempt status from engaging in partisan political campaigning. These measures have limited the political advocacy of churches on the Christian right, and Trump’s move (which he overstated as a repeal) is a reward to evangelicals. Even Trump’s promises of a wall and an immigration crackdown reflect the values of white evangelicals, who among all faith groups are the most hostile to immigration. White Christians are wedded to the GOP; Hawley remarks that “white Christians remain the base of the GOP, and I would expect them to remain so”. In a two-party system, the overwhelming whiteness of the Republican party has seen Democrats “following the trends, and becoming more diverse”. Democrats are heavily favored by black and Hispanic Americans, including Hispanic Catholics, by young people, and by the growing number of religiously unaffiliated Americans. For years, these trends have produced optimism among Democrats – their coalition appears to resemble America’s future, whereas the Republicans appear mired in the past, with a shrinking base. Even Republicans have been growing alarmed: the famous “autopsy” document produced by Reince Priebus’s RNC in the wake of Mitt Romney’s defeat urged the party to reach out to Latinos with, among other things, meaningful immigration reform. A glance at the present, however, shows Republicans in charge of Congress, the presidency, and a majority of statehouses, and Trump looking to implement the stridently anti-immigrant, Christian right-friendly platform he was elected on. Turner says that in the short term, changing demography will not necessarily guarantee election results: “For a long time people have been saying that the marriage of Republican politics to white Christians was a losing game, but it wasn’t last year.” And it bears saying that nothing guarantees that Latinos, African Americans, or other non-white groups in America will remain loyal Democrats. White Christianity is not an immutable category. After all, white Catholics and Mormons – formerly the targets of Protestant persecution – have themselves become a part of the white Christian coalition. Last week John Judis, previously a leading advocate of “demography is destiny” predictions about an emerging Democratic majority, recanted, remarking: “Whiteness is not a genetic category, after all; it is a social and political construct that relies on perception and prejudice. A century ago, Irish, Italians, and Jews were not seen as white. Jones, though, thinks that even if the trends aren’t decisive in the short term, “sooner or later these demographic realities will show up” in national elections. He adds: “We need to remember how close the 2016 election was.” He says “there is a lag”, but by 2024 the changes will have become electorally decisive, and for Republicans the problem will increasingly be that “when one part of your base is so large and vocal, it becomes hard to pivot”. Republicans’ white Christian base in large part wants to slow immigration or even halt it altogether – but it may be that that ship has sailed. If Republicans cannot change, they may find that the country has changed around them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/15/overfishing-north-sea-likely-reduce-meps-vote-fishing-quotas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T10:26:34Z","webTitle":"Overfishing of North Sea may reduce after MEPs vote on fishing quotas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/15/overfishing-north-sea-likely-reduce-meps-vote-fishing-quotas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/15/overfishing-north-sea-likely-reduce-meps-vote-fishing-quotas","fields":{"headline":"Overfishing of North Sea may reduce after MEPs vote on fishing quotas","bodyText":"The European parliament has voted on a series of measures likely to reduce overfishing in the North Sea which will affect the UK’s fishing fleet until Brexit takes effect and potentially beyond. The vote ensures that there will be limits to fishing quotas so that they cannot exceed levels regarded as sustainable by scientists. The outcome had been in doubt as MEPs voted on Thursday, but several amendments aimed at watering down the proposals were rejected. The North Sea is one of Europe’s biggest fishing grounds, especially for key commercial species such as cod and haddock. But the UK has threatened to withdraw from the EU common fisheries policy (CFP) as part of Brexit, which would throw the future of fishing stocks in the area into doubt. The proposals will now be finalised by member states. Even after Brexit, the UK will have a strong interest in how the key fishing grounds of the North Sea are managed. There is still the possibility that the government will choose to remain part of the EU common fisheries policy, or abide by its quota limits from the outside, in order to avoid a situation of conflict over the existing stocks. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The UK welcomes the vote on the North Sea Multi-Annual Plan which aims to secure the long-term sustainability of North Sea fish stocks and provide stability for fishermen in the region. As we leave the European Union, we will continue to work closely with our neighbours to champion sustainable fishing. Once we have taken back control of our waters, we will be able to ensure our fish stocks are managed more sustainably while also helping the UK fishing industry to thrive.” Andrew Clayton, project director at the Pew Trusts, said: “MEPs have again stepped in to defend the ambitious fisheries reforms the EU agreed four years ago, and hold reluctant fisheries ministers to account on their commitments. This multi-annual plan has the potential to end overfishing in the North Sea and provide healthy stocks and productive fisheries. Now fisheries ministers need to make more urgent progress in delivering this.” At present, more than 40% of fish stocks in the North Sea – the most productive sea in Europe – are overfished. Scientists estimate that if managed sustainably, stocks could produce an additional 1.45m tonnes of fish a year within the next 10 years. Key species could fare well under a stock protection programme, meaning catches of cod and haddock could be increased fourfold within a decade. However, if the UK opts to leave the CFP as part of Brexit, there could be increased pressure on fish stocks as sustainability targets agreed by the EU would no longer be binding, and EU fisheries ministers would come under pressure from their domestic fishing fleets to allow greater catches in order to compete with the UK. Environmental campaigners fear that the slow progress towards recovering fisheries stocks, hard won over the last two decades, could be wiped out in such a scenario."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/14/mountain-between-us-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T20:13:01Z","webTitle":"The Mountain Between Us review – Kate Winslet and Idris Elba heat up snowy romance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/14/mountain-between-us-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/14/mountain-between-us-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"The Mountain Between Us review – Kate Winslet and Idris Elba heat up snowy romance","bodyText":"One of the many problems with the overstuffed awards season we’re now entering is that films with some element of prestige, at least on paper, are judged solely on their Oscar potential. The Mountain Between Us has been viewed from the outset as a major contender. There’s the pairing of Kate Winslet and Idris Elba – check. The director Hany Abu-Assad, whose credits include two Oscar-nominated films – check. Based on a book – check. A premiere at the Toronto film festival – check. A fall release date – check. Oh, and a story that plays into the Academy’s adoration of stories about survival – check. But entering the cinema with such lofty expectations does the film a major disservice. If judged through the lens of how Oscar-worthy it is, then it’s a non-starter (which might explain some sniffy early reviews) but as an unpretentious and unashamedly mainstream romantic adventure, it’s a solidly entertaining diversion, old-fashioned in its no-frills brand of storytelling and direction. Alex (Kate Winslet) is a photojournalist, on assignment for the Guardian, in a rush to get to her wedding. Ben (Idris Elba) is a surgeon in a rush to get to the operating room. But the pair find themselves grounded when a storm causes major delays and after a chance encounter, Alex hatches an unlikely plan: they will pay a local resident and charter a small aircraft over the snowy wilderness to Denver. Mid-air, tragedy strikes and their pilot has a stroke, causing them to crash. Both are injured, freezing and surviving on a small supply of ever-diminishing food. As they’re forced to rely on each other to get out alive, an attraction starts to grow. There’s something admirably to the point about the way The Mountain Between Us unfolds. It zips along at a tightly controlled pace and, as scripted by the About a Boy and Rogue One screenwriter Chris Weitz, the dialogue is refreshingly brisk and often quite witty. It doesn’t take long for the pair to find themselves stranded and the crash that gets them there is choreographed with ferocious efficiency. Abu-Assad, known for Paradise Now and Omar, makes his English language debut here, and it might seem like a strange fit given the film’s generic nature, but he handles the panicked set-pieces with ease. While the stakes are clearly high, there’s something comforting about how the film avoids an overly grueling tone. It’s an adventure but it’s also a starry romance and there’s a smooth handling of the two genres that makes it an easy, glossy ride, despite the situation. Given the fact that it’s essentially a two-hander ( there’s a dog as well, of course), it’s all heavily reliant on the appeal of the two leads. Winslet, who tried and failed with the similar mushy throwback Labor Day, gives a committed, warm performance but it’s Elba who really gets the chance to flex his often miscast movie star muscle. Despite his talents, he’s been stuck in a string of thankless blockbusters from Prometheus to Pacific Rim to Star Trek: Beyond to this summer’s The Dark Tower, but this is arguably his best mainstream film role to date. He’s a charming romantic lead and there’s a nice gender role flip-flop in the film, with his character defined as overly cautious and timid while Winslet is the reckless, adventurous type. The pair also have just about enough chemistry to make you root for them and even though the film starts to sag in the final stretch, there’s an ending that works in spite of its predictability. In a film such as this, there’s no room for cynicism. It’s unsophisticated and hugely familiar (hardened viewers will spot the plot developments a mile off) but there’s an earnest, simple satisfaction to be had, buoyed by two engaging star leads. Lower your expectations. The Mountain Between Us is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US and UK on 6 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/14/tensions-surface-uk-us-iran-nuclear-deal-rohingya","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T19:14:04Z","webTitle":"Tensions surface between UK and US over Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/14/tensions-surface-uk-us-iran-nuclear-deal-rohingya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/14/tensions-surface-uk-us-iran-nuclear-deal-rohingya","fields":{"headline":"Tensions surface between UK and US over Iran nuclear deal","bodyText":"Tensions between the US and UK over whether to tear up the Iran nuclear deal were exposed on Thursday when the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the US viewed Iran as being in default of the deal’s expectations but the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the world to have faith in its potential to create a more open Iran. Tillerson repeatedly emphasised that the US decision about whether to end the agreement – signed in 2015 – will be based on a wider assessment of Iranian behaviour, including in Yemen and Syria, and not just on whether Tehran is complying with the strict terms of the deal. Donald Trump resumed his attacks on the agreement on Thursday, calling it “one of the worst deals I’ve ever seen”. Trump claimed Iran had “violated so many different elements, but they’ve also violated the spirit of that deal”. He did not say what he would do on 15 October, when Congress requires the administration to certify Iran’s compliance, but said his stance would be “very evident”. The state department announced on Thursday that the US would continue to suspend nuclear-related sanctions on the Iranian oil industry, as required by the agreement. But officials insisted that the president’s waiver of sanctions did not reflect an endorsement of the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA). “Waiving some of those sanctions should not be seen as an indication of President Trump or his administration’s position on the JCPOA nor does the waiver give the Iranian regime a pass on its broad range of malign behaviour,” said the state department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert. The US Treasury imposed new sanctions on 11 individuals and companies for alleged hacking attacks on the US and for trading in components for Iran’s missile programme. Nine of the targets named were Iranian and two were Ukrainian. Johnson and Tillerson, speaking at a joint press conference in London, were united in urging the leader of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, to speak out against the massacre of Rohingya Muslims. But the two men were clearly at odds over Iran. The UK and the other signatories of the 2015 deal – France, Germany, Russia and China – remain committed to the agreement. The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has reported that Iran is sticking to its obligations to abide by strict limits on its stockpiles of nuclear material and on its nuclear activities. If Trump blocks certification of Iranian compliance in mid-October it would cause a substantial rift with Washington’s European allies. But the president has appeared determined to overturn an agreement the Barack Obama administration saw as its signature foreign policy achievement. The administration must certify to the US Congress every 90 days whether Iran is adhering to the agreement. If Trump refuses to certify compliance Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions that were lifted under the agreement. In April Trump ordered a broad review of Iranian compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. That review is not yet complete but is reported to recommend maintaining US participation in the agreement. Meanwhile hardliners inside and outside the White House are urging Trump to ditch the deal and take a much more confrontational stance towards Iran. The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that Iran is violating the spirit of the nuclear agreement. Tillerson quoted the agreement’s preamble as saying the signatories “anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security”. He claimed that Iran was in default of that clause by “propping up the Assad regime, by engaging in malicious activity in the region, through its cyber activity and by aggressively developing ballistic missiles. “We have to consider the totality of Iran’s activities and not let our view be defined solely by the nuclear agreement.” European diplomats reject such an interpretation of the deal, saying it was clear at the time the agreement was signed that it was solely about Iran’s nuclear programme and was designed to prevent chronic tensions in the region turning into a nuclear arms race. Johnson agreed that “the Iranians have got to behave and fulfil their side of their bargain. They have got to stop their adventurist and expansionist plans, causing trouble in Yemen, Syria or anywhere else”. But in a markedly different tone he added: “On the other side, we in the UK feel that Iran – a country of 80 million people, many of them young and potentially liberal – could be won over. I think it is important they see there are benefits from the JCPOA, so we in the UK want that alive.” On Myanmar, Johnson made it clear that he could no longer defend Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace prizewinner. Last week he described her as “one of the most inspiring figures of our age” as he urged her to stop violence against the Royhingha. In a sign he has lost his patience, he said: “Let’s be clear: she led Burma after a period of decades of repression by a military junta and I yield to no one in my admiration of what she stood for and the way she fought for democracy. I think many people around the world share that admiration. “But I think it’s now vital for her to use that moral capital and that authority to make the point about the suffering of the people of Rakhine. Nobody wants to see a return to military rule in Burma, nobody wants to see a return of the generals. “But it is vital for her now to make clear that this is an abomination and that those people will be allowed back to Burma and that preparation is being made and that the abuse of their human rights and the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of killings will stop.” Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month provoked an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 fleeing to Bangladesh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/15/florida-keys-canaries-climate-change-coalmine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T14:35:06Z","webTitle":"The Florida Keys are the canaries in the climate-change coalmine | Joanna Guthrie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/florida-keys-canaries-climate-change-coalmine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/florida-keys-canaries-climate-change-coalmine","fields":{"headline":"The Florida Keys are the canaries in the climate-change coalmine","bodyText":"The Florida Keys are still closed until further notice. On the far side of the blockade that inhabitants of the lower Keys negotiate to return to their homes, the US One highway, a tarmac spine over the limestone vertebrae of the islands, makes its way 127 miles down to Key West, battered and torn. Key West, final south-easterly outpost of mainland North America and the self-styled “last resort”, is, still, four days after Hurricane Irma hit, almost completely out of contact with the outside world. Images have been surfacing all week. In Marathon, the sea draining away from an entire bay like dishwater off a dirty plate, leaving the ocean floor exposed to the daylight, while a woman films it from her balcony and screams: “My God! My God! The sea is gone!” In Key Largo, a stretch limousine banked crosswise across the highway. Big fridges stranded on plinths of trashed seagrass and mangrove leaves, their doors open, still full of food. Cars blown the short distance from road to shoreline, sideways in the shallows in a rusty puddle of their own fluids. Boats that have cracked the road with the force with which they’ve landed; in Islamorada, someone’s house being thrown along a lagoon and landing crooked in a new spot. I know and love these islands well. I’m wondering what they did with the dolphins in the sea aquarium; how the evacuation of the mental health facilities went; whether the drive-through bank where I used to cash my pay cheque got wrecked; what it’s like in the Winn-Dixie supermarket right now, and in the Kmart, in the dark. As the search-and-rescue operation moves further into the devastated Keys, I’m watching from England to see how this first-world humanitarian disaster unfolds. It’s an extraordinary corner of America: sub-tropical, subaqueous, and not especially suited for habitation. I’m wondering if its 70,000 inhabitants may be the canaries in the coalmine for the realities of climate change as it hits the developed world. The Keys are extreme. Curving away from the bottom tip of Florida, they nose out to sea in dribs and drabs towards the Caribbean. They’ve been fully inhabited for only 150 years. Drinking water has to be piped in from the mainland; the inhabitants used rainwater until 1940. The first Coca-Cola bottling plant arrived here in 1908 and they made the Coke with rainwater. Limestone, Miami oolite and white coral form what land there is; much of the territory consists of tracts of rich, eggy sea grass and webs of island-building mangrove. The boundaries between land and sea are porous: they call this terrain “the heavy dew”. Hurricane season lasts from May to November, during which time everyone is on evacuation alert. Inhabitants are below or only just above sea level. It’s scorching nearly all the time. Humidity is high. Reliance on air-conditioning is total. Machines roam the streets misting inhabited areas with mosquito repellent. The sewage infrastructure is questionable. These islands are a complex and fragile ecosystem. They are surrounded by the only living barrier reef in the continental United States, which forms a natural surf-break: their rigid structures absorb the shock of the impact of waves and wind and are essential in restraining high tides and hurricanes. Coral is a delicate creature; the reefs have, in recent years, been showing signs of stress. It is heartbreakingly beautiful. Jewel-blue sea stretches away to all horizons, replacing landscape. Everything oozes salt: the ground, the air, the leaves. At the edges, boardwalks lead through sparse, creaking pockets of resolutely inhospitable wilderness. On higher ground lie incredibly species-rich hammocks: homes for gumbo limbo trees, the giant Florida tree snail, and hundreds of other site-specific creatures. This is prime real estate, too: building continues apace on these swampy blobs of land. Key West is a kind of ocean frontier town, with an eye-poppingly eccentric history. The major industry now is tourism. It brands itself relentlessly: it is the Conch Republic, Home of the Sunset, Margaritaville, and – because Route 1 runs out there – The End of the Rainbow. It’s also Paradise, trademarked: its police cars have “Protecting Paradise” stencilled on them. The official town motto is One Human Family. Paradise? It sometimes feels like it. Protected? I’m not so sure. Spending time there was, for me, both joyous and uneasy. I was preoccupied by how frightening it must be in hurricanes, finding yourself where you actually are: on a pitch-dark, stiflingly humid island; a tropical coral-drift that beneath its veneer is entirely wild. Living there is a kind of conjuring trick, a process of mind over matter. It demands a hefty measure of denial in your margarita – eyes half-shut as another perfect sunset commences and the steel band strikes up beside the cruise liner. Denial is also there in the recent news that the US Department of Agriculture is censoring the term “climate change”. Call the weather what you want, the past few days have shown that the Americans in these outposts may find themselves living in a whole new kind of frontier: involuntary pioneers in the face of these new “weather extremes” and their unprecedented storms. • Joanna Guthrie is a poet and writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/14/hmrc-chief-warns-post-brexit-border-and-tax-checks-could-cost-up-to-800m","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T21:30:18Z","webTitle":"HMRC chief warns post-Brexit border and tax checks 'could cost up to £800m'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/14/hmrc-chief-warns-post-brexit-border-and-tax-checks-could-cost-up-to-800m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/14/hmrc-chief-warns-post-brexit-border-and-tax-checks-could-cost-up-to-800m","fields":{"headline":"HMRC chief warns post-Brexit border and tax checks 'could cost up to £800m'","bodyText":"The head of the UK tax authority has warned that border and tax checks post Brexit could require an extra 5,000 staff with new customs checks costing the taxpayer up to £800m. HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson warned that could take between five and seven years to get a new streamlined system to deal with imports and exports in place. He told the Treasury select committee he was most concerned about the Dover- Calais route which cannot accommodate expanded customs checks warning it would take just two hours of disruption for “everything to stop”. His comments come months after shipping, ports and business interests complained that the government wasn’t taking their concerns about Brexit gridlock seriously enough. Thompson said HMRC was investigating the “business case” for a new Singapore-style system, which could deal with customs and border checks in one system. He had hired the team that delivered the Singapore project, but said the Treasury would have to stump up between £500m and £800m to get it off the ground. “We need to be transparent with you: that is a mega project,” Thompson told the committee. “You need to be thinking about that as a project that costs somewhere between £500m and £800m. “It would take five to seven years to implement. We have been asked to look at whether there is a business case for that because there would be a noticeable change to GDP in my opinion. “It would make it much smoother to import and export if you only had to go to one place instead of multiple different government departments.” Another HMRC official told MPs on Thursday that in a “crude estimate” it could require an additional 3,000 to 5,000 people by the 30 March 2019 Brexit deadline, to meet the increased custom demands posed by Brexit. Jim Harra, HMRC’s director general of customer strategy, said the organisation would have to deal with an additional 130,000 new companies after Brexit that import and export within the EU but do not currently come into contact with British customs. This would involve a fivefold increase in business and require five times as many staff – possible up to 5,000 workers. “There are probably about 130,000 new businesses that will be dealing with customs for the first time and there is a big challenge in reaching them, supporting them and getting them to be able to comply with their obligations on a transitional basis as well as on an ongoing basis,” said Harra. Earlier this year the previous treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie warned that confidence had collapsed in the HMRC’s capacity to deliver a new customs declaration system in time for Brexit. Thompson said HMRC did not have the money or resources at this point to tackle the shift, but “extensive conversations” had been had with the Treasury on the issue. Thompson said the authority may have to prioritise Brexit changes over existing projects to transform and improve the HMRC if it is to cope with Britain’s divorce from the European Union. Asked which ports had the greatest potential for disruption, he pointed to the Eurotunnel system between Britain and France, saying: “Our major concern is the closed loop system that is between Dover and Calais, it is the area where we are focusing most. “The situation on the other side of the Channel is more problematic,” said Thompson. He said that while concerns have widely centred on Operation Stack – a traffic management tactic that requires lorries to park on Kent motorways when channel crossing is disrupted – there was “equally a risk of a French Operation Stack because you can’t get through Calais to get to Dover”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/15/ipp-prisoners-james-ward-jail-sentences-parole","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Thousands of IPP prisoners are trapped in a shameful limbo.

They must be freed","bodyText":"In 1997, when Labour came to power, I was in jail, part way through a seven-year sentence. Back then, I had no thoughts of becoming a journalist, but I had more than a little interest in penal reform, so rejoiced when Blair led his party to a landslide victory. While in opposition, Labour had talked a good fight on putting the prison system to rights. In 1993, when Blair was shadow home secretary, he said: “The purpose of any system of justice should not just be to punish and deter, but also to rehabilitate, for the good of society as well as the criminal. Which is why there are practical reasons, as well as those connected with civil liberties, for reforming our monstrous prison regime.” Once in power, though, Labour changed its tune. As shadow home secretary, Blair had promised to be “tough on crime, tough on the underlying causes of crime” – but as prime minister, he stayed true only to the first part of that pledge. Thousands of new laws were introduced which increased the prison population by 20,000. Among other things, the Labour government seemed intent on slapping every kid on a deprived estate with an asbo. But in my book, their worst offence came with the introduction, in 2005, of indeterminate sentences for public protection (IPPs), a scheme dreamed up by David Blunkett. The idea was that high-risk criminals, mainly convicted of violent or sexual offences, would be given a tariff instead of a fixed-term sentence. They could only be released at the end of that tariff if the Parole Board was satisfied they could be managed safely in the community. If not, they stayed put. As could – and should – have been forecast, the judiciary went beyond the stated remit of IPPs. Between 2005 and 2012, when the sentences were abolished, 8,711 prisoners were given IPPs. The majority of those had tariffs of four years or less, which in itself showed that the offences were not on the scale of seriousness that IPPs were supposedly brought in for. The plight of James Ward, who has served 11 years in jail after initially being sentenced with an IPP to a minimum of 10 months for arson in 2006, is just the latest case to be highlighted – he is now due to be released. Today, seven years after IPPs were abolished, about 3,300 IPP prisoners remain behind bars, not knowing when they will be released. This is not because the Parole Board considers them a threat (though some may well be), but because the system simply cannot cope with the logistics of putting these prisoners through the required release process. Before satisfying the Parole Board, IPP prisoners must complete offending behaviour courses but, even now, many are still waiting to participate in such courses. Not all prisons run the required courses and prisoners can wait months, or years, for transfer to an appropriate jail. The Prisoners’ Advice Service, which helps many in this situation, tells me that some of their IPP clients experience cognitive difficulties, making it difficult to ever complete the behaviour course. Shockingly, one such female prisoner is eight years over her tariff. The chair of the Parole Board, Nick Hardwick, has only been in post since March last year. He is deeply concerned about the IPP situation and has made progress since he took charge, hearing more cases in less time. This year has seen more IPP prisoners released than any year since they came into being, but he says the situation is still unacceptable and cites the high level of suicide and self-harm among those caught up in this shameful legal limbo. In the latest issue of Inside Time, the national newspaper for prisoners and detainees, Hardwick proposes that the rules of this cruel game should be changed. He says that for those with a tariff of two years or less, the onus should be on the state to prove they are likely to commit another offence, rather than on the prisoner to show that they are not. Hardwick, the former chief inspector of prisons, is a good and humane man whom I am loth to disagree with – but I do on this. Change the rules by all means, but let the state prove danger in all of these cases. The state created this lousy logjam, it should use its executive power to set those undeservedly trapped in it free. • Eric Allison is the Guardian’s prison correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/my-partner-has-sex-with-other-people-which-i-find-exciting-but-also-difficult","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"My partner has sex with other people, which I find exciting but also difficult","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/my-partner-has-sex-with-other-people-which-i-find-exciting-but-also-difficult","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/my-partner-has-sex-with-other-people-which-i-find-exciting-but-also-difficult","fields":{"headline":"My partner has sex with other people, which I find exciting but also difficult","bodyText":"I am a 36-year-old man and have been in a very good relationship for three years. My partner has gradually become more interested in polyamory, and I find that exciting. When she has had sex with someone else, it often feels very special and affectionate when we are together again – and sometimes very arousing – but it can be difficult to have penetrative sex. I don’t want to take the easy way out and try to renegotiate monogamy. What is the way forward? I doubt that “renegotiating monogamy” would be the “easy way out”. But you are allowed to change your mind, and if polyamory is not for you, it is important to say so and be clear about what you can and cannot handle. You are at a stage of exploration, and our society is focused on monogamy, so stepping outside those values can seem frightening. What will anchor you both is having a strong core relationship with a great deal of discussion, sharing your feelings and asking for what you truly need. It would be perfectly reasonable to express your current misgivings now, saying: “I am still excited and intrigued by the idea, but I’m really not ready to commit to it. While I’m willing to continue exploring, I may eventually need to return to something simpler, maybe more exclusive. Can you please try to understand that?” I would also try to better understand her desire for polyamory, and exactly what it means to her. Would halting this current course be a deal-breaker for her? If so, you would have the option to walk away. “Different” sexual lifestyles are not for everyone. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. • If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/14/unions-call-for-39-pay-rise-plus-800-for-1-million-nhs-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T21:30:15Z","webTitle":"Unions call for 3.9% pay rise plus £800 for a million NHS staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/14/unions-call-for-39-pay-rise-plus-800-for-1-million-nhs-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/14/unions-call-for-39-pay-rise-plus-800-for-1-million-nhs-staff","fields":{"headline":"Unions call for 3.9% pay rise plus £800 for a million NHS staff","bodyText":"Unions have ramped up the pressure on Theresa May over public sector pay by demanding a 3.9% rise for 1 million NHS staff plus an extra £800 to make up for lost earning power during austerity. Health service personnel from nurses and midwives to paramedics and therapists across the UK are urging Philip Hammond to ensure they receive a salary boost that would add an extra £3bn to the NHS pay bill. Emboldened by this week’s scrapping of the pay restraint introduced by the coalition government in 2010, NHS staff say their claim would “stop the rot” in the real-terms cut in their earnings they have experienced as a result of seven years of 1% rises or pay freezes. “Health workers have gone without a proper pay rise for far too long,” said Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, which has coordinated a joint letter from the 14 unions to Hammond in a direct plea that bypasses the NHS Pay Review Body – which has set their salary rises since 1986. “Their wages continue to fall behind inflation as food and fuel bills, housing and transport costs rise,” Gorton added. “NHS staff and their families need a pay award that stops the rot and starts to restore some of the earning that have been missing out on.” The £800 additional payment the unions are seeking is in effect back pay for seven years of 0% and 1% pay rises, which they claim have seen wages fall by 15% in real terms. The unions’ joint demand comes at the end of a torrid week for May and Hammond over public sector pay, discontent over which played a key role in the election campaign and Labour’s surge in popularity under Jeremy Corbyn. May was forced to abandon the 1% cap on Tuesday in a symbolic rejection of austerity. The police will receive an extra 2% next year while prison officers will get 1.7% – though funding must come from within existing budgets. Then on Wednesday the precariousness of May’s position as head of a minority government was underlined when Democratic Unionist MPs, who are keeping the Conservatives in power, backed a Labour motion in the Commons calling on ministers to “end the public sector pay cap in the NHS and give NHS workers a fair pay rise”. The size of the 3.9% claim puts the government in a difficult position. Ministers recognise that holding down NHS staff pay has helped to exacerbate the service’s workforce shortages. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has recently championed the case for nurses receiving a pay boost. But experts say the service’s budget is already so stretched that meeting the unions’ demands would force the Treasury to foot the bill as the NHS could not meet the cost from existing resources. “This is a large amount of money that they are asking for,” said Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation thinktank and a former director of public spending at the Treasury. “It’s completely understandable that the unions’ pay claim is an attempt to make up the lost ground in earning power of NHS wages. But the NHS isn’t funded at a level that would enable it to afford a pay increase at that level.” Saffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “Staff morale is suffering. We need an end to pay restraint that is funded with new money. The NHS is already overstretched financially and any requirement to divert more scarce resources into pay would inevitably impact on patient care.” Jon Skewes, director of employment relations at the Royal College of Midwives, said “this claims represents fair compensation for the rise in cost of living” that has eroded the value of NHS personnel’s pay. Midwives’ salaries have lost £6,000 in value since 2010 and pay restraint has helped leave the NHS short of 3,500 midwives, he claimed. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index rose to 2.9% in August. That is the more commonly accepted measurement of changes to the cost of living, which the TUC and Corbyn have used in public debate over the cap in recent days. The unions say the 3.9% boost they want is “a pay rise in line with inflation”. But their claim is based on the alternative Retail Prices Index, which says that inflation is running at 3.9%, far higher than the CPI definition. The unions say that RPI takes beter account of the rising cost of housing and better reflects the financial pressures NHS staff are under. There are signs that the government may use targeted pay to give certain groups of NHS staff a bigger increase than others to tackle acute shortages in some areas. Nurses are likely to benefit from that approach, if Hammond decides to use it. Those in London, where the NHS is struggling to fill 13,000 nursing vacancies, may receive extra cash to reflect the capital’s higher cost of living, especially housing. Ministers did not reject the unions’ pay claim, despite its size. But a government spokeswoman said that all claims from across the public sector would be considered during the budget-setting process and that NHS staff would get a “fair” rise. “Public sector workers, including NHS staff, do a fantastic job and the government is committed to ensuring they can continue to deliver world-class public services,” the spokeswoman said. “The government will continue to ensure that the overall package is fair while also being affordable to taxpayers as a whole. The detail of 2018-19 pay remits for specific pay review bodies will be discussed and agreed as part of the budget process and will be set out in due course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/14/europe-miss-brits-jean-claude-juncker-unified-union","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T17:57:25Z","webTitle":"Why Europe will miss the disruptive Brits | Nigel Gardner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/14/europe-miss-brits-jean-claude-juncker-unified-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/14/europe-miss-brits-jean-claude-juncker-unified-union","fields":{"headline":"Why Europe will miss the disruptive Brits","bodyText":"It was almost embarrassing to be British in Brussels in the 1990s. A one-country awkward squad, we faced hostility across the continent and were accused of lacking values and promoting Dickensian labour conditions when John Major’s government tried to block the 48-hour limit on the working week. After the 1996 outbreak of mad cow disease, and faced with a Europe-wide ban on exports of British beef and every British-made foodstuff from jelly to digestive biscuits, Major launched the Great British Beef War – a policy of non-cooperation that obstructed some 100 EU decisions. Major had taken up where Margaret Thatcher had left off. At her first EU summit in Dublin, she demanded “her” money back from the European budget – infuriating both the German chancellor Helmut Schmidt and French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. “She was asking for her pennies back, when she hadn’t yet spent one,” Giscard is said to have quipped to Schmidt. David Cameron maintained the awkward tradition. Long before his ill-fated renegotiation, he spoke of finding EU summits “immensely frustrating”. In 2013, he accused fellow European leaders of “an ambush at 1am”. When France made a late-night attempt on the British budget rebate that Thatcher had secured all those years earlier, Cameron announced he would “lock and load” his gun with a bullet “up the spout”. So will Europe without the Brits turn out to be a harmonious club? My suspicion is not, despite Jean-Claude Juncker’s claim this week that “the wind is back in Europe’s sails” and that a new drive for closer integration is on the way. The reality is that for almost five decades, hiding behind the awkward Brits has been the oldest trick in Brussels. The UK’s constant digging-in of heels has allowed other governments to steer clear of negotiating clashes, safe in the knowledge that Britain and its Eurosceptic media would do the blocking of unpopular measures for them. Take the seemingly trivial example from 2013, of rules about how olive oil could be served in restaurants. “There was a daft proposal that it couldn’t be served in bowls or glass jugs at the table, but only in sealed sachets,” recalls a senior Dutch official. “We didn’t have to do anything – the Brits and their tabloids did the heavy lifting for us, and the proposal was withdrawn ... Every time the European Commission proposes something, we know we can rely on the British to kick and shout so it’s blocked. With Brexit, that’s no longer going to be possible.” Even that opt-out over the 48-hour week for which the UK fought its lonely battle is now – 20 years later – quietly being used by 15 other member states. So which country may end up replacing Britain as Europe’s new troublemaker-in-chief? Poland and Hungary are the obvious candidates because, across a whole range of areas, from civil liberties to media freedoms, the two countries find themselves at odds with the EU. As one senior EU official put it: “They are simply not in line with fundamental EU policies. As new member states they should be enthusiastic, but it’s the opposite.” Beata Szydło, for example, tells us a lot about what the EU will look like after 2019 when Britain is supposed to exit. The Polish prime minister’s intemperate language at a recent European summit was previously the kind of thing the EU’s top brass expected only from the British. She would not accept “blackmail from a leader with an approval rating of 4%” she raged against France’s then president François Hollande. Poland is now facing EU legal action over judicial reforms which Brussels says would undermine Polish democracy. Ironically, we may need to look to a more unlikely quarter to find Europe’s true new bad boy. Because post-Brexit, the Germans will end up being much more unpopular. “Without Britain,” one EU official told me, “they will have to assume the role they are historically reluctant to play.” Indeed, the eurozone crisis provided a foretaste of how this could play out. With Britain outside the single currency, all the anger was directed against Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel, when things went wrong. Pictures of Merkel with a Hitler moustache were everywhere in the Greek press. And the old joke about Merkel arriving at Athens airport – the one where the border guard asks “Occupation?” and Merkel replies, “No, just visiting” – took on new life. Expect much more of this. Odds are against Merkel’s rival, Martin Schulz, the former president of the European parliament, beating her in the general election on 24 September, but if he does, anger against Germany could ignite. “He has not got the diplomatic skills of Merkel,” said one British MEP. Schulz could become a lightning rod for anger against Germany. Europe post-Brexit may be anything but united. Perhaps only when the most disruptive pupil is expelled will the teacher discover how unruly the rest of the class are. Juncker and his colleagues may find the Brexit negotiations were actually the easy bit. • Nigel Gardner is a former European Commission spokesman.

Beckett took the Group Two feature event on the second day of the St Leger Festival with the 25-1 outsider Alyssa, who enjoyed a soft lead through the first 10 furlongs and rallied after being headed inside the final furlong to beat Melodic Motion, the 9-2 co-favourite, and Aljazeera, who dead-heated for second place, by half a length. “I just thought turning in that she’d done nothing for over a mile and they might just have a job to get past her,” Beckett said. “Of course, I was also watching the other filly [Melodic Motion], who was travelling like a dream. “I’m delighted for Ms [Kirsten] Rausing [the owner of Alyssa], and I’ll have a bit of explaining to do to Sheikh Fahad, but she [Melodic Motion] looked like perhaps she didn’t quite get the mile six-and-a-half. “The only downside is diabolical prize money for this race, absolutely disgraceful. We had three-year-olds off [handicap marks of] 80 running in £100,000 mile-and-a-half and mile-and-six handicaps last weekend at Haydock and Ascot.” Doncaster’s two Group Two contests on Thursday the May Hill Stakes for juvenile fillies and the Park Hill Stakes, for staying fillies, had first prizes of £40,000 and £51,000 respectively, while the connections of Melodic Motion picked up £14,000. Asked what he felt would be a fair prize for a Group Two race at this meeting, Beckett said: “What York put on for Group Twos, that would be a fair prize.” York staged four Group Two events at its showpiece Ebor Festival meeting last month, for which the first prize ranged from the £96,000 earned by Cracksman in the Great Voltigeur Stakes to the £142,000 prize for the Lowther Stakes for juvenile fillies. The average winning prize money in the four races was £119,000. The Group Two races on Friday’s card, the Flying Childers Stakes and the Doncaster Cup, are worth £40,000 and £57,000 to the winner respectively, while the disparity in the money on offer at Yorkshire’s two major racing Festivals also extends to their Group One feature events. The International Stakes, the most valuable race at the Ebor Festival, was worth £567,000 to the winner, while the first prize for Saturday’s St Leger, the fifth and final Classic of the British season, is £397,000. Arena Racing Company, which owns and operates Doncaster, declined to comment when asked for a response to Beckett’s criticism. Laurens, who finished strongly to win the May Hill Stakes by a head from Dark Rose Angel, is quoted at 33-1 for next year’s 1,000 Guineas and Karl Burke, her trainer, feels she will be well worth her place in a Classic field next season. “Something like the Prix de Diane [French Oaks] at a mile-and-a-quarter could be perfect for her,” Burke said. “She’s got an entry in the Irish 1,000 Guineas, which has already closed, and she’ll be entered in all the Guineas, but the Prix de Diane would be the target that I would have in mind for her. “She will only improve again. She’s in the [Group One] Fillies’ Mile [at Newmarket on 13 October], which would give her an extra couple of weeks [compared to the Prix Marcel Boussac on 1 October] so we’ll see how she comes out of this but that’s a possibility. “As far as the fillies are concerned, she’s the best we’ve had at this stage. She wouldn’t be a speed filly but she’s very good. I knew the last furlong was going to be our best furlong and I knew we’d stay right to the line. She’s tough and she’s game.” Frankie Dettori has chosen to ride the filly Coronet, the winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot, in preference to the Goodwood Cup winner Stradivarius in Saturday’s St Leger, for which there were 11 final declarations on Thursday morning. Stradivarius, who denied Big Orange a hat-trick of wins in the Goodwood contest in its first renewal as a Group One event, drifted in the betting as a result, from a top price of 6-1 on Thursday morning to 9-1 a few hours later. Coronet, who could be backed at 10-1 on Thursday morning, is now the fourth-favourite at a best price of 13-2, while Aidan O’Brien’s Capri, the Irish Derby winner, is vying for favouritism with Crystal Ocean, from Sir Michael Stoute’s stable in Newmarket. Both horses are available at 4-1 with Roger Varian’s Defoe also popular at a top price of 5-1.

Beside a picture of him holding a pen and writing on one of several piles of paper, it ran: “Secret weapon. Many productive meetings and big business deals have been sealed with a handshake at my GSD (Get Shit Done) table that’s inside my trailer. This table holds a lot of great mana (spirit/power) and energy. And if these wood slabs could talk … well it’s best they can’t talk for national security purposes.” So far, so FDR. But the mere sight of The Rock with pens and paper seems to have enFurioused his co-star Tyrese Gibson, who shot back: “If you move forward with that #Hobbs movie you will have purposely ignored the heart to heart moment we had in my sprinter. I don’t wanna hear from you until you remember what we talked about. I’m on your timeline cause you’re not responding to my text messages. #FastFamily is just that a family … We don’t fly solo.” Ooh!

She has never set up a direct debit or standing order. She has certainly never used contactless. But she has full mental capacity. It’s just that after 60 years of her husband running every aspect of the family finances, she has now found herself handling money for the first time due to his ill-health. Much has been done to help youngsters learn about money, with personal finance lessons introduced in schools. Do we need more of a national effort to help elderly people facing the same acute lack of financial understanding?

It was in a dodgy area and the walk back to her car left her feeling exposed. No one has told her how easy it is to have the pension paid into a bank account and for cash to be withdrawn at a closer ATM, or that it’s possible to nominate someone else to withdraw the cash for her. Separately, a friend told me about his recently widowed dad who had a knock at the door from a salesman pushing a walk-in bath. What followed was the standard rip-off: the deal would only last for a week, he’d check with his manager if he could offer such a discount – the usual garbage. All the 80-year-old had to do was put down a £3,000 deposit. Of course, once the money was pocketed, the salesman and the bath never materialised. Irrespective of the onset of dementia, there is some evidence that while “crystallised intelligence” – the accumulation of facts and knowledge – peaks later in life, normal ageing causes cognitive decline from the mid-50s. Some research suggests it starts even earlier. Older people, even without Alzheimer’s, are more likely to struggle with day-to-day banking and make poor money decisions. We accept that spending vast amounts on healthcare for the elderly is essential. Should a bit of that be spent on wealthcare? Yes, there is a vast online library of help available – from Age UK, Citizens Advice, the Money Advice Service, government departments and so on. And there are numerous options to help elderly parents: third-party mandates, joint accounts and the various powers of attorney. But is there enough face-to-face help? The starting point must always be family members, but not everyone has helpful, able or willing offspring. The banks have a role to play here. Barclays has a great “digital eagles” programme that gives practical support to older adults at “tea and teach” sessions, helping them set up passwords, send emails, shop online and use Skype and Facetime. A broader programme like that, available in branches, jointly funded by the banks and aimed at the over-75s, could be hugely beneficial. We can also harness technology to improve oversight. If I had a financially vulnerable mum or dad, I’d want a text alert every time they spent more than a specified sum, say £500. Or some sort of electronic dual-authorisation for large payments. What do you think would most help the elderly handle their day-to-day finances?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/14/british-bobsleigh-dominik-scherrer-winter-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:33:43Z","webTitle":"British bobsleigh coach quits just five months before 2018 Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/14/british-bobsleigh-dominik-scherrer-winter-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/14/british-bobsleigh-dominik-scherrer-winter-olympics","fields":{"headline":"British Bobsleigh coach quits just five months before 2018 Winter Olympics","bodyText":"The coach of British Bobsleigh has resigned in the wake of allegations of bullying and discrimination within the Olympic programme. Dominik Scherrer has left less than five months before the start of the 2018 Winter Olympics. Although he is not personally accused of any wrongdoing he claimed a change in strategy at the governing body had made him feel unable to do his job. Bobsleigh is one of several sports which has undergone an independent review after being implicated in the duty of care scandal afflicting British Olympic and Paralympic sport. His departure comes after the performance director, Gary Anderson, stood down last month citing “health issues”. In an email sent to athletes and staff, Swiss Scherrer wrote: “Until now it was possible for me to decide what strategy we use. This is no longer possible. I have always been success-oriented and I don’t feel comfortable with the current strategy and I don’t have the competence to make decisions in that regard. “Also, it will not be possible to work with the same performance team in the future. What made us successful in the past is that I could be who I am. This is, for reasons that we all could not have foreseen, no longer possible.” UK Sport, the agency which allocates lottery and exchequer funding, cut British Bobsleigh’s support by nearly £50,000 this summer after athletes on the elite performance programme complained of a “toxic atmosphere” in the sport. In a complaint directed to Richard Packer, the chief executive of the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association, one athlete alleged a senior coach referred to black people as “lazy” and had “a blatant dislike towards people of colour.” Another claimed there was “a racial bias in favour of caucasian males” on the performance programme and “a racial stigma against black drivers.” British Bobsleigh and Skeleton, which has received £10m in UK Sport funding for the four year cycle to the Pyeongchang Olympics, is expected to announce the appointment of a new coach on Friday. Scherrer’s departure is one of a few linked to the fall out from increased scrutiny of athlete welfare in Olympic sport. The British Cycling performance director, Shane Sutton, resigned just months before the Rio Olympics after being accused of sexism and disability discrimination. There are independent reviews underway at British Canoeing and British Swimming after allegations of bullying and discrimination were made at both governing bodies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/norsemen-netflix-review","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:47:52Z","webTitle":"Norsemen review - Monty Python meets Game of Thrones in this Norwegian comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/norsemen-netflix-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/14/norsemen-netflix-review","fields":{"headline":"Norsemen review - Monty Python meets Game of Thrones in this Norwegian comedy","bodyText":"What is it? A Norwegian comedy charm offensive with killer performances and amazing plaits. Why you’ll love it: Norsemen owes as much to Monty Python as it does to Asterix and Game of Thrones. A bunch of brilliantly talented Norwegians have made this ludicrously lovely sitcom in English (they made a Norwegian version too), so that we may access their dry-as-a-bone humour more easily. It’s written and directed by Jon Iver Helgaker and Jonas Torgersen, and set in the village of Norheim in the year 790. The comedy comes from the juxtaposition of their ancient, brutal struggle for survival and the minor concerns we all obsess over nowadays. Acting village chieftain Orm (the superb Kåre Conradi) orders all villagers to surrender their weapons to make them into an art installation, leaving the community cultured but defenceless. He is a scared little man – like all the best sitcom buffoons – running from his own shadow and desperately repressing his homosexuality while his muscle-bound wife Frøya goes on raids with the men and joins in the pillaging with abandon. Orm is sitting in as village leader while his brother (the much more impressive Olav) leads his warriors on a pillaging mission to bring back treasure and slaves. A dissatisfied captive kicks up a stink about the lack of facilities on board and gets a punch in the face. “That’s not really me,” confides Olav to one of his warriors, “… that fear-based leadership style”. Norsemen is often disgusting, gory, brimming over at times with widdle and plop, full of graphic violence and imbued with the spirit of stinking, bloody life in 8th century northern Europe. You can almost smell Norsemen, so juicily do the cast tuck into their parts. And the soundtrack’s epic Thrones-like quality makes the ineptitude even funnier as Orm fires arrow after flaming arrow at a retreating funeral boat, missing every time. “Try firing an arrow with really cold fingers before you start booing,” he whines to the disgruntled villagers as the boat drifts out of sight, unlit. When events conspire to leave him in charge more permanently, Orm makes terrible decisions, including hiring a former slave as his “creative director” and tasking him with putting Norheim on the cultural map. David Brent-like in his self-delusion, he has a whiff of Captain Mainwaring when marshalling his troops and a hint of Basil Fawlty when he’s covering up another boob. Conradi’s performance is the impressive comic totem around which the others caper, rolling their eyes. “This one’s mine,” he growls, arriving late to a battle all but finished by his colleagues. He then proceeds to beat up a 10-year-old girl - before she gets the better of him, obviously. If you are left uncharmed by Norsemen you are both heartless and immune to their heartily irreverent approach to situation comedy. Lighten up and let the men in plaits beguile you into stupid, helpless giggles. Where: Netflix Length: Six 30-minute episodes, available to stream now. Standout episode: Episode four, in which Orm “leads” a raiding party to Britain to rob the locals. If you liked Norsemen, watch: Viking Apocalypse (Netflix), Chelmsford 123 (All4)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/live/2017/sep/14/mercury-prize-2017-follow-ceremony-announcement-glass-animals-kate-tempest-sampha-stormzy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T21:31:16Z","webTitle":"Mercury prize 2017: Sampha wins for Process – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2017/sep/14/mercury-prize-2017-follow-ceremony-announcement-glass-animals-kate-tempest-sampha-stormzy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2017/sep/14/mercury-prize-2017-follow-ceremony-announcement-glass-animals-kate-tempest-sampha-stormzy","fields":{"headline":"Mercury prize 2017: Sampha wins for Process – as it happened","bodyText":"So that’s it for another year. Another male winner – there’s not been a female winner since PJ Harvey’s second win in 2011 – and perhaps not the most thrilling, but certainly a deserving one. Sampha puts grotty, negative, cloudy emotions into a kind of perspective, and maybe even draws something noble from them – a laudable aim for any songwriter. And Glass Animals and Alt-J go home empty handed, except for that “well done for taking part” statue, which is nice. Thanks for following along everyone! Down some mineral water and stock up the tear ducts after the last performance, because here comes (No-One Knows Me) Like the Piano again. It does feel like a properly canonical ballad – it has already soundtracked countless hours of hipster sorrow, but is the kind of thing that could easily cross over to the X Factor this year. He looks delighted and astonished, as he bigs up his brothers for “making me believe in myself,” along with his parents. “I’m so thankful for this, this is absolutely incredible” he adds. An extremely waved Idris Elba says hello to his mum and dad and makes a slightly slurring appreciation of English music. The winner is... Sampha! OK it’s time for the winner to be announced! Lauren says it’s the longest a judging panel have deliberated over the prize. She kind of gives it away by saying it’s a debut from south London. Skepta! Last year’s winner rolls up in what I think is an old-school Vauxhall Vectra (Vauxhall gang please confirm), to perform Man, still a diamond-tipped bit of self-affirmation. With his tucked in T-shirt, he actually does, per the lyrics, look a little bit like he just came from church. He bigs up Stormzy and J Hus, and nods approvingly at his live guitarist. Killed it as per. It’s Glass Animals themselves, with Life Itself. To these ears it’s features an insufferably dinky, frankly offensive take on “tribal” percussion, paired with an overstuffed, grossly inelegant (though certainly catchy) top line. Please explain in the comments why people like this. Clara Amfo now, talking about the “tension” and “passion” of the judging process, that apparently brought some judges close to tears at times. I mean, if Glass Animals were being championed to win, I’d cry too. It’d be like 12 Angry Men in there. Have you noticed how Lauren Laverne is picking up on Jools Holland’s public speaking style? Sampha now, playing (No-One Knows Me) Like the Piano, a kind of endurance test to see if you can avoid crying for three and a half minutes. To be honest I thought he’d never top Indecision in the ballad stakes, and maybe he hasn’t, but this comes damn close. It’s very on-the-nose in its expression of music interfacing with grief, but that bald honesty is what gives it its power. “A beautiful performance”, says Lauren, accurately. Kate Tempest plays a barnstorming version of Don’t Fall In, delivering a sermon like a soapbox soothsayer, eviscerating the moneyed classes in this country to a backdrop of chaotic, often beatless effects. I mean, I love J Hus, but that was the lyrical display of the evening – like a crazy person on the tube who you actually want to listen to. Stormzy looks utterly delighted by it. Amazing stuff! Literally no-one is cheering the Ed Sheeran sales stats. He does a video message, where he says his main goals were to play Shepherd’s Bush Empire and get a Mercury nom. Ten mins or so until decision time. So who will win? When the nominations came out I thought Sampha was an absolute shoo-in. While it’s not my favourite album of the crop, it ticks a lot of Mercury boxes: progressive, emotive, populist, robustly written, but not wildly challenging and even a little bit tasteful. And, of course, featuring some wonderful songs, which articulate loss and anxiety in a soul voice for the ages – all of which still makes him a serious contender. In with a chance though I think are Kate Tempest, for articulating the sheer rubbishness of post-Brexit Britain, though it’s certainly an album of storytelling rather than incredible musicianship. Loyle Carner, whose live show is irresistible and whose lazy-river flow is arguably more satisfying than the gear changes of Stormzy and J Hus, is a good outsider pick. And Glass Animals I guess, if the bookies are anything to go by. They got it wrong last year, picking David Bowie, and the year before, picking Jamie xx. Blossoms perform Charlemagne, and it’s given a bit of grit with some added lead guitar shredding – though is still at heart a massively cheesy soft-rock song. Bit weird that staunch indie blokes have made these guys massive, while the far more trad Big Moon remain niche. Still, Charlemagne remains essentially a very good song. I have docked any remaining hipster points I may have had. Dinosaur here, playing what is probably the highest-profile gig of their career, playing a frantic, condensed version of Living, Breathing. You know what, if they don’t win – and they won’t – the Mercury prize is still a fillip for jazz performers in this country: the Comet is Coming, Gwilym Simcock, Led Bib and others would all probably say that’s is been great for their careers. Idris Elba gets on the mic again, bigging up host Lauren Laverne, and claiming that Britons pronounce Hyundai “Hyundoo”. Literally no one says it like that Idris. Stormzy performs in a live tableau of the cover art from his album Gang Signs &amp; Prayer, which you shouldn’t rule out tonight, even if Skepta won last year. First Things First shows he’s not going cuddly, further undermining Dstrkt’s credibility and literally spitting on the mic. But then it’s like falling into a feather bed for Blinded By Your Grace Pt 1. I find this track a little bit jejune, and it’s hard to award anything more than points for trying for Stormzy’s singing voice. It’s certainly second to Loyle Carner in the gospel vocals stakes tonight. But it’s heartfelt stuff, and Stormzy remains incredibly charismatic. The crowd loooove it. The Big Moon up next, and the chugging guitars are weirdly bracing amid this lineup. They play Cupid which is a brilliant song about – yes, another! – dick of a man who makes his ejaculate taste nice by drinking pineapple juice. The plummy vocals grating against the gnarly guitars are a superb combo. It’s not a classic album, but they show they deserve their place here tonight. I think this person means that Richard Dawson should have been on the shortlist, in which case yes, Snarlygog, never has a truer word been spoken, even though you spelled Peasant wrongly. J Hus medley time! Fisherman hat present and correct, J Hus rolls through Friendly and Did U See, offering to season women’s chicken, and the rest. It’s like a club PA has rolled into the building, if you go to clubs with people eating dinner on the dancefloor. He can’t say “penis” on BBC4 though so I want my licence fee back. I slagged off Alt-J just a couple of posts ago, but this performance isn’t making me feel bad about it. The elements are interesting – vocal samples jumping out on you, brooding guitars, and a spartan atmos which is absolutely my thing – but they cohere like trifle ingredients chucked at a wall. That this lot played the O2 is one of the most baffling things I have encountered in my life. Next! Next up it’s Loyle Carner with The Isle of Arran, which uses this incredible sample... ... and makes it even better than the Dr Dre track that also samples it. Performed live by the House Gospel Choir it’s even more powerful. This track is the blockbuster opener to his Mercury-nommed album and, while the production feels American, the flow is all English phonics. He wears a T-shirt reading Son of Jean, bigging up his mum. Bless, in every sense. Other people who probably won’t win: Alt-J, because they’ve won it before. Also because they use smart production to hoodwink people into believing they write good songs, but without actually bothering to write hooks. An arrogant, talentless pox on the British music scene who really shouldn’t be further enabled. The Big Moon, because what is essentially Britpop doesn’t feel very 2017 – though the lyrics, featuring a police lineup of essentially crap but still frustratingly attractive men, make it Bumble in grunge-pop form. Works best in one-two song doses imo. Dinosaur, because it’s jazz, and service to jazz, beyond lips, is never forthcoming from the Mercury panel. Their record Together, As One isn’t the total knockout it would need to be to win – it has some fusion idiosyncrasies that you’ll either love or hate, and I personally can’t get on board with Jimmy Smith-style organ or the sometimes fussy electronics. But trumpeter and bandleader Laura Jurd nods satisfyingly to the bright melodies of Freddie Hubbard and Miles Davis, and stuff like Living, Breathing swings hard. Definitely check it out if you haven’t already. First up playing live is the xx, performing On Hold. They won’t win tonight, because they’ve won it before, and because there’s some middling, pulled-punches tracks on their album I See You. But in some ways it’s a deserving record – when they’re good, as on this record’s sensationally good singles, they hit you square in the tear ducts and hypothalamus simultaneously. And Oh Hold is emphatically one of those sensational singles, perfectly meshing their Young Marble Giants-style minimalist songwriting with Jamie xx’s Balearically-minded production. Jamie jabs his MPC (or whatever it is) with split-second precision, the guitars echo eerily, and Romy and Oliver’s vocals together remain one of the ultimate weapons in British pop. The crowd are euphoric! The Mercury gang have been doing a series of Boomerang vids of the nominees, of which this by Blossoms is much the best: Idris meanwhile shows off his guns on telly. Strong shirt. A nation ovulates. And we’re off! The BBC4 show has begun. Harriet meanwhile is forward in time somewhere, watching the ceremony live, and Stormzy looks a bit like this: Look it’s just a smartphone camera OK. If we could afford an iPhone X we wouldn’t be asking for your cash all the time. One of the key stories of the Mercury this year is the quality of the rap nominees. While the prize is sometimes attacked for being unadventurous, something it should be praised for is consistently making room for British MCs. From winners Ms Dynamite, Young Fathers, Skepta, Speech Debelle and Dizzee Rascal, to nominees like Ty, Roots Manuva, the Streets, MIA, Ghostpoet, Plan B and Kano, it’s got a pretty good pedigree. Y no Wiley though? Anyway, of 2017’s crop, J Hus expertly crystallises the neo-Afrobeats sound that’s ruling London and does so with stoicism and sexual magnetism; Kate Tempest zooms masterfully from close portraits to panoramic social commentary; Loyle Carner’s soulful British take on boom-bap is full of masterfully weighted bars; Stormzy’s voice when he gets indignant and contemptuous is probably the best sound on any of these records. Any of them would be worthy winners. The perception of our chief critic Alexis Petridis is that the panel won’t award it to an out-and-out rapper the year after Skepta winning for Konnichiwa. BUT MAYBE THAT’S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK. Don’t they scrub up well! Down the other end of the bookies’ picks are Blossoms, whose generic (but not charmless) soft lad-rock the bookmakers rightly presume the panel will find way too unsophisticated – they’re at 33-1. And they’re joined by Ed Sheeran, also at 33-1 for ÷, which united the critics as much in disparagement as it did the public in adoration. Given the panel are made of a number of the former, with our own Harriet Gibsone giving ÷ two stars and bemoaning its “sharp stench of a salesman’s cheap cologne”, it’s almost impossible for him to win. He’s also not turned up to the ceremony because he’s on tour in the US. He’ll at least have a friend on the judging panel in Jessie Ware – the pair have frequently written songs for each other. Yes, his lyricism leaves no symbol – Superman, aeroplanes, rocks – unmolested on the way to kneejerk poignancy. Yes, his snobbery around Ministry of Sound compilations is utterly unexcusable. But, ultimately, he can write songs – even the massively maligned Galway Girl has a cast iron melodic logic. He shouldn’t be the outsider with Glass Animals the favourite, and yet here we are. After backing Sampha and then Kate Tempest, the bookies are now throwing their weight behind Glass Animals, the Oxford four-piece who have had some admirable success this year, particularly in America, a country known for its impressionability, and willingness to be cowed by British invaders. *swigs Haterade* Personally I think of Glass Animals as what Wild Beasts would sound like if they were eunuchs, ie pointless. They’re as annoying as Clapham accountants on coke at an electro-swing night, who coincidentally make up the bulk of their fanbase – the kind of people who find pineapples and glitter exciting, and use the word “weird” to describe anything north of Sam Smith and Bake Off. DON’T DO IT, HARRIET. One notable absentee from the below list is our deputy music editor Harriet Gibsone, who is on the judging panel for the second year in a row. She’ll hopefully send back some exciting goss about Marcus Mumford’s new child or something. She and he (Marcus, not the child) sit alongside musicians Jamie Cullum, Ella Eyre, Lianne La Havas, and Jessie Ware; radio DJs Clara Amfo and Mistajam; radio bigwigs Mike Walsh and Jeff Smith; and journos Will Hodgkinson and Phil Alexander, all overseen by former EMI CEO Tony Wadsworth. You’d could say that the famous people on this list lean, taste-wise, towards the hip-hop, grime and soul on the list, but that would probably just be massively reductive … I should add that Harriet has kept admirably shtum these last weeks and I have no idea who is likely to win. The Guardian’s critics have got behind their favourite runners and riders, from J Hus to the Big Moon, pictured above: Welcome! It’s time for a team of industry professionals to plunge themselves into the age-old philosophical quandary about the subjectivity of art, and decide which British album is 2017’s “best”. As usual, the shortlist is a pretty broad – and slightly middlebrow – selection, getting behind everything from Ed Sheeran’s ÷ (over 1bn streams in the US alone) to Dinosaur’s Together, As One (5,000 monthly listeners on Spotify). Here are the albums facing off tonight: Alt-J: Relaxer The Big Moon: Love in the 4th Dimension Blossoms: Blossoms Loyle Carner: Yesterday’s Gone Dinosaur: Together, As One Glass Animals: How to Be a Human Being J Hus: Common Sense Sampha: Process Ed Sheeran: ÷ Stormzy: Gang Signs &amp; Prayer Kate Tempest: Let Them Eat Chaos The xx: I See You We’ll give you some preamble, and then will be following along with the coverage on BBC4 from 9pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/how-to-grow-great-brassicas-brussels-sprouts-cabbages","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"How to grow great brassicas – from brussels sprouts to cabbages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/how-to-grow-great-brassicas-brussels-sprouts-cabbages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/how-to-grow-great-brassicas-brussels-sprouts-cabbages","fields":{"headline":"How to grow great brassicas – from brussels sprouts to cabbages","bodyText":"If I have a true love, it must be the genus, brassica. I didn’t expect to fall so hard. It’s hardly a glamorous one: its members are wide and varied, and often pungent – think of the sulphurous tang of boiled cabbage or the whiff of fermented sauerkraut. But I find that when I look upon a brassica I see the most beautiful of vegetables. I love how they look nestled among the flowers of my garden; I regularly make vases of kales, and marvel at the packed interiors of cabbages. The wild cabbage, Brassica oleracea, is a diffuse and polymorphic species, which is another way of saying it is good at self-love. A long time ago we took one wild and wayward species, and selected and selected and selected until a wildling became a kale, became a cabbage, became broccoli or cauliflower or a brussels sprout. For brassica nerds, there are eight major cultivar groups. Depending on your taste buds you’re salivating or are about to turn the page; this is because you can taste the chemical compound, phenylthiocarbamide or PTC, which brassicas are packed with. If you can taste it, you’ll find the genus, particularly brussels sprouts, bitter; if you can’t, you really don’t get the aversion. Children can detect PTC much more readily, which is why the poor sprout endlessly rolls around a plate while sweeter-tasting peas are devoured. Regardless of your tastes, brassicas make up the mainstay of our winter eating, so it’s worth paying attention now to those you planted earlier in the year, particularly if you want to brandish your own brussels and braise your own cabbages on Christmas Day. Brussels sprouts will start to ripen from now until early spring. Pick the lowest sprouts first as they ripen from bottom to top and don’t forget to eat the delicious sprout tops, which are like tender small cabbages. Eat them last, as they are protecting the sprouts below. Cabbage heads are ready when they feel firm. Some cultivars of cabbage bolt quickly after maturing, others will stand for months. The trick is the name: ‘Tundra’, ‘January King’, ‘Noelle’, ‘Siberia’, are all long-standing winter types. Wild brassicas are easy-going and hardy; their highly bred cultivated offspring are easily upset and prone to blow out – those much-desired tight heads of brussels or cabbages grow loose as the plants go straight to flowering. They produce superfine root hairs to take in nitrogen and if the plant rocks in the wind, the root hairs are damaged and they blow open their heads. Staking brussels is essential on anything but the most sheltered of sites. Earthing up around stems of brussels and heavy-headed cabbages helps to stop rocking. Feed them bacteria-rich comfrey or nettle tea (from rotted-down leaves), or mulch with nitrogen-rich grass clippings. Kales are closer to their wild relatives and tend to be much tougher about these things."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/15/barclays-head-of-whistleblowing-to-leave-after-dropping-employment-case","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T15:32:40Z","webTitle":"Barclays' head of whistleblowing to leave after dropping employment case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/barclays-head-of-whistleblowing-to-leave-after-dropping-employment-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/15/barclays-head-of-whistleblowing-to-leave-after-dropping-employment-case","fields":{"headline":"Barclays' head of whistleblowing to leave after dropping employment case","bodyText":"The head of whistleblowing at Barclays is to leave the bank at a time when the bank’s chief executive, Jes Staley, is being investigated over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. Jonathan Cox, a former police detective inspector, is leaving after dropping an employment case against the bank, according to Reuters. The detail of the case or if it has any connection to the Staley investigation is not clear, but the east London tribunal confirmed the case had been withdrawn after being listed to take place earlier this week. The bank refused to comment and Cox’s phone went to voicemail but the Financial Times reported that there had been an out-of-court settlement, which prevented either side from discussing the situation. His departure comes as the investigations into Staley’s conduct continue. The American banker – who joined Barclays in December 2015 – along with the bank are under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority. The bank stunned the City in April when it announced the investigations after Staley’s attempts to use Barclay’s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters sent to the board and a senior executive at the bank last June. The letters made allegations about a former colleague Staley had hired. The bank’s chairman, John McFarlane, continues to support him. In an interview with CNBC on Friday, McFarlane said the chief executive had done a fantastic job restructuring the bank in the wake of Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2017/sep/24/german-elections-exit-polls-merkel-set-to-form-new-coalition","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-24T16:13:12Z","webTitle":"Exit polls offer Merkel fewer coalition choices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/sep/24/german-elections-exit-polls-merkel-set-to-form-new-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/sep/24/german-elections-exit-polls-merkel-set-to-form-new-coalition","fields":{"headline":"Exit polls offer Merkel fewer coalition choices","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/15/akin-to-someone-with-a-liverpool-defender-in-their-fantasy-league-team","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T15:39:58Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Akin to someone with a Liverpool defender in their fantasy league team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/15/akin-to-someone-with-a-liverpool-defender-in-their-fantasy-league-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/15/akin-to-someone-with-a-liverpool-defender-in-their-fantasy-league-team","fields":{"headline":"Akin to someone with a Liverpool defender in their fantasy league team","bodyText":"TICKET TROUBLE In the hours and days after the Big Vase draw on 24 August social media and fans’ forums filled with Cologne/Köln fans discussing how best to get to London for their team’s match against Arsenal, and how to find tickets. Fans booked coaches, they booked ferries and trains, and they booked aeroplane tickets to London, to Birmingham and to Manchester. Most decent transport options had been booked up long before tickets went on sale. Cologne/Köln supporters were massively encouraged by Arsenal’s ticket pricing, which started at £18 and topped out, for tickets that for Category A domestic fixtures are flogged for £95.50, at £23.50. The prices were interpreted as an admission that the club could never sell them all, and therefore as an invitation for anyone so inclined to turn up and snaffle a spare. On one forum The Fiver poked around this morning there were discussions dating back to 27 August concerning what kind of clothing fans might get away with wearing if they had tickets in the wrong bit of the Emirates. And then yesterday they gathered, thousands of fans grouping in central London. Videos started circulating on social media disgrace Twitter and elsewhere in the early afternoon, showing crowds of Cologne/Köln-kit-clad fanatics gathering, chanting, drinking and marching. Back at the Emirates, anyone still believing at this stage that only 3,000 Germans – the number clutching precious official tickets to the away end – would turn up that evening was akin to a climate-change denier, a creationist, or someone with a Liverpool defender in their fantasy league team. And then they arrived. Many had tickets, many more did not. Nobody was ready for them. A couple of hours of largely but not entirely good-natured confusion followed. Uefa disciplinary proceedings were opened. The irony here is that one of the causes of the problem was that Arsenal sold their tickets too cheaply, not something that has often been said of them since they moved into the Emirates in 2006 and bumped up admission fees, first to pay back the enormous cost of building the thing, and later just because. But there was another issue at play. Arsenal might have sold match tickets too cheaply, but they also sold season tickets too expensively. Even after the 10% price cut that followed their failure to qualify for Big Cup the cheapest season ticket for this season is £891. This works out at a nasty £46.89 per league game. When Arsenal bigwigs identify season-ticket holders whose places were occupied by away fans last night they will feel only anger – it is now being reported that such supporters will be stripped of their seats – but perhaps they should also feel some shame. Each one represents a die-hard fan driven to sell themselves out by the club’s own policies (and also, perhaps, the desire to make a quick and easy buck). Of course, entrance to as many as seven home cup games is included in Arsenal’s ticket prices, potentially bringing the cost per game down to a less unreasonable £34.27. But not every fan can be bothered with, or is able to make, random midweek cup ties. Forcing the tickets upon them allows the club to boast healthy attendances even for unattractive matches, but also leaves some fans with places at games they have no plan to attend. So who is to be blamed when some of them pass them on to a friendly fellow European with a stein full of beer and a wallet full of cash? It is certainly true that some of Arsenal’s fans sold off their tickets to last night’s game in a manner that displayed selfishness, greed and a callous indifference to the inconvenience of others. Now who could they possibly have learned that from?

Here’s the short version: ‘I wouldn’t question the attitude of the players. When you work with the players everyday you see the attitude and it’s all there. We haven’t lost that at all. Of course confidence is a factor, but there is no ability issue and no confidence issue, there never has been.’ If I went to see my boss with zero sales and said my attitude was excellent, my abilities were as good as ever and confidence is as it should be. I suspect he would press a secret button under the desk and Smithers would release the hounds” – Marten Allen. “Good to see Joe Mercer keeping in touch with the modern football world via Fiver letters and, I presume, a ouija board (Thursday’s Fiver Letters).

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Police have said they are growing increasingly concerned for Clarke Carlisle after the former Burnley and Leeds players was reported missing. Carlisle was last seen by his family in Preston on Thursday afternoon, and may have been in Manchester city centre on Friday morning. Lancashire Police have urged anyone with information to contact them. Ronald Koeman has called for his key players to start delivering after three straight defeats, no goals scored and eight conceded. “It’s time for the experienced players to stand up,” Koeman growled, giving Wayne Rooney one of his extra hard stares. Sliced clearance’s Kolo Touré has been appointed as the Queen’s Celtic technical assistant. “This is a new chapter in my career, a new beginning,” he cheered. “The football is over now. I can officially say I am retired from playing and now I am fully concentrating on coaching.” As far as José Mourinho is concerned, Rooney should only stand up for a red-carpet reception at Old Trafford on Sunday. “He’s a real legend of the club,” Mou purred. “I think the stadium will show him the respect he deserves.” Mauricio Pochettino still doesn’t know when Danny Rose will be fit to play again. “I’m a coach, not a doctor,” Pochettino mithered when pressed on a potential return for Rose, who was expected back after the international break. In other Spurs news, new signing Fernando Llorente has said Harry Kane is one of the world’s best strikers. “The truth is that he is in a sweet moment,” sighed Llorente, adopting the popular parlance of our time. Sadio Mané has expressed regret over his collision with Manchester City keeper Ederson. “Next time, I will get the ball before him,” Mané added, failing to connect to the point with a flailing boot. Isco has signed a new contract at Real Madrid, keeping him at the club until June 2022. “I have no regrets, I’ve won three [Big Cups] in four years,” the Spanish midfielder crowed. Newcastle’s Matt Ritchie had his first beer for more than two years – so he could do the necessary for a drugs test. “I had a knock on my door at 8.45pm – it was the drug testers,” he cheered. “To try and make myself have a wee, I had my first beer since my wedding day!” And fixture of the weekend comes in the Swiss Cup, where BSC Young Boys of Bern travel to BSC Old Boys of Basel/Basle/Baaaarrrl. That one will sort the boys from the other boys, etc and so on.

Which you then plug into the wall. If you’re struggling to imagine the kind of person who finds the act of plugging a cable into their phone unacceptably inconvenient – especially since you’ll still have to leave your phone in one place while it charges – well, that makes two of us. But I’m sure wireless charging will catch on anyway, because Apple understands something profound about the psychology of convenience: half the time, it isn’t really about eliminating annoying or effortful chores. It’s about introducing features you “didn’t know you needed” – a fancy way of saying you didn’t need them – safe in the knowledge that once lots of other people have them, you’ll want them; and once you’ve got them, you won’t want to lose them. “I guess it’s one of those things you don’t really care about until you use it,” wrote one owner of another device with wireless charging, trying to explain the appeal. Which is also true of heroin, but never mind that for now. One culprit here is presumably the phenomenon of “loss aversion”, which describes how people are much more upset about losing, say, £10 than they are thrilled by the prospect of gaining £10. Perhaps for evolutionary reasons, we’re much more motivated to cling to what we’ve already got than to strive to obtain what we don’t yet have. Add to that our hardwired tendency toward laziness – our instinct to conserve every morsel of energy, and to avoid every expenditure of effort – and you can see why, once you can persuade people to adopt certain pseudo-conveniences, they’ll be unlikely to want to give them up. Before you have wireless charging, the effort of plugging a cable into your phone seems negligible; once you have it, it’s too convenient to relinquish. And so even if, like me, you’re the kind of person who fantasises about downgrading from a smartphone to a dumbphone, you find yourself buying the new iPhone instead. The other strange implication in Silicon Valley’s obsession with “effortless” convenience is the idea that all these tiny daily hassles – plugging in your phone, having to talk to a human to order a takeaway, inserting your card instead of using contactless payment – add up to a significant obstacle to a happier or more meaningful life. But the time savings are tiny. A much bigger obstacle is making good use of what time you already have. Because even if wireless charging saved you an hour a day, rather than three seconds, the same preference for laziness means you’d be more likely to spend that hour on Facebook or Instagram –instead of writing your book, volunteering in your community or whatever. And how would you check Facebook? Why, on the same smartphone that was supposed to be freeing up all that time. I’ll admit this is all very convenient. But convenient for Apple and the rest of them – not for you. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/18/canada-nafta-talks-brexit-theresa-may-ottawa","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T10:30:07Z","webTitle":"Canada’s Nafta talks with the US are a model for Brexit.

Theresa May, take note","bodyText":"When Theresa May visits Ottawa on Monday, she might have more to learn from Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau than what socks to wear to the United Nations, or how to win a majority. Now that the UK has entered into the difficult early stages of negotiating its way out of the European Union, May and her government might want to take note while in North America of how another trade relationship works and how Canada, specifically, handles its role within it. Donald Trump’s election put the spotlight on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a deal between the US, Canada and Mexico that covers everything from avocados to lumber to Ski-Doos. Trump has made it clear that he believes Nafta to be “the worst trade deal ever signed”. The goal, as far as Trump is concerned? Regain control. As with similar promises from Brexiters, the impossibilities of such economic independence were totally ignored in favour of rhetoric. The unprecedented trade talks requested by both Trump and the Brexiters have arrived, and the way by which both Canada and the UK have approached negotiations is a study in contrasts – one that could be instructive for May. Whether Canada bargains at the Nafta table from a position of strength or weakness depends on who you ask and when, but the overall picture is that of an uneven partnership. The US claims it carries a trade deficit with Canada (it does not), but the overall Canadian economy depends more on America than the other way around. But this allows Canada to naturally land a key mental leap – one the Brexiters in May’s government should study. That is, while Canada has long accepted its lot as a junior partner in its relationship with the US, it also knows doing so doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not in a position of considerable power or influence. It all depends on the approach. After the Trump administration prompted Nafta renegotiations, Canada pushed a charm offensive. It routed its diplomatic forays around the White House and down to the congressional and state level. As Vice News and Bloomberg first reported, Trudeau’s office dispatched as many as 18 cabinet ministers to lobby states directly and to remind them of the importance of Canada’s trade relationship in a more local context. Ministers held meetings, shook hands, and smiled for some Instagram photos. Unlike the exchanges between the UK and the EU, Canada’s official verbal dust-ups with the US have been muted. As the renegotiations got under way, chief US negotiator Robert Lighthizer took direct aim at both Mexico and Canada, clarifying that Trump “is not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters”, but rather a rewrite. “We feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,” he said. Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, didn’t directly retaliate. Rather, her response was in keeping with the overall tone Canada adopted from the outset: measured, calm, and reminding of a mutually beneficial relationship. More Canadian, if you will. “We pursue trade, free and fair, knowing it is not a zero-sum game,” Freeland said, before pointing out that “that we are the biggest client of the United States”. For their part, Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump share what is, at least in public, a congenial relationship. Trudeau is cautious to never sound like he’s attacking the president directly, and Trudeau’s inner circle has worked to establish friendly ties with his closest advisers. How much of it is genuine or merely for the cameras is immaterial; it’s in service of a greater goal. You catch more flies with maple syrup, I suppose. There are genuine points of contest between Canada and the US when it comes to rewriting Nafta, and there will be disagreements in the course of its renegotiation. Nafta may even yet be destroyed. May’s Conservative government has an arguably tougher task with regards to the EU, but expecting Brussels to acquiesce, or to bend to Britain’s will, is fantastical thinking. It’s not going to happen – certainly not in a way in which the Brexiters’ lofty guarantees can be met. With their vote to split from the EU, Britons perhaps unknowingly accepted a simultaneous fate of creating a lopsided economic relationship, with the UK dependent on the EU’s moves, rather than the other way around. In a way, Britons voted for the UK to become the Canada of Europe. Maybe it’s time it started acting like it. • Colin Horgan is a former speechwriter for Justin Trudeau"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/ive-always-been-an-arab-it-was-only-when-i-moved-to-the-us-i-realised-i-was-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"I’ve always been an Arab.

It was only when I moved to the US I realised I was ‘brown’","bodyText":"On 26 May, a white supremacist stabbed two people to death in my adopted hometown of Portland, Oregon. Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche confronted their killer when they saw him shouting Islamophobic slurs at a pair of teenage girls on a city train. In response, he slashed their throats and ran. The man who committed this crime did so because he felt entitled to harass Muslims. And he knew at least one of the young women sitting in front of him was Muslim, not because he had any meaningful understanding of her religion, but because he saw the garment covering her hair. It has been a bumper year for Islamophobia in the US – indeed, for hatred of all kinds. And amid the spike in racist violence, there has crystallised a certain definition of what it means to exist as a Muslim in the US today: to be subjected arbitrarily and without notice to a monumentally superficial definition of what it is you are, and await at all times whatever outbreak of individual or institutional violence such a definition might elicit. My wife and I moved to the US four years ago. Besides the usual trepidation I suspect most Arab Muslim men feel whenever they walk through a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint, I experienced no great anxiety at immigrating to this country. From a very young age, I have subsisted on an almost exclusively American cultural diet, and so believed that I understood this place. I didn’t. Only after I had lived here did I come to realise that, before one can make anything of oneself in the US, one must contend with whatever it is the US makes of him. I’ve been Arab my whole life, I’ve been Muslim essentially my whole life, but it wasn’t until I came to this part of the world that I found out I was brown. It is an astounding fraternity, this brownness – a term applied to Central and South Americans, Arabs, Persians, south-east Asians, an assortment of human beings so broad in origin and experience that they may as well literally be called “Other”. I have almost no idea how to be brown. But living in the US, I am constantly offered glimpses of what the designation means; how it relates or fails entirely to relate to my own Muslim identity; the lens under which it casts me. You learn quickly. There are, of course, unwritten rules to my particular flavour of brownness, a small toolkit for getting by: whenever you have to go to the airport, you show up well ahead of time and you bring every conceivable piece of identification, every immigration document. When you speak to a TSA agent, you start with: “How are you?” or “How’s it going?” rather than something more formal, so as to prove your familiarity with the way people speak here and also display your good-as-native English accent. You shave beforehand. If you find yourself driving behind a pickup truck plastered with bumper stickers that say “Certified Isis Hunter” or featuring an illustration of a rifle next to the words “Come and take it”, you ease off the gas and give the guy some space. If someone mangles the pronunciation of your name, you let it slide. Every time anyone expresses pleasant astonishment at how well you speak the language, given you weren’t even born here, you smile and say: “Thanks.” It’s exhausting. Exhausting. But it is not new. In a country that loves its clean, clear dichotomies, there are only good and bad Muslims, and both relate exclusively to terrorism. A billion human beings all neatly reduced to cliches, plot devices for the latest season of Homeland. As with every aspect of racism in the US, the rise of the Trump regime has not brought about some fundamentally new form of Islamophobia, but simply empowered its practitioners to shout out loud what previously they might have only whispered. What is often more frustrating than this sweeping dehumanisation is the tepid way that even champions of mainstream American progressivism argue against it. Throughout the 2016 election, I watched the US’s self-professed liberal politicians denounce everything from Islamophobia to outright torture by pointing out that such things should be avoided because they only serve to make the country less secure. I don’t care if they make the US more or less secure – the rationale for denouncing inhumanity resides on the moral, not the pragmatic, spectrum. One does not advocate for an end to segregation on account of its economic inefficiency, or internment camps on account of there probably being a better use of the space. The day after the Portland stabbings, I went to a memorial for the victims. I watched a group of people from all walks of life gather and light candles and make speeches and hug one another and cry. And for a moment, it was almost possible to forget that one need only drive 20 minutes from here before the city gives way to the vast rural gut of Oregon, where people voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump and Confederate flags still fly high. It was almost possible to forget that, in response to a horrific and high-profile hate crime, the president said exactly nothing for three whole days, before offering a condemnation so half-hearted that many white supremacists undoubtedly assumed it came with a wink and a nod. To live as a minority in America during the Trump era is to occupy one or more slots on a roulette wheel of cruelty. One week the ball might land on immigrants, the next on the transgender community, the next on black or brown people, Muslims, Jews – anyone whose wealth, skin colour or established societal privilege can’t protect them from an administration whose leaders and supporters mistake brutality for strength.

Or looking at the new Dairy Milk bar with bits of marshmallow in it and thinking “Ooh, interesting!” rather than “That is literally the worst abomination committed by humankind.” In short, it’s the thought process of someone who likes films to be in 3D. “Are you then the right person,” you may be asking, “to write about the merits or otherwise of the Natural History Museum and Hasbro’s new twist on Monopoly, Monopoly Dinosaurs?” If you are asking that, full marks for prescience, because that’s exactly what I’m about to do. But absolute minimum marks (which is probably a B or a 2 these days – there’s no point compounding stupidity with low self-esteem) for fair criticism, because the very last person you want passing judgment on Monopoly Dinosaurs is one of those “Ooh, interesting!” juxtaposition junkies munching their peppermint Wotsits washed down by a can of Cadbury’s Creme Sperm. I realise there’s long been more than one Monopoly – and I don’t mean Amazon and Google. I mean more than one version of the game: Star Wars, 007, Virgin Money, Nottingham, and so on. In fact, Amazon and Google don’t actually have Monopolies. Sets of Monopoly for sale, that is. I Googled, I looked on Amazon and found nothing – and how else can you buy anything? Perhaps they fear the implications of its name next to theirs, like when Pavarotti refused to endorse an Italia 90 version of Hungry Hungry Hippos. By the 1930s there were already two Monopolies: the American one, based on Atlantic City, and the British one, set in London. The latter was brought out so the game resonated more with British customers, and I understand the pressure to keep it feeling relevant. But who at Hasbro, in 2017, thought the best way of doing that, of catching the imagination of the aspirant plutocrat kids of today, was to move it out of the field of property development and into palaeontology? Because buying and selling houses for inflated sums is so last century, while academic research is where it’s at? Monopoly is a game that rewards getting rich without making anything. It’s about wealth creation by the aggressive use of ownership. It was ahead of its time. The logical response to our current era would be to take games about dinosaurs, or indeed anything else, and turn them into property trading games like Monopoly where success or failure depends entirely on luck and circumstances rather than merit. Add an extra Chance card, where you lose the rent from one of your cheaper properties when it burns down because you cut corners refurbishing it, plus a load more Get Out of Jail Free cards, and it’s a game about Britain today. I’m not sure that would be appropriate to the Natural History Museum shop, though. Customers will just have seen a lot of dinosaur skeletons and information about dinosaurs and so retail orthodoxy dictates they’ll want to buy things with dinosaurs on them: mugs, pens, badges, games of Monopoly. And, from the game’s blurb, it’s clear the adapters gave the new version a full five minutes’ thought: “Lay claim to each dinosaur fossil, and leave tents and jeeps on your fascinating discoveries. Then watch the rent come pouring in as you make deals with other palaeontologists.” So I’m guessing a jeep on a Tyrannosaurus rex is something a rival palaeontologist really wants to avoid landing on. Much worse than, say, two tents on an iguanodon. Unfortunately, I think my cynicism about this game springs from naivety. “Why would they make that?”, I’m instinctively asking. When I looked at the full list of Monopoly versions – and there are hundreds – I realised it was the wrong question. I should have asked “Why not?”, to which it seems the market supplies no adequate answer. I don’t know why, but the manufacturing costs have obviously sunk so low that they may as well make one. A handful will buy it, and that’s enough: some 3D film buffs plus those saviours of capitalism, people who are buying a present for someone. They don’t have to think the game’s worth having, just that it’ll look appropriate to whoever unwraps it. Together, they’re enough to make Monopoly Dinosaurs pay for itself, just as they were with Dino-opoly in 2004 and Monopoly Dinosaur (singular) in 2010. And indeed Monopoly Harrow School Edition, Dachshund-Opoly, Monopoly Corvette 50th Anniversary Collectors Edition and the rest. Like a bastardised chocolate bar, each causes a microscopic synapse of surprise to fire, a sensation we fleetingly mistake for fun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/15/donald-trump-blames-london-train-explosion-on-loser-terrorists","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T16:20:16Z","webTitle":"Theresa May rebukes Donald Trump over tube bombing tweets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/donald-trump-blames-london-train-explosion-on-loser-terrorists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/donald-trump-blames-london-train-explosion-on-loser-terrorists","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May rebukes Donald Trump over tube bombing tweets","bodyText":"Theresa May has rebuked Donald Trump for suggesting the people responsible for an explosion on a London tube train were known to the Metropolitan police. The prime minister expressed her frustration as she spoke for the first time about the “cowardly attack” at Parsons Green underground station in west London, which injured 29 people. Trump claimed on Twitter that the terrorist attack involved “sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard”, despite no such information having been released publicly by police. He also blamed it on “loser terrorists”, promoted his travel ban and advocated a “proactive and nasty” policy against Islamic State. Asked about Trump’s potential breach of convention on intelligence sharing, May was unusually critical of the US president, saying: “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.” When the president tweeted, no suspect had been identified and no group or individual had claimed responsibility for the blast. The Met police said the president’s comments regarding Friday morning’s incident were unhelpful and “pure speculation”. There was no immediate response from the White House to questions about the basis of Trump’s assertion. Speaking outside the White House on Friday, Trump made no reference to her rebuke. “It’s a terrible thing,” he said. “It just keeps going and going, and we have to be very smart, we have to be very, very tough. Perhaps we are not nearly tough enough. “It’s just an absolutely terrible thing. In fact, I’m going to call the prime minister right now. We have to be tougher and we have to be smarter.” Downing Street said Trump offered May his condolences over the attack during a telephone call later on Friday. In a summary of the call, a White House statement said: “President Trump spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May to convey his sympathies and prayers for those injured in the terrorist attack today in London. The President pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism.” In the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bombing in May, British police temporarily suspended intelligence sharing with the US, after a series of leaks to US media. The broadcaster CBS disclosed the name of the bomber, Salman Abedi, citing US sources, at a time when British authorities were asking the media to withhold the information to protect the investigation. The New York Times then published detailed photographs of the bomb scene that had been taken by British investigators. Nick Timothy, a newspaper columnist who was formerly May’s chief of staff, wrote on Twitter of Trump’s remarks: “True or not – and I’m sure he doesn’t know – this is so unhelpful from the leader of our ally and intelligence partner.” Eighteen people were taken to hospital after the explosion, which was being treated as an isolated incident, and four people made their own way to hospital. London ambulance service said: “None are thought to be in a serious or life-threatening condition.” Trump’s intervention had echoes of his tweets after the London Bridge attack in June, when he criticised Sadiq Khan’s call for calm. In a statement, the London mayor confirmed that the Parsons Green explosion was being treated as terrorism and said: “I urge all Londoners to be calm and vigilant.” At a morning press briefing, the Met assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said: “We now assess that this was a detonation of an improvised explosive device. As you will have seen, there are reports of 18 injuries. I understand most of those to be flash burns.” Rowley said the investigation was being led by the Met counter-terrorism command, supported by MI5. Police officers would be deployed across the capital’s transport network, he added. At around the time Rowley spoke, Trump sent consecutive tweets: He then sent a third: “The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific – but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!” Trump’s travel ban against refugees and others from six majority-Muslim countries is in force but not in full effect, as court challenges on constitutional grounds continue. A first version, against seven countries, was withdrawn after similar challenges. “We have made more progress in the last nine months against Isis than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years,” he said. “Must be proactive &amp; nasty!” The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, will be able to ask Trump to be more cautious with his comments in future when he sees him on Monday at a special UN general assembly session on reforming the organisation. May and Johnson have repeatedly urged politicians and the media not to speculate about the identity of a terrorist, or whether any suspects were under surveillance by UK security services. Overall, the Foreign Office has become more relaxed about Trump’s plain speaking, but the security services that work under its political direction will be infuriated by any sign that the US president has leaked intelligence information. Trust and confidentiality between UK and US intelligence is the bedrock of the relationship between the two services. May is is due to make prevention of extremism on the internet one of her three key themes at the UN next week. Although May does not support Trump’s talk of cutting off the internet, she agrees with him that technology giants have not done enough to tackle online extremism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/15/iphone-8-buy-cheapest-offers-cheap-sim-only-deal-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T12:04:32Z","webTitle":"What's the cheapest way of buying an iPhone 8?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/15/iphone-8-buy-cheapest-offers-cheap-sim-only-deal-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/15/iphone-8-buy-cheapest-offers-cheap-sim-only-deal-cost","fields":{"headline":"What's the cheapest way of buying an iPhone 8?","bodyText":"The iPhone 8 is available to pre-order from today, but don’t be distracted by flashy offers with low upfront costs and a high monthly fee: the cheapest way to get one is still simply buying it outright from Apple or another retailer, and taking out a low cost sim-only contract. The 64GB iPhone 8, the cheapest of the newly launched phones, costs £699 when bought directly from Apple or from a third-party electronics store such as Currys or John Lewis. Combined with a low-cost contract or pay-as-you-go sim, such as the £5 plan offered by O2’s corporate sibling Giffgaff, the cost of owning the phone for two years is £819 – lower than any competing deal of the major retailers we reviewed. Only one mobile phone operator deal came close to offering better value for money: Sky Mobile charges an up-front fee of £99, with a monthly cost of £37 for the first 12 months and £28 for the second 12 months – a total outlay of £879. But the Sky Mobile deal, with its Swap12 plan, lets you trade up to a new phone 12 months in, restarting the cycle (and locking you into a contract for another two years). The Sky Mobile deal means you are, in effect, paying £543 for the iPhone 8 over the one-year period, a saving on the £759 you’ll have to pay for the same period if you pay up-front and take out a low-cost sim deal for a year. But unlike buying the phone in one lump sum, you don’t get to keep your iPhone when you decide to trade it in. That means the distinction largely comes down to two questions: how happy you are navigating eBay or similar, where a one-year-old unlocked iPhone will typically sell for at least half its new value; and how much you want to avoid being locked in to one mobile operator for the long term (Sky Mobile uses O2’s network, so its coverage will be the same). Even if your main interest isn’t to keep the price as low as possible, the most cost-effective way to get a new iPhone is still to buy it outright from Apple and then pick up a sim-only contract that carries the best mixture of minutes, SMS messages and data to suit your needs. A word of warning for the worst plans we found, which are O2’s “deals” that let you “pay for your device in full”: the company charges £771.99 up front for a phone that Apple sells for £699, and still locks you in to a two-year contract on tariffs that start at £19 monthly. Finally, it’s worth mentioning the iPhone Upgrade Plan. The company splits the cost of an iPhone and AppleCare+, its premium warranty service, over 24 monthly increments, but allows customers to upgrade to a new phone after 11 months. As with Sky Mobile’s Swap12 plan, the deal can be worth it if you intend to get a new phone every year, but it comes with similar lock in: if you decide to switch to Android, you’ll be stuck paying off your iPhone for a full two years. The forced AppleCare+, meanwhile, will be a waste of money for most users – unless you smash your phone’s screen, in which case it vastly reduces the cost of fixing it. And one word of warning: the iPhone 8 is not the iPhone X, Apple’s all-singing, all-dancing, all-screen “future”. The 8 will start shipping 22 September, while the X is coming on November 3. If you’re in two minds about which model to go for, it may be worth waiting another couple of months until the first set of reviews come in for that device before tying yourself down to an iPhone 8. Indeed, new information is still coming through about the iPhone X. Apple executive Craig Federighi just yesterday revealed some more news about how the device’s Face ID system works, in an email to an Apple developer. The feature uses IR light, which shines through “most sunglasses”, he said, meaning it will still work on your beach holiday (unless you are unlucky); and an emergency lock feature, activated by “gripping the buttons on both sides of the phone”, prevents it being simply stolen and unlocked coercively by a thief. Whether Face ID really works as well as Apple says it does remains to be seen. Flying to US to get an iPhone X is cheaper than buying in Europe. It’s also illegal New iPhones: why is Apple’s pricing the same in pounds and dollars?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/17/the-march-on-russia-review-david-storey","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"The March on Russia review – subtle drama of hope and regret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/17/the-march-on-russia-review-david-storey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/17/the-march-on-russia-review-david-storey","fields":{"headline":"The March on Russia review – subtle drama of hope and regret","bodyText":"It is a long time since I have seen a tasselled lampshade on stage. Or an antimacassar. But then it is a long time since I have heard such gradually uncoiling, slowly deepening dialogue as that in David Storey’s The March on Russia. When Storey died in March, he was celebrated for work based on his own early days: fictional and theatrical evocations of northern working-class life. His novel This Sporting Life (1960), filmed by Lindsay Anderson, drew on his career as a professional rugby league player: he was as much athlete as aesthete, and once hit the Guardian’s Michael Billington after an adverse review. The March on Russia, set in a retirement bungalow near the Yorkshire coast in 1989, has an intense naturalism that suggests personal experience: Storey bought his own parents such a bungalow. It might have been written to prove that lack of dramatic action does not mean dramatic inertia. This is an evening when a tiny movement, such as a light and unexpected kiss, can send a gasp and a sigh through the audience. A couple marking their diamond wedding anniversary are visited by their three children. He is an ex-miner, out of school at 11 and down the pit till he was 65; she was timid and is now tense. The adult kids are used to the elderly grumping at each other and to their competitive ailments: his pneumoconiosis versus her hysterectomy. They are unprepared for the sadness of the secrets they let out. This is a drama of disappointment spliced with hope. Is the constant bickering really just banter, the sniping only display? Or is it the gruff amiability that is the pretence, covering up an abyss of grief? It is Storey’s skill to keep these questions up in the air. In Alice Hamilton’s finely calibrated production all the performances are lively. But the evening belongs to the jubilee couple. To Ian Gelder, habitually jaunty but invaded by bewilderment and sudden sadness. His cheeks slowly drop towards his slippers. And to Sue Wallace as his wife, her snappy terseness – “There’s feelings and feelings” – undermined by anxiety. There is no explosion, but continual upset. James Perkins’s design makes a complete world out of two rooms. Only the kettle looks wrong. Surely this couple wouldn’t have had an electric jug? It is a tribute to the play that you feel you know them well enough to question it.

These activities give Zametkin the chance to take time for herself, which, she says, helps her better care for others. This view is shared widely across the industry, including by London-based yoga teacher Kat Achtelik, who participated in several NGO-led projects in Asia before moving to the UK. For her, practicing yoga and meditation comes down to self-love: “You cannot pour from an empty cup. You have to take care of yourself first, before catering for others.” Likewise, Anke Lenz, a 29-year-old social care professional who works with teenage refugees in Berlin and has completed yoga teacher training, insists that yoga has made her enjoy her job more. She says it has taught her to have a positive mindset and helped her get through emotionally-draining situations by allowing her to distance herself from her emotions. “Through doing yoga and being mindful, I’ve been able to see my limits and learn how to care for myself,” she adds. “Social workers are often over-scheduled, underpaid, exposed to traumatic stories and are therefore at risk of burnout and secondary trauma,” says Kristen Esposito Brendel. Working as an assistant professor of social work at Aurora University, Illinois, and being a licensed clinical social worker, she’s also the founder of Per La Vita Wellness, an organisation providing mindfulness-based counselling to clients with mental and physical health issues. Secondary traumatic stress (STS) is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder that has also been linked to burnouts. For Brendel, mindfulness is a way to simultaneously “mediate the risks and heal the healer”. Dedicating time to meditative practices is crucial for those working in organisations where the cumulative effects of stress can lead to physical and psychological issues. An advantage of meditation and mindfulness is that these practices aren’t time-consuming or expensive and don’t require specific equipment. Achtelik says: “It’s a tool you always have with you, it’s always available and doesn’t cost anything to use. And it’s holistic. It will help you in your private life, too. You’ll learn not to bring issues from home to work, and the other way around.” Zametkin agrees: for her, meditative practices are essential for wellbeing if you work in social care. The prevalence of yoga and meditation studios as well as the existence of free mindfulness podcasts, videos and apps, make meditative practices more accessible than ever before. Brendel recommends Insight Timer, a popular free meditation app, as a precious tool for social care professionals needing to be guided through the process. Considering that emotions can either prevent or support our ability to work, Brynne Caleda, the CEO of Yoga Ed, a US-based organisation that focuses on integrating yoga into education, believes that the way professionals come to work affects their relationship with their patients: yoga and meditation give them the ability to “be fully present to their client”. Meanwhile, Claire Knigge, a 32-year-old social worker based in Belgium, says that meditation helps her cope with the daily crises that come up at work. These events are now less likely to harm her state of mind – and she is able to distance herself from what is happening and react appropriately. Knigge says the teenage girls she looks after are stunned at how happy she always seems. “What they see is actually me being very balanced. And being balanced is one of the biggest benefits of meditation,” she says. Every social care professional I spoke to said they thought yoga and meditation should become part of the course for aspiring social care workers. As the importance of mental health in the workplace is being increasingly acknowledged, the social care sector hopes to be leading the way. Looking for a job?

However, we are now in a position where that taboo is being flagrantly disregarded by the leaders of the most powerful nation in the world, and a totalitarian dictatorship. Taboos offer a way for us to create overarching rules of societal acceptability that transcend our social and cultural norms. Taboos prohibit behaviours that are not appropriate within and beyond the moral or ethical framework of an individual community – scenarios that are so dangerous or perverse that they are almost unspeakable. Traditionally, those who engage in taboo activities, such as incest, are stigmatised and ostracised by their society, as their breach or defiance of taboo could have significant and unacceptable repercussions. We had a taboo surrounding deploying nuclear weapons – out of respect for the devastation they can wreak – but it seems more and more fragile. Fat Man and Little Boy exploded in the skies over Nagasaki and Hiroshima 72 years ago. The immediate consequences of the bombings were dramatic and survivors of this attack are still physically, culturally and psychologically affected by their experiences to this day. This is the source of the nuclear taboo. It evolved during the cold war, as our international arsenal transitioned from atomic bombs to larger and more devastating thermonuclear weapons. These were tested in seemingly endless competitive escalation by the first five nuclear states, Russia, France, the USA, China and the UK. In 1960, Herman Khan of the Rand Corporation arrived upon the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) as a reason to inhibit further weapon development. He declared that nuclear defence technologies had grown to such enormous proportions that it would now be possible to obliterate humankind if multilateral nuclear warfare was ever undertaken. Whereas the initial era of nuclear arms development created a frenzied, normalised, and even valorised race toward weapons development and deployment, MAD subsequently stigmatised and reversed those goals, firmly establishing the nuclear taboo. Despite the taboo, testing and development continued among non-nuclear states, including Pakistan and India. However, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1996 cooled hostile interactions between nuclear weapon possessor states. For about a decade or so, we felt comparatively safe from nuclear warfare. The conscience of the world had stigmatised nuclear weapons – and the taboo of MAD had stretched far beyond the geopolitical arena and the strategic concerns of individual states by the end of the Cold War. Public disquiet was multifaceted and complex. State nuclear strike preparedness activities, such as Protect and Survive in the UK, had been counterproductive and created further apprehension. Passionate appeals from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors emphasised the brutal nature of the bomb, and further contributions to the growth of stigma were made by the women of Greenham Common and other anti-nuclear movements. A shift in attitudes meant that nuclear weapons had gained a special status, inhumane and uncivilised. Even President Ronald Reagan recognised the stigma of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, saying that “A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The only value in our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used.” His thoughts were echoed by UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1980s. How and why have we entered a new phase of nuclear brinkmanship? Thanks to President Donald Trump and Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un, our generation’s own volatile Fat Man and Little Boy, the sensible norms of restraint and careful diplomacy that have previously surrounded nuclear deterrence proliferation and use are now under stress. President Donald Trump seems indifferent to social norms, and behaves without rationality. He made several public statements, via Twitter and traditional media, that glamorise the use and increased production of nuclear weapons. All while his administration slashes budgets and slashes programs designed to protect communities from the well-documented risks that come from producing nuclear weapons. Trump has ostracized himself from international leadership nearly every turn, including NATO and G-20 summits, isolating himself from democratic world leaders, and aligning himself more with leaders of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. He has divided America, twisting the knife into historical wounds of racism and civil rights abuses, as well as upending environmental protection, denying climate change and proposing a tax regime that will create persistent poverty – to name a few examples. North Korea is currently basking in its own nuclear disruption, finally gaining the place that it feels it deserves in the geopolitical arena – for all the wrong reasons. Like a child who learns to gain attention for bad behaviour, Kim relishes this moment. However, there is a tragic legacy behind his trumped-up attempts at power. Poverty and human rights violations are experienced by many North Koreans, and there is a dark legacy of Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace programme that originally took nuclear technology to South East Asia in the hopeful 1960s. We mustn’t forget the human beings who live in North Korea, and the way that UN sanctions are already affecting their lives. The bickering across Twitter has escalated, and the sheer ubiquity of Trump and Kim’s threats have to some extent re-legitimised the use of nuclear weapons to ‘solve’ conflict rather than deter such “fire and fury” that might bring to an end life as we know it. Indeed, recent research suggests that a limited use of nuclear weapons could disrupt the climate in such a way that would radically alter food production, and in turn lead to global famine. Trump needs to cut the sass, to scale back his inflammatory and impulsive rants, and to start engaging in the nuclear debate with much greater sensitivity. We want the most peaceful resolution that is now possible, to prevent further escalation of conflict. We do not want stumble into nuclear war, a risk that exists beyond bellicose displays of power. The current hot-threat engagement is not just a security issue, but a massive humanitarian one too. Kim starves his own people in the pursuit of nuclear defence technology. Trump and Kim’s verbally violent exchange is as serious as North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons. It could have devastating future implications if the stigma of nuclear weapons is not restored. The people of the supposed democracy of the USA and the totalitarian state of North Korea both seem powerless to change the behaviour of their leaders. However, international attitudes are more progressive. The stigma of nuclear deterrence has not been lost on the majority of nations, 122 of whom endorsed a nuclear weapon ban treaty that seeks to prohibit the development, production, possession, testing, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. The BAN treaty is likely to enter into force on 20 September 2017, when it opens for signatures at the United Nations in New York. Although no nuclear possessor nation supports this treaty, they understand that the BAN will re-stigmatize nuclear weapons and re-invigorate public debate and action for nuclear abolition. Our taboos are a greater reflection of our global society and ethics.. What does it say about us at this point in history, if we let the taboo of the unspeakable horror of nuclear warfare disappear? We cannot uninvent the bomb, so we need to rethink and redesign the rules of de-escalation and disarmament, if we are to avoid the fallout of nuclear conflict.

Tweed, a 19-month-old springer spaniel, and Rob, a 20-month-old black labrador, are said to the first digital detection dogs outside the US. The dogs have been trained by Devon &amp; Cornwall and Dorset police but have already been used at crime scenes across the UK. They have been used to sniff out hidden data devices such as USB sticks, SD cards and hard drives. Ch Supt Jim Nye, commander for the alliance operations department that works across the two forces, said: “These dogs will give the police a new way to fight the threat of terrorism, paedophiles and fraudsters.” In 2015, dog instructor PC Graham Attwood began to research whether dogs could be used effectively in this way and worked with his counterparts in Connecticut, who use digital detection dogs. Most dogs used by the south-west forces come from their own puppy breeding scheme, are given as gifts or are rescue dogs. However, Tweed and Rob were bought especially for this job when they were about 15 months old. Attwood said: “Myself and members of the alliance dog school initially handled and trained Tweed and Rob mainly in our own time as we were committed to our usual daily duties of training the forces’ other operational police dogs.” Mike Real, a recently retired Connecticut state police dog instructor and co-founder of the American programme, along with special agent Jeffrey Calandra, who is the only digital detection dog handler in the FBI, were invited to Devon for a week to train and assess Tweed and Rob. They passed their assessment with flying colours and were set to work. Attwood, added: “Our digital dogs have already proven to be a success and have been used in over 50 warrants executed across the UK, including Hampshire, Essex, south Wales, and North Yorkshire. “We have already seen some really fantastic results from these two dogs. Tweed on one warrant indicated that something may have been within what looked like a Coke can. This was then inspected by a search officer and discovered that it was actually a money box that had a number of SD cards hidden within it. “Rob has also indicated a small device hidden carefully in a drawer which would have likely to have been missed by the human eye.” If the dogs continue to do well, others may be trained.

Business leaders, and even ministers, continually refer to the “adverse effects of Brexit and how to offset them”. There is only one way – stop Brexit (“May has neither the strength nor the skill to lead us out of Brexit shambles”, Editorial). Michel Barnier has stated, and you have reiterated, that the current UK position on negotiations with the EU is totally unrealistic. Indeed, it is nothing short of embarrassing. We are trying to claim that we will be “better off” leaving the EU, but also admitting that we cannot afford to and need EU help in transition, allowing us to “cherry-pick” what we want from them. Why should they help us while we are trying to set up trade deals elsewhere that disadvantage them? There are two realistic choices – remain in the EU or leave and take our chances in the world, standing on our own feet. I hope it will end up being the former and I think that when faced with reality (rather than the current fantasy) the majority of the British public would agree. Public opinion is perhaps already starting to turn. It is often said that the responsibility of MPs is to “respect” the referendum result. Clearly, it should be considered seriously, but we also elect MPs to give advice and guidance. The vast majority of MPs, along with business leaders, the governor of Bank of England etc, believe in remaining in the EU. Why, unlike the minority who want “Brexit at all costs”, are they afraid to speak out? Putting politics and self-protection issues aside, ministers should come clean and stop peddling the pretence of a totally unrealistic Brexit deal. Pro-Remain MPs should exert pressure to do so and the sooner it happens, the less it will cost us all. Ken Hickson Caddington Bedfordshire Your leader last week identifies many things that Britain did not vote for in the EU referendum – lower living standards, slacker environmental protection, a contemptible immigration policy and so on – and asks: “By what twisted reasoning… hard Brexit Tories claim a mandate for forcing their extremist views on the majority of voters?” On another page, Toby Helm (“Is this divided Brexit parliament up to the challenge?”, In Focus) identifies 200 or so MPs as “resolute Leavers”, happy to follow the fanatics out of the single market and customs union. Imagine the referendum result had gone the other way. Would the Remainers, cock-a-hoop at their 52% to 48% victory, have claimed that the settled will of the British people was not only to stay in the EU but also to join the euro and the Schengen zone, while giving up the rebates and opt-outs, regardless of the economic and social consequences? I think not, but this is the mirror image of the stance of the hard Brexiters, driving what passes for the government’s negotiating strategy. John Filby Ashover Derbyshire I read with interest your article about opposition to a hard Brexit with a soft Brexit. You are unable to get to grips with the politics of devolution and still see it through the Westminster/English prism. Scotland, the country to the north of England, not merely another region of England, voted in every constituency to stay, therefore, the government of Scotland, and all the other parties, if they actually believed their job is to represent their constituents and not the three mother English parties, should only be focused on remaining completely in the EU, whatever that stakes, including supporting the Scottish freedom movement and independence in the EU. Rather than reflect this national difference, and the reality of the vote last year, you try to fit the round shape of Scotland’s vote into the square of English Brexit.

A survey by the BBC found that 61% of its employees had parents who were in or had been in higher managerial positions and professional occupations. This measure is considered an accurate reflection of whether people are from a privileged background. The result is double the national average, suggesting the corporation is significantly out of sync with the general population. The survey also found that 17% of BBC staff and 25% of the BBC management team went to private school, significantly above the UK average of 7%. Furthermore, 52% of staff had parents with university degrees, which is also above the norm. This is the first time the BBC has collected information connected to class. James Purnell, its director of radio and education, revealed the findings at the Royal Television Society (RTS) convention in Cambridge. Purnell said the BBC is considering introducing targets regarding the class of its workforce. The corporation already has targets connected to gender, race, sexuality and disability, but Purnell said it wanted to see more data from across the TV industry before deciding what an appropriate target for class would be. In an attempt to avoid hiring people only from Oxbridge and private schools, the BBC has started removing names and educational backgrounds from CVs during the recruitment process. This measure already covers thousands of applications and about 300 jobs a year at the corporation. It was put in place for entry-level roles, such as trainees and apprenticeships, last year, and expanded in April to all vacant positions at the BBC on an optional basis. The removal of degrees from CVs is likely to be controversial, because tuition fees for a three-year university course are more than £27,000. Purnell defended the move, saying: “It’s something lots of organisations are doing; across accountancy, across law. The theory, which I think is right, is that you can get that evidence in other ways, so you can get it through demonstrating competency in other ways.” The BBC has been under pressure to broaden the socioeconomic diversity of its workforce for some time. Sharon White, the chief executive of the media regulator, Ofcom, said earlier this year that the broadcaster was too focused on “middle-aged and middle-class” people. Purnell, who admitted he was “definitely privileged”, said the BBC was keen to have targets. “We don’t have targets for socioeconomic [backgrounds], but we are thinking about it,” he said. “The hard question is what is good. We know what our data is, we don’t know how it compares to other people. Until we have data across the industry, I think it’s quite hard to know what good is. We would love to have a target, we would be very happy to do that, it’s just what it would be.” Diversity in broadcasting was one of the dominant topics at the RTS convention this week after Ofcom published a damning report. White criticised British broadcasters for a woeful lack of diversity among their staff and accused the BBC of failing to lead the way. Women, minority ethnic groups and disabled people are all under-represented by broadcasters, Ofcom found. The regulator intends to expand the diversity report next year to include social class, an issue White said was “incredibly important” for diversity. It will ask broadcasters for information on the geographic and educational backgrounds of staff. The Ofcom chief called on TV executives to stop using unpaid internships because of concerns that the practice limits access to the industry to those who can afford to live in London. “We would call to industry across the board to move away from unpaid internships in order to broaden social class,” White said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/mondays-best-tv-rellik-w1a-letters-from-baghdad","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T04:59:00Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Rellik; W1A; Letters from Baghdad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/mondays-best-tv-rellik-w1a-letters-from-baghdad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/mondays-best-tv-rellik-w1a-letters-from-baghdad","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Rellik; W1A; Letters from Baghdad","bodyText":"Liar 9pm, ITV Frustrated by what she sees as a lack of police progress, teacher Laura (Joanne Froggatt) makes a social media attack against the man she has accused of rape, surgeon Andrew (Ioan Gruffudd).

One of the most successful space missions ever launched, it revealed Saturn and its moons in glorious detail. Images beamed home from the probe showed raging hurricanes that enveloped the planet, and millions of rings that surround it. The spacecraft dropped a lander on Titan, the largest of Saturn’s 62 known moons, marking the first touchdown on a heavenly body on the other side of the asteroid belt. But it was observations of the tiny, icy moon Enceladus that stunned astronomers most, and transformed their views on the potential for life elsewhere in the solar system. From the moment Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004, its cameras and other instruments radically altered scientists’ understanding of the most distant planet visible to the naked eye. Before the mission astronomers thought Saturn, the second largest planet in the solar system and the sixth from the sun, was circled by thousands of rings. Cassini showed it was millions. And rather than static bands of dust, the rings have a complex life of their own. Cassini saw ring matter clumping into snowballs, and being cleared by tiny moonlets, leaving propeller-shaped gaps in the rings thousands of kilometres long. In places the rings are incredibly thin, only hundreds of metres from to top to bottom, and when nearby moons pass by, they send giant waves rippling through them. Cassini carried a European lander named Huygens. Its destination was Titan, a world so mysterious that engineers designed the lander to touch down on both liquid and solid surfaces. The moment came in January 2005 and, at first, Huygens appeared to have settled on a crème brûlée landscape, a brittle layer coating softer ground. The conclusion turned out to be premature: scientists later worked out Huygens had set down on a pebble before finally coming to rest. John Zarnecki, president of the Royal Astronomical Society, worked on the instrument Huygens used to measure Titan’s resistance to the landing. “It was the first part of Huygens to make contact and for all of 15 milliseconds we were the only thing touching Titan,” he said. “It was the most memorable day of my professional life. Fifteen years of blood, sweat and tears and it all came down to those minutes. It was incredibly emotional.” For Zarnecki, one consolation is that while Cassini has burned up, the defunct Huygens could remain on Titan for generations to come. Titan turned out to be an extraordinary world. Bright, feathery methane clouds float in the hazy orange sky and pour methane rain onto a surface carved by rivers, lakes and seas, producing a landscape resembling the early Earth’s. In the seas, scientists noticed what they called “magic islands” that come and go with time. The features are not well understood, but may be massive upwellings of nitrogen bubbles. Meanwhile, in the upper atmosphere, Cassini found molecules known as “carbon chain anions”, precursors of complex organic molecules that ultimately form the building blocks of life. Cassini explored 18 moons beyond Titan, but none was more revelatory than Enceladus, an icy ball only 500km wide. In 2005, Cassini spotted plumes of salty water containing simple organics blasting into space from the moon’s southern pole. The spacecraft later found convincing evidence for a subsurface ocean that was feeding the geysers, most likely with help from hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Scientists consider such vents on Earth as promising places for life to have started. “We thought Enceladus was a run-of-the-mill icy satellite and yet we found it is active and nobody expected that. It is game-changing for how we look at the solar system,” Zarnecki said. “Many of these icy moons, we think, have large reservoirs of water beneath the surface. It means most of the icy satellites of Saturn and Jupiter could in theory be harbours for life.” Nasa is now considering a mission that would fly back to Enceladus, to look for alien microbes in the moon’s hidden ocean. But even if the mission is selected, it would be more than a decade before launch. Late in 2010, Cassini watched a monstrous thunder and lightning storm form on Saturn. Months of observations showed the hurricane growing until it eventually wrapped around the planet. Geography ensures the same cannot happen on Earth, but without land to intervene, Saturn’s storm stretched over 300,000km. It lasted for most of the year and only petered out when its head caught up with its tail and disrupted the gigantic weather system. Saturn is so distant that a year on the planet lasts 30 years on Earth. But for all scientists have learnt about the ringed world, they are still unsure how fast it spins, and so the length of its day. With no landmasses to observe, clocking the spin of gas giant is far from straightforward. Jupiter, another gas giant and the largest planet in the solar system, emits radio waves that reveal its day to last a mere 10 Earth hours. Similar radio waves come from Saturn, but they have not been so helpful. The waves’ patterns, which are controlled by the planet’s spin, turned out to be different at the northern and southern hemispheres, and even changed with the seasons. For now, the length of the day is one secret Saturn has not given up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/20/barge-tide-history-cornwall-country-diary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T04:30:37Z","webTitle":"'River lorries' float us back on the tide of history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/20/barge-tide-history-cornwall-country-diary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/20/barge-tide-history-cornwall-country-diary","fields":{"headline":"'River lorries' float us back on the tide of history","bodyText":"Tide floods between mud banks and wind-blown purple reed flowers as the audience carry chairs into Shamrock’s shed. Earlier, high water washed debris across the quay and into the gig club’s yard, and the possibility of more rain precludes the outdoor venue of tonight’s concert by the Polperro Fishermen’s Choir. Inside the lofty slate-roofed building, beneath block and tackle sorted as stay, main and mizzen, we are entertained with songs and shanties; money raised will go towards repairs and maintenance of Shamrock, a renovated Tamar sailing barge. Shamrock has been based at Cotehele since 1974, when it was towed upriver and away from abandonment in Hooe Lake. Restoration (by the National Trust and the National Maritime Museum) was completed in 1979 with the hoisting of new sails made in Falmouth. Lately, a slipway track and cradle have been installed to winch the barge out of the dock and on to dry land so that rotten hull planking can be renewed and a new engine fitted to allow easier movement without complete reliance on wind and tide. Before motorised transport this waterway was thronged with boats carrying grain, timber, ores, limestone and fish refuse for manures. Servicing involved pulling barges up on to hards to be careened, or guiding them to float towards and settle across huge tree trunks resting on sandbanks exposed at low tide. Some of the later “river lorries” included Mayblossom, Martin, Sirdar, Commerce, and Secret. Myrtle, the last barge to ply the Tamar and dock at Cotehele, was destroyed during the blitz of Plymouth. The vessel had been built at Calstock in 1896 for Captain Bill Martin of Boetheric; later, my grandfather, of Cotehele Mill, bought it. An engine was installed and the barge continued to haul imported grains, unloaded at the quay for carting to the water-mill for grinding and mixing. This evening, after a melodious celebration of Cornwall’s fishers, farmers and miners, of the county’s moors, meadows and seashore, we emerge into the quiet darkness. Flags decorating Shamrock are still, tree tops above the lime kilns are silhouetted against fading brightness in the west, and an owl hoots in the woods.

That means it’s the end of the road for Mitchell, Priddis and Petrie (although we’ll be seeing plenty of Mitchell next year in the coaching box). It wasn’t the end they deserved, but the Port Adelaide win was surely a highlight worthy of going out on. The Giants, meanwhile, delivered on the promise they’ve flirted with all season, and look a scary proposition for the Tigers next week. Coniglio dominated with 35 disposals, including 11 contested possessions, eight clearances, three marks, seven tackles and a goal. Likewise, Lachie Whitfield delivered one of his best performances yet, with 28 disposals, seven contested possessions, 11 marks, two clearances and five tackles. And then there was Steve Johnson, who returned to form in stunning fashion with six goals, to ensure his place in next week’s blockbuster. The story in the lead-up will most likely be Brett Deledio’s unlikely encounter with Richmond in a preliminary final - who would’ve thought? Thanks for joining me for tonight’s action - which unfortunately delivered yet another AFL finals blowout. Preliminary final week, however, should be huge, with Patrick Dangerfield’s Cats up against his old side in the Adelaide Crows, and the Giants taking on a rampaging Richmond. Can’t wait. See you next week. AFL Q4 01:09 GWS Giants 19.11 (125) v West Coast Eagles 9.4 (58) Sam Mitchell kicks a goal to cap off a fine career, which will finish on 329 games with 28 disposals and two goals. Only Priddis and Redden (29 each) have more disposals for the Eagles. AFL Q4 04:06 GWS Giants 19.11 (125) v West Coast Eagles 8.3 (51) Johnson has a shot at a seventh - but he can’t quite make the difference. He’s laughing his way to the finish line, Stevie J (literally and figuratively). Chants of “Stevie” ring out throughout Spotless. Now it’s Patton’s turn at one with a set-shot - he’s racked up 22 disposals after some time on the ball tonight. He slots it. AFL Q4 06:42 GWS Giants 18.10 (118) v West Coast Eagles 8.3 (51) Miraculous snap for Johnson to bring up number six from a tough angle in the pocket. Reckon the Tigers will be worried the Eagles have played them back into their best form. Well done by Coniglio to have the sense of theatre to pass it off to Johnson on a worse angle. AFL Q4 07:50 GWS Giants 17.10 (112) v West Coast Eagles 8.3 (51) Another goal to the Giants - this time through Coniglio, who has 31 disposals and now a goal. What a strange finals series we’ve had - after such a close season to have so many blowouts. Perhaps it makes a strange kind of sense after all. AFL Q4 10:39 GWS Giants 16.10 (106) v West Coast Eagles 8.3 (51) Couple of consolation goals to the Eagles through retiring Drew Petrie (who can hold his head up high after a fantastic season) and then Jack Darling, with a spectacular snap over his shoulder. The North Queensland Cowboys live to fight another day with their upset victory over the Parramatta Eels finishing at 24-16. It could have been worse, if not for a last-minute try to Jennings in the 80th minute. The Cowboys were down 10-6 at half-time but found the tryline through all of Asiata, Hess and Morgan in the second half to power to victory. That’s back-to-back losses for the Eels after they finished fourth after the regular season - and ends a disappointing finals series for them. For the Cowboys, however, it continues an incredible story given they are without captains Thurston and Scott. They’ll now face the Roosters in a preliminary final, who - although they’ll start hot favourites - will hold no fear for the brave Cowboys. AFL Q4 16:44 GWS Giants 16.10 (106) v West Coast Eagles 6.3 (39) Mark to LeCras (get it?), who has a chance to save some face for the Eagles. Just the one goal for him tonight, and ten disposals. He converts from 50m out. AFL Q4 19:44 GWS Giants 16.10 (106) v West Coast Eagles 5.2 (32) Unreal - it’s five goals to Johnson with just seconds gone in the final quarter. That’s the first time ever he’s kicked five goals in a final. NRL H2 75:14 Parramatta Eels 10-24 North Queensland Cowboys Now for something more like a contest... and the Cowboys are up 18-10 through that try to Hess in the 52nd minute (and Lowe conversion). Taumalolo has 193 run metres, while Hess has 133. Single line-breaks to Hess, Linnett and O’Neill. Scrap that it’s another try to the Cowboys! This one goes to Michael Morgan, and it’s game over! Huge win for the Cowboys. So next week we’ll see Storm v Broncos and Roosters v Cowboys. AFL three-quarter-time GWS Giants 15.10 (100) v West Coast Eagles 5.2 (32) Uh oh, Nick Haynes looks to have hurt his knee - looks in big trouble (although now he’s back on the ground?) You’d think the Giants would get him off anyway (and on cue he runs off the ground). On the replay just looks to have got a boot to the knee-cap. Siren sounds for three-quarter-time, and it’s all too easy for the Giants. Total fizzer of a final. AFL Q3 02:27 remaining GWS Giants 15.10 (100) v West Coast Eagles 5.2 (32) GWS captain Callan Ward up to 21 disposals, including six contested possessions, nine marks, four clearances, five tackles and a goal. Whitfield isn’t far behind, with 21 disposals, nine marks and five tackles. Loved their games, as well as Coniglio (22 disposals - 7 contested possessions, six clearances, seven tackles. Guess who - he’s kicked four goals in this quarter alone, Johnson. AFL Q3 07:28 remaining GWS Giants 14.10 (94) v West Coast Eagles 5.2 (32) Eagles players look out on their feet - it’s surely that rather than any lack of effort. De Boer has a chance at a second but it’s punched through. Eagles defenders just can’t stay with their players who are finding all kinds of space on the overlap. Stevie J has a shot at a third - and it’s an off break through for a goal. Has played himself into a prelim - even if it has all been after the fact of the Giants’ dominance. Shuey bombs one outside 50 for a consolation goal. AFL Q3 09:25 remaining GWS Giants 13.9 (87) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) Lots of old-fashioned biff happening here, think the Eagles are just trying to tempt some Giants into a nervous week at this point. Hate to think how the Power players are feeling now. AFL Q3 11:56 remaining GWS Giants 13.8 (86) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) The trade-in Giants are all chiming in - this time via Deledio... now there’s a match-up I’m looking forward to next week (he’s yet to play the Tigers, Deledio). Dangerfield will of course play the Crows next week too. AFL Q3 12:32 remaining GWS Giants 12.8 (80) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) Guess who? Johnson takes a spectacular contested mark between two Eagles’ defenders including McGovern - and gets two in a row. Looks like he’ll play in a Prelim (as will the Cats, albeit the other Prelim - imagine if they met? Don’t see it happening, personally). AFL Q3 13:26 remaining GWS Giants 11.8 (74) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) Stevie J - with a heavily bandaged forehead - kicks the Giants eight goals in front (they’ve kicked 10 of the last 12). Sorry to say this one is a boilover... in the NRL, meanwhile, Hess scores for the Cowboys (after a slick Martin inside ball) - and Ma’u looks to throw a punch (but no sin bin?) 18-10 Cowboys! OK I’ll stay focused on this... promise. AFL Q3 15:11 remaining GWS Giants 10.8 (68) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) Patton takes a big contested grab on Hurn - he’s in almost the same position he kicked two behinds from in the first quarter. Just his eighth disposal. This one floats straight through - and it’s all Giants. AFL Q3 16:44 remaining GWS Giants 9.8 (62) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) Yeo shifted forward in an attempt to turn things around for the Eagles - but the Giants hit up Whitfield 40m out, who looks to have recovered from his apparent concussion. He’s had 14 disposals and eight marks - but misses for his second behind for the night. NRL H2 46:29 Parramatta Eels 10-12 North Queensland Cowboys COWBOYS score! It goes to Asiata after a strip. Lowe converts. Game on! Tennis In case you missed it earlier today - Nick Kyrgios vowed to keep delivering for Australia in the Davis Cup following his dramatic five-set victory over Steve Darcis in Brussels. Kyrgios has endured a tough year with injuries forcing him to retire from Queens, Wimbledon, and an event in Washington last month, leading to some inconsistent form on court. He is 26-13 in wins-losses so far this year on the ATP Tour. The enigmatic star has previously admitted he’s often not as committed as he should be with his training and even questioned whether he wanted to continue playing tennis. But there was no doubting his commitment to the cause in the Belgian capital on Friday as he sent down 34 aces in a come-from-behind 6-3 3-6 6-7 (7-5) 6-1 6-2 win that silenced a partisan home crowd. It was arguably his best performance in a campaign that has also seen him beat Novak Djokovic at Indian Wells in March and more recently Rafael Nadal in Cincinnati. “I think it was one of more important wins I have had,” Kyrgios said of overcoming Darcis. “I was 2-1 down in a tough situation and obviously the crowd was going for him. It was on a tough clay court and I had a lot of doubts, but Lleyton was in my face telling me to believe and things will turn our way.” Kyrgios will face Belgian spearhead David Goffin in Sunday’s reverse singles and the 22-year-old feels in his best shape for months - ready to take Australia to a Davis Cup final for the first time in 14 years. “I haven’t had my greatest couple of months ... but I played pretty well in Cincinnati. This Davis Cup tie has alway been at the back of my mind and I wanted to peak for this week. I did everything right preparing. This has been my priority all year. I didn’t play my best tennis but I served well on the big points and that is the best part of my game.” AAP Rugby Championship 37m Australia 10-13 Argentina Looks like a good match in the Union at least - with the Pumas holding a narrow lead over the Aussies. Follow the live blog here. NRL half-time Parramatta Eels 10-6 North Queensland Cowboys The Eels have added a try since we last checked in - with Will Smith chiming in for one in the 31st minute (without a conversion). Cowboys have had more possession (53%) and 100% completion - but the Eels lead the way in run metres (714-626). Unfortunately I can’t get any individual stats because it looks like the NRL site is down (at least it is for me?) but from what I can tell on my phone Radradra has a huge 144 run metres, while Taumalolo has 84 for the Cowboys. AFL half-time GWS Giants 9.7 (61) v West Coast Eagles 4.2 (26) Mark LeCras has a kick on the half-time siren to a multitude of boos - and it’s a behind only. Heath Shaw lets him know all about it. Meanwhile, Lachie Whitfield leaves the ground looking wobbly indeed - perhaps concussed. Whatever put Whitfield in that state spurs a melee - with (guess who) Steve Johnson in the middle of it. OK I’ll jump back over to the NRL. AFL Q2 01:32 remaining GWS Giants 9.7 (61) v West Coast Eagles 4.1 (25) Can the Eagles get another one back before the half-time siren? Cripps looks to have taken a certain mark but it’s not paid. Unlucky, and a big call. Down the other end, Toby Greene takes a mini-hanger, and lines up for his third. It’s straight through. Having a big influence, Toby. He had three in last year’s Preliminary - so this is his equal-best finals effort already. AFL Q2 04:06 remaining GWS Giants 8.7 (55) v West Coast Eagles 4.1 (25) Sheed straight out of the middle to hit up Josh Kennedy 50m out on an angle. Helps to get a clearance. His long-range bomb misses to the left. Not ideal. AFL Q2 04:49 remaining GWS Giants 8.7 (55) v West Coast Eagles 4.0 (24) Titus O’Reily has aptly reminded me that we have a simultaneous Wallabies live-blog. It’s 3-3 Australia v Argentina as it stands. Sam Mitchell boots a MUCH-needed goal for the Eagles to hopefully breathe some life into this game. AFL Q2 06:25 remaining GWS Giants 8.7 (55) v West Coast Eagles 3.0 (18) Have to say, this final is a fizzer as it stands. Eagles look slow and flat-footed. Johnson has had just the three disposals so far, but a couple of inside 50s, a couple of tackles and a centre clearance. Has had presence. Clearances still well in the Giants’ favour 20-11, as are inside 50s, 25-17 and tackles 39-25. AFL Q2 09:53 remaining GWS Giants 8.7 (55) v West Coast Eagles 3.0 (18) Shiel (12), Whitfield (11), Coniglio (11), Kelly (11) and Ward (10) leading the way for the Giants, while McGovern hits Toby Greene head-high for his chance at a second goal. It starts well right, but squeezes through. Big warning bells for the Eagles now. AFL Q2 14:31 remaining GWS Giants 7.6 (48) v West Coast Eagles 3.0 (18) Clearances 17-8, inside 50s 21-14, contested possessions 44-35, tackles 28-17, hit-outs 19-11. Giants dominating. Where does the Eagles’ resistance come from? Sam Mitchell coaching from the bench. AFL Q2 16:49 remaining GWS Giants 7.6 (48) v West Coast Eagles 3.0 (18) Wilson hits up Himmelberg (with no opponent in sight - think McGovern was wrong-footed) who has a chance to put the Giants in even more space. It’s a horrible looking effort, but it’s through for another. Simpson looks worried, as am I. AFL Q2 17:46 remaining GWS Giants 6.6 (42) v West Coast Eagles 3.0 (18) Back on here at Spotless - just the two behinds so far to the Giants, with a rushed behind from a Toby Greene snap, and a miss from Dylan Shiel. The Giants’ midfielders are on top - with ten disposals to Shiel (three contested possessions, three clearances and four tackles) who leads the way alongside Kelly (ten disposals, four contested possessions, two clearances, three tackles). Matt de Boer kicks a goal for the Giants - in plenty of space after their midfield forces the overlap. This has a dangerous look about it. NRL H1 15:25 Parramatta Eels 6-6 North Queensland Cowboys Scores are level over at ANZ Stadium - with a try to Kyle Feldt in the 11th minute and conversion to Ethan Lowe squaring things up for the Cowboys (after the Eels found touch through Semi Radradra in the 7th - and Moses converted). Not too surprised that the first try of the night went to Radradra. AFL quarter-time GWS Giants 5.4 (34) v West Coast Eagles 3.0 (18) Against all the momentum, the Eagles find a late goal through LeCras, on the run from 50m out. That bucks the trend of three late GWS goals. Not to be outdone, Callan Ward kicks the Giants’ fifth with just ten seconds remaining. Simpson will be fuming. A “Giants” chant goes up around Spotless. I’ll quickly check in on the NRL before coming back to this one. AFL Q1 02:08 remaining GWS Giants 4.3 (27) v West Coast Eagles 2.0 (12) Shiel to Kelly to Ward - their big names are dominating through the middle, and Scully finds himself on the end of it again inside forward 50. He might not quite command the same fear as Dangerfield - but I see shadows of Danger last night in his presence in the forward line tonight. Taranto snaps a goal to propel the Giants further in front. Sheppard leaves the field after a heavy clash of heads. AFL Q1 04:32 remaining GWS Giants 3.3 (21) v West Coast Eagles 2.0 (12) Giants finding dangerous amounts of space in the middle, and Scully causing havoc for the Eagles in the middle and forward. After the last assist he chimes in for his own goal. Giants getting on top in clearances 9-5, contested possessions 27-19 and tackles 18-9. AFL Q1 05:44 remaining GWS Giants 2.3 (15) v West Coast Eagles 2.0 (12) Beautiful intercept mark by Jeremy McGovern - he has had three for the game already. Toby Greene snaps a bouncing goal after taking the assist from Scully in an open forward line. Shiel has rocketed up to six disposals for the Giants - while Kelly also has six. AFL Q1 07:51 remaining GWS Giants 1.3 (9) v West Coast Eagles 2.0 (12) Free kick to Josh Kennedy just outside the goal square - on replay Corr tugs the jumper - it was there. He kicks truly. Giants - and coach Cameron - ruing early misses. AFL Q1 09:36 remaining GWS Giants 1.3 (9) v West Coast Eagles 1.0 (6) Late-inclusion Wellingham has had plenty of the ball (four disposals) - and fires the ball in long to Vardy who takes a near-uncontested mark 10m out, directly in front. What a season he’s had since crossing over from the Cats. He opens the Eagles’ tally with a goal. AFL Q1 10:56 remaining GWS Giants 1.3 (9) v West Coast Eagles 0.0 (0) Stats not diabolical yet for the Eagles - but the Giants look harder at it, with 18-12 contested possessions and 15-3 tackles. Down-field free to the Giants gifts Patton another shot at goal from almost the same distance and angle. He misses in almost identical fashion. AFL Q1 12:12 remaining GWS Giants 1.2 (8) v West Coast Eagles 0.0 (0) Great run down from Scully on Priddis who looked set to send the Eagles inside 50 - and the Giants are off and running. Coniglio hits up Patton on his chest. He misses one he should’ve kicked - it’s across the face. AFL Q1 13:31 remaining GWS Giants 1.1 (7) v West Coast Eagles 0.0 (0) Ward wins the clearance just outside 50 to set up Greene on a sharp angle 45m out. Greene angrily removes some Gatorade obstacles in typical villain-mode. He misses to the left. Shiel makes no such mistake, after a turnover from the kick-in, and the first goal goes to the home side. AFL Q1 15:27 remaining GWS Giants 0.0 (0) v West Coast Eagles 0.0 (0) Himmelberg on McGovern as expected - which hasn’t stopped him from already taking a big, contested grab. Barrass, Hurn and McGovern look formidable down back. Intensity is as you’d expect for a final - plenty of fumbles and turnovers. First real chance at a score goes to Mitchell - who hits the post for an out of bounds on the full. AFL Q1 18:55 remaining GWS Giants 0.0 (0) v West Coast Eagles 0.0 (0) Mitchell out of the midfield - wonder how many times I’ll say that tonight. Still, it’s turned over and goes forward to Patton who turns it over into the man on the mark. Nervous start. Giants get the first inside 50 - and Heath Shaw has already started a fracas. AFL GWS Giants v West Coast Eagles National anthem over - not sure there’s a crankier resting face than Toby Greene’s. Hurn wins the toss. Just about ready to go here. AFL GWS Giants v West Coast Eagles Both teams out on the ground now - and it looks to be a fairly disappointing crowd at Spotless Stadium. I’m sure it’ll be a talking point throughout the week - some fans on Twitter pointing out that the Matildas drew a larger crowd in Penrith today. AFL GWS Giants v West Coast Eagles No late changes for this one. That means the only changes are as named: Eagles IN: Wellingham OUT: Partington Giants IN: Johnson, Taranto OUT: Cameron, Mumford Can’t help but think they’re huge outs for the Giants. Johnson will bring some poise, finals experience and class, but Taranto is just a kid. Racing Just while we’re wating for this game to start - Winx today won an incredible 20th consecutive victory when she came fast and late to win the George Main Stakes at Randwick. This from Wires: “Chris Waller’s exceptional thoroughbred had lots of ground to make up in the one-mile Group One, but she flew at the death to defeat Happy Clapper by a length and a quarter. Winx is now likely to have one more run before she tries to win the Cox Plate at Moonee Valley on October 28 for a third consecutive year. Waller said: “True champions normally come out and win. We should respect Happy Clapper because he is a very good horse in his own right and we had to fight to get past him. I’d say she’ll have one more run up here if we can and at some stage she’ll head to Melbourne but we’ll lock it in over the next week. The first Cox Plate she won it off three runs, next Cox Plate she won it off four and she will probably run in it off a fifth run this time.” Jockey Hugh Bowman said: “I expected to be closer to the speed but the pace was strong. At the top of the straight she had a lot of ground to make up but after her last two performances I knew she could do it. I am just so proud of her.” Associated Press The Matildas Speaking of the Matildas, I loved Paul Connolly’s article today about the historical trajectory of women’s football in Australia. (And when I say I ‘loved’ it, I should really say it enraged me. Thank god we are at the point where we’re finally righting some of the wrongs that have been done to women’s sport over time!) NRL Parramatta Eels v North Queensland Cowboys Of course I haven’t forgotten that there’s also a do-or-die NRL final on tonight - with the Parramatta Eels taking on the North Queensland Cowboys at ANZ Stadium (starting 7:40pm AEST). Unfortunately since these games are on at the same time, however, I’ll only be able to update you on progress during breaks from the AFL. Reckon this will likewise be a close one, with the Cowboys - like the Eagles - with nothing to lose after their underdog victory over reigning premiers Cronulla last week in extra-time, highlighted by an incredible Jason Taumalolo try (did he/they just want it more than the Sharks?) The man I love to watch averages over 200 run metres a week and seems to get better with each season (despite already being the reigning Dally M winner). The Eels, however, are in some form, after almost producing the upset of week one, leading at half-time against the Storm and producing some uncharacteristically panicked play from the competition favourites (who had to produce some miraculous, if unconventional, tries to win). Apart from the Storm loss, this team has nine wins from their last ten games, and they’ll back themselves in against a Cowboys side pushed all the way to extra-time and with a day’s less recovery. These sides have a very even historical record - with the Eels having won 18 to the Cowboys 17 (with one draw) over 36 encounters. They’ve only ever played once in finals, and in good news for the Cowboys, that was a boilover of epic proportions (29-0). That was all the way back in 2005, but in what could be similar fashion, knocked the more fancied Eels from the finals series. Still, the Eels will take heart from the fact that over the last couple of years, no team that finished top-four has lost in straight sets (the last to do so was Manly in 2014). I think I said I’d never tip a game here again, but I’ll back the Eels here - with a hell of a scare from the brave Cowboys. Welcome Hello everyone and welcome to this Saturday evening edition of Sportwatch. I’m Kate O’Halloran and I’ll be here to guide you through tonight’s AFL finals action (with some NRL updates). As you may have seen from Mike’s opening post, it has been a big day in sport already, with the Matildas winning their international friendly against Brazil 2-1. Surely the highlight was seeing a women’s international football game sell-out - to 17,000 adoring (and many new) Matildas fans. The game was a cracker too, and had me glued to my seat while I should have been working (what about that De Vanna volley, eh?) It capped off a wonderful week for Australia’s footballers, who - under a new collective bargaining agreement- will see their average W-League salaries doubled (to a still not-so-grand total of $15,500 a year). Love this David Squires take on the deal. Hooray progress! Alright, better not get sidetracked with women’s sport! Onto the real stuff! (Anyone who knows me - including hopefully my readers - will know this is a joke!) So. Onto tonight’s semi-final between the Greater Western Sydney Giants and the West Coast Eagles, who will tough it out for the final spot in Preliminary final week. We already have one match-up decided - with the Cats last night winning through to a daunting match-up with the minor premiers, Adelaide, next Friday night. Tonight’s winner will have no less a daunting task: a win will see them take on the rampaging Tigers (and an increasingly bustling bandwagon of supporters). This one could be close, with the Eagles (written off for the season before the finals even started) the real surprise packet of the series to date. They were outplayed for large segments of last week’s match against Port (including in extra time), but persisted for one of the more memorable finals victories in recent times. Combine that with their last-gasp, unexpected victory over minor premiers Adelaide to sneak into the finals, and they’re on something of a confidence-boosting roll. They again have the added incentive of sending off veterans Matt Priddis, Drew Petrie and Sam Mitchell in style and seem to be relishing their underdog status. Then there’s the impending return of Nic Naitanui, and suddenly the Eagles look a team to be reckoned with indeed. Still, they’ll have their work cut out for them against an albeit-underperforming and injury-affected GWS. The Giants were dealt a big blow in the lead-up to this game, with the loss of barometer ruckman Shane Mumford, who is out with a foot problem. This could swing clearances the way of the Eagles - who thrived on the dual versatility of Nathan Vardy and Drew Petrie against the Power last week, clearly taking the honours against All-Australian Paddy Ryder. The Giants have also lost their leading goalkicker in Jeremy Cameron - who is out for the season with a hamstring. This considerably changes the complexion of their forward line, and they will be hoping for a finals miracle from recalled mercurial forward Steve Johnson. I’m backing Jon Patton to step up in Cameron’s abscence; he’s a fiery, fierce competitor who hates to lose, and is one of the many Giants still reeling from last year’s heartbreaking Prelim final loss. I’ll also look for Josh Kelly to fire in lieu of a tag: when Adam Simpson sent tagger Mark Hutchings to Dylan Shiel in round 22, Kelly amassed 43 disposals, eight clearances and a goal. Will be interesting to see whether Hutchings goes to Kelly this time around, or sticks to Shiel. As far as match-ups go, I’m also fascinated to see what the Giants do about Jeremy McGovern. Will they send Harry Himmelberg to him as a defensive forward, as they did with Jake Lever last week? They’ll need to do something, as McGovern’s intercept marking game turned the match against Port last week. History is against the Eagles this week: under the final eight system, the eighth-placed team has only won consecutive finals once (North Melbourne in 2015). They also lost both outings against the Giants this year - in Round 22 at Spotless Stadium (by 21 points) and Round Ten at Domain Stadium (by nine points). Still, I reckon they’ll play with nothing to lose, while the Giants will have the weight of expectation bearing down on them. A straight-set finals loss for the Giants this year would be a disaster, and cement their ‘under-performing’ tag. Will be a fascinating one. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, catch up on how the Matildas fared against Brazil in their friendly earlier today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/17/living-standards-are-going-up-but-are-lower-than-six-years-ago-hardly-a-winning-argument","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T22:53:44Z","webTitle":"Living standards are going up but are lower than six years ago – hardly a winning argument | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/living-standards-are-going-up-but-are-lower-than-six-years-ago-hardly-a-winning-argument","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/17/living-standards-are-going-up-but-are-lower-than-six-years-ago-hardly-a-winning-argument","fields":{"headline":"Living standards are going up but are lower than six years ago – hardly a winning argument","bodyText":"Often politics will involve asserting things that feel right even though the evidence doesn’t support it. Such was the case this week with the Labor party’s assertion about rising energy prices. But we also had the situation of the treasurer arguing that living standards had improved, which not only didn’t feel right but also was questionable when his evidence was held up to the light. The ALP’s focus this week was on energy prices and saw Bill Shorten and Mark Butler ask a variety of questions attempting to assert that power prices have gone up. Shorten for example asked, could “the prime minister confirm that the average Sydney household is paying almost $1,000 more in power bills since this federal Liberal government was elected to office?” The claim that power prices have gone up by $1,000 is a big one and the ALP didn’t really back it up. Because the data doesn’t support it. The most recent inflation figures show that since September 2013 electricity prices in Sydney have actually fallen 2.1%. That’s because the carbon price ended in July 2014 and prices did fall once power companies could pump carbon emissions into the atmosphere for free. That last aspect really is the crux of the issue. But rather than debate the impact of carbon emissions, our energy debate as ever is stuck on the issue of price. Because providing carbon emissions had zero cost, the quarter after the carbon price ended, electricity prices in Sydney on average fell 7.3%. But because prices of things do inevitably go up, they have risen since then – and very much so in the past year. In the 12 months to June this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics calculated that Sydney electricity prices rose 10%. That is a sizeable jump – but it is still a long way from seeing energy prices going up $1,000. The ALP knows that while prices might have fallen two years ago, they are rising now, and that will take precedence in people’s minds – not only because it is more recent, but because the recent rises reinforces the pre-held belief that power prices always go up. And it should be stated that is not an incorrect assumption. In the past decade electricity prices in Sydney have risen 116% compared with the overall rate of inflation in Sydney during that time of just 27%. Arguing that electricity prices are going up is always going to be an easy sell, and while the government is right that prices have fallen, it is only that case if they use a time frame that suits their narrative – ie since the 2013 election rather than the past year. Such cherrypicking of time frames was also done by the treasurer in a response to an assertion made by Shorten in parliament that despite promising economic leadership Malcolm Turnbull had delivered (among other things ) “declining living standards”. The treasurer tweeted on Thursday that this was “false” and the “National Accts show they’re up 3.8%” The figure Morrison is using to justify this claim is “real net national disposable income per capita” – a measure Chris Bowen has also used in the past to talk about living standards. A while it is correct that since September 2015 the measure has grown 3.8%, and the treasurer might feel on strong footing given the opposition has also used this data, the use of it does provide some less than happy storytelling. For example, using that measure you could argue that living standards fell 1.4% in the June quarter alone – the biggest quarterly fall in two years, and the second biggest fall since the GFC. Not exactly a solid narrative. The treasurer would also need to admit that on this measure living standards remain lower now than they were in 2011. The ABS estimates that in June this year real net national disposable income per capita was $13,942 – lower than the $13,971 measured six years ago in June 2011. That living standards are going up but they are lower than they were six years ago – and also a mere 0.8% better than they were when the Liberal party took office – is a hardly a winning argument. And this is even more the case given it doesn’t fit with other data or people’s perceptions that living standards have actually fallen in recent times. Certainly over the past four years real wages have been flat – since March 2013 the Reserve Bank’s underlying measure of inflation has risen 9.4%, while in that time private sector wages have risen just 9.3%. Similarly figures out just this week showed that both median and average household incomes fell from 2013-14 to 2015-16. One reason for the discrepancy between these figures and Morrison’s assertions is that the measure he has used is a measure of national income, not household income. And national income gets a big boost when the price of our exports rises. As the ABS noted back in 2013 this caused national income to rise much faster the GDP during the mining boom. And once again fast rising export prices has been a big driver of national income. Since September 2015 the terms of trade have risen 18% in trend terms – a growth level similar to that experienced in 2005-06. But the difference was that back then it fuelled an employment boom that saw wages grow strongly. This time round the boom has seen a massive jump in company profits while wages growth has shuddered along at record lows. Profits however add to national income and thus makes the measure of real net national disposable income look rather good. But the national accounts also measure household income, and there the picture is rather less cheery. In nominal terms, since Turnbull took over the prime ministership, household disposable income has grown by less than half that of national disposable income, and on a real per capita basis it has if anything gone backwards and is mostly flat since 2011. While the ALP’s argument struggles when held up against the data and time frames but gels with people’s perceptions, Morrison’s claims not only falter against other data and other time frames, they also jar with people’s perceptions. People are often slow to acknowledge improvements in their standard of living, and to that extent treasurers often have a hard time selling a positive picture. Generally they need strong employment growth and wages growth. This week showed that employment continues to grow well, but until wages follows suit, the treasurer is going to have a hard time convincing anyone that their standard of living has improved – whatever measure or time frame he chooses to use."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/15/duck-and-cover-in-japan-north-korea-missile-alerts-becoming-fact-of-life","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:26:13Z","webTitle":"'Duck and cover': in Japan, North Korean missile alerts are becoming a fact of life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/15/duck-and-cover-in-japan-north-korea-missile-alerts-becoming-fact-of-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/15/duck-and-cover-in-japan-north-korea-missile-alerts-becoming-fact-of-life","fields":{"headline":"'Duck and cover': in Japan, North Korean missile alerts are becoming a fact of life","bodyText":"For the second time in just over a fortnight, millions of people in northern Japan were jolted awake by an alert warning them a North Korean missile was heading in their direction. “Missile launch! Missile launch!” read the first of two messages, as the wail of sirens pierced the early-morning calm in a dozen prefectures, including the northern island of Hokkaido. “A missile appears to have been launched from North Korea. Take cover in a building or underground,” the message added. The missile, thought to be an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, was of the same type that triggered Japan’s first J-alert warning at the end of last month – a chilling reminder to North Korea’s neighbour that it is within easy striking distance of its missiles. As the US and countries in the region persists with sanctions and continue to rule out dialogue – a hardline stance mirrored by Kim Jong-un’s regime – residents were concerned that ballistic fly-pasts and calls to “duck and cover” could become an uncomfortable fact of life. Seven minutes later, a second text confirmed the missile had passed over Japanese territory without incident before splashing into the Pacific ocean 2,000km to the east. “Missile passed. Missile passed,” it said. “It seems that the missile has passed Hokkaido area and landed in the Pacific Ocean. If you find anything suspicious, please don’t go close to it. Report it to the police and firefighters.” Friday’s missile was the fourth to have passed over Japanese territory. The first was in 1998 and the second in 2009, although Pyongyang claims they were rockets carrying satellites into orbit. Multiple missile tests in recent months have sparked concern – although not panic – in Japan and ushered in a flurry of civil defence activity not witnessed since the end of the war. About a dozen towns have conducted evacuation drills since North Korean missiles landed in the sea inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone in March, and sales of nuclear shelters have soared, although the overall number is still low. “I cannot say that we are used to this. I mean, the missile flew right above our town. It’s not a very comforting thing to hear,” said Yoshihiro Saito, who works in the small Hokkaido fishing town of Erimo. “It’s pretty scary.” Like the 29 August launch, text alerts implored residents to seek shelter underground or in sturdy buildings. North Korea’s proximity means that Japanese authorities realistically have less than 10 minutes to confirm a missile launch and issue the alerts. After receiving his second warning in a little over two weeks, Yoichi Takahashi questioned the government’s advice. “It’s really scary. The government tells us to flee to stable buildings but we can’t do that quickly,” said the 57-year old fisheries official in the Hokkaido town of Kushiro. “Our colleagues offshore can never take cover. It has now happened twice to us ... we’re going to have restless days from now on.” Japan’s response to the missile launches has prompted criticism that the government is exploiting public anxiety as it seeks to expand its missile defence systems and, perhaps, consider giving its self-defence forces the capability to carry out pre-emptive strikes against North Korean targets. Its conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, routinely describes the launches as a “grave” threat to Japan, assuring the country’s citizens their government is doing all it can to guarantee their safety. On Friday, as at the end of last month, there were no reports of damage to aircraft or shipping in the area, or of missile debris falling onto land from a height of well over 500km. North Korea’s displays of nuclear brinkmanship have become a regular interruption in Japanese daytime TV schedules in recent weeks. On Friday, the national broadcaster NHK cut away from regular programming to cover the aftermath of its launch. Commuters making their way to work in Sapporo, the biggest city on Hokkaido, were handed special newspaper editions announcing the test. Bullet trains operating in the region, as well as some subway services, were suspended. Matthew Galat, a US citizens staying near Lake Toya in Hokkaido, said he had been woken up by “a really loud noise on my phone”. “This loud speaker is playing all throughout the city,” Galat said in a Facebook video recorded while the sirens were still sounding. The vlogger, who is cycling around the world, said the alert, which he translated into English on his smartphone, told him to find shelter in a basement because North Korea had just launched a missile. “Crazy … stupid,” he said. The alert also disrupted play at an international golf tournament in Sapporo. Matt Griffin, an Australian golfer, said he was in his hotel room when he received the text alerts. “It was a bit of a shock, and I thought ‘Not again’,” Griffin told the Guardian. Players who had already teed off at Sapporo golf club were instructed to leave the course and stay in the clubhouse. Play resumed after 40 minutes, said Griffin, who was due to start his second round in the ANA Open on Friday afternoon. “It’s been a topic of conversation among the players in my group,” he added. “Everyone hopes that this is just for show and then the North Koreans will come to their senses. If it’s a one-off then you tend not to be too concerned, but if it keeps happening, that’s when you start to worry.” While the immediate threat has passed, Hokkaido residents worried that the launches could have a knock-on effect on visitor numbers and other local industries. Hironori Matsura, an official in Erimo, said: “We are afraid that this may have an impact on our life, ranging from fishing to tourism.” As life began to return to normal, for a while there was only one topic of conversation in the town. The predictable focus, according to Saito: “How scary it is.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/15/qantas-boss-alan-joyce-pay-packet-nearly-doubles-in-year-to-25m","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:30:08Z","webTitle":"Qantas boss Alan Joyce's pay packet nearly doubles in year to $25m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/qantas-boss-alan-joyce-pay-packet-nearly-doubles-in-year-to-25m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/15/qantas-boss-alan-joyce-pay-packet-nearly-doubles-in-year-to-25m","fields":{"headline":"Qantas boss Alan Joyce's pay packet nearly doubles in year to $25m","bodyText":"Qantas boss Alan Joyce has flown close to the top of the Australian executive pay league after nearly doubling his remuneration in the past financial year. Joyce earned a total pay package of $24.6m in the 2016-17 year, the company’s annual report showed on Friday, nearly twice as much as the $12.96m he pocketed in the previous 12 months. Joyce’s huge pay bump reflected a big rise in the company’s share price in the past financial year, the report said, which drove a big increase in the value of his performance-based incentives to $18.5m from $3.16m. His base pay was frozen at $2.1m, while his cash bonus was less than the previous year’s at almost $1.8m, thanks to slightly lower company profits. The balance of the package included nearly $2m in short-term incentives. Leigh Clifford, the company’s chairman, defended the pay award which he said was based on the airline’s “remarkable” turnaround from a $2.8bn loss in 2014 to record profits. “There is no question that these pay outcomes are high,” Clifford said in a statement. “That’s because they reflect the company’s exceptional performance, including our top ranking for total shareholder return among global airline peers and every company on the ASX100.” Clifford said the share price had more than quadrupled in the past three years and the value of executive bonuses, which are mostly paid in Qantas shares, had risen accordingly. Shares that were worth $1.26 when they were awarded in 2014 as part of a three-year-long term incentive plan are now being paid out at $5.72. Three years ago Qantas made a loss of $2.84bn thanks to a bruising battle with Virgin and oil prices well over $100 a barrel. But painful restructuring involving thousands of redundancies and a halving of the price of fuel has seen the carrier transformed, recording its second-highest profit ever in the 2016-17 year. Joyce, who will now vie with the Lowy brothers at Westfield and Macquarie boss Nicholas Moore to be the highest paid executive in a public company, said the restructuring had “certainly paid off”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/sep/15/lachlan-murdoch-and-bruce-gordon-make-new-bid-for-ten-network","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T04:32:27Z","webTitle":"Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon make new bid for Ten Network","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/15/lachlan-murdoch-and-bruce-gordon-make-new-bid-for-ten-network","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/sep/15/lachlan-murdoch-and-bruce-gordon-make-new-bid-for-ten-network","fields":{"headline":"Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon make new bid for Ten Network","bodyText":"Billionaires Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon have submitted a late bid for the Ten network, just hours after the cross media laws were passed by parliament on Thursday night opening the way for them to own a TV network. Receivers KordaMentha will consider the offer from Murdoch and Gordon’s investment vehicles Illyria and Birketu over the weekend, a spokesman told Guardian Australia on Friday. KordaMentha will examine the legality of such a late bid because it has missed the formal deadline of 25 August, he said. The audacious bid comes at the end of a week which saw the Murdoch and Gordon camp take to court to delay a scheduled creditors’ meeting on Monday. The Tuesday meeting would have seen creditors, including Ten staff and program suppliers, asked to accept the offer for Australia’s third-rated commercial television network from CBS. The spokesman said KordaMentha would wait for the New South Wales supreme court’s decision on Monday before making a public announcement. The 11th hour move by the Murdoch camp puts the future the successful CBS bid in doubt, despite an agreement by the $28bn US media and entertainment giant CBS to buy the network last month. The CBS offer was accepted by the administrators, KordaMentha, over the offer by Birketu/Illyria. The new bid is reportedly higher than the CBS bid, according to the Australian Financial Review. Receivers PPB Advisory were appointed by the Commonwealth Bank in June over a $200m debt falling due in December, and no longer guaranteed by shareholders Murdoch and Gordon. It is understood employees of Ten do not favour a Birketu/Illyria bid over a CBS one, especially since a takeover by the Australian billionaires would likely mean massive job losses at Ten. In KordaMentha’s second report, released to creditors last week, it recommended an offer from US broadcaster CBS, which is the largest creditor, over one from Birketu/Illyria. In the report, the Birketu/Illyria or B&amp;I reveal they plan to get out of the leases for the Channel Ten studios in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, meaning the home of Ten’s television and news studios would be shut down. The Pyrmont studios in inner city Sydney is the home of Ten news, and The Project is produced out of the Melbourne studios of Ten. There is widespread speculation that the new owners would use the resources of Sky News to produce Channel Ten’s news if the bid was successful. Sources said Sky is keen to get a hold of a free-to-air network. “B&amp;I Transaction document made provision for the repudiation of the leases relating to Pyrmont, Melbourne and Adelaide,” the KordaMentha report said. “Operationally seen as moderate to high risk.” Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the report revealed that Murdoch and Gordon plan to close Ten studios in Adelaide and Melbourne, “a move which would ultimately result in less diversity in the media in a city like Adelaide that needs more”. “CBS have already committed to no job losses if their bid to takeover Channel 10 is accepted, and this bid must be allowed to go ahead,” Hanson-Young said. “If the government was serious about media diversity, it would back journalism jobs, not newsroom closures.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/15/turnbull-defends-church-that-refused-to-marry-couple-backing-same-sex-marriage","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T02:59:24Z","webTitle":"Turnbull defends church that refused to marry couple backing same-sex marriage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/15/turnbull-defends-church-that-refused-to-marry-couple-backing-same-sex-marriage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/15/turnbull-defends-church-that-refused-to-marry-couple-backing-same-sex-marriage","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull defends church that refused to marry couple backing same-sex marriage","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has defended a Victorian church that cancelled the wedding of a local couple after they posted their support for same-sex marriage on Facebook. The couple in their 20s – who have not been named – were to be married at the Presbyterian church of Ebenezer St John’s in Ballarat, Fairfax media reported on Friday. Days after Turnbull announced the postal survey in August, the young woman posted her support for marriage equality. She and her fiance were then told by the minister, Steven North, he would no longer marry them or allow the ceremony to be held in the church. “After the premarital counselling that you attended and the sermons delivered at Ebenezer on this subject, you must surely appreciate that your commitment to same-sex marriage opposes the teaching of Christ Jesus and the scriptural position practiced by the Presbyterian church of Australia and by me,” he reportedly wrote in a letter to them. “By continuing to officiate it would appear either that I support your views on same-sex marriage or that I am uncaring about this matter. As you know, neither statement is correct. “Also, if the wedding proceeded in the Ebenezer St John’s church buildings, the same inferences could be drawn about the Presbyterian denomination. Such inferences would be wrong.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he thought “we would have moved beyond that sort of prejudice”, but the prime minister defended the minister’s actions. “Churches are entitled to marry or not marry whom they please,” he said. “That is part of religious freedom. My own church, the Catholic church, will not marry someone who has married before.” According to Fairfax, the couple, who had attended the church for 10 years, told North his decision was “disgraceful”. “You were made aware from the beginning of our proceedings that we had gay friends and also that people in our wedding party were gay. How could you assume that we would abandon them or degrade them with regards to same-sex marriage?” North and Ebenezer St John’s could not be reached for comment. Those arguing for a no vote have frequently pointed to religious freedom as an argument against marriage equality, but most calls for “conscientious objection” have been to allow refusal of service to same-sex couples, not to any couple who supports marriage equality. The moderator general of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, John Wilson, declined an interview but said in a statement it was a local church matter. “Within the Presbyterian church of Australia, the question of accepting requests to officiate at weddings is a discretionary matter for ministers of congregations, and not something that is directed from higher places or central offices of the church,” he said. “The minister engages with the people concerned, counsels them, builds relationships with them, and then taking all this into consideration decides to accept or not.” Wilson did not respond to follow-up questions. The Presbyterian church has urged its congregation to oppose changing the Marriage Act. It recently requested its followers “without binding consequence” to consider voting no in the postal survey, and to try to persuade their family and friends to do the same. “There’s no doubt that the postal vote can be won in favour of the current definition,” Wilson wrote. “There is a large number of Australians, many of whom have not had their say, who affirm the common view of marriage as God-given and God-blessed. “Your participation will make a difference, but we need you to be earnest, active and in prayer about it. There are many powerful voices clamouring to tear down what God declares to be holy. The church must not be silent on this. While we speak up and have our say, we do so with a gracious engagement and with respect for those with whom we disagree.” In 2015, SBS reported the NSW branch of the church had voted to push the federal body to withdraw from the Marriage Act should it be amended to include same-sex couples. The motion, made at the church’s annual meeting, was passed 140 votes to 62, SBS reported. A subsequent statement by the New South Wales assembly moderator, Kevin Murray, said the decision was based on a report which argued legalising same-sex marriage “would corrupt a good gift of God into a wrong”. “That would mean that ministers would then be acting for the government in a system which did not reflect the biblical view of marriage,” Murray said. “In this case the positive reason for our cooperation with the Marriage Act would have been removed, and we would be better to avoid association with evil by no longer acting as celebrants.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/15/how-do-we-survive-paranoid-californians-prepare-for-nuclear-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T13:17:12Z","webTitle":"'How do we survive?': fearful Californians prepare for nuclear attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/how-do-we-survive-paranoid-californians-prepare-for-nuclear-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/how-do-we-survive-paranoid-californians-prepare-for-nuclear-attack","fields":{"headline":"'How do we survive?': fearful Californians prepare for nuclear attack","bodyText":"Hal Kempfer, a noted international security expert, is getting a roomful of California public health officials and emergency responders to think about the unthinkable – a nuclear bomb exploding at the port of Long Beach, about four miles away. His message – coming on the same day North Korea threatened to reduce the mainland United States to “ashes and darkness” and then launched a ballistic missile over Japan – is unvarnished and uncompromising: get ready, because we all need to prepare for what comes after. “A lot of people will be killed,” he said, “but a large percentage of the population will survive. They will be at risk and they will need help.” Most likely, Kempfer tells his audience, if the device is fired from North Korea or smuggled in by North Korean agents, it wouldn’t be the sort of high-yield weapon that planners worried about during the cold war, with the potential to wipe out most life and civilization across the Los Angeles region and send radioactive materials halfway across the American continent. Rather, it’s likely to be a Hiroshima-sized bomb – large enough to obliterate everything within a square-mile radius and kill tens of thousands of people, either immediately or through the lingering effects of radiation. But still leaving millions of survivors across the region who would need help. “We’re talking about smaller North Korean things,” Kempfer emphasized, though the word “smaller” sounds very far from reassuring. “This is not your traditional nuclear apocalypse scenario.” Kempfer, a retired marines lieutenant colonel, is a charismatic speaker, with a keen understanding of the need for humor to leaven the grimness of the subject matter. And so he talked through what would and would not be left standing after an attack on the port – which, together with its neighbor in San Pedro, is by far the busiest maritime trading hub in the United States and a key component of the global trading system. He talks about the port and downtown Long Beach being “toast” – no exaggeration, since the blast wave is likely to vaporize everything in its immediate path. But the city health department, the Long Beach airport and fire department might not be; they are all somewhat protected by a hilly area that is likely to halt the initial blast wave. And so the city can, tentatively, think about setting up a center of emergency operations. Of course, the radioactive fallout created as the explosion gathers up tremendous quantities of dust and ocean water and spits them into the atmosphere would represent a secondary grave risk, especially in the first hours after an attack. Not to mention the electromagnetic pulse that is likely to knock out electronic systems including phones and computers, the pile-ups expected on the freeways as drivers are blinded by the flash of the explosion, the rush for food, water and gasoline as millions of Angelenos attempt to drive out of the region, and the terror triggered by even the idea of a second, follow-up attack. Kempfer and his colleague, fellow marine veteran Matt Begert, sugarcoat little or none of this. They talk about North Korea’s advances in testing intercontinental ballistic missiles – the reason Long Beach’s head of public health emergency management invited them in the first place – about the likelihood that Long Beach is high on North Korea’s target list, and about the likely movements of a deadly radiation plume according to wind, terrain, and urban landscape. “How do we survive?” a public health worker asks despairingly from the middle of the room in the heat of the presentation. “If you’re not blown up,” Kempfer retorts, without missing a beat, “that helps.” He and Begert then talk through a risk assessment matrix, based on history (more applicable to natural disasters), vulnerability, how bad an event could potentially be, and the probability of it occurring. It’s a method Kempfer uses to get local communities to focus on what matters most, not what happens to have been in the news that day or that month. In Long Beach’s case, preparing for an earthquake is still a higher priority, but the nuclear threat is not too far behind. “If you want to mess up southern California, if you want to mess up the west coast, if you want to mess up our country – where do you attack?” Kempfer asks. “If I’m sitting in North Korea and looking at possible targets, I’m going to be looking at Long Beach very closely.” Kempfer and his group, Knowledge and Intelligence Program Professionals, are not the first to think through the consequences of a nuclear attack on Long Beach. In 2006, when the worry was more al-Qaida than North Korea, the Rand corporation published a report assessing the impact of a 10-kiloton bomb smuggled into the port in a shipping container. Rand’s scenario envisaged a significant breakdown in social order, including gunfights over food and gasoline and shootouts on the freeway as desperate families stuck in traffic look for any possible way to hasten their route over the mountains. Rand also imagined the health system collapsing as hospitals and health workers became overwhelmed with hundreds of thousands of people needing decontamination and other treatment. Kempfer thought a well-coordinated response from the federal government – analogous to the improved performance in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, compared with the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 – could play a crucial role in holding together the social fabric and making sure crucial supplies did not run so low as to start rioting. Still, neighboring counties – particularly Ventura County, to the north-west of Los Angeles – are themselves deeply concerned about being overwhelmed by millions of evacuees. Ventura, unusually, has prepared a 250-page plan in the event of nuclear attack, which it updates regularly, along with a public information campaign featuring an oddly jaunty musical entreaty to residents to stay indoors until the worst of the radioactive fallout has subsided. News out of North Korea has created a mini-bonanza for local manufacturers of nuclear fallout shelters. But more important to the vast bulk of the population, Kempfer says, is having some rudimentary knowledge of what it means to “shelter in place” and, for example, to have plastic sheeting on hand to cover up windows and cracks in the doors to minimize the effects of radioactive fallout. Sandy Wedgeworth, the public health emergency management coordinator, said she and her staff felt energized, not depressed, by what they learned from Kempfer and that the session generated a long to-do list. “We need to look at our county plan and become familiar with it,” she said, “but we also need to think about mutual aid systems and getting resources from elsewhere. Obviously, we don’t have everything we need. The point is knowing where to get more stuff.” She and her colleagues appeared to concur with Dwight Eisenhower’s old adage, quoted approvingly by Kempfer, that while plans in warfare can be useless, planning is indispensable. “The more education I get,” Wedgeworth said, “the more I understand and the more competent I feel to respond. It’s less scary when you understand the threat and know what to do to meet and mitigate it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/15/universal-healthcare-us-possible-bernie-sanders-kamala-harris","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T14:03:10Z","webTitle":"Universal healthcare in the US is possible.

We already have proof","bodyText":"Speaking to opponents of universal healthcare in the US today is much like speaking to a moon-landing denier or any other conspiracy theorist – they insist on arguing impossibility in the face of proven reality. As Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and 15 other senators release details of their universal healthcare bill – one that guarantees access to healthcare for all Americans while simultaneously creating cost savings – there will be many healthcare conspiracists claiming that such a plan is infeasible. So as we consider these arguments in the coming weeks, we must always be prepared to make sure they pass the “look!” test. That is, when someone argues that something cannot be done, we needn’t argue. Rather, we simply need to point and say: “Look!” Someone doesn’t believe we landed on the moon? “But look! There’s an American flag up there!” Someone doesn’t believe we can insure every single American while simultaneously reining in the exorbitant costs of our healthcare system? “But look! Every other developed country in the world is already doing it!” These medical conspiracists claim that such a system would be impractical, overly expensive, or provide inferior care. But to make these claims in the face of obvious proof is laughable. If Canada is able to provide coverage for each of its citizens from birth to death, with no out-of-pocket-costs to any of them, all the while providing high-quality care with excellent patient outcomes at half the cost of our system, it is unacceptable to say that we somehow cannot. Real people living in other countries are currently enjoying these systems. They can change jobs without fear of losing access to their diabetes medications. They can go jogging without worry that one slip and broken bone would send their families into bankruptcy. They can go to their doctor never questioning that, at the end of the day, she has any incentive to do anything but make them better. So how could one be so bold as to deny this reality? The truth is that nobody is content with our current healthcare system. We do poorly when it comes to access to care and equity, administrative efficiency and cost containment, as well as basic health outcomes. We pay more than double what other countries do, and get worse results. Our life expectancies are shorter than any other developed nation. Children die in the US unlike in any other modern society. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US. Our overspending in healthcare directly limits what we can do with defence, education and infrastructure. Yet when it comes to talk of change, people become skittish. Doctors become scared that change would mean lower incomes. Patients fear longer wait times and loss of access to services. The fear of losing the small benefits we currently enjoy is prohibiting us from enjoying far greater ones at half the cost. It’s as if we’re so scared of losing our crumbs that we are ignoring the entire loaf sitting within reach. We need to learn to trust our eyes and ears and be suspicious of the naysayers fearmongering us away from something better. We can, and should, argue about the precise form our system will take – the US’s universal healthcare system will almost certainly have a different flavour than, say, France’s – but we can no longer accept that such a system is impossible. Importantly, we should never forget the stakes. Real Americans are going through real pain every day. I have seen a patient come to my emergency room stating: “They diagnosed me with cancer but said they couldn’t see me because I have no insurance. I have nowhere to go.” I have seen a patient having a florid heart attack walk out against medical advice stating, “Thanks doc, but my brother went through this and lost his house. I’m gonna go.” And I have heard many well-insured patients say “I hear you and you seem nice, but all you doctors want to do is make money off me, so I don’t know who to trust.” To experience all this while knowing that something better is already out there is simply unacceptable. Those who deny the plausibility of a universal healthcare system are inevitably the same people who stand to benefit most from our current system. They can argue up, down, left and right, but ultimately they can never pass the “look!” test. The next time they try to claim that universal health care would be impossible in the US, point them to footage of Neil Armstrong bouncing on the moon and dare them to deny reality. A universal healthcare system is not only possible here, but long overdue.

Two years have passed without a leadership coup being launched against a sitting prime minister. In our unhinged system, that level of stability is a genuine achievement. So, hooray for #auspol. Except the voters are still ropeable, and politics doesn’t feel all that stable, does it? Old debates churn round in enervating circles, deeply silly business persists, and one of Malcolm Turnbull’s rewards for surviving two years in the top job was a harrowing account of Tony Abbott’s wounding and scarring exit from the prime ministership “at the height of his political career” in the Daily Telegraph on Friday. Poor old Tony (the paper’s political editor, Sharri Markson, noted by way of exposition) didn’t like talking about his emotions, “like most men”. But given opportunity, Wronged Tony™ rose nimbly to the occasion. Of course losing the prime ministership was wounding. “Of course you carry scars,” Abbott noted, movingly. Not being prime minister still hurts, but you just have to put disappointments behind you “and make the most of every day and that’s what I’m doing”. It certainly is what he’s doing. Fortunately for him, sorrow seems a healthy working distance from Abbott’s daily default disposition. This week, the former prime minister took a day off from his parliamentary duties to help put out bushfires. That made a refreshing change from lighting them – metaphorically of course. Two years after his own party ran him out of Dodge, Abbott is not ubiquitous in the political landscape, but he’s determined to be assertively present, a little pulse of mischief. He’s present in the marriage equality debate, defending religious freedom, holding back the scourge of progressivism – although it is mildly curious that the public running on that issue at the moment has defaulted to John Howard, rather than the member for Warringah, almost as if there has been a subtle baton change. Abbott is also making noise in the government’s fraught energy debate, having warmed his jets on the tarmac on that issue for some months, telling that nice Ben Fordham on 2GB all about his plans for a “100% reliable energy target” – a policy that carries the mild inconvenience of being technically impossible to deliver, given no energy system is ever 100% reliable. But then targets are, presumably, strictly optional for a political leader who willingly signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement, and now says we don’t have to do anything serious on emissions reductions, because international agreements are not a “straitjacket”. While Abbott is never one for fine policy detail, or constrained particularly by facts in the crafting of a deft political argument, he’s been very determined to front run the inevitable crab walk by the government in the direction of coal. The government is in the middle of its energy policy crab walk, and has picked a partisan fight with Labor, and the energy company AGL, to kick up sufficient dust for shellshocked Coalition MPs to get their tails up, and allow the cabinet to get on with settling the new investment framework. The energy plan is in transition, right before our eyes. The volume is being turned right down on the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and we are moving clearly in the direction of an overhaul of national electricity market rules. The market operator wants a day-ahead market, which allows better planning to ensure sufficient quantities of dispatchable energy are available in the system, and there is talk of a shift to a capacity market, which exists in Western Australia. While the rule changes look sensible, how any clean energy target fits with an energy market overhaul remains a bit moot, except it’s clear that if it survives, the level of ambition for emissions reduction will fall below the already low level aspired for in Finkel’s report. If all this comes to pass, the question will be about how can Australia meet it Paris climate change target – the one Turnbull says is not aspirational, despite what you might hear on 2GB every Wednesday afternoon and every second Monday morning. The next question will be whether the government can get its energy policy fix through parliament – or whether it actually wants to fail on that front in order to dust off the old political fight with Labor over climate policy and energy. Could it think that failing to fix this mess up is the viable path, politically, to winning the next election? Out in the real world, tolerance for such antics is low, but the picking of the old partisan fight has been mildly positive for morale among government MPs, as has the postal ballot’s survival against the high court challenge. You’d think shouting your way, incoherently, to victory would be impossible, absurd, ridiculous – except that modern politics is really a curious business. Shouting furiously about things often substitutes, successfully, for doing them. One little reported example this week can tell you a story about what sort of collective hole #auspol is in, when it comes to posturing and blathering being more important than substance. In the media policy debate, the main verb of the political week, the Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi drafted some amendments that would have allowed One Nation to vote for the deal it had negotiated with the government. Let me step through this carefully lest I get confusing. Several weeks ago, the One Nation bloc gave the Coalition its support for the government’s long-planned overhaul of the media landscape – the one that is going to make the Australian media sector even more concentrated in terms of ownership than it already is – in return for some nasty business against the ABC. The ink was no sooner dry on that agreement when it became clear it was an agreement in air quotes – a deal in name only. Being nasty to the ABC would require changes to completely separate pieces of legislation, not the broadcasting bill now before parliament, and no one else in the parliament was that interested in being nasty to the ABC, mass political suicide not really being in contemplation. Bernardi, who is of course in competition with One Nation for votes, thought he’d fix that problem for them by drafting detailed amendments grafting the ABC changes to the bill immediately before parliament. See Pauline, I’m delivering your deal, Bernardi said – cherubic. So did One Nation go ahead and vote for Bernardi’s amendments to deliver their own deal with the government? Well, no, it did not. The senators hovered outside the chamber during the division, abstaining from the vote to deliver their wish list. The numbers weren’t there in parliament to legislate the Bernardi amendment, but that doesn’t explain why One Nation refused to vote for, wait for it ... its own deal. Dare we suggest it is more important to have a Facebook live event moaning about the ABC than doing anything concrete to follow through on your moaning?

Such is the nature of media power. One of the reasons we now, at last, have change to media ownership regulation in Australia is that desperation has forced commercial rivals to come to some agreements about what they want. Previous governments were too timid to move in the face of division and opposition, even from the diminished media moguls of our time. But we still don’t have a media policy – from either side of politics – worthy of the name. It is all ad hoc and behind hand – puddling around the edges and lacking vision and understanding. Another reason we now have change is the founding and conduct of a Senate inquiry into public interest journalism. This, together with some serious behind the scenes lobbying by the new kids on the media block, has resulted in a deal under which Nick Xenophon has won a promise of government funding for journalism start-ups, regionals and independents as a counter to the increased concentration of ownership that will be the immediate effect of the changes. But the deal is not as good as it looks if you know the history and the context. Other proposals, including tax breaks for investment in journalism, have fallen by the wayside. Over the last five years there have been plenty of inquiries and parliamentary committees into aspects of media regulation. All have agreed, with variations, that the present method of regulating media diversity is outdated. All have resulted in great heat, little light and next to nothing in the way of change. Meanwhile the crisis engulfing commercial media, and particularly public interest journalism, has deepened. The 2012 convergence review was launched by the Labor government and reported in its last months. It recommended the creation of a converged content production fund, financed by all media players above a certain size. This would, by now, include Google and Facebook. This fund would have “a broad focus that supports traditional Australian content, new innovative content, and services for local and regional distribution”. The convergence review directly addressed journalism in the context of the content fund, noting that “the importance of local news to regional communities was one of the key messages from the Review’s consultations around Australia…. Content providers should also have access to the converged content production fund to encourage a diverse range of local services on new platforms.” So the deal that Nick Xenophon and his team have secured for a $60 million fund to make grants to independent and regional publishers is hardly a new idea. What’s missing is the levy on Google and Facebook and other publishers of size. The convergence review recommendations disappeared in the mire of controversy surrounding its proposal for statutory regulation of journalism standards. After much rubbish (remember the News Corporation tabloid front pages comparing communications minister Stephen Conroy to Stalin?) it all came to nothing. Then there was another Senate inquiry in March 2016 into an earlier attempt to pass reforms. All the same issues were chewed over – including the crisis in local and regional news services. The bill was not considered before parliament was dissolved, and it lapsed. So will the changes passed by parliament be good or bad? Underlying the legal changes is the simple fact that it won’t be ownership legislation that determines the future of media. Rather, it will be the speed of technological change and the success or otherwise in adjusting to it. Government could make real contributions here, but there is no sign of the necessary understanding or vision. The 75% reach rule is one of the things to go. It prohibits any one organisation from broadcasting to more than 75% of the Australian population. It is utterly meaningless in the era of Netflix, web pages and delivery of content via mobile devices. Nobody defends it. The two out of three rule refers to the three old-fashioned media platforms – television, radio and newspapers – and prohibits anyone from owning all three kinds in a single area. It is also outdated in the era of podcasting and the web, but this rule has its defenders for the simple and pragmatic reason that its abolition will result in more concentration of media ownership in the cities. For example, we are likely to see a merger between a commercial television network and Fairfax Media – which owns both newspapers and radio stations. The medium and long-term results of this change are very hard to predict. Things are moving very fast, and legacy media organisations such as Fairfax and Channel Nine are only part of the story. It is rare in human history for companies that have dominated one technology to successfully make the transition to dominating the next. Cobb and Co ran the stagecoaches, but never owned a steam train. In our own time Google and Facebook have quickly become the most powerful publishers the world has ever known, feeding partly the content created by legacy media. Most online advertising revenue flows their way, and most young people consume news through their apps – regardless of where the journalists who wrote the news are employed. It is the future employment of those journalists that is the most important issue in all this. There is an increasing body of research to show that the crisis in journalism is not, or not yet, in investigative journalism. Legacy media companies have safeguarded it, and some of the new players, such as Buzzfeed and the Guardian Australia, have also invested in it. Yet there are real deficits emerging in our capacity to satisfy the information needs of a democratic society. The crisis is in the hollowing-out of the traditional, non-glamorous, non-award-winning yet essential reporting of state parliaments, courts, local governments and other local public events and issues. None of the new players report state affairs in detail, do a solid job of court reporting, or touch local government except when there is a national issue at stake (such as citizenship ceremonies and Australia Day). Meanwhile legacy media has withdrawn from the local. How are dubious apartment buildings approved? How is it that flammable cladding endangers residents throughout the nation? How is it that grants go to government held marginal electorates? These are national stories that arise from the local. Even that is to put the local in terms of service to the nation. It is more immediate than that. In the modern media world, you have more chance of finding out what Malcolm Turnbull had for dinner than why there were half a dozen ambulances at the end of your street last night, or what the water quality is in the local river, or what is happening with the eyesore half completed building in your main street that hasn’t been touched for years, or what’s happening to crime levels in your area, or whether the local police station is under-staffed and why the local school principal has suddenly been moved on. Increasingly, the journalists aren’t there to, as the code of ethics puts it, “describe society to itself”. For these reasons, the $60 million fund for independent and regional media is a good thing. It recognises that we have a crisis that merits a concerted civic response. But it is not enough – and in fact doesn’t come close to what has already been cut, including by government. It is one step forward following several steps backwards. On the best available estimates (which are necessarily partial and imperfect) 3,000 journalists have lost their jobs in Australia over the last five years – many in regional areas. If we assume an average $70,000 salary cost each, back of the envelope figuring suggests it would take over $200mn a year just to get back to where we were. Or to offer another benchmark, the government gave the Australian Broadcasting Corporation $41.4million over three years for “enhanced newsgathering” in the 2016 triennial funding round – but this was a cut from the $60 million a year for the same program that the previous Labor government had provided. In other words, Xenophon’s fund doesn’t even keep up with money that has already been cut from government support for news reporting in Australia – including local and regional news. Speaking about the ABC, what of the One Nation backed move for an inquiry into its “competitive neutrality” – that is, whether it unfairly competes with its commercial counterparts? The devil will be in the detail. Who will conduct the inquiry, and what are the terms of reference? Certainly, there is a lot of angst about this in the ABC headquarters at Ultimo. It is one of the greatest threats of recent times. Meanwhile, changes requiring the ABC to have board members from regional areas and to have a reference to rural and regional in its charter are feel good measures that will not make much difference. There has for some time been rural representation on the board, and the current managing director, Michelle Guthrie, last March announced a raft of new positions in regional areas, funded by cuts to management. Yet there is no doubt that one of the main narratives of the last decade of the ABC is its increasing centralisation in Sydney, including the end of local television production in Adelaide, Hobart and Brisbane. Why? Internal politics are part of the answer, but the rest is about funding. If you want a better local presence, it must be paid for. So what are the answers? While few can argue with the abolition of outdated media ownership regulations, there are now powerful arguments for good media policy and a concerted rather than piecemeal response to the challenges in this vitally important sector. This might include increased government investment in journalism as an underpinning of democratic forms, as well as regulation and potentially levying of Google, Facebook and their yet to emerge competitors and successors. Most of all, we need a media policy. Actual policy, with strategic objectives. Anyone seen one recently? Margaret Simons is an associate professor of journalism at Monash University. She was a co-author of two submissions to the Senate committee inquiry into public interest journalism – one from the Public Interest Journalism Foundation and the other from the Civic Impact of Journalism research project, which she led. She also made submissions and appeared before many of the other inquiries mentioned here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/15/friday-briefing-no-bright-future-warning-to-north-korea-after-missile-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T05:31:15Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: 'No bright future' – warning to North Korea after missile launch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/15/friday-briefing-no-bright-future-warning-to-north-korea-after-missile-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/15/friday-briefing-no-bright-future-warning-to-north-korea-after-missile-launch","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: 'No bright future' – warning to North Korea after missile launch","bodyText":"Top story: ‘China and Russia must take direct action’ Hello – it’s Warren Murray, beginning our round-up with North Korea raising tensions once again. Kim Jong-un’s regime has directly defied toughened sanctions by firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile over northern Japan and into the sea. The suspected Hwasong-12 IRBM took off just before 11pm London time from Sunan, near Pyongyang, and passed over Cape Erimo on Japan’s Hokkaidō island before landing 2,200km further east in the Pacific Ocean. The inevitable condemnation from world leaders has rained down and experts are analysing what North Korea, or those aligned against it, might do next. No direct response from Donald Trump just yet, but his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has called on China and Russia to act against Kim Jong-un. His regime only 12 days ago carried out its most powerful nuclear test yet, and on 29 August sent another missile over Japan – a US ally that Washington has vowed to defend. “China supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labour,” said Tillerson. “China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.” James Mattis, the US defence secretary, called it a “reckless act” but reserved comment on what America and its allies might do in response. Japan’s prime minister made extensive comments, but this passage leapt out: “If North Korea continues to walk this road, there will be no bright future. We need to get North Korea to understand that.” South Korea said it immediately carried out its own missile drill to put the North’s Sunan launch site within striking range. The South’s president, Moon Jae-in, convened an emergency council and told officials to prepare for biological and chemical weapons attacks from North Korea, as well as potential electromagnetic pulse attacks that disable electronic equipment. The UN security council is to discuss the launch at an emergency session today. We will of course have more Guardian analysis and reaction as the day continues. * * * Killed by crocodile – A British man is presumed dead after being dragged into the water by a crocodile in Sri Lanka. Paul McClean, a Financial Times journalist, had been having surfing lessons near a spot called Elephant Rock. He was attacked on the shore of a nearby lagoon, witnesses said. A colleague at the FT told the newspaper: “We’re all totally stunned. He was a great kid, an Everton fan, super bright. It’s an absolute tragedy.” McClean had worked for the newspaper for two years and covered the EU and Brexit. The Foreign Office said it was assisting his family. * * * Are cats actually a liquid? How felines can adopt the shape of their container is the phenomenon explored by the winning paper in the Ig Nobel prize for obscure research. Marc-Antoine Fardin, of the Université Paris Diderot, was inspired to write On the Rheology of Cats after seeing … well … funny cat pictures on the internet. Rheology is the science of flows, and his study was published in the Rheology Bulletin (subscribe today!). Potential puns abound: “This research is bound to be poured over.” Or even “pawed over”. You can take it from there. Or not. Other finalists: how learning the didgeridoo reduces snoring, why old men’s ears get longer, and the part of the brain that makes people hate cheese. * * * More pressure on May over pay – Unions have ramped up their campaign against the government’s public sector pay cap, calling for a 3.9% raise for a million NHS staff, plus £800 each to make up for lost earning power during austerity. “Their wages continue to fall behind inflation as food and fuel bills, housing and transport costs rise,” said Sarah Gorton from Unison. Midwives say the claim represents fair compensation for losing £6,000 in the value of their salaries since 2010. The NHS is short of 3,500 midwives and struggling to fill other vacancies, with pay restraint seen as a factor. NHS trusts say they need more money to boost pay and staff morale without cutting services. The government says it will discuss and agree 2018-19 pay remits as part of the budget process. * * * Home sweet micro home – “Tiny but not cramped … very warm and, though the night was stormy, quiet. A good night’s sleep.” That is the verdict of our reporter Steven Morris after his stay in an iKozie: pod-style living quarters designed to help homeless people make the transition into permanent housing. It has a small double bed and cupboards, shower room with toilet, “entertainment zone” with sofa and television, semi-circular table and kitchen with cooker, washing machine, fridge and work surface. A community of iKozies is being considered in Worcester, to house key workers and students, as well as homeless people. Lunchtime read: From Russia with overwhelming force “I recommend you to look in that direction,” says the Russian major general – then two cruise missiles streak aloft from submarines in the Mediterranean, bound for Isis targets in Syria. Later, in war-torn Aleppo, children sing patriotic songs and teachers thank Russia for its aid. The local mufti denies Russian or Syrian bombing had anything to do with the devastation of the local neighbourhood, including his mosque – “it was all the terrorists”. On this carefully orchestrated official tour, designed to show that the Kremlin “is in control of both war and the peace in the country”, Shaun Walker, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, looks past the photo opportunities and scripted lines to describe the scale of an intervention that has made Russia a major power in the Middle East. Sport Arsène Wenger expects a Uefa inquiry into the chaotic scenes that forced a one-hour delay to Arsenal’s Europa League win over Cologne last night, when London got a taste of what it feels like to be caught on the hop by thousands of boisterous, tribal, boozed-up football fans in search of a space to call their own for the night. Everton, meanwhile, produced another hugely disappointing display as they were soundly beaten for the third successive game, this time Atalanta inflicting the damage. In boxing, Nicola Adams, Great Britain’s two-times Olympic gold medallist, cannot stop smiling as she prepares to take on Alexandra Vlaik of Hungary on the Golovkin-Álvarez undercard this weekend. Billy Vunipola has defended his decision to withdraw from the summer’s British &amp; Irish Lions tour because of a shoulder injury, saying that “otherwise I’d be letting people down”. Essex completed victory at Warwickshire and now await their title deeds from Somerset today, and the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and secretary general, Fatma Samoura, have been accused of “violating the norms and standards of good conduct” by a governance committee member who resigned. Business The pound briefly surged over $1.34 again overnight before slipping very slightly to $1.338. But there’s no doubt the Bank of England has lit a fire under sterling with comments from the governor Mark Carney hinting that the first rise in rates for 10 years is on the cards for November or December. On the continent the pound is buying €1.124. Asian shares were a mixed bag despite North Korea’s latest missile test over Japan, while the FTSE100 is set to open very slightly down later this morning. The papers The Telegraph goes it alone today to proclaim that a weakened navy “can now barely protect the UK” due to spending cuts. Like the Sun it has a front-page picture of Paul McClean, the Financial Times journalist apparently killed by a crocodile in Sri Lanka. The FT itself splashes on signals from the Bank that it is poised to raise interest rates – the Scotsman picks that one up too. The Guardian splash is the NHS unions’ “£3bn pay demand” – the Mirror marks the day as the start of the “3.9% pay war” though whether that phrasing will resonate through history is debatable. Overweight people will be sent to cooking and exercises classes, says the Times, under health guidance being rolled out to doctors from today. The Express has one of our beloved “latest study” stories – this one says losing weight cuts blood pressure more than giving up smoking. The Daily Mail is very worried that “well-off parts of the country are facing the construction of tens of thousands of new homes” as councils are ordered to increase housebuilding by 40% over the next decade.

The final score was probably about right by the end, but at the end of the first half it looked like Australia were in serious trouble. Just how much their improvement in the second half was due to their own ability and how much was due to Argentina tiring badly is up for debate. I strongly suspect it was a combination of both. For my money the key passage of play was early in the second half when the Pumas threw everything at the Wallabies line only to come up short. They looked dead on their feet after that, and the late try fest was no surprise. What does this all mean in terms of the Wallabies’ progress? It’s difficult to say. As tough as Argentina were in the first half, you always suspected they would struggle if Australia went up a gear. Whether the Wallabies can do it, and maintain it, against the Springboks at altitude in their next game is a much more difficult proposition. Thanks for joining me tonight, I’ll catch you next time. Foley adds the extra points and the whistle blows. That’s all she wrote - the Wallabies were as clinical in the second half as they were off the pace in the first. 80 min: Australia ignore the siren, charge towards the line and Uelese bundles the ball over. There’s the icing on the cake. 78 min: Sanchez hits it home from the edge. 77 min: Moroni with a perfect chip and chase to get the scoreline more respectable. Great skill. 76 min: Foley adds the cherry. This has been a Jekyll and Hyde performance by the Wallabies. 75 min: McMahon with the pass to Phipps who’s brought down just short of the line but pops it over with an outstretched hand 74 min: Foley kicks the Wallabies further ahead, in off the post. 73 min: Well it’s been a long time coming but the Wallabies are finally over the line again. The line was wide open from the scrum, Genia saw the opening and hurled himself through it. 71 min: A card for Argentina. It’s been coming. Pieretto marches off after more pressure on the Pumas scrum. 69 min: Oof. The Wallabies get it away from the scrum, charge to the line but get held up again. Kerevi this time. Back we go. 68 min: The ref is getting impatient with the Argentina scrum. The Wallabies have piled on the pressure. The latest infringement sparks a bin warning. Hooper asks about a penalty try ... doesn’t get much of a response. 66 min: McMahon is held up over the line and the Wallabies get the scrum. That would have been a kick in the teeth for the Pumas after all that pressure. The momentum has swung back to Australia. 65 min: The Wallabies finally get some possession and run it deep into the Argentina half. Eventually it’s turned over but play is brought back for an an earlier penalty and Foley boots it into touch about 5m out from the Argentina line. 64 min: A poor lineout and, here we go again, the Pumas bolt forward. It’s been all Argentina for the last five minutes. 63 min: Finally, the Wallabies get a penalty and the pressure evaporates. That’s heartbreaking stuff for the Pumas who threw everything at the line and came up short. Great defence. 61 min: The Pumas can practically smell the try line but the Wallabies have defended admirably, repelling everything that’s been thrown at them. So far. 60 min: More excellent defence from the Wallabies. Just when it looked like the Pumas had dived over in the corner, the Wallabies throw their bodies underneath to keep it out. Still in the danger zone though. 58 min: Heart-in-mouth time for the Wallabies. They defend brilliantly on the line to keep the Pumas out originally, then Folau gets a fingertip to a pass that would have led to a certain try. Then a stab forward causes confusion and the Wallabies defence scrambles to get it down. 56 min: Lord knows what Cheika yelled at said to the Wallabies during the break but it seems to have done the trick. They can’t afford to take their foot off the gas though. The Pumas are on the attack, looking for an immediate reply. 54 min: Foley with a textbook kick from the edge to add the extras. 52 min: And suddenly the game looks a lot more comfortable for the Wallabies. Genia with a long pass out to Folau who slides home. Good spell of pressure from the hosts. 50 min: Foley makes no mistake from the kick. Better from the Wallabies, who now have a bit of breathing space. 49 min: The Wallabies batter their way to the line with a hat-trick of pick-and-gos. Kepu is the man who finally gets it over the line. “No urgency... I don’t think we realised we were in a Test match,” Cheika says of the first half during a break for the scrum. Nail meet head. 48 min: The Wallabies take a quick tap penalty, hoping to keep the pressure up on the Pumas line, but Argentina soak up the attack and the hosts are lucky to win a scrum. 47 min: It’s actually been a good bit of play by the Wallabies, but the Pumas have tackled well to deny them an opening. Plenty of phases. This will tire Argentina, but Australia need the points. 45 min: A lot of phases from both teams... but no points at the end of it. The Wallabies get a lineout and try to run the phases again... until a loose pass slips out of Folau’s grasp. They start again. 43 min: Forget I said anything. Another poor decision and it’s the Pumas who suddenly have the ball again. They’re battering the Aussie line too, fighting for every metre. 41 min: Peeeep! Off we go again. Surely the Wallabies have to step it up a gear in this half? Argentina have tended to die off a little towards the back end of games but are Australia capable of making them pay? They’ve already made numerous errors themselves this game. They’ve started this half well though. Moving the ball from right to left to right again. A few boos ring out from the sparse crowd as the Wallabies boot it into touch. The Pumas have had plenty of possession and possibly should be further ahead. Would love to hear what Cheika says to the Wallabies during the break. See you in the second half. 39 min: Not long to the buzzer and the Wallabies will be glad to hear it. The way it’s been going the Pumas are the more likely side to score. 37 min: Hats off to the Pumas, they’ve been the better side and but for that brief moment of excellence from the Wallabies for the try, they’d be well in front. The visitors win yet another penalty about 45m out. Sanchez goes for it but it sails wide. 35 min: The Pumas pile on the pressure from the restart and earn another penalty, Kuridrani giving it away this time. This one’s much closer though and Sanchez boots it home easily. 32 min: The big boot of Boffelli comes into play as McMahon gives away a penalty. Elementary error. Offside. It looks like the kick is sailing between the posts... but then it slices just wide. 30 min: And the conversion from Foley is straight through the middle. We’re all square again. Cheika can breathe. 29 min: The Wallabies hit back. Great ball movement and once it reached Folau on the right, there was only one outcome. He brushes off a stretching hand from the nearest defender to touch down. 26 min: Good metres from a Foley kick but the Pumas have got their tails up and charge again at the Wallabies line. Argentina are good for their lead, the Wallabies are struggling to get out of second gear. Sanchez with the conversion. Pressure on the Wallabies. 24 min: Well it’s given by John Lacey and Argentina are in front. Debatable but that’s the call. 24 min: Landajo over the line ... but is it legal? The ref goes to the TMO. Strong suggestion of offside. 22 min: Well it’s not exactly been the spectacle the ARU would have hoped for so far - more of an arm wrestle really with some errors thrown in. Some good offloads from the Pumas keep the ball alive and they begin to build pressure close to the Wallabies line. 20 min: Just as the Pumas look like they’re about to make the break, they’re brought back for a forward pass from Sanchez. Boffelli was in a very dangerous position then too. Warning signs for the Wallabies. 17 min: Well this isn’t going according to plan for Australia. It’s been the Pumas in control for the last 10 minutes, pushing and probing without really threatening to break the line. Eventually it’s booted high and Beale takes the mark. 15 min: Well after that initial dominance the Wallabies have been on the back foot for the last five minutes, literally, as the Pumas charge up the field with a rolling maul. It’s finally halted but it comes at the cost of a penalty, which is duly booted between the posts to level things up. 12 min: Some, shall we say, ‘scrappy’ defence from the Wallabies to finally halt a Pumas attack down the right flank. Argentina also struggle to hold on to the ball with the try line in sight and the Wallabies get a scrum out of it to ease the pressure. It’s booted into touch and the physio immediately races onto the pitch to check on Sanchez, who hurt himself in a solid tackle on Kuridrani. 10 min: The referee loses patience with the Pumas and hands it over to the Wallabies who go long, kicking deep into the Pumas half. A looping kick comes flying back and it’s as you were - with the Pumas on the attack. 9 min: Well it’s been a solid start from the Wallabies, and they’ve deservedly edged in front... although there are a few signs of the Pumas fighting back. They have a scrum in the Aussie half after almost breaking the line. 6 min: Foley with a simple kick from between the posts after one too many infractions from the visitors. 5 min: Early stoppage as Alemanno goes down with a knock from a lineout. He takes about a minute, then hops up as healthy as you like. Wallabies back on the attack but the Pumas’ defence has held up well. So far. 4 min: The Wallabies attack the left corner but Beale can’t find a way through and the Wallabies concede a penalty. Good defence from the Pumas. 3 min: And that leads to a penalty which Foley boots into the corner. Early pressure from the Wallabies. 1 min: Peeeeep! And we’re off. Can the Pumas spring a surprise tonight? They’ll fancy their chances after such a good showing in New Zealand... although there’s a mistake right from the off, a knock-on from Argentina as they try to pick up the Aussie kick. Australia scrum. That’s the anthems over. You could see the players’ breath frosting over in the cool Canberra air. It’s almost go time. A wealth of options tonight for code-hungry Aussies. Despite that - and the chilly conditions - there’s a “decent” crowd shaping up in Canberra. Reports earlier in the week that it had sold out (when it hadn’t) didn’t help ticket sales either. Selection questions. Michael Cheika must live in a rough area because he’s changed his lock combination yet again. It’s Rob Simmons in the second row at the expense of Rory Arnold, who isn’t even in the 23. Earlier in the week, Cheika said it was to prove a point about the consistency needed from players at Test level, but surely consistent set-piece combinations is just as crucial for building success. There are plenty of question marks over Hanigan’s form too but he’s been backed for another week, possibly because no one is really pushing for his position. Marika Koroibete is poised for his debut. Argentina have made four changes. Tomas Lezana replaces Benjamin Macone at No.8. Martin Landajo, Ramiro Moyano and Matias Orlando start in the backs instead of Tomas Cubelli, Joaquin Tuculet and Santiago Cordero. Australia (15-1): Israel Folau, Henry Speight, Tevita Kuridrani, Kurtley Beale, Reece Hodge, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Sean McMahon, Michael Hooper (c), Ned Hanigan, Adam Coleman, Rob Simmons, Sekope Kepu, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Scott Sio Reserves: Jordan Uelese, Tom Robertson, Allan Alaalatoa, Izack Rodda, Jack Dempsey, Nick Phipps, Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete Argentina: Emiliano Boffelli, Matias Moroni, Matias Orlando, Jeronimo de la Fuente, Ramiro Moyano, Nicolas Sanchez, Martin Landajo, Tomas Lezana, Javier Ortega Desio, Pablo Matera, Matias Alemanno, Guido Petti, Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro, Agustin Creevy (c), Lucas Noguera Reserves: Julian Montoya, Santiago Garcia Botta, Enrique Pieretto, Marcos Kremer, Juan Manuel Leguizamon, Tomas Cubelli, Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias, Manuel Montero Stat blast. There are plenty of other reasons for the Wallabies to feel optimistic going into this clash, and let’s face it, Aussie rugby fans need something to cheer about this year. The statistics paint a pretty one-sided picture. World ranking - Australia 5, Argentina 10. Played 27 - Australia 21, Argentina 5, Draw 1 Rugby Championship results: Since 2012 - Australia 8, Argentina Last five results: 2016: Australia 33-21 (Twickenham); 2016: Australia 36-20 (Perth); 2015: Australia 29-15 (Twickenham); 2015: Australia 34-9 (Mendoza)2014: Argentina 21-17 (Mendoza) Evening everyone and thanks for ignoring all that football finals nonsense going on elsewhere to join me as the Wallabies look for their first win of the Rugby Championship campaign - if you’re reading this, you’re truly a diehard fan. But before I go any further, they may have struggled recently against the Wallabies and Argentina, but reports of the All Blacks’ imminent demise seem to have been greatly exaggerated. They have just absolutely shpadonked the Springboks 57-0 – a victory so emphatic it’s forced me to invent a new word to describe it. So I guess that’s this season’s Rugby Championship title race over then. Over to the battle to avoid the wooden spoon. And while it’s all too easy to be cynical (see my intro) in this post-truth, post-Super Rugby-season world, at least Wallabies fans have cause for optimism tonight. They may have been frustrating to watch in their last two outings against South Africa and New Zealand, but there were also signs that they can be as good as anyone when it all clicks together. Michael Cheika certainly seems to think he’s onto something good and, with the exception of one tweak, has backed the team that battled to a stalemate against South Africa last week. And yet in some ways, it’s a no-win situation for the Wallabies coach. A comfortable victory tonight and his critics will argue they should always beat Argentina comfortably at home (while conveniently ignoring the Pumas impressive display in New Plymouth last week). Anything other than a win, however, and things could get ugly. We’re talking ‘floral tribute to Princess Diana’ ugly. And with away games against Argentina and South Africa coming up, the Wallabies could well be eating humble pie with a wooden spoon by the end of play. But that’s worst-case scenario territory and, personally, I reckon there’s more chance of Tony Abbott voting ‘yes’ than the Wallabies slipping up tonight. Richard will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Bret Harris on how the Wallabies have finally turned up to the party, only to find out the other revellers have moved on:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/15/self-driving-car-fake-ford-virginia-tech-man-in-seat","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Why did Ford build a 'fake driverless car' using a man dressed as a seat?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/15/self-driving-car-fake-ford-virginia-tech-man-in-seat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/15/self-driving-car-fake-ford-virginia-tech-man-in-seat","fields":{"headline":"Why did Ford build a 'fake driverless car' using a man dressed as a seat?","bodyText":"In early August, residents of Arlington, Virginia, spotted an unmarked silver Ford Transit van cruising around town without a human behind the wheel. Local news publication ARLnow caught the ghostly vehicle on camera and speculated that it was part of Virginia Tech’s autonomous driving research. A couple of days later, NBC reporter Adam Tuss approached the vehicle on foot and peered inside, only to see hands poking out from the driver’s seat holding the steering wheel. The “driverless” car had a driver – but he was disguised as a car seat. The “seat suit” stunt was the brainchild of Ford and Virginia Tech Transportation Institute researchers to explore how self-driving vehicles can communicate their intent to pedestrians, human drivers and cyclists. There are many subtle cues humans use to communicate with each other on the road that disappear when the driver is removed from the equation: eye contact to show a pedestrian they’ve been noticed; a head nod to let another driver take his or her turn at an intersection; or a hand wave of appreciation when changing lanes in heavy traffic. Ford and Virginia Tech wanted to test how people would react to light signals replacing some of this communication. “We needed to try out this new lighting to communicate the intent of the vehicle, but if you’ve got a driver behind the seat you still have natural communication between humans like eye-to-eye contact,” said Andy Shaudt, who headed the research at Virginia Tech. “So we needed to make it look like a driverless car.” That’s where the seat suit came into play. Shaudt’s team essentially created a false front for the driver’s seat matching the upholstery of the passenger seat. The driver would sit on the real seat and then cover his torso with a chest piece that snapped round the real seat with four magnets. He would then place a hood designed to look like the headrest (a black fabric screen over molded plastic) over his face. “At first it was a little different and uncomfortable,” said Shaudt, who was one of six drivers to don the suit during August. “We first practised on a test track and got used to setting everything up and holding your hands down low [on the steering wheel]. “Then you just pump up the air conditioning a little bit more and head out.” Extensions on the indicator stalks allowed him to control signals with his hands held low and a control box strapped to his leg was used to control the experimental lighting signals which sent signals to passersby. “Some people are wary of this technology and if the vehicle is communicating its intent to them they may be more comfortable and accepting of the technology,” said Ford’s human factors technical specialist John Shutko who worked closely with Virginia Tech. Shaudt and his team racked up more than 150 hours and 1,800 miles on the road, with cameras capturing how other people reacted to the signals. The drivers were trained by Ford’s Argo AI autonomous car team in how to move the vehicle so it looked like a driverless car. “They taught us not to accelerate or decelerate too quickly and obey all of the rules of the road, so stopping at stop bars and not going over the speed limit,” said Shaudt. Being such sticklers to the rules could be frustrating for other drivers. In one case, the car took a while to accelerate when a red light turned green. “The car behind pulled up on the side and the driver started to yell, ‘Come on, get out of my way’ before stopping and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, there’s nobody in that car!’” said Shaudt. Researchers gave the project the code name “Curtains”. Shaudt said: “Because of the Wizard of Oz approach we used; the whole idea was ‘don’t look at the guy behind the curtains.” The team has yet to go through all of the camera footage, but on the whole it went unnoticed – except by a few beady-eyed reporters. “For the most part people are going about their day,” said Schaudt. There was some pointing and peering, but no mass outrage or attempts to sabotage or confuse the vehicle. “Sometimes people would be looking at the the ‘seat’ but it would seem like they were looking right at your face even though they couldn’t see you. It was kind of awkward. You’d start smiling and then look away [because of the extended eye contact]. “But you didn’t need to – the hood was like one way glass.” Barry Brown, a human-computer interaction researcher in Stockholm University, has been studying footage of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles made by Tesla, Google, Honda and Volvo to see how they handle social cues from human drivers. He found that Teslas in autopilot can make lane changes in ways that would be considered rude by human drivers. In one case, the Tesla moves cuts in front of another vehicle that’s clearly accelerating into the gap. “We like other drivers to be predictable. With Teslas sometimes they can change lanes in an unpredictable way. It’s not only seen as rude but can be dangerous,” said Brown. “We’ve had 100 years of driving with other humans on the road to build up so many conventions and understandings,” he added. “Having machines that come in and don’t understand the subtleties of social interaction is going to be really difficult.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/observer-killer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:01:24Z","webTitle":"Observer killer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/observer-killer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/17/observer-killer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer killer sudoku","bodyText":"Normal Sudoku rules apply, except the numbers in the cells contained within grey lines add up to the figures in the corner.

So it follows that English-style museums – which is to say, most Australian ones – also often fall short. Museums of bricks and mortar are largely antithetical to Aboriginal repositories of material and lived culture – community, country, story (in every form) and memory. How could a museum with walls and windows and display cases even contemplate an exhibition about something as central to 60,000-plus years of Indigenous life on this continent as “songlines” – a word given popular and literary currency by English writer Bruce Chatwin 30 years ago, which references paths of Indigenous knowledge and creation history that crisscross land, heaven and water? Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders have long embraced Chatwin’s “songlines” (at least the word, if not his 1987 novel The Songlines). They have claimed it to describe what they also know to be churinga tracks or dreaming paths – cultural, political, spiritual, ecological, geographical, historical (and so very much more) wisdom that is etched for them in the land. Songlines embody the stories of the ancestors’ creation of country itself. They are a belief system. But they are also akin to maps – stories about the land that, understood, spoken or sung, can be used to navigate on foot or even by vehicle. Given that this continent’s Indigenous populations represent the oldest continuous civilisations on earth, the songlines can even be seen as foundation stories of the cosmos. Now the National Museum of Australia, itself situated on an ancient corroboree ground through which runs a dreaming track, is explaining in an exhibition – Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters – that which words have failed. The verdict: a triumph of 21st century museology that the world deserves to see. It uses few English words and as many Indigenous. It is visual and experiential, featuring more than 100 paintings, photographs and other artworks, maps, video installations and a quite remarkable immersive six-metre multimedia “DomeLab” to tell the creationist story of the seven sisters as it appears in sections of five vast western and central desert songlines. It tells this story the way the people to whom it belongs – of the Martu, Ngaanyatjarra and APY (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjara) lands – understand it. The Seven Sisters is a metaphor and an allegory, a story of traditional laws that imparts ways to live today. It incorporates sexual longing, danger, deception, metamorphosis, temptation and an epic battle between good and evil, as the lustful sorcerer Wati Nyiru or Yurla chases and tries to seduce the sisters. He’s a “shape-shifter”, this demon; he becomes a tree to tempt them with shade, and a snake who they can kill and eat. The story has its variations from songline to songline, country to country. The songline goes subterranean in places, as the women dive into a waterhole to escape Wati Nyiru. They have other tricks too. They can fly. And so, as he chases them they take off from the Earth (woven images of the women soar over the exhibition) and become one with the Orion constellation and Pleiades star cluster. You can navigate parts of the central and western deserts using those stars, walk from waterhole to waterhole where the sisters submerged and emerged ... but only if you know the songline. There is another way of thinking about it: the women created the landmarks – the boulders and the trees, the hillocks and the waterholes – that they traversed on their chase. On other songlines the country over, creationist animals – emus, kangaroos, snakes – made the land. This exhibition is as breathtaking, as wondrous, as it is at times overwhelming and confounding. As you walk around it, stretch out in the dome – which includes images of 3,500-year-old rock art about the seven sisters from Cave Hill in South Australia – and examine the art, you might think you know precisely what a songline, a dreaming or churinga track, is. But then you’ll try to explain it in English to the person next to you and the odds are you’ll fall short. Yes, the songlines are mind-blowing for their multi-layered, literal and allegorical meanings, and the challenges they pose to western thought constructs and linear notions of time. Just as they are also profoundly beautiful for the purity of the beliefs and the spiritual truths that underpin them. This exhibition celebrates Indigenous culture and belief, endurance and wisdom in a way I’ve not hitherto experienced in a cultural collecting institution. It has immeasurably raised the international standard for any museum wanting to tell Indigenous stories (take note British Museum). Significantly, this is not a top-down exhibition. Its genesis lies in a request in 2010 from Anangu elders of the APY lands who, concerned that the Seven Sisters story would be lost to new Indigenous generations, asked the museum to help track the songlines and preserve the knowledge. The museum’s chief Indigenous curator and adviser, Margo Neale has worked collaboratively with a team of elders from the lands over the past seven years to mount the exhibition and to help track the songlines visually, performatively, archaeologically and ecologically. The artworks created for the exhibition will be incorporated into the museum’s national collection. Neale, of Aboriginal/Irish heritage, reckons the songlines are a “master archive – and they really are given that they record 60,000 or more years of experience of the oldest continuous civilisation ... they record deep cultural and geographic and all sort of other knowledge in the land and then transmit it”. She continues: “I’ve thought about it a lot and at their simplest, the songlines are corridors or pathways of knowledge embedded in the land, that crisscross this country and which have been laid down over the millennia.” Rene Kulitja, a senior artist from Mutitjulu who sings and dances the Seven Sisters story, smiles and nods when I ask if this exhibition will help non-Indigenous people understand what songlines are. “When I was a schoolgirl, maybe 13, in 1970 or 1971, an old lady taught me the Seven Sisters,” she says. “I understand it. It’s important. It’s our law. Every single day after school I would sing and dance the Seven Sisters. Now you can see it here too.” This exhibition focuses on sections of only five songlines that deal with the same story. There are thousands of others the length and breadth of the country, extending above and below us and into the sea. And so this exhibition intrigues and impels you to ask big existential questions and, naturally, to scrutinise ever harder Australia’s non-Indigenous creationist myths around foreign wars, continental invasion, dispossession and white settlement. It is a celebration of the wonders of this remarkable country that will introduce new generations of Indigenous and other Australians to a continental identity that stretches tens of thousands of years beyond 1770 or 1788. It may well send a new legion of readers the way of Chatwin, whose book, seminal though it remains, could have benefited from much in this exhibition. But he remains a trail-blazer, an Englishman engaging with the dreaming tracks that so much of Australia could not have cared less about just a few decades ago. Not least, Tracking the Seven Sisters puts into sharp relief recent historical spats, over statues for example, and reinforces the truth that those who were here first seeded the land with story long, long, long before the British arrived with parchment and quill to tell so many other tales. • Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters is open at the National Museum of Australia, Canberra until 25 February 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/15/turnbull-says-john-howard-could-help-coalition-fine-tune-marriage-legislation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T02:22:55Z","webTitle":"Turnbull says John Howard could help Coalition fine-tune marriage legislation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/15/turnbull-says-john-howard-could-help-coalition-fine-tune-marriage-legislation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/15/turnbull-says-john-howard-could-help-coalition-fine-tune-marriage-legislation","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull says John Howard could help Coalition fine-tune marriage legislation","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull says John Howard could assist the government in “fine-tuning” the exposure draft for any same-sex marriage legislation if the postal survey returns a yes vote. Noting that the former prime minister had not made a submission to a parliamentary committee convened specifically to consider issues such as religious freedom after the legalisation of marriage equality, Turnbull said, nonetheless, he would welcome Howard’s experience and expertise, and his passion for detail. “I am sure John will make an enormous contribution,” the prime minister told Sky News on Friday. Turnbull’s response followed another public intervention by Howard in the marriage equality debate, when he accused the government of failing to deal with the matter of religious freedom before the postal survey went ahead. Howard on Thursday released a sharp statement to the media warning if the yes vote triumphed in the postal survey there would be overwhelming pressure to legislate as quickly as possible, leaving scant opportunity to include proper religious protections in the legislation. But Turnbull said the government would protect religious freedom and the question had already been considered thoroughly by a parliamentary committee last year. He said the parliament could also amend any bill to legalise same-sex marriage during chamber debate in the event Australians voted yes. “John Howard knows very well, because there were free votes that were conducted under his time as prime minister, private members will get a bill to protect religious freedoms and there could be an amendment here and an amendment there, a debate about this and a debate about that,” he said. “No doubt it will be amended and debated and we don’t have a majority in the Senate and, in any event, it is a free vote.” In an interview marking the two-year anniversary of his prime ministership, Turnbull also sideswiped his predecessor, Tony Abbott, who on Thursday suggested Australia did not have to meet its commitments in the Paris climate accord. The prime minister said Abbott’s assertion that Paris was only aspirational was “not, in fact, the case”. For his part, Abbott marked the two-year anniversary of his losing the prime ministership to Turnbull by giving an interview with the Daily Telegraph. Abbott said during the interview that he would have won last year’s election against Bill Shorten if he had been leading the Liberal party. “Absolutely. There’s absolutely no doubt,” Abbott reportedly said. “I’m not going to speculate or make comparisons but I have not the slightest doubt that the government would have won last year’s election under my leadership. Not the slightest doubt. “Obviously 14 September 2015 wasn’t a great day in my life but the last thing I am going to do is let one bad day ruin six good years. They were good years. “It still hurts … but most people at some point in their life have disappointments and you’ve just got to put it behind you and make the most of every day and that’s what I’m doing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/18/trump-in-moscow-what-happened-at-miss-universe-in-2013","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Trump in Moscow: what happened at Miss Universe in 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/trump-in-moscow-what-happened-at-miss-universe-in-2013","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/trump-in-moscow-what-happened-at-miss-universe-in-2013","fields":{"headline":"Trump in Moscow: what happened at Miss Universe in 2013","bodyText":"Sitting in a makeshift studio overlooking the Moscow river on a crisp day in November 2013, Donald Trump pouted, stared down the lens of a television camera and said something he would come to regret. Asked by an interviewer whether he had a relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin, the brash New York businessman could not resist boasting. “I do have a relationship with him,” Trump said. Russia’s strongman had “done a very brilliant job”, Trump told MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts, before declaring that Putin had bested Barack Obama. “He’s done an amazing job – he’s put himself really at the forefront of the world as a leader in a short period of time.” Trump, a teetotaler, seemed intoxicated by the buzz surrounding the glitzy event that had brought him back to Moscow: that year’s instalment of the Miss Universe contest that he then owned. Four years later, he is struggling to shake off the hangover. The 2013 pageant has become a focal point for the simultaneous investigations, led by special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees, into whether associates of Trump colluded with Russian officials to help them win the 2016 US presidential election. Investigators are examining closely efforts apparently made by the Russian government to pass Trump’s team damaging information on Hillary Clinton, using Trump’s politically connected Miss Universe business partners as couriers. They are also looking into the $20m fee that Trump collected for putting on the pageant from those same business partners – along with extraordinary allegations about Trump’s private conduct behind closed doors at the Ritz-Carlton hotel during his 2013 stay in Moscow. The Guardian has learned of additional, previously unreported, connections between Trump’s business partners on the pageant and Russia’s government. The ties are likely to attract further scrutiny by investigators who are already biting at the heels of Trump associates. A full accounting of Trump’s actions in the Russian capital as that autumn turned to winter may be critical to resolving a controversy that has already consumed the first eight months of his presidency. “Our committee’s investigation will not be complete unless we fully understand who President Trump met with when he was over in Russia for Miss Universe, and what follow-up contacts occurred,” Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said in an interview. Trump’s attorney, John Dowd, declined to answer when asked whether the president’s team accepts that the Miss Universe contest is a legitimate area of inquiry for investigators. “Fake news,” Dowd said in an email. ‘Look who’s come to see me!’ It was a whirlwind courtship. Trump was instantly taken with Aras Agalarov, the billionaire owner of the Crocus Group corporation, when the two wealthy property developers met for the first time on the fringe of the Miss USA contest in Las Vegas in mid-June 2013. After just ten minutes of discussion, Trump was showing off his new friend. “He clapped me on the shoulder, gave a thumbs up, and started shouting, ‘Look who’s come to see me! It’s the richest man in Russia!’,” Agalarov recalled to a Russian magazine later that year, before clarifying that his fortune – estimated at about $2bn – was far from Russia’s biggest. The meeting had been set in motion only a month earlier, when Agalarov’s son Emin, a pop singer who is well-known in eastern Europe, filmed his latest music video in Los Angeles. His co-star was the reigning Miss Universe, a casting choice that brought the Agalarovs into contact with Trump’s beauty pageant division. The idea of hosting that year’s contest in Russia was raised over dinner by Paula Shugart, Trump’s top Miss Universe executive, according to Emin Agalarov. In a little-noticed interview published in July, Emin said Trump’s organisation seemed to be in need of the money that Moscow could offer. “We have a lot of debts,” he quoted Shugart as saying. Miss Universe denies that Shugart said this. In any case, a price tag of $20m to be paid by Agalarov in return for Trump bringing the Miss Universe contest to Russia was quickly agreed upon. Several Democrats have raised concerns that the payment – like the billions in bank loans he secured to bring himself back from the brink in the early 1990s – may have left Trump indebted to foreign influences. “The pageant was financed by a Russian billionaire who is close to Putin,” Senator Al Franken of Minnesota told a congressional hearing in May. “The Russians have a history of using financial investments to gain leverage over influential people and then later calling in favours. We know that.” Just four weeks after Emin’s video shoot, at the backslapping Las Vegas get-together, Trump announced that the deal was done. Miss Universe would be held at the Agalarov family’s sprawling Crocus City complex on the edge of Moscow, described by Trump as ”Russia’s most premier venue”. In a dreary Vegas hotel banqueting hall, the beaming new business partners ate a celebratory dinner together. Video footage later obtained by CNN showed Trump at his most oleaginous. “What a beautiful mother you have,” he told Emin. The principals were joined by an assortment of hangers-on including Emin’s publicist – a portly Briton named Rob Goldstone. It was Goldstone who would contact Trump’s son Donald Jr during the 2016 presidential campaign with a sensitive message, revealed in emails released last month. The “crown prosecutor of Russia” – assumed to be Goldstone’s garbled billing for Yury Chaika, the Russian prosecutor general – wanted the Trump campaign to have some documents that would “incriminate Hillary”, he said. And the Agalarovs would deliver them. “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin,” Goldstone wrote. Rather than express surprise or question the apparent Kremlin operation Goldstone was describing, Donald Jr pressed ahead and arranged the meeting. “If it’s what you say I love it,” he replied. Aras Agalarov made a suitable sherpa. While not a member of Putin’s inner circle, Agalarov cultivated friendly relations with the Kremlin while rising to the country’s oligarch class with a profitable network of shopping malls. He travelled around in a $44m Gulfstream private jet. Less than two weeks before the Miss Universe finals, Putin awarded Agalarov the prestigious Order of Honor medal, after Crocus had completed for him a billion-dollar transformation of a former military base into a new state university. “I wish to thank you so much for your work and contribution to the development of this country,” Putin told Agalarov and his fellow honorees. Crocus would go on to be further rewarded with more government construction contracts, including for stadiums that are to be used for next year’s soccer World Cup tournament in Russia. Separately, one of Agalarov’s top executives, Irakly “Ike” Kaveladze, also has his own relationships with several influential Russians. Kaveladze, a publicity-shy Crocus vice president, was the so-called “eighth man” at the 2016 Trump Tower meeting where Donald Jr hoped to receive dirt on Clinton. While relatively unknown to the public before news of the meeting emerged in July, Kaveladze has in fact been an associate of some of Russia’s richest and most powerful people for the past three decades. The Guardian has established that Kaveladze was involved in the $341m takeover of a US company by a Russian mining firm belonging to an associate of Putin, and was a business partner to two former senior officials at Russia’s central bank. In 2003, the Colorado-based firm Stillwater Mining was bought by Norilsk Nickel, a metals corporation in Moscow led by Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia’s wealthiest oligarchs, who is so favoured by Putin that he has played on the president’s “Hockey Legends” ice hockey team . As part of its $341m purchase of the American firm, Norilsk nominated Kaveladze to be one of its five handpicked directors on Stillwater’s new board, according to a filing by the company to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Kaveladze was billed as the president of “an international consulting boutique” serving a “US and Eastern European clientele”. The deal was the first time a Russian company had ever taken a majority stake in a publicly traded US company. It was viewed as critical by the Kremlin. Putin was reported at the time to have personally advocated for the deal’s approval by US regulators during a meeting with then president George W Bush earlier in 2003. Norilsk was then co-owned by Potanin and Mikhail Prokhorov, another major Russian oligarch, who later sold his stake. Prokhorov, who has had mixed relations with the Kremlin, now owns the Brooklyn Nets basketball team in New York. Kaveladze and Prokhorov had been classmates at the Moscow Finance Institute in the late 1980s and formed a partnership selling customised jeans between their studies. Kaveladze’s ascent to the Stillwater board was eventually derailed, according to a source, after the discovery of his earlier involvement in a $1.4bn California-based scheme involving shell companies and transfers from Russia, which US authorities said may have been used for money laundering. Norilsk said he withdrew from the process for personal reasons. The Guardian previously revealed that Kaveladze’s partner in that operation was Boris Goldstein, a Soviet-born banker whose ties to former KGB officers attracted interest from US investigators after he moved to California in the early 1990s. In a remarkable coincidence, the US attorney in San Francisco whose office eventually declined to bring criminal charges over their alleged money-laundering scheme was Robert Mueller, the special counsel now looking into Kaveladze’s reappearance. Also previously unreported is Kaveladze’s close friendship with Andrei Kozlov, who was first deputy chairman of Russia’s central bank under Putin for four years before being assassinated in 2006 as he attempted to clean up Russia’s corrupt banking system. At the turn of the 1990s, Kaveladze and Kozlov had gone into business together after graduating from the Moscow Finance Institute. They founded a small publisher and translator of financial books with Dmitry Budakov, another classmate, who also went on to be a senior executive at Russia’s central bank before running a division of the state-owned Bank of Moscow. The young entrepreneurs capitalised on a hunger for financial literature among players in Russia’s rapidly privatising economy, pricing their textbooks at around $250. One book was published in Kaveladze’s name. His 1993 work, Protecting trade secrets in the US: A guide to protecting your business information, remains available in several university libraries. According to an official history of that time, their book publishing outfit, ECO-Consulting, was established as a division of Crocus International, Aras Agalarov’s then-burgeoning business empire. In return for the security of being part of a larger corporation, Kaveladze and his business partners advised Agalarov on economic and financial affairs, according to a memoir of the time by Budakov. “Cooperation was mutually profitable,” he wrote. Kaveladze soon moved to the US, landing first in Pennsylvania. He had earlier spent almost a month visiting the Gettysburg area after graduating in 1989. As a tribute to their departed guest, locals held a “Perestroika” 5,000-metre running race near the site of the civil war battlefield as part of their Labor Day celebrations, according to the Gettysburg Times. When Kaveladze moved to the US, he became close with a middle-aged couple in York, Pennsylvania. Judith Shaw, whose obituary affectionately named Kaveladze as her “adopted son”, died in February 1993; her widower did not respond to requests for comment. Kaveladze eventually bought an apartment in New York. More than 25 years after their first venture, Kaveladze continues to work alongside Agalarov at Crocus. Their company has become one of the biggest corporations in Russia, carrying out government building contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Putin’s administration – and sealing international deals with tycoons such as Trump. An attorney for Kaveladze did not respond to requests for comment prior to publication. After this article was first published, an attorney for Kaveladze contacted us to say that Kaveladze considers a number of matters in the article to be inaccurate. In particular Kaveladze denies being business partners with either Prokhorov or Goldstein. In relation to Prokhorov, Kaveladze says that he only worked for his jeans business for two days whilst studying at the Moscow Finance Institute. In relation to Goldstein, he says he has only met him briefly on two occasions. Kaveladze also denies being involved in the takeover of Stillwater Mining by Norilsk Nickel. ‘Will he become my new best friend?’ Before leaving the US for his big Russian show in 2013, Trump made an unusual public appeal. “Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow,” he asked on Twitter, and “if so, will he become my new best friend?” A source in Moscow told the Guardian that a meeting with Trump was indeed pencilled into Putin’s diary by aides, but fell off his schedule a few days beforehand. Agalarov later said that Putin sent his apologies to Trump in the form of a handwritten note and a gift of a traditional decorative lacquered box. It is not known whether Trump met any associates of Putin in lieu of the president himself, but he certainly claimed to have. “I was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people,” he said in a radio interview in 2015. “I can’t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.” Having flown from the US overnight, Trump arrived in Moscow on 8 November and checked in to the Ritz Carlton hotel. It was a choice that has since become notorious. An opposition research dossier compiled for a private client by a former British spy, which was later published by BuzzFeed News, alleged that the Kremlin held compromising and lurid footage of Trump and a pair of prostitutes during his stay at the hotel. Elsewhere in the dossier, author Christopher Steele wrote that two sources alleged Trump also had illicit sexual encounters in the Russian city of St Petersburg during a separate visit to the country. The sources, according to Steele, said that Aras Agalarov would “know the details”. Trump denies any wrongdoing. It is plausible – but unproven – that attempts were made to surveil Trump during his trip. “If you are in their field of interest then the FSB will absolutely attempt to carry out surveillance,” said a Russian hotel industry source, who did not want the name of his hotel mentioned due to the sensitivity of the topic. The source said there was little that hotel managers could do about FSB demands, and that they are sometimes forced to provide access to rooms for agents. “In the bigger hotels you also definitely have a number of people on the staff who work on the side for the FSB, so they would have had absolutely no problem getting into the room if necessary.” Putin said earlier this year that it was absurd to think the FSB would have bugged or secretly filmed Trump’s room in 2013, as he was not even a politician at that point. Russia did not simply bug every American billionaire who visited the country, according to the president. But the hotel industry source cast doubt on that claim. “Surveillance doesn’t happen that often, but I’m pretty sure Trump would have been of a sufficient level to warrant it,” said the source. “I’ve seen people of lower levels than him watched for sure.” When the late-night talkshow host Stephen Colbert managed in July to gain access to the Ritz-Carlton’s presidential suite, where Trump is said to have stayed, an unexplained power cable was discovered dangling from a section of the bedroom wall that was hidden behind a non-illuminated mirror. Whatever the truth about how closely Trump was being monitored by the Kremlin, a remark he made about Putin during that boast-filled interview with MSNBC seems particularly curious with the benefit of hindsight. “I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today,” Trump said of the Russian president. “He’s probably very interested in what you and I are saying today – and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form.” Some elements of Steele’s dossier have reportedly been confirmed by investigators, but other details have been shown to be false. And Trump has been backed up on the claims about his private conduct by Emin Agalarov. “While the world tries to figure out what Donald Trump was doing in a hotel in Moscow during Miss Universe – I actually know because he was filming my music video,” he wrote on Instagram. Early in the morning of 9 November, Trump was taking part in filming at the hotel for the video of Emin’s single In Another Life. The video features Emin dreaming about being surrounded by bikini-clad Miss Universe contestants, before waking up to be lectured by Trump and told: “You’re fired.” Yulya Alferova, a businesswoman and blogger who was hired by Crocus Group to help with their social media presence at that time, arrived at the hotel that morning and met Trump shortly after the filming had finished. After a brief conversation, Trump took a shine to her, and Emin invited her to join a small group for lunch. “We talked about Twitter, and I asked him if he agreed that Twitter is the strongest and sometimes the most dangerous social media. He asked me about real estate, because I told him it’s one of my professional interests,” said Alferova, who once achieved notoriety in Russia for posting a photograph of her cat eating black caviar. Later, Trump told her that she should contact him if she was ever in New York. He had his assistant hand her a business card. But there was nothing inappropriate about his conduct, Alferova said, describing Trump as a “gentleman” who always acted “correctly and properly” in their interactions. The pageant went off without a hitch. Gabriela Isler of Venezuela was crowned the winner. An after-party was held for the contestants and friends of the organisers. There were three private boxes: one for the Agalarovs, one for Trump and one for Roustam Tariko, the chief of Russian Standard, the Russian vodka company and bank, which sponsored Miss Russia. The American band Panic! At The Disco provided the music, and contestants mingled with guests. Several were invited into the boxes to speak with Trump and the oligarchs. Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, who had performed at the ceremony, was also there. “Trump was still there when I left at 2am,” a guest at the party told the Guardian. “There were a lot of people there, it was fun but pretty civilised.” Alferova, the businesswoman and blogger, remembered multiple guests approaching Trump and asking for photographs with him. “There were no government people present and no major Forbes List people except Aras [Agalarov] and Roustam [Tariko]” said one of the organisers of the event, suggesting Trump’s boastful claims that “all the oligarchs” attended may have been false. Still, during his Moscow stay Trump also attended a private meeting with leading Russian businessmen at Nobu, the high-end Japanese restaurant chain for which Agalarov owns the Moscow franchise. The dinner was arranged by Herman Gref, Putin’s former energy minister and now chief executive of the state-owned Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank. The bank, which was another sponsor of Miss Universe, was later among the Russian companies sanctioned by the US over Russia’s annexing part of Ukraine in 2014. “He’s a sensible person, very lively in his responses, with a positive energy and a good attitude toward Russia,” Gref told Bloomberg. Agalarov has said he and Trump also met with the businessmen Alex Sapir and Rotem Rosen – Trump’s old partners on the controversial Trump Soho project in New York – to discuss opportunities in Moscow. Agalarov later said they struck an agreement in principle to go ahead. Trump seemed to think so: “TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,” he said in a thank you note to Agalarov on Twitter. Eight days later, Sberbank announced it was lending Agalarov 55bn roubles ($1.3bn) to finance new projects in Moscow. Trump Tower Moscow, like so many other Russian twinkles in Trump’s eye over the past three decades, did not materialise. But it recently emerged that the conversations continued behind the scenes even after he began his long-threatened campaign for president. In October 2015, four months into his campaign, Trump signed a “letter of intent” to build a tower in Moscow. Pulling the strings on the abortive deal was Felix Sater, yet another Russian business associate of Trump, who once served time in prison for stabbing a man in the face with a broken cocktail glass. “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” Sater reportedly told Trump’s attorney in an email. “Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it … I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this.” The future of Trump’s presidency may rest on what else was said and done relating to the project – and whether investigators who already smell blood can prove it. On at least three occasions following the Miss Universe trip, Trump had publicly claimed to have met Putin. But when asked by reporters at a campaign stop in Florida in July 2016 to clarify the status of his relationship with the Russian president, as concerns over Russian election interference mounted, Trump gave a rather different version. “I never met Putin,” said Trump. “I don’t know who Putin is.” On 4 October 2017 this article was updated to include comment provided by Mr Kaveladze.It was updated further on 11 October 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/15/open-mike-eagle-rap-chicago-social-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T16:59:58Z","webTitle":"Can rap shine a light on America's social housing crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/15/open-mike-eagle-rap-chicago-social-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/15/open-mike-eagle-rap-chicago-social-housing","fields":{"headline":"Can rap shine a light on America's social housing crisis?","bodyText":"Open Mike Eagle appears in his new music video as a masked hero named Iron Hood. His arch-nemesis is a white-collar figure swinging a baseball bat at three model buildings. These represent Chicago’s Robert Taylor Homes, the largest US public housing development before it was demolished with the false promise of 2,388 mixed-income units to replace it. “There’s a photo of the Robert Taylor Homes where the buildings are lined up in the back, and in the front and there’s a playground,” Mike says. “I kept looking at that picture. Then it popped into my head: I wanted to see that building with a head and arms.” Mike, a South Side native, remembers how imposing that complex was when he was younger: how chain-link fences enclosed the balconies, how he used to hear gunshots. But this was also where he and his parents would walk a mile to see his great-aunt and his first cousins; there was a human side to these buildings that’s rarely discussed. Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is an archaeological dig turned concept album about what Robert Taylor used to be – a home. It is as smart and empathetic as any release Open Mike Eagle has put out over the past few years, mostly material about combating the existential dread of being a black man in 2017. Mike relocated to Los Angeles and, with his 2010 debut, established what he called “art rap”. That term began a protest against how rock is treated with more critical nuance than hip-hop; today, it is its own subgenre. What separates Brick Body Kids from his past work is the lyrical territory, but also his tone. “When I was writing these songs, I didn’t feel like I had the space to laugh,” he says. This album exists because of a flight Mike had over a year ago. He was on this airplane, wondering what happened to the Robert Taylor Homes. “I just assumed that it was turned into something – was it condos?” he says. He used the airline wifi to watch several documentaries, learning that, apart from a few hundred units to replace the 4,300 demolished ones, the site is nothing but an overgrown field. Pop culture (the documentary Hoop Dreams, the book turned film There Are No Children Here, a good portion of rap music) has been kinder than public policy about recognizing the tens of thousands of people who live in public housing. Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is yet another example. The opening track, Legendary Iron Hood, comes from the perspective of a child playing pretend as a Marvel-inspired super-villain, and features guitar by Dan Miller of They Might Be Giants. Yet undergoing his transformation, this kid can’t help but notice the roaches running rampant at home – his reality. This approach to storytelling, where there isn’t any outright explanation, was inspired by the video game director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s approach to Dark Souls, the notoriously difficult fantasy role-playing game that Mike has played frequently over the past two years. “You have to use your imagination to connect the dots,” he says. Like his 2016 album Hella Personal Film Festival, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is a combination of fictional storytelling, hypothetical scenarios and personal experience. Legendary Iron Hood isn’t at all autobiographical, as listeners have been inclined to believe of most hip-hop songs, though it is rooted in emotional truth. By comparison, Brick Body Complex is Mike addressing us directly, both when he raps: “Don’t call me nigga or rapper / My motherfucking name is Michael Eagle, I’m sovereign” and when he repeats “My body is a building, a building, a building, a building” – as illustrated on the album art. Mike says: “Part of the statement for the album is about when we talk about humanizing trauma, and the hardening and horror that takes place. These buildings go up. They come down. And a lot of people don’t think about the quality of suffering that might happen to people who were in that situation. There’s a correlation there to what happens to black bodies, when black people are murdered by police. There’s a lot of people who have no empathy to that.” Mike swears up and down that any reaction to Brick Body Kids, even apathy, is valid. “That’s the risk I run by wanting to express my true range of emotions on these matters and the time we live in,” he says. The album ends with My Auntie’s Building, its most visceral and autobiographical song – one last plea to understand why this policy failure feels so personal. To static, he mutters that the demolition of Robert Taylor Homes is “the sound of them tearing my body down to the ground”. It is our hero meeting crushing defeat.

It will not do so. Sanders unveiled his Medicare for All proposal on Wednesday with the admission that it had virtually no chance of passing a Republican-controlled Congress. “Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan – a curse on the US and its people,” Trump tweeted on Thursday. “I told Republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen. But don’t worry, I will veto because I love our country and its people.” The Vermont senator shot back: “No, Mr President, providing healthcare to every man, woman and child as a right is not a curse. It’s exactly what we should be doing. “What is a curse is your support for throwing 23 million off health insurance. That’s the curse and we won’t allow you to get away with it.” Sanders formally introduced his single-player proposal with the backing of 16 Democrats, record support for a concept until recently derided as a liberal fantasy. Under his plan, Medicare – a federal health insurance program available to people 65 and older and some people with disabilities – would be expanded over four years. In the first year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 55 and access opened to children through age 18. The age of eligibility would be gradually lowered until the program was open to “every resident of the United States”. Not included is an accounting of how to pay for the program, which would radically transform the US healthcare system and economy. Sanders separately released a white paper on possible ways to pay for the bill. Trump is still fuming at Republicans for failing to fulfill seven years of promises and repeal Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act (ACA). Aboard Air Force One on Thursday, Trump blamed Senator John McCain, who felled a Republican effort to overhaul the law in a late-night vote in July. “It was a very unpleasant surprise,” Trump said. “Now we have people talking about single-payer. So Republicans have to stick together better. We had the votes.” Trump was once open to the idea of universal healthcare. In a 2015 interview with CBS, he said: “I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.” Trump admitted it was an “un-Republican” position, but said he felt strongly. Days before his inauguration in January, he told the Washington Post he wanted “insurance for everybody”. Once in office, though, he joined Republicans in pushing for the repeal of the ACA, celebrating the passage of a House Republican bill with a ceremony in the White House rose garden. Trump later called the House bill, under which an estimated 22 million people could have lost access to health insurance, “mean” and urged the Senate to draft legislation with “heart”. The Democratic leadership has yet to embrace Sanders’ plan but there is broad agreement that reforms to the ACA should expand coverage. Republicans are split on healthcare, with some wanting to tear down the entire law and others aiming to protect pieces that have helped expand coverage in their states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/15/ryan-ten-doeschate-glorious-march-essex-boys-county-championship","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T06:57:38Z","webTitle":"Wily Ryan ten Doeschate paves way for Essex boys' glorious march to the title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/15/ryan-ten-doeschate-glorious-march-essex-boys-county-championship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/15/ryan-ten-doeschate-glorious-march-essex-boys-county-championship","fields":{"headline":"Wily Ryan ten Doeschate paves way for Essex boys' glorious march to the title","bodyText":"By finishing Warwickshire off promptly on Thursday, Essex were left with a few agonising hours to kill before their first Championship title in a quarter of century was confirmed by Lancashire’s defeat to Somerset. “I want to go home and chill out,” Ryan ten Doeschate, the captain, said. “But some of the youngsters are eyeing two days in Birmingham.” The cheering from the Edgbaston dressing room, rowdier with every Somerset wicket, hinted that the youngsters had won. They were all Cidermen for the day, in more ways than one. Essex have dominated Division One on their first season back after six summers away to claim their seventh title ever – and first without Graham Gooch. The County Championship may never see a climax as exciting as 2016’s but thanks to Essex’s excellence, there has barely even been a contest – the title race is over with eight of 56 days to spare. Their win at Edgbaston was their eighth in 12 games (Middlesex won with six in 16 last year), and they are the only unbeaten side in the land. “Name me a game, I can tell you two players who have won it. Name a player and I’ll give you two games they have won for us,” Ten Doeschate said. It has, as he says, been a triumph of the collective. Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer have bossed the bowling, with more than 60 wickets each, but Essex have eight different centurions. Neil Wagner and Mohammad Amir have shared 38 wickets as overseas pro, while the third seamer’s spot has been a revolving door of young seamers from the local leagues and in the last couple of weeks, Sam has shown that two is not too many Cooks. Speaking of which, they have had the batting depth to cover for the absence of Alastair Cook and Tom Westley. Ten Doeschate is a man who believes “people make too much of a big deal out of cricket captaincy”. But he is the most resourceful and dynamic skipper on the circuit. In signing Harmer, Essex have the best spinner, too. After winning Division Two barely using spin, this was the most pressing target for Ten Doeschate and the head coach, Chris Silverwood. Providing him with the footmarks carved out by the left-arm seam bowling overseas bowlers has been a masterstroke. Besides Harmer, the best of the Kolpak signings, Ten Doeschate (the South African Dutch international who has been with the club more than a decade and describes himself as “Essex through and through”), and those overseas bowlers, everyone else is local. It is a side forged in the Essex leagues, but refined elsewhere. “That is very deliberate,” says Silverwood who, with his assistant Anthony McGrath, won the title as a player with Yorkshire in 2001. “We are passionate about homegrown players coming through. They’re all Essex boys. If you get that, you get longevity, rather than a short-term thing.” Ten Doeschate is coy about the club’s ambitions at the start of the season, but says he was desperate to dispel among his squad the “myth” of the gap between the divisions, and to land a punch for the smaller counties. By the sixth or seventh game, they believed they could win and started to plan exactly how to do so. “We had that myth in our head at the start,” he says. “I hope we’ve shown that teams coming up don’t have to go down. Another thing that’s big for me is that young players don’t have to move to Test grounds.” Those early games were an education. Dan Lawrence, who had six Championship tons before 20, had to save an opening draw against Lancashire, then Cook’s excellence saw them chase 255 – the day after 18 wickets fell – at Taunton. They escaped with a draw against Middlesex at Lord’s but, having ridden those early challenges, got on a run of five straight midsummer wins, spearheaded by Harmer, who took 14 wickets in successive matches against Warwickshire and Middlesex. Essex were promoted in 2016, the toughest season, because just one side came up. But they believe that helped, because by being forced to win the division, they had to learn how to win matches. This has not happened overnight but the upswing has been sharp. It was only in 2015, after all, that they became the first team to lose to Leicestershire in three seasons. The story of 24-year-old Porter – who has stepped into the haggard old bowling boots vacated by Graham Napier and Dave Masters, who retired last year and deserve at least an assist for this triumph – perhaps illustrates this best. After failing to make the grade as a teenager at Essex or Middlesex, as well as three years as an MCC Young Cricketer, he was working in recruitment in London as England lost the 2013-14 Ashes 5-0; this time, he is in contention to tour. He had just about given up on a career in the game but after a fine start to the 2014 season for Chingford he got a trial with Essex seconds. “I quit my job after one second-team game which was a bit rogue,” he says with the grin of a man who knows he will never have to go back. “One of the old sales bosses told me there’s always a job there if I need it – I remember thinking I’d look like a right muppet if I asked for my job back by the end of the week! I had enough savings to get me through the summer so I gave it one last go and here we are.” Talk to any of the movers and shakers, and the subject shifts to legacy, of an era of Porter, Lawrence and Westley. Club legends Brian “Tonker” Taylor and Doug Insole have died during the course of this campaign, while Keith Fletcher and Gooch were vital in the development of many of these players, and remain close to the team. Indeed, a former player is never far away at Chelmsford, a ramshackle ground where Essex are supported loudly and proudly, always with half an eye on history. “Everyone talks about the Fletcher era, and Gooch,” says Silverwood. “Well, what I’m saying to these guys is I’d love them to be talking about this era in 20 years time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/15/premier-inn--ethical-trade-body-unite-union-whitbread","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T10:49:40Z","webTitle":"Premier Inn owner quits ethical trade body after union row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/15/premier-inn--ethical-trade-body-unite-union-whitbread","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/15/premier-inn--ethical-trade-body-unite-union-whitbread","fields":{"headline":"Premier Inn owner quits ethical trade body after union row","bodyText":"The owner of Costa Coffee, Premier Inn and Brewers Fayre has pulled out of the UK’s ethical trade body after a spat with the Unite union over recognition of British workers. The union said attempts to gain access to workers at Whitbread’s Premier Inn chain, in line with core principles of the Ethical Trading Initiative, which is backed by unions, human rights charities such as Oxfam and companies including Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and WH Smith, were at first ignored. It said Whitbread then argued that the ETI’s code on freedom of association did not apply to its direct employees in the UK. A spokesperson for Whitbread would not give a reason for its withdrawal from the ETI, just over a year after joining, but said it had “an open policy towards our employees belonging to a union”. “Our employees are completely free to talk to a union, to discuss trade unions in the workplace and to invite a union representative to join them at formal meetings. We have a number of unionised team members who are affiliated with a range of different unions,” the company said. In a letter to Whitbread’s chief executive, Alison Brittain, Unite said that the company’s “commitments and obligations” on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining “are not currently being met in any practical sense”. It said: “Unite had high hopes that Whitbread’s membership of the ETI would open the doors to better working conditions and improved union relations in the notoriously anti-union and exploitative UK hospitality industry as the ETI base code, which is founded on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, includes the right to freedom of association and to bargain collectively. “But our attempts at meaningful negotiation with the company were ignored. We had sought to secure a union access agreement which would have allowed union officials to meet with workers to the benefits of trade union membership and the company’s own human rights policy.” Whitbread said it was “a leader in responsible sourcing within the hospitality industry” and remained “100% committed to ensuring ethical and sustainable practice across our global supply chain”. “Since we joined the ETI in 2016, we have been subject to false allegations from Unite about our employment practices, specifically around our policy towards union membership, and Unite allege that we do not comply with the ETI base code. This is untrue and the ETI have confirmed that we met our obligations as a foundation stage member,” the company said. Peter McAllister, the executive director of the ETI, said: “Like any new member there is a period where we work through what our expectations are and the company’s priorities, based on supply chain needs and tackling relevant issues. We therefore regret that Whitbread chose to leave ETI so soon after joining. “We will continue to try to find ways of working with leading companies and unions to support ethical conditions for vulnerable workers in the UK hospitality sector.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/blog/2017/sep/16/is-it-worth-getting-garden-office-25000","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Is it worth getting a garden office?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2017/sep/16/is-it-worth-getting-garden-office-25000","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/blog/2017/sep/16/is-it-worth-getting-garden-office-25000","fields":{"headline":"Is it worth getting a garden office?","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.

It’s a 70-metre diameter radio telescope, the largest in the southern hemisphere, and on this cold Canberra Friday night, red lights were flashing to signify it was sending data to one of the space missions it monitored. It was the Cassini probe – for the final time. DSS43 is located at the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC). It’s a Nasa site run by Australia’s scientific research organisation, the CSIRO, nestled in a valley in Tidbinbilla, a treacherously kangaroo-filled 45-minute drive from the nation’s capital. The public are rarely permitted beyond the cafe and visitor’s centre, but this was a very special night. Thirty people had been chosen via application to be present for the end of the almost 20-year odyssey of the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn, which ended just before 10pm (AEST) on Friday with the spacecraft plunging into the atmosphere of the giant planet. There it will be vapourised into its constituent atoms, a decision made by Nasa to avoid the threat of the probe and its radioactive power source crashing and potentially contaminating one of Saturn’s moons – and the life that looks increasingly possible thereon. I’ve been following this mission since the beginning. My late father and I had been captivated by the Voyager missions of 1977, which took the first ever close-up photographs of Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, although he was very sick by the time Voyager 2 sent back images of Uranus in 1986 and was gone before the first images of Neptune arrived in 1989. But Saturn fascinated us both. Dad, like many scientists at the time, was convinced that if we were to find life anywhere else in the solar system, it would be on the massive Saturnian moon of Titan. So when Nasa and the European Space Agency announced a joint mission to Saturn (Cassini) incorporating the ESA’s Huygens lander that would reach the surface of Titan, I knew I’d be paying close attention on Dad’s behalf. I scoured the media in pre-internet 1997 for information about the launch. I greedily devoured every detail about the long journey to Saturn via gravity swing-bys of Venus, Earth and Jupiter. I marvelled at the science Cassini did: the discovery of seven new moons, the mapping of Saturn’s rings, the discovery of methane oceans on Titan and the shocking discovery of water geysers on Enceladus – suggesting another potential site for biological life. And years later, a chance meeting with a holidaying member of Nasa’s imaging team meant I got a peek at the freshly-received pictures sent from Cassini the previous day. Even without processing, they were stunningly beautiful. Saturn is the Cate Blanchett of the solar system: it’s simply impossible to take a bad picture. Everyone I talked to on Friday evening – postgraduates, schoolteachers, science educators, space nerds like myself who are slightly confused as to why they made the cut – has a similar story about how Cassini captured their imagination. Our phones had all been switched off since arriving on site, as the signals the four telescopes received were far fainter than the pings of a cellphone trying to find a tower. There’s no reception in this valley in any case, for that very reason. The celebration of Cassini’s fiery death began with a tour of the CDSCC site, including a tour of the telescopes and the command centre, a walk about the tiny-but-amazing visitor’s centre (which includes a chunk of volcanic basalt, the only piece of moon rock on display outside the US) and presentations from Nasa and CSIRO staff. For an audience of space science obsessives, it was wonderful stuff. A little after 8.30pm, there was a (non-alcoholic) toast to Cassini. In real time, the probe was entering Saturn’s atmosphere. Saturn was about 1.5bn kilometres from Earth at this point in our orbits so the radio transmissions from Cassini, travelling at the speed of light, were still taking just over 83 minutes to get to us. When the data arrived, it would be a ghost of a robot that hadn’t existed for more than an hour. The mood to this point had been one of excitement but there was now a subtle shift. Even the CDSCC staff, who make it a point not to get emotional – in contrast to their more excitable colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California – were starting to get choked up. Half an hour before the signal was due to vanish, the skies above the complex cleared and everyone trooped outside to where the DSS43 was pointed at Saturn, which looked like an unusually bright star in the western sky. By this point, the data of the final transmission had passed the orbit of Jupiter and was heading towards that of Mars. We then went back in to await the inevitable. At 9.53pm AEST, as predicted, there was a wobble in the hitherto-stable X radio band. It jumped around for a few seconds, and then went dead. A few seconds later, the stronger S radio transmission did the same, and contact was officially lost. Of course, by this time Cassini was nothing but a mist of atoms floating among the swirling cloud tops of Saturn, but the effect in the room was like seeing a heart monitor flatline. There was a deep intake of breath, and then silence. No one made eye contact. We were told California’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had grief counsellors on site for staff, some of whom had dedicated decades to the mission. I could see why. On the displays showing the status of the four telescopes on site, DSS34 and DSS36 continued to communicate with the far-off Voyager 2 probe. DSS43 and DSS53 were silent. As we walked out into the frigid night air, DSS43 was gently moving into position for its next assignment. Saturn still shone bright in the sky."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/20/chicano-batman-los-angeles-latin-soul","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"Chicano Batman: 'We’re four Latinos breaking into rock music and succeeding'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/20/chicano-batman-los-angeles-latin-soul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/20/chicano-batman-los-angeles-latin-soul","fields":{"headline":"Chicano Batman: 'We’re four Latinos breaking into rock music and succeeding'","bodyText":"“The first time people come out to see us, they just stare the whole time,” says Chicano Batman’s bass player, Eduardo Arenas, as he sits in the band’s practice space on the outskirts of Los Angeles. “The same people come back a second time to try to understand what they just saw. Some places we go people have never seen this shit before.” You may be forgiven for cutting confused Chicano Batman first-timers a bit of slack. Chicano Batman aren’t your typical rock band. Four Latinos from the LA area and beyond (drummer Gabriel Villa is from Cali, Colombia), they’ve developed a cult following in the city with their “LA Tropicalia” blend of soulful music lifted from all over Central and South America. It’s a tradition that beyond a few choice compilations is far less explored than its North American equivalent. That’s something they want to change. “We’re trying to bring something that’s from our heritage,” says singer Bardo Martínez. “Everyone knows that black people have the funk and soul, but we’ve got that too. In the 70s in Latin America people were getting funky and getting down. We’re showing people that that exists.” Dubbed “LA’s house band”, the group have been well-respected locally for the best part of a decade, but they gained national attention after a support slot for Jack White, which led to them being signed by ATO Records – home to the Alabama Shakes. Their 2016 album Freedom Is Free saw them team up with producer Leon Michels, who has worked with everyone from the Arcs to Lee Fields and been sampled by Jay-Z. His recording approach – analog equipment, recording to tape – gave the group the feel of the classic groups they were inspired by. They have a revivalist feel, but instead of classic R&amp;B and blues they take their cues from Latino groups as well. Aesthetically, they look like the Peruvian pop group Los Pasteles Verdes or Los Angeles Negros, the 70s Chilean band who made their name with lovelorn ballads – all ruffled shirts and pastel-coloured three-piece suits. Their name came from Martínez and is a reference to a certain comic book character, but was also inspired by the bat-like symbol of Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers movement, which fought for labourers’ rights in California. “It’s not our intention to be political, it’s just where we’re at,” says Arenas. “Creating a song that talks about your environment that’s just as timeless as any love song,” adds Martínez. “For this particular record the intention wasn’t to have a ‘political record’, the intention was to have truthful songs.” But the band have become de facto spokesmen for Latinos in rock in LA, a city that they say doesn’t always recognise its Latino population despite it accounting for around half its citizens. “It really upsets me when I watch Judd Apatow movies – they are really funny movies – they all take place in LA but you don’t see Latinos in them,” says guitarist Carlos Arévalo. “It’s a fictional LA. It’s the LA that you see in all movies with only white people in it or maybe a few black characters, but you never see Latinos and we’re such a big part of the city. We’re everywhere in the city and part of being in this band is about raising our identity.” “We’re four Latinos breaking through in a market of rock music and succeeding,” adds Arenas. “That’s the face of immigration or migration or however you want to call it. That shifts a lot of people’s preconceived notion of the status quo and that feels good.” Being accepted in the indie rock world and becoming visible in it is something the group value. They may shy away from overt politics but being visible and showing other Latinos that they can succeed in what is still a very white world inspires them. “I grew in the Inland Empire and I would always go to LA to see shows,” says Arévalo. “No matter what band I was seeing I’d say around 40% of the crowd was Latino. I’ve seen so many groups and I’ve seen us in the crowd but I wasn’t seeing us on the stage. When people see us on stage it’s something really meaningful.” “I felt the same way when I first saw the Mars Volta,” he continues. “They were the first guys I saw on the stage who looked like me and they were making really cool music. It wasn’t some pop Latin stuff, it was something I could identify with and I feel that people are having that same reaction with us. It means a lot.” “I remember being young and being into metal, and I’d go to Hollywood to check out metal bands,” adds Arenas. “There’s a band called God Forbid and half of them were black and from New Jersey, and I was like ‘whaaaaat, this is insane’. Sepultura – when I found out they were Brazilian and not white – I was like ‘we can do this shit too’.” That pan-Latino approach, political edge and reverence for forgotten sounds has given them a cross-generational appeal. Martínez recently told an anecdote about being stopped while crossing the street in east LA dressed in his full-ruffled regalia by an older Latino gentleman who simply nodded in approval. “We’re not only reaching out to the older people who have this nostalgic value about what they hear, but we’re also reaching out to their children and grandchildren,” says Arenas. “I would love to hear young Latinos playing the music we’re playing,” adds Martínez. “It has the dynamics for creating music and songs which touch people.” Freedom is Free is out now on ATO Records; the band begin an extensive US tour this week"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/15/northampton-bath-premiership-rugby-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T21:04:04Z","webTitle":"Northampton get their big guns firing to overpower lacklustre Bath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/15/northampton-bath-premiership-rugby-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/15/northampton-bath-premiership-rugby-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Northampton get their big guns firing to overpower lacklustre Bath","bodyText":"Two wins from three - and here a bonus point, to boot. What, Northampton must be thinking, is all the fuss about? The jury waits. Such a summary glosses over the indignity of the one defeat – the humiliation, really – but consecutive wins over the two biggest names in English rugby is enough to be getting on with, should it be felt that rebuilding were required. “You remember what people say,” said Jim Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby. “You read things, and it hurts. We needed a reaction last week and got it. This week we’ve shown we’re a difficult team to beat.” Still a way to go, then, if they have designs on the kind of trophies they have developed a taste for. This was scarcely a swaggering display by potential champions, owing more to brute force and the capitulation of a Bath side battered by injury than to any subtlety or wit. Bath finished, for the third game in a row, with 14 men. This time it proved too much. Sam Underhill, who was having a superb match in defence, Bath’s sole positive, was knocked out by his 23rd tackle, in the 68th minute. Because it was an open and shut case of concussion, he was not eligible for a head injury assessment (if he hadn’t been knocked out, he would have been), so Bath were unable to bring on a replacement, having used all of their bench. Substituted players can return only in the event of an HIA or blood. Todd Blackadder, the Bath director of rugby, queried the logic afterwards. This was not Bath’s night, losing Matt Garvey, their captain, and Kahn Fotuali’i on the half-hour to an ever-growing list of injured. Coincidentally or not, they lost their way thereafter. For large parts, the game meandered dispiritingly, one side, Bath, simply unable to secure any possession, largely because of a line-out that was picked apart by Northampton’s jumpers, while the other struggled to hold on to the copious amounts of ball they won. Such is the Saints’ muscularity, though, the sheer weight of the wave after wave of attack eventually took its toll. Dave Ribbans, the new South African lock, had a fabulous match, scoring tries either side of half-time and galloping around the park as if he were as fleet-footed as any of Northampton’s backs, which for the most part he was. But not as fleet-footed as Tom Collins. The young winger looks tiny among Northampton’s gargantuan back division but is becoming one of the stars of the season. He sparked the Saints’ first try, dashing blind to slip a pass to Courtney Lawes. Lawes had another great game after his return to form the week before and here extended his considerable frame to score out of Fotuali’i’s tackle. A pair of penalties by Rhys Priestland actually edged Bath in front just past the half-hour, and Northampton looked frustrated. But a penalty to the corner on the stroke of half-time was driven by the home team, and Ribbans burst through the retreating Bath defence to score Northampton’s second, Harry Mallinder converting from the touchline. The Saints’ three towering points of reference, their two locks and Lawes, were having blinders. Both locks had enjoyed gallops as well as dominance in the line-out, and Ribbans was off again early in the second half. Then he scored his second, Lawes pinching a line-out and Luther Burrell breaking through the midfield for Ribbans to crash through what was left of Bath’s fractured defence. Underhill was led from the field in the final quarter, and with him went Bath’s hopes of recovering the 17-6 deficit they were facing at the time. With five minutes remaining, Northampton made the extra man pay. Their heavy runners became too much, and quick hands from Burrell and, particularly Mallinder, put George North over in the corner. The win moves them to fourth for now, some position from which to be in a crisis, but at the top sit champions Exeter, who have recovered from defeat on the opening weekend themselves to record a second bonus-point win in a row, this one at Worcester, where they won 41-10. London Irish, though, have been unable to build on their successful return to the Premiership, suffering a second consecutive defeat on the road. Sale scored five tries to beat them 36-7 at the AJ Bell Stadium.

Defoe, Bournemouth and Howe have come a long way since those days, when they were knocking around in the third tier, yet they badly needed this victory to ease the tension that was creeping into these parts after four successive league defeats. For a brief period it looked as though that sequence would be extended to five after Solly March headed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in front early in the second half but two goals in six minutes turned the game on its head. Defoe and Andrew Surman were the scorers but it was Jordon Ibe who provided the most influential contribution by coming off the bench to set up both goals at a time when Bournemouth were crying out for some craft and guile to break down a resolute Brighton defence. Remarkably Ibe never had an assist to his name in his previous 28 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth – a statistic that spells out just what a struggle it has been for him since moving south from Liverpool for £15m last year. Not that a lack of confidence appeared to be a problem when he came on midway through the second half. It was an exquisite backheel that set Surman free for the midfielder’s first Premier League goal for the club and a wonderfully weighted pass that released Defoe for the second to bring a smile to Howe’s face after a testing few weeks. “I’m very relieved,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I think that is the emotion. It is pure relief for everyone connected with the club. At the start of the season you’re desperate to hit the ground running and get off to a good start – that hasn’t happened. We had to dig really deep tonight, that was a real test for us and thankfully the players came through it. “It would have been easy to go under. I think that’s the most impressive thing about tonight’s win – we did it the hard way. We went 1-0 down and I’m sure the players were looking at each other and thinking: ’How are we going to respond here?’ Full credit to them and it maybe took Jordon’s cameo to spark that revival.” Up until that point Bournemouth had rarely looked like scoring as they ran out of ideas as to how to find a way through the massed ranks of yellow shirts that were content to sit deep and frustrate their opponents. Too many passes went sideways rather than forwards until Ibe’s introduction gave Bournemouth a new dimension. “Jordon showed real quality in the final third,” said Howe. “His backheel was a moment of magic – that was the first time we really opened Brighton up – and then the weight of pass was so good for Jermain. Full credit to him for his impact. He’s a player of immense promise. I feel the same as a lot of other people I’m sure, that you underestimate how young he is because it feels he’s been around a long time. But I think he’s come back a better player than he was last season. Hopefully this is the start of a real lift for him.” Chris Hughton admitted that he thought his Brighton side would go on and win the game when March converted a superb cross from Pascal Gross, who has been involved in all four of their goals this season. That breakthrough had been coming after a spell of Brighton pressure in which Surman cleared two headers off the line, from Shane Duffy and Davy Pröpper, and Dale Stephens nodded another chance against the crossbar. On top and in front, Brighton were in command for a spell but unable to see the game through. “You’ve got to be resilient right until the end,” said Hughton, who hopes that the knee injury Gross picked up late in the second half is not serious. “I thought we defended really well for large periods but the two times we didn’t was on their goals and that’s a tough lesson for us.” Indeed from the moment that Ibe’s pass ran into Defoe’s path there was a sense of inevitably about what would follow. “He’s one of the best finishers I’ve ever seen,” Howe said. “The disappointing thing for us this season is that we haven’t created enough chances for him. That was the first real chance that he got and he took it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/16/resistance-now-edith-windsor-gay-rights-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T12:00:11Z","webTitle":"The Resistance Now: activists call for action as they mourn Edith Windsor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/16/resistance-now-edith-windsor-gay-rights-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/16/resistance-now-edith-windsor-gay-rights-activists","fields":{"headline":"The Resistance Now: activists call for action as they mourn Edith Windsor","bodyText":"Edith Windsor and the fight for same sex marriage The “resistance” lost one of its inspiring figures this week with the death of Edith Windsor, a hero of the gay rights movement who died on Tuesday at age 88. The Guardian’s Molly Redden was at a service for Windsor held in New York city on Friday afternoon, where those paying their respects included Hillary Clinton, and she sent us this dispatch: With quavering voices, hundreds of family, friends, and supporters gathered on to celebrate Edith Windsor. They were also feeling political. When Roberta Kaplan, the litigator who argued Windsor’s landmark gay rights case before the US supreme court, said her passing was a reminder to “redouble our efforts to resist”, the word went out like a shockwave, drawing applause and cheers. Known to friends as “Edie”, Windsor was the lead plaintiff in the US supreme court case that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act and paved the way for the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015. Those gathered inside Temple Emanu-El on the Upper East Side remembered her as an electric companion whose 4ft 11in frame could barely contain her verve. The weight of Windsor’s political legacy was heavy in the room – most of all when Hillary Clinton approached the podium to standing applause. Without naming the current president, Clinton recast Windsor’s legacy as an exemplar for those countering the Trump administration’s assaults on LGBT rights. “There wasn’t a cynical or defeatist bone in Edie’s body,” Clinton said. “That’s especially important for us to remember now. We owe it to her to ensure that gay rights are human rights and human rights remain gay rights forever … It is easy for us to grow weary of these fights, but remember Edie, who took on and won the US government. Our work is not done.” Moments later, Kaplan echoed Clinton’s message. After warmly recounting that Windsor lived by two maxims – “never delay joy” and “keep it hot” – Windsor’s friend and attorney charged the congregation with taking up her legacy. “No human gets to complete the dream of liberation,” Kaplan said. “Edie did not see her work as finished, and neither should we.” Windsor married Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007, after the pair had been together for 40 years. Two years later Spyer died, and the IRS ordered Windsor to pay $363,000 in estate taxes, as the federal government did not recognise the pair’s marriage, prompting her legal battle. “Even during her final weeks, she was a flirt,” working her charms on the doctors, nurses and cleaning staff who cycled out of her room, said Karen Sauvigne, one of Windsor’s longtime friends. In the hospital, Sauvigne said, Windor charmed a nurse into painting her nails “so that she died with a fresh manicure”. ‘We will win this struggle’ Bernie Sanders unveiled his long-awaited universal healthcare bill on Wednesday, promising that America would eventually adopt the sort of healthcare system that the majority of other developed countries take for granted. Sanders’ plan would transition the current system to a “Medicare for All” program, funded by an increase in taxes, that would see every American insured. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, but in a sign that times are changing, it is gaining backers at a pace. There are 15 Democratic senators who have backed the bill, including rumored 2020 presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Al Franken. ICP to DC Washington DC’s national mall will be filled with clowns and Donald Trump supporters on Saturday, when fans of the band Insane Clown Posse gather to protest the FBI, and fans of the president gather to cheer on the commander-in-chief.

They’ve profoundly altered how we interact, express ourselves and frame our identities – and that’s just for starters. While in many cases these changes have been for the better, in others, Silicon Valley’s sleek aesthetics and fancy buzzwords have turned out to mask new forms of profiteering, surveillance and control. If we want digital technologies to be a force for good, it’s crucial to understand what’s at stake – not least for regulators, politicians and policymakers. Fortunately, we already have a fictional form that can help us do just that: the humble videogame. I’m aware that this claim might sound dubious. People tend to think of gaming as a harmless waste of time at best – or, if you’re Keith Vaz, a perniciously addictive, troublingly violent waste of time. At the moment each day seems to yield fresh evidence that “gamer culture” is awash with misogyny, racism (hello, Pewdiepie) and homophobia – hardly utopian impulses. But while gaming’s iffy reputation is far from undeserved, the good news is that games are also evolving into a medium uniquely equipped to help us grapple with the impact of new technologies. More than just being a forum for stories about digital life, videogames offer a means of understanding how computers perceive reality – and how they’re reshaping it. This isn’t to claim that all videogames are interested in telling stories; nor is it to assert that games are somehow innately superior to, say, novels or TV shows. In fact, if you’re looking for elegantly plotted narratives about plausible, relatable, psychologically complex characters, you’re still largely better off looking away from your PlayStation. The thing is, computers don’t see the world in these terms. They deal in calculation and classification, ifs and thens, ones and zeroes. The novel emerged at a time when Enlightenment humanism and bourgeois capitalism were making stories about ambitious individuals shaping their own fates newly resonant; film emerged in tandem with Freudian psychoanalysis and Fordist mass production, developing into an industrial artform offering dreamlike projections of shared fantasies and phobias. Videogames, meanwhile, are the product of a postwar culture shaped by cybernetics and systems theory, a culture where we’ve come to see everything from urban planning to armed conflict to consciousness in terms of networks, flow charts and feedback loops. Of course, there are plenty of novels, movies, plays and TV shows that have addressed this shift in illuminating ways; and of course, games borrow liberally from these – and many other – cultural forms. It’s the way that they integrate what they’ve borrowed into rule-bound virtual worlds that makes them special, though. Naturally, these attempts at integration don’t always go smoothly. But in many cases, games are able to capture the texture of digital life precisely because they’re full of kludges and compromises, lurches into the uncanny valley and awkwardly repurposed cliches. Ours is a culture that has enthusiastically embraced new technologies even as it clings to ways of understanding the world that are inherited from movies and myths, Descartes, Freud and Marx. An omnivorous, giddily promiscuous medium, videogames reflect the resulting friction. In recent years, a series of games have appeared that tackle digital experience head on, often presenting players with scaled-down caricatures of systems and interfaces we use every day.

Try Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris’ sci-fi satire Redshirt, which foregrounds the insidiousness of Facebook’s “like” economy by having the player scheme and flatter their way off a doomed space station via a social media site. Concerned about the internet’s role in the lives of today’s teens? Nina Freeman’s Cibele, Accidental Queens’ A Normal Lost Phone and Christine Love’s Don’t Take it Personally, Babe, It Just Ain’t Your Story all address what it’s like to come of age online. Lucas Pope’s justly lauded Papers, Please casts players as a passport inspector in a fictional eastern bloc state. Set in the 1980s, it speaks nonetheless to our post-9/11 age of travel bans, mass migration and biometric checkpoints, examining the modern political issues of data mining and demographic profiling. And what about online privacy, or the future of work? Robert Yang’s brilliant sexting simulator Cobra Club uses NSFW selfies to raise issues of online visibility and consent, impishly breaking the fourth wall to denounce government surveillance. All these examples were made by avant-garde, indie and DIY developers working alone or in small studios. They’re less about playing to win than spending time in intelligently crafted storyworlds inhabited by engaging characters. But it would also be wrong to conclude that more conventional, commercial games are devoid of things to say about technology or novel ways of saying them. Titles such as Forbidden Siren 2, Bioshock 2: Minerva’s Den, Alien: Isolation and Nier: Automata all lean on gaming’s staples: shooting and sneaking, looting and levelling up. But they also draw imaginatively on Gothic fiction and sci-fi cinema to make unexpectedly shrewd points about identity, memory and machine intelligence. The postmodern conspiracy thriller Killer 7 puts a paranoid spin on the notion of a “networked world” by scattering clues, puzzles and red herrings across deviously configured levels broken into systems of hubs and spokes. The horror game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories raises questions about algorithmic pigeonholing by profiling the player and tailoring its scares to their personality type. Inevitably, there are moments in these games when the obligation to provide challenges and rewards gets in the way of telling a coherent story. But their “gameness” is also an integral part of how they communicate. And even the least imaginative games can end up inadvertently calling the promise of the digital into question, simply by overreaching themselves or failing to work as advertised. Problems with gesture-, voice- and face-recognition systems, for example, have given gamers a better understanding of how computers are learning to see us, hear us, and read our movements. By struggling to register certain accents, body types and skin colours, these devices show how supposedly objective technologies reflect and entrench racial biases and cultural blindspots. With the arrival of the iPhone X, and mass awareness of facial recognition, gamers will once again be ahead of the curve. For the most part, the games I’ve discussed don’t take themselves too seriously. They’re content to be sweet, schlocky, goofy or slyly self-referential, foregoing the naked bids for profundity we expect of “serious” works of fiction. They tend to focus on specific issues, platforms and experiences rather than trying to make sweeping statements about digital culture in general. Cumulatively, though, they show how, almost by accident, game designers have developed an expressive vocabulary tailor-made for playfully interrogating our relationship with digital systems and devices. Whereas linear media is good at twists of fate and tragic ironies, it should be no surprise that games tend to be more convincing when they allow for exploration and experimentation, trial and error. As vehicles for traditional stories, videogames still leave much to be desired. But as spaces where we can get to grips with the technologies transforming our world, they already deserve your attention – and that of the powers that be. Traditionally, the authorities have met new technologies with a mix of kneejerk overreaction and myopic refusal to think things through. If you want this to change, your duty is clear: write to your MP and demand that they play more videogames. • Dr Rob Gallagher is a postdoctoral research associate at King’s College London and the author of Videogames, Identity and Digital Subjectivity (Routledge)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/15/social-housing-grenfell-london-modernist-estates","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T18:24:31Z","webTitle":"Look at Grenfell and recall when social housing was beloved | Deborah Orr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/social-housing-grenfell-london-modernist-estates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/social-housing-grenfell-london-modernist-estates","fields":{"headline":"Look at Grenfell and recall when social housing was beloved","bodyText":"On Thursday, as the inquiry into the Grenfell fire was formally opened, I took a poignant architectural tour of London. A group of us rode in a Routemaster bus round five of Britain’s most important modernist buildings, most of them landmarks in the history of social housing. And, yes, this country’s mid-20th century social housing masterpieces tend to cluster in the capital, Sheffield’s Park Hill estate being a significant exception. Why? London had the blitz. It had the émigré architects. It had, as ever, cash. This tour, organised by the Gentlewoman magazine, was led by Joe Kerr, an academic and bus driver, and titled Glimpses of the Future. Those glimpses of the future, as Kerr was assiduous in reminding us, are in the past. Some aspects of them are, anyway. Our first stop was the Boundary Estate in the East End. It’s the world’s oldest municipal housing project, completed in 1900, and built to replace a slum considered the most notorious in the city. Twenty elegant redbrick housing blocks, built in the arts and crafts style, radiate from a central hill, created from the site’s rubble. A circular path, accessed by four broad sets of steps, runs round the mound, halfway up, affording good views of the terraced gardens on either side. At the top, there’s a Japanese-style bandstand, where concerts were given for the residents. The Boundary Estate is a Grade II-listed monument to William Morris’s belief that beauty should be accessible to all. It was controversial in its day. Detractors argued that by giving attractive homes and free entertainment to poor people, do-gooders would destroy their motivation to work. It’s a familiar argument. What’s more, this was being said of the respectable poor, the “working aristocracy”, to use Kerr’s term. The original inhabitants had been dispersed from the area. The utopian vision of the Boundary Estate’s progenitors had its limits. Records suggest that only 11 out of many hundreds were rehoused in the estate that was built over their neighbourhood. Gentrification is nothing new. The next building was one I had never heard of, Bevin Court. Designed by Berthold Lubetkin, it was supposed to have been called Lenin Court, after the Russian revolutionary. He had lived on the site during 1902-3 in a building that was destroyed in the second world war. A memorial bust of Lenin had been placed there in 1942, but it was so regularly defaced by fascists that it needed a 24-hour guard and was eventually removed. Vandals were still daubing antisemitic insults on the memorial in 1945, after the evil of Auschwitz was well known. No doubt they would still be doing it today if its plinth hadn’t been incorporated into Bevin Court’s foundations. The name was changed, for the obvious reason that communist fervour had fallen into abeyance by 1954. The block is unfussily attractive from the outside. Inside, however, there’s a breathtaking constructivist staircase, which spirals up and up, offering a new and more expansive view of the city with every storey. It was built not just to be used but also to be cherished, a magnificent secret for its residents to share. Camden’s time of bold idealism came later, its apotheosis being the Alexandra and Ainsworth Estate. The back of the longest terrace in London will be familiar to people who travel by train between London and Glasgow on the west coast line out of Euston. From the rail tracks, it looks strange: a concrete, upside-down ziggurat that hangs out towards the tracks, with occasional tiny windows. On that side, it protects residents from the noise. From the front, one sees a sinuous, pedestrian street, each side six storeys high but, thanks to the generous rake, looking much less. It’s hard to believe, looking at the two sides, that the building is the same. Each home has a balcony that’s open to the sky. Every other layer has a built-in plant trough, generally utilised with enthusiasm. Cars are parked and rubbish accumulated in a layer hidden from sight underneath. It’s lovely to see a residential street without vehicles, where children play unhindered. The estate was conceived by its architect, Neave Brown, as an alternative to the little-box tower blocks that surround it. When it was completed, over time and over budget, Ken Livingstone, then chair of housing for Camden council, launched an inquiry. That was in 1978, just before Margaret Thatcher came to power and the dream of social housing with ambition died. Nevertheless, the Alexandra and Ainsworth was the first of Britain’s postwar estates to be listed. It’s bold and exotic and wonderful. It was an abject thing that the hopes and aspirations of modernism were squandered so carelessly. In the wake of Grenfell, the missed opportunities and the lost achievements are almost impossibly painful to think about. Each one of these developments was mocked in its day. Only time and lived experience transformed each of them into beloved and coveted places to live. The follies of humans are legion. • Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 18 September 2017. An earlier version referred to the “west coast line out of King’s Cross”.

The treasure trove of tree growth data dating from the 1930s was found by the biologist Koen Hufkens in a tumbledown building at the Yangambi Biological Station, which was once Africa’s leading forest and agriculture research institution. Combined with other records, the recovered data allows Hufkens to make improved predictions about the health of the forest. Hufkens, of Ghent University in Belgium, began researching the Congo Basin about five years ago. He had planned to install a high tech monitoring station known as a carbon flux tower in Yangambi. The instruments are indispensable for observing the way plant life responds to climate change and have become standard gear for studying forests in North America and Europe, as well as a handful of locations in the Amazon Jungles such as the Congo forest play a critical part in controlling the rate of global warming; vegetation sucks up about 25% of the carbon dioxide we spew out of our tailpipes and smokestacks. Scientists believe much of this CO2 ends up stored in the trunks of tropical trees, with the Congo’s trees sequestering 250bn tonnes alone. But research shows the tropical carbon sink is faltering. This means CO2 will build up faster in the atmosphere and temperatures will rise more quickly. Scientists are working to understand better how tropical forests respond to shifts in rainfall. The Congo forest, second only to the Amazon in size, is particularly hard to study. Poor infrastructure, unstable governments and civil war have hindered systematic research. But understanding the Congo is important – it appears to be drying out, and it is hard to say how it will behave in a drier climate. Hufkens was hired by a research team to install the first tower in the Congo Basin, but the project soon ran out of funds. Undaunted, Hufkens looked for other ways to examine how the forest responds to changes in rainfall. A colleague mentioned the neglected notebooks from the middle of the last century, still on the shelf in Yangambi’s herbarium. In 2013, Hufkens flew to Yangambi and made copies of the old notebooks and annual summaries. He arrived just in time. The herbarium’s roof was caving in and the documents were already exposed to incessant rains, leaving them water-stained. Rodents had gnawed on some of them. But Hufkens was delighted. The collection contained weekly observations of 2,000 trees between 1937 and 1958. Technicians had meticulously noted when trees flowered, fruited, dropped fruit and lost leaves. The archive was a treasure, but there was a serious problem. The hand-written notations could not easily be digitised for statistical analysis. Up to 100,000 observations needed to be transcribed tediously into a spreadsheet. Hufkens estimated it would take him a full year, more time than he had for the work. In 2015 Hufkens stumbled across Zooniverse, a website for enlisting online volunteers to help scientists perform the necessary but tedious tasks that research often requires. Through the site, 1.5 million volunteers have helped classify galaxies, transcribe old ship logs and identify individual whales by their flukes. Hufkens digitally sliced up the scans he had made in Yangambi into thousands of matchbook-size photos, each containing a year’s information from a single tree. Volunteers on the site examined one photo at a time. In a matter of seconds they could transcribe the visual information into a form that could later be assembled into a complete data set. About 8,000 volunteers worked an average of 90 seconds per visit, perhaps on the bus to work or during TV commercials. Altogether the anonymous helpers contributed the equivalent of three years of full-time work. Hufkens had each image processed 10 times, by 10 distinct volunteers. They had multiplied the effort required, but reduced the error rate to near zero. After just over a year, the virtual team finished processing the huge collection last March and Hufkens is now correlating tree behaviour with Yangambi’s weather records. The European Union has recently authorised a grant to finally erect the longed-for flux tower at Yangambi, but it will take years for researchers to gather enough data to draw any conclusions. By relying on the kindness of strangers, however, Hufkens is already a long way toward predicting the Congo forest’s future. This story was updated on 25 September 2017 to correct a numerical error. The trees of the Congo forest do not absorb 250bn tonnes of carbon annually; this is the amount of carbon stored in their wood.

The images from Kensington shocked the world, but the huge scale of the problem was revealed by the sheer number of blocks with similar concerns when the government carried out fire safety checks on cladding samples submitted from other tower blocks across England. After the collapse of the 22-storey Ronan Point block in 1968 due to a gas explosion, new building regulations were brought in to make construction safer in tower blocks. But in August, four blocks in the Ledbury estate in Peckham, south London, were evacuated after Southwark council admitted it could not be sure the buildings – which were built at the same time as Ronan Point – had, in fact, been strengthened. Architect Douglas Murphy says outsourcing and complex supply chains make safety difficult to delegate. “In just a couple of generations the construction industry has become far more complex, with a far greater number of different components inside our buildings, all made by different contractors and suppliers,” he says. Murphy says this has made it harder for anyone to look after the quality of any housing project as a whole: “Contracts that favour immediate ‘value for money’ over anything else mean that quality can be extremely low once the initial shine wears off.” For years, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) has called for better guidance on fire safety – echoing Murphy’s concerns about the loss of a lead architect to supervise projects from start to finish. In particular, the RIBA warns that when buildings are being renovated, separate fire-proof compartments must be maintained. This was a huge problem at Grenfell. Architects know how to prevent fires spreading, but need regulations to force developers to implement safety mechanisms, rather than attempting to winnow down the project costs. It’s not all bad news, of course. Many architectural firms are able to focus on quality and safety when designing small social housing projects, rather than bolting on a few affordable homes in a profit-making luxury block. But older blocks are too often forgotten, despite being architecturally sound. Kate Hardy, an academic and member of Greater Manchester Housing Action, believes postwar brutalist buildings, which often contained sturdy, warm, sound-resistant flats, have been so denigrated that many people simply want them removed from sight. “They’ve been marked with architectural stigma,” she says. “So instead we see cheap-looking plastic populating the skyline in our towns and cities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/18/most-britons-dislike-prospect-living-mini-nuclear-station","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T06:50:59Z","webTitle":"Most Britons 'dislike prospect of living near mini nuclear station'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/18/most-britons-dislike-prospect-living-mini-nuclear-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/18/most-britons-dislike-prospect-living-mini-nuclear-station","fields":{"headline":"Most Britons 'dislike prospect of living near mini nuclear station'","bodyText":"Most Britons would not be happy living near the mini nuclear power stations that Rolls-Royce and several other international companies want to build in the UK, a survey has found. The government has promised the developers of small modular reactors a slice of a £250m funding pot in a race to position the UK as the place where the first generation of the power stations should be built. Polling by YouGov, however, believed to be the first survey of public attitudes towards the plants, found that 62% of people would be unhappy living within five miles of one. The poll, commissioned by the climate change charity 10:10, found that only 24% would be unhappy living near an onshore windfarm, which the Conservative party has stymied with tougher planning rules. The figure fell to 17% for community-owned windfarms. Ellie Roberts, a campaigner at 10:10, said: “These results show just how wildly out of step with public opinion UK energy policy has become.” Most small modular reactors (SMRs) would generate less than a tenth of the power the projected Hinkley Point C will provide, but are backed by industry as a cheaper option to big nuclear plants and an opportunity for British firms to be first in a new technology. The government’s multimillion-pound competition to help build the first one in the UK has, however, been repeatedly delayed. Ministers are expected to lay out their intentions later this autumn. Rolls-Royce, Britain’s leading multinational manufacturer, last week added to pressure on the government to give industry clarity on its plans for the mini nuclear power stations. Harry Holt, the president of nuclear at Rolls-Royce, said: “With demand for energy set to rise in the near future, in part due to the growing popularity of electric cars, we believe that a UK SMR programme is a vital addition to our national infrastructure.” The company predicted that once the reactor had been built, future ones could at some point after 2028 be built for a subsidy price of £60 per megawatt hour of power they supplied. Offshore windfarms to be built in 2022-23 recently secured a price of £57.50 per megawatt hour, a record low in the level of state support they require."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/19/the-state-of-the-oscars-race-whos-in-the-lead-after-the-big-film-festivals","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-19T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"The state of the Oscars race: who's in the lead after the big film festivals?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/19/the-state-of-the-oscars-race-whos-in-the-lead-after-the-big-film-festivals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/19/the-state-of-the-oscars-race-whos-in-the-lead-after-the-big-film-festivals","fields":{"headline":"The state of the Oscars race: who's in the lead after the big film festivals?","bodyText":"By the end of September last year, after the annual onslaught of festival premieres, we’d already seen seven of the year’s nine best picture nominees. Again, we’re back at the informed speculation stage: the reviews are in, the first trophies have been handed out and we can start to assemble a loose, yet likely, list of potential candidates. The race officially kicked off in January and although Sundance has become a less reliable starting point for awards-friendly films, this year did offer up three major contenders. The most ecstatic reviews were given to I Am Love director Luca Guadagnino’s heartfelt gay romance Call Me by Your Name, which also received special notices for leads Armie Hammer and breakout star Timothee Chalamet. Both could be in with a chance but the buzz is strongest around A Serious Man star Michael Stuhlbarg who is close to being a best supporting actor lock for an emotive, much-talked-about scene at the end of the film. The festival also saw the premiere of Mudbound, a second world war-set drama about racial division in Mississippi, which opened to acclaim for director Dee Rees, who could become the first black woman to receive a nomination for best director (there’s also best supporting actress heat around star Mary J Blige). It was bought by Netflix for an ambitious $12.5m but the company has struggled to break through to the Academy with any of their fiction films so far – unlike Amazon, who scored their first Oscar last year for Manchester by the Sea. The company was also the toast of Sundance with Kumail Nanjiani’s crowd-pleasing comedy The Big Sick, which became one of the summer’s big sleeper hits. Oscar-wise, Holly Hunter has a decent chance of a best supporting actress nod and the screenplay could get recognition while the film is likely to make a showing at the Golden Globes, given the often limited comedic contenders. Cannes was low on awards-aiming films with Todd Haynes’s fantasy Wonderstruck failing to gather much support, but Tangerine director Sean Baker’s comedy drama The Florida Project was warmly received and star Willem Dafoe is likely to get a best supporting actor nod. The opening film at Venice has become something of an Oscar indicator with Gravity, Birdman and La La Land all occupying the slot. This year saw the premiere of Alexander Payne’s high concept comedy Downsizing, which stars Matt Damon as a man who decides to be shrunk, and while initial reviews were warm, it lost steam in Telluride and Toronto. The film that emerged from the festival with most acclaim was Guillermo del Toro’s 60s-set romance/fantasy/horror hybrid The Shape of Water which picked up the festival’s major prize, the Golden Lion. It also continued to impress audiences in Telluride and Toronto and star Sally Hawkins is an early lock for best actress for her role as a mute cleaner who falls in love with a sea creature. Venice also saw Frances McDormand secure a place in the category with a foul-mouthed performance as a grieving mother in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, a film that also generated buzz for co-star Sam Rockwell. It went on to win the people’s choice award at Toronto, a prize that’s previously been awarded to Room, La La Land and The Imitation Game. The debut of Darren Aronofsky’s darkly comic surrealist assault Mother! was met with divisive reviews and while most were impressed with Jennifer Lawrence, the film is too strange to repeat any Black Swan-style Oscar success. Michelle Pfeiffer’s sinister turn could sneak into the best supporting actress category, however. George Clooney’s Suburbicon was dead on arrival with middling reviews despite a cast including Matt Damon, Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, while Stephen Frears is unlikely to continue his streak of directing older female actors all the way to the best actress race, with Victoria and Abdul gaining little heat for star Judi Dench. At Telluride, the best actor race gained its frontrunner with Gary Oldman’s transformative portrayal of Winston Churchill in Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour and co-star Ben Mendelsohn heading for a best supporting actor nomination as well. Reviews have been strong and it’s exactly the sort of prestige British drama that the Academy likes to reward. There was also a warm reception for Annette Bening’s performance as Oscar-winning actor Gloria Grahame in Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool but the film itself is small and in a tough category she might struggle. The Colorado-based festival saw the premiere of fact-based tennis drama Battle of the Sexes, a timely crowdpleaser that could see last year’s best actress winner Emma Stone get a nomination and Greta Gerwig’s directorial debut Lady Bird which has two awards-worthy performances from Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf as mother and daughter. The film continued to generate heat in Toronto, the press screenings proving the hardest to get into throughout the fest. Almost immediately after, the best actress race became even more confused in Toronto with the arrival of Aaron Sorkin’s directorial debut Molly’s Game, which propelled two-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain into the race with her role as a resourceful “poker princess”. The film itself is likely to be an adapted screenplay contender as well and could nab Idris Elba a best supporting actor nomination. His other film at the festival, the romantic adventure The Mountain Between Us, emerged as a non-starter despite chemistry between him and Kate Winslet. It didn’t bomb quite as hard as Benedict Cumberbatch’s Thomas Edison biopic The Current War which was seen as one of the festival’s biggest disappointments alongside Halle Berry and Daniel Craig’s LA riots drama Kings. Toronto then saw yet another big star added to the best actress race: six-time nominee Glenn Close. Her performance in marital drama The Wife was heaped with praise but the film still doesn’t have a distributor so her place in the race will depend on who, if anyone, picks it up in time. In a similar boat is Hostiles, a grim western with Christian Bale that’s been scoring fine reviews but also lacks distribution. If it’s bought in time then Bale could be joining Oldman and previous nominee James Franco who entered the fray with his role as Tommy Wiseau in The Disaster Artist which will benefit from the Academy’s obsession with rewarding films about films. They’re also joined by Jake Gyllenhaal, whose performance in Boston marathon bombing drama Stronger was universally praised. The Tonya Harding skating comedy I, Tonya picked up some positive reviews but might prove too crude for the Academy. Allison Janney is a likely lock, however, for her role as Harding’s vicious mother. Outside of the festivals, Christopher Nolan’s second world war hit Dunkirk is a strong contender for best picture and will also score well in many of the technical categories. A similar summer release failed to launch Kathryn Bigelow’s Detroit which was a box office disappointment and didn’t receive the acclaim it needs for a big awards push. There’s been buzz around Get Out becoming a rare horror film to sneak in given its critical acclaim, but it seems like original screenplay recognition might be the most likely way in. There are still a number of unseen films to come. The New York Film Festival will launch two major premieres: Richard Linklater’s road trip drama Last Flag Flying and Woody Allen’s 50s-set Wonder Wheel. There are also three films from Academy-approved directors on the way. Steven Spielberg’s political drama The Post (Which could see nods for Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep), Ridley Scott’s fact-based crime drama All the Money in the World (which could do well for stars Kevin Spacey, Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg) and Paul Thomas Anderson’s fashion-themed Phantom Thread (which is likely to thrust Daniel Day-Lewis to the front of the race). Ten safe nominee bets Gary Oldman – best actor, Darkest Hour Sally Hawkins – best actress, The Shape of Water Jessica Chastain – best actress, Molly’s Game Jake Gyllenhaal – best actor, Stronger Michael Stuhlbarg – best supporting actor, Call Me by Your Name Christopher Nolan – best director, Dunkirk Allison Janney – best supporting actress, I, Tonya Laurie Metcalf – best supporting actress, Lady Bird Aaron Sorkin – best adapted screenplay, Molly’s Game Willem Dafoe – best supporting actor, The Florida Project"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/04/sam-allardyce-preparing-to-sue-fa-england-exit","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T14:28:34Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce preparing to sue FA over comments that followed England exit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/sam-allardyce-preparing-to-sue-fa-england-exit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/04/sam-allardyce-preparing-to-sue-fa-england-exit","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce preparing to sue FA over comments that followed England exit","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce is preparing to sue the Football Association for damages in a dispute over the way it reacted after his removal as England manager last year. It is understood the FA, including the chief executive, Martin Glenn, and chairman, Greg Clarke, have received a 5,000-word letter from lawyers instructed by the 62-year-old. Allardyce was effectively sacked as England manager in September last year after a sting operation by the Daily Telegraph in which undercover reporters posed as businessmen. The end-product ran under the headline “England manager for sale”. The FA decided his position was untenable less than 24 hours after the piece was published. The Daily Mail claims to have seen the legal letter addressed to the FA. Allardyce, who believes the governing body did not wait until the full facts emerged before firing him, is taking action over public comments made by Glenn and Clarke. Allardyce lost his job over allegations made by the Telegraph that he advised the fictitious businessmen how to circumvent rule about third-party ownership of players. But his lawyers have obtained a transcript of the recordings, taken over the course of two meetings, and say he did not advise on that matter. Allardyce is furious with comments made by the FA in the wake of his demise. Clarke and the governing body’s communications chief, Robert Sullivan, gave evidence at a hearing about football governance by parliament’s department of culture, media and sport select (DCMS) committee. The FA may feel those comments are protected by parliamentary privilege but Clarke made similar remarks in an interview with the BBC. On 26 October last year Glenn said: “The issue we had with Sam was that in implying he could help people circumvent the rules, we felt in every other situation in the next few years we would have that thrown back in our face. We have to apply the rules consistently.

First time ever? I blacked out on one song and came out on another?” “Yeah,” Jim sighs. “Drink,” says Kim, simply. “I think it was pretty horrible.” Josephine Wiggs, the Breeders’ original, British bassist, says she found an old laptop recently, with some mid-90s correspondence on it. There was an email from the music writer Michael Azerrad. “He’s writing to me about being at one of those shows and just being like: ‘Oh my god, I’m fearful for their safety.’” “I’ve not heard this before,” says Kim. “It’s all going in the book, Kim,” Josephine smiles, wryly. Given the Breeders’ history, there should be plenty for her to draw upon. They formed in 1989 as a side-project for Kim while her other band, Pixies, were on a hiatus. But they soon became much more than that. With 1990’s Pod and 1993’s Last Splash, the Breeders released two of the most iconic albums of that era’s alternative rock explosion. But their success was messy, too. It’s taken a long time for the four people here today to get together again. In Kim’s living room, in a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, the Last Splash lineup – Kim, twin sister Kelley, Jim and Josephine – are sitting around, discussing texts and calls and emails and shows, working out a timeline of how it all snapped back into place. “There’s something about this sound that really feels like home,” says Kelley, warmly. Spending time in their company is like being at a family get-together. They tease each other, they bicker over song titles. They chat effusively about current affairs and why it might be that so many serial killers are from Ohio. Kim has always lived here, on and off, but moved back permanently in 2003 to help take care of their mother, who has Alzheimer’s. She and Kelley’s parents live at the end of the road. With a new Breeders album and tour on the way, Josephine gave up her apartment in Brooklyn and moved into Kim’s attic. Kelley lives a couple of streets away; the sisters have an older brother, who is just around the corner with his family. Jim cycles over to rehearse in the basement, when he has time off from his carpentry job; his wife helps take care of Kim and Kelley’s mum. Kim gives me a tour of their rehearsal space in the cellar, where the band have been practising since she first moved in, in 1990. Brilliantly, they sometimes get noise complaints from the neighbours, particularly if the bass is too loud. They play me some new Breeders songs, the first with this lineup since 1993. As we’re listening, the Deals move to sit right in front of my face and stare at me, closely, with jokey intensity. “It’s really comfortable, isn’t it, listening to someone’s music while they’re there,” teases Kelley. Kim and Kelley had always played music together, starting out at the truck stops around Dayton. “It was the daytime, so not as cool as Urban Cowboy and all that stuff,” says Kim. They did weddings, too, and played in a lounge band that occasionally did disco covers. The twins do simultaneous jazz hands as they stage-whisper their formative band’s name: “Track Five!” The group was made up of local sisters, recalls Kim. “A couple of them were getting old so they needed girls to be backup singers. We had outfits, we had dance moves on the stage. Men would buy us sloe gin fizzes. I remember driving there on acid, and the snow was coming, and I was getting ready to sing and I was fried …” It was Kim’s desire to make a disco song that eventually led to the Breeders, in a way. Kim had moved to Boston with her then-husband, and in 1986 answered an ad to play bass in the band that would become Pixies. By 1989, she was at a loose end, so she and her friend Tanya Donnelly, from Throwing Muses, had the idea of playing together. “Both of our bands were not doing anything for a while,” she recalls. “Kristin [Hersh] was pregnant at the time, I think Charles [Pixies’ Black Francis] was driving to LA or on a solo tour or something.” The disco idea didn’t stick, but the band did. Josephine was recruited to play bass after first meeting Kim when her group, the Perfect Disaster, supported Pixies in Europe. “I was like, ‘Why do you want me to play bass? Why don’t you play bass?’” So why didn’t one of rock’s most famous bassists want to play bass in her own band? “I’m a guitar player!” Kim protests. “I’ve played guitar since I was 13. I don’t have anything against playing bass, but if I was gonna play something or write something I’d play guitar, cos that’s what I play.” Pod was recorded quickly in Edinburgh with producer Steve Albini. It’s a masterpiece of both songwriting and production. Kim describes it as “just magic”. In a 1992 issue of music mag Melody Maker, Kurt Cobain named it as a record that changed his life. “The main reason I like them is for their songs, for the way they structure them, which is totally unique, very atmospheric. I wish Kim was allowed to write more songs for the Pixies, because Gigantic is the best Pixies song and Kim wrote it,” he said. The Breeders ended up touring with Nirvana in the early 90s. By this point, Kelley had left her job to play guitar, Jim had joined on drums – he knew Kim from flyering her house in Dayton with leaflets for his band’s shows – and Tanya had left to form Belly. Jim remembers their first show in Dublin, opening for Nirvana. “I was playing and Kurt walked up. I was like, ‘Oh shit, there he is.’ He didn’t wear his lanyard, and one of the bouncers just got up on stage and beat the shit out of him. He just thought it was a punter. So Kurt fired every single one of them and said he wasn’t gonna play the show until they got a whole new security.” “They were awesome,” adds Kelley. “I feel like I know Krist [Novoselic] the best, and then Dave Grohl was always really nice. Kurt seemed really nice, but with my knowledge of what addiction does and shit like that, he seemed super-addicted. Quiet. Probably high, I don’t know.” It’s hard to grasp the sheer magnitude of that scene, particularly looking back now. Kelley says she doesn’t think there will ever be anything like it again. At the start of 1993, Pixies broke up, with Black Francis allegedly sending Kim and drummer David Lovering a fax to inform them of the news (Kim told Spin she actually found out when Kelley informed her during the Last Splash sessions). But that same summer, the Breeders released Cannonball, an insanely infectious single that became an instant classic. On YouTube, there is a treasure trove of rambunctious MTV interviews with the band from that time. But there’s an element of wild-eyed chaos to the fun and, with hindsight, a Rolling Stone profile from 1994 hints at what was really going on: Kelley spends most of the interview with her back turned, asleep. She had been a heroin addict for a while, and in 1994 she was arrested for possession. She went to rehab a few months later. Kim, meanwhile, had her own problems with alcohol. Despite various attempts at writing and touring, it would be eight years before another Breeders album, Title TK, appeared. Neither Jim nor Josephine had stayed around. Both say it was odd for them to know that there was a Breeders album coming out without them on it. “It was weird,” shrugs Jim. “But I was the one who told Kim I was leaving, so it was no fault of hers.” “I have no memory,” Kim says. (Kim stopped drinking in 2002 and, like Kelley, is now completely sober.) “I had no idea you told me that. I’m sorry, Jim.” Josephine, like Jim, is similarly understanding. “On the one hand, you’ve heard what was going on [during this period], and I did not want to be involved in that,” she says. “It sounded like such a nightmare. I thought: ‘I just don’t think I can do it, for my own mental health.’ But at the same time I was feeling slightly nose-out-of-joint that there was a record with the Breeders name on it and I wasn’t part of it.” Kim asks if it’s like seeing an old partner happy with someone new, even though you dumped them. “I think it makes your gut feel the same,” says Jim. Amusingly, this incarnation of the band ended up on an episode of Buffy. The Deals were fans and had started to incorporate the theme tune into their live set, which earned them an invitation to play on set at Buffy’s fictional nightclub The Bronze in season seven. “I have a coffee cup that says The Bronze on it. I remember I got yelled at,” Kim smiles. “For smoking?” asks Kelley. “Me too. (Stern voice) ‘You’d better hope Sarah [Michelle Gellar] doesn’t come back and see you. She’d be really mad.’” The two of them love TV. Kim has a Walking Dead calendar hung up in her kitchen, and at 6pm every night, the sisters FaceTime so they can watch the news together and discuss events. A fourth album followed in 2008, the introspective, winding Mountain Battles. By this point, Pixies were four years into their reunion, to the initial surprise of fans, who had thought their initial split too acrimonious. “The Pixies were doing those tours which, by the way, were fantastic,” says Kim. When there was serious talk of recording a new Pixies album in 2011, she decided it was time for her to step away. “I didn’t really want to do [an album] anyway and I had been pretty vocal about that. Then when it was actually like: ‘We’re gonna do it’, I was busy, we had this going on and the solo stuff, so I’m pretty good. And they’re doing really great.” Kim and Kelley wanted to commemorate Last Splash’s 20th anniversary with some shows and had begun to talk about how it might be to have Jim and Josephine back in the Breeders. Kelley chips in: “There was talk of some more [Pixies] shows in 2012 and I was like, ‘Noooooo! You’re booked!’” Many say Pixies are not the same without Kim Deal. She’s a trailblazer and a hero to a generation of rock fans who had never quite seen a woman like her in their favourite band before. But she is dismissive of any talk of reverence. “Just look outside my window,” she says, nodding to the porch that looks out onto her quiet street. “Nothing. Nobody recognises us or knows us at all.” Kelley tells a story about how the Breeders were playing a festival in Austin, and Exene Cervenka [from LA punks X] was there. “And she’s like the cute guy in the room that you are watching without watching. I clocked her every movement. I knew exactly what she was doing at all times.” She mimes following someone around, agog, and looks at her sister. “So the fact that you are that to somebody, I totally can get that.” Later, Kim and Jim drive me to Dayton’s record store. A man comes up to Jim and thanks him; when they were younger, Jim turned him on to Pixies and let him borrow his albums. “Well,” says Jim, slightly bamboozled, “here’s Kim.” Kim smiles, says hello, shakes his awestruck hand. She’d been standing there all along.

It was followed by a series of high-profile stories, with the paper proudly vindicating itself by declaring: “Judge rules child must leave Muslim foster parents.” The headlines created an almighty media stink. Yet we now know from the court that far from being a child wrongly placed with unfit parents, as was reported, the five-year-old girl actually had a “warm relationship” with her Muslim carers and misses them. In its attempt to create a storm, the Times not only attacked thousands of foster parents whose sacrifices are essential yet rarely acknowledged, it did so in a way that was framed as a clash of religions: one that appeared to give supremacy to a white Christian girl over a backward Muslim family, and one that seems to have forgotten that more than 1,500 young Muslim children have spent time in care at non-Muslim homes. Contrary to claims, the foster family did speak English, the child was not denied certain foods for religious reasons and, while a long necklace was removed from her, this was because her carer was worried it posed a safety risk, not because of imagined religious strictures. The coverage of this story was an opportunity to raise serious issues: given the ultimate goal of safeguarding a young child in need, how much importance should be given to the cultural and religious match with the young child for a short-term placement? And what should be the criteria for recruiting foster parents given the huge shortage in the sector? Yet if this was the aim, why were the voices of foster parents such as Martin Barrow and Esmat Jeraj not sought – individuals whose homes were shared with vulnerable young children of different cultures? Why were independent providers of foster care and advisory groups such as the Fostering Network not cited? They later joined over 20 others in a statement calling out the Times’s “divisive reporting”. The reality is that these critical voices were ignored. The man heading the government’s review into fostering, Martin Narey, recognised how the coverage by the Times and others could deter people from ethnic minorities from offering their services – with “disastrous” consequences. Many others point out that British Muslims, who choose to open their homes and hearts to vulnerable children regardless of faith, are now at risk of social castigation or suspicion. So how did the Times get it so wrong, now that more of the facts of the case have been laid bare for the world to see? After all, the man responsible for these stories was none other than Andrew Norfolk, the award-winning journalist who rightly and fearlessly exposed the Rotherham grooming scandal. Yet if Norfolk was trying to replicate his northern success in east London, he was wide of the mark. In the wider coverage of this non-story, it felt as if some people thought Muslims were unfit to be foster parents. If they must be entrusted with children other than their own, they must pass an arbitrary “I am not an Islamist test” set by the Times. The so-called fear of reporting on Muslims clearly does not exist – as evidenced by alarmist headlines in the Times and its sister paper, the Sunday Times: from the false claim that “Enclaves of Islam see UK as 75% Muslim” to unjustifiably calling a Muslim school “Islamist” or scaremongering that Muslims are “silent on terror”. Taken alongside these headlines, the Times’s story on Muslim fostering follows a disreputable pattern of baiting Muslims. But it is not only the Times whose reputation has been severely damaged as the paper continued its coverage without any retraction, apology or remorse. Sky News, for instance, appeared to initially parrot the Times’s narrative without the scrutiny that the BBC provided. The Sun’s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, appearing on Sky News’s Press Preview, claimed that there should be the same level of outrage if a child brought up as a Muslim was placed into a strict Christian family, apparently oblivious to the fact this has occurred on multiple occasions. Meanwhile Trevor Phillips, the former head of the Commission for Racial Equality, contributed to the circus by making a number of misleading claims on the pages of the Sun. Phillips labelled the local council at the heart of this case as “pro-Muslim”, likening their actions to “child abuse”, while attacking the real experts voicing concern at the coverage as “hypocrites”. And the cherry on the proverbial cake was the press regulator IPSO’s refusal to take any action. In a letter sent to complainants, its executive claimed that it could not investigate and publicly rule on the inaccuracies because of “the effect … this coverage may have on those involved in the case, and particularly the child”. It has, in effect, absolved itself of the responsibility of doing its job and regulating the press invasion of the child’s privacy by citing that very same child’s privacy. There are a number of social issues that require careful journalistic investigation and proper scrutiny. But this episode reveals a baser journalistic instinct – Muslim wrongdoing, whether real or imagined, sells. It conforms to the narrative that there is something about Muslims and their faith that is not quite British, not quite modern. The way in which this issue is reported by some newspapers may help explain why trust in the profession languishes behind even that in estate agents and bankers. And this affects too the many journalists who have reported this story so diligently. We cannot let them get away with it. • Miqdaad Versi is assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/04/rex-tillerson-trump-moron","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T15:37:48Z","webTitle":"Rex Tillerson says he won't quit but doesn't deny calling Trump a 'moron'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/rex-tillerson-trump-moron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/rex-tillerson-trump-moron","fields":{"headline":"Rex Tillerson says he won't quit but doesn't deny calling Trump a 'moron'","bodyText":"The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has denied he has considered resignation and pledged loyalty to Donald Trump in the wake of a report that he had called the president a “moron”. “There has never been a consideration in my mind to leave. I serve at the appointment of the president and I’m here as long as the president thinks I can be useful to achieving his objectives,” Tillerson said at a hastily arranged press appearance on Wednesday. But he did not deny the report on NBC News on Wednesday morning that he had derided Trump as a “moron” in a meeting of White House national security officials and members of the cabinet. Instead, he shrugged off the report as “petty nonsense” and issued a stream of praise for the president. “He loves his country. He puts America and Americans first. He’s smart. He demands results wherever he goes and he holds those around him accountable for whether they have done the job he has asked them to do,” Tillerson said. Moments after his statement, CNN also reported that he had called Trump a moron and that Trump had been made aware of it. After Tillerson’s appearance, the state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, held a separate press conference and denied Tillerson had called the president a moron, insisting: “He never said that.” For those who wanted him to resign, Nauert said: “Go ahead and keep pushing, because that will only strengthen his resolve.” The secretary of state said he had not talked to the president on Wednesday morning before making his statement, saying Trump was on his way to Las Vegas. But the president was clearly watching Tillerson, tweeting within a few minutes. “The NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec Tillerson and VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!” Trump wrote. After Tillerson’s statement, a NBC correspondent put out a tweet quoting MSNBC anchorwoman Stephanie Ruhle as saying: “My source didn’t just say he called him a moron. He said he called him an f-ing moron.” The report by NBC News is the latest in a long series of snapshots of an administration in near constant crisis, largely as a result of the erratic and abrasive character of the president. In its first nine months it has been dogged by resignations, gaffes, failed legislative initiatives, and scandals, to a degree unmatched by any administration in modern US history. Trump has openly disparaged his own top officials, such as the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and repeatedly contradicted and undercut Tillerson – most recently when the secretary of state was in China to explore ways of containing the North Korean nuclear crisis. Tillerson mentioned said there were channels of communication between Washington and Pyongyang. Soon afterwards, Trump went on Twitter to say the secretary of state was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man [Trump’s nickname for Kim Jong-un]”. “Save your energy, Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” he tweeted. Speculation on whether Tillerson would resign has swirled around Washington throughout the summer, and apparently for good reason. Tillerson was in Texas for his son’s wedding in late July when Trump addressed the Boy Scouts of America, an organisation Tillerson once ran and is passionate about. The president’s address made little allowance for the fact he was addressing an audience of teenagers and Trump spent much of it scoring political points against his rivals and boasting about his election success more than eight months earlier. Tillerson threatened not to return to Washington, according to NBC, citing three unnamed sources “with direct knowledge of the threats”. The report said the defence secretary, James Mattis, and retired General John Kelly, who would later become White House chief of staff, helped talk him out of resigning for the sake of national stability. When Tillerson did return to Washington, Mike Pence, the vice-president, is reported to have arranged a meeting with him to counsel him on how to get on with Trump. Tillerson’s spokesman, RC Hammond, said Tillerson did not consider quitting over the summer and did not call the president a moron. He told NBC he was unaware of Tillerson’s meeting with Pence. Pence’s office also denied the NBC report. “The vice-president can also confirm that, as the secretary of state made clear, at no time did he and the secretary ever discuss the prospect of the secretary’s resignation from the administration,” Pence’s office said. Asked about his reaction to the day’s furore around Tillerson, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Corker, said: “I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos, and I support them very much.” Earlier this year, Tillerson admitted that he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it. Tillerson had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the election, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect “about the world” and his experiences as an oil company CEO. He was “stunned” to be offered the job of secretary or state, he said. “I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,” Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR) in March. “My wife told me I’m supposed to do this.” Twitter users seized upon the row to recirculate a cartoon that Trump originally posted in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/10/what-mysteries-could-be-unlocked-by-new-antikythera-shipwreck-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T10:28:49Z","webTitle":"What mysteries could be unlocked by new Antikythera shipwreck finds?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/10/what-mysteries-could-be-unlocked-by-new-antikythera-shipwreck-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/10/what-mysteries-could-be-unlocked-by-new-antikythera-shipwreck-finds","fields":{"headline":"What mysteries could be unlocked by new Antikythera shipwreck finds?","bodyText":"The shipwreck at Antikythera, Greece, continues to reveal its secrets and surprise archaeologists. As reported last week, recent excavations on the 1st century BC shipwreck have revealed statue fragments, bronze ornamentation, and wooden remains from the ship’s hull. The finds are sensational, but the artifacts and the project have broader importance. Among the finds was the bronze arm of a statue, which may be the most significant find. When the shipwreck was first found and excavated in 1900-1901, a number of bronze and marble statues were recovered. However, the arm is the first piece that has been found recently and it might point to more intact statuary in the area. The arm is one of several limb fragments that do not have corresponding bodies. The Antikythera team hypotheses those statues could be in the vicinity of the undisturbed deposit that they excavated this year. New bronze statues would be a sensational discovery. Bronze statues are among the rarest artifacts to survive from antiquity; however, ancient authors tell us that they were quite common. Pausanias wrote a Roman travel guide of Greece and he describes the many bronzes statues filling cities like Athens. In Greek Bronze Statuary Professor Carol Mattusch writes, “all ancient literary accounts indicate that freestanding bronze statuary was the primary mode of artistic expression in Classical Greece.” Ancient cities like Athens and Rome were filled with bronze sculptures, with bronze being preferred over marble. Why do so few bronze statues survive today? I spoke with Professor Mattusch, who explained that few examples have been found on land due to the value of bronze. Statues were melted and recycled, leaving only relative handful today. Therefore, statues from the sea are important discoveries. “Bronze statues from the sea have significantly increased the numbers of classical bronzes that survive today,” says Mattusch. Examples found in the sea include the famous youth riding a horse and statue of Zeus or Poseidon currently in the Greek National Museum, the Riace statues depicting two warriors, and the Athlete of Croatia. Due to their loss in the sea, these statues were protected from the bronze recyclers. The Antikythera project is significant because it can tell us a great deal about ancient statues and their transport. It is the first project to excavate a cargo of bronze statues in situ using modern methods. The majority of bronzes found in the sea are isolated finds or found in fishers’ nets. This includes the Athlete of Croatia, which was excavated by archaeologists, but it was not part of a shipwreck. Careful excavation may reveal much about the past, as well as contribute to our understanding of ancient art. Mattusch explains that “there is much more to be learned from the careful excavation of an ancient shipwreck,” since these sites have a closed context like a time capsule. Shipwrecks reveal information about the economy and trade routes, as well as ship construction. These sources all contribute to the understanding of ancient statuary, since “fixed dates are a rare thing for finds from classical contexts” according to Mattusch. Amphoras from the cargo, dendrochronology from the ship’s wood, and dates from other artifacts contribute to the dating of bronze statuary, which is typically dated based stylistic features. The excavation of an undisturbed deposit may shed new light on the ancient transport of statuary. Are these statues part of a consignment of scrap metal for the recyclers? Or are they being used as heavy ballast? Are they new statues that are part of a high value cargo, such as the shipwreck found at Madhia carrying bronze furniture pieces? Or could this be plunder or the resale of Greek statues to Roman buyers? These hypotheses have been proposed in the past, but the excavation offers the first opportunity to address them. The future work on site is “bound to add much-needed information to our knowledge of the statue industry in classical antiquity,” says Mattusch. Hidden behind the headlines is another impressive part of the project: the truly challenging nature of diving on the site. The physicality of working in a relatively remote area at a depth of 55m is rarely communicated to the public. Diving to such great depth increases the chance of decompression sickness, also known as “the bends.” Divers must carefully monitor their dive time and follow strict decompression protocols to ensure they can safely exit the water. While operating under these strict health and safety protocols, they must also move boulders, delicately excavate artifacts, and deploy the latest scientific methods. The project has addressed the difficulties through the use of five PhD archaeologists and a technical diving staff. “We’ve hit upon a good recipe,” says Dr Brendan Folely. The archaeologists are able to focus on the work while the technical divers monitor the dives. The partnership proves that precise archaeological excavation can be undertaken underwater at great depths. The project has a perfect safety record and continues to make impressive discoveries. Excavation of the Antikythera shipwreck will continue in 2018. Last year the team found human remains and this season provided a tantalizing undisturbed deposit. With the potential to locate several of the missing statues, one can hardly imagine what the next season will bring. Whether it is contributing new understanding of ancient art or pushing archaeology forward through its technical diving and underwater sciences, the Antikythera team has us all riveted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/04/bruce-springsteen-on-broadway-live-review-reaction","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T14:26:40Z","webTitle":"'It's not a concert, it's a show': first reactions to Springsteen on Broadway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/04/bruce-springsteen-on-broadway-live-review-reaction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/04/bruce-springsteen-on-broadway-live-review-reaction","fields":{"headline":"'It's not a concert, it's a show': first reactions to Springsteen on Broadway","bodyText":"Bruce Springsteen, the Boss, the Boardwalk Balladeer, the one-time New Dylan, Steinbeck in Leather, the leader of the E Street Band and the man whose lyrics have been misunderstood by Republican politicians for over 30 years now has another title: Broadway star. Tuesday night’s performance of Springsteen on Broadway wasn’t officially opening night (that’s 12 October) but the reviews on the street from the first preview were unanimously positive. “It’s not a concert, it’s a show.” When one person said it, all the enthusiastic fans who’d just exited the Walter Kerr Theatre agreed. This wasn’t one of Springsteen’s fabled four-hour blowouts in a stadium, it was two hours in a Broadway house. “It was fantastic, a great night. He told stories, he sang all the classics, it was unbelievable!” gushed a New Yorker by the name of Adrian who was in such a whirlwind she couldn’t pick a highlight, so settled on Born To Run, Bruce Springsteen’s signature song that closed out the evening. Though Broadway is known for its razzle-dazzle, everything about this production is apparently stripped bare. This is not a jukebox musical like Billy Joel’s Movin’ Out. There are no dancers, skits or tableaux. There are no slides projected, no video installations, just a microphone stand waiting for a man and his guitar, a piano and some equipment cases stacked up against a brick wall. “I’d read his book, a lot of the stories came from there,” said Mark Zuckerman, a Florida transplant to New York. Nearly each of the 15 songs were set up by an excerpt. While there was some off-the-cuff banter, like a dedication to Tom Petty at the start, “it felt like theater.” (“There had to be a teleprompter, but I couldn’t see it from my angle,” Jonathan Toth from Toronto suggested.) There was no encore, and only the final song, Born to Run, had audience members singing along. Springsteen’s wife, the longtime E Street Band backup singer (and singer-songwriter in her own right) Patti Scialfa, joined the stage mid-show to sing duet on Tougher Than The Rest and Brilliant Disguise. The intimate setting of a Broadway house (975 seats at the Walter Kerr Theatre as opposed to 82,500 at nearby MetLife stadium, where Springsteen played three sold-out shows last summer) was the big selling point for many. “This is my 27th show, but the first time I heard him speak without any sort of amplification,” Mike Ryan of Manhattan’s Upper East Side said concerning the few moments when Springsteen didn’t speak into the microphone. “I’d say it was around 50-50 music and storytelling,” he continued, delighted that the singer had some good comic timing. “He talked about being Mr Born To Run, gotta get out, leave home. And now after he’s made his fortune he still lives 10 minutes from where he grew up.” The tickets set him back $620 a pop, and while there did appear to be a look of shock and horror in his eyes as he recalled this, he was quick to add “this is a once in a lifetime.” A few seats in the top rows are reserved for lucky lottery winners at a more reasonable $75 price point. “It looked good from up there,” said Jill, a German woman living in New York pleased she didn’t have to break the bank. “I was thinking during the show how Springsteen is the embodiment of America. Of a certain kind of America,” she added. In a recent interview with Variety, Springsteen said you shouldn’t expect too many overtly political songs or statements from him: “I’ve done it when I felt it was really necessary and that maybe my two cents might make some small bit of difference. But the more you do it, your two cents becomes one cent and then no cents whatsoever, so I think your credibility and your impact lessens the more you do it.” But before singing The Ghost of Tom Joad, he included a pro-immigration statement, saying something about how the new America will have darker skin, and won’t just be Irish and Italians, the heritage he and his wife share. More encouraging is how the predominantly white audience wealthy enough to throw down so much money on a ticket reportedly met the comment with such applause.

This year, 505 new books are being published on Super Thursday, the day marked out as the start of the annual race for Christmas bestsellers. As usual, memoirs feature prominently, with books by actor David Jason, comedian Sarah Millican, and Virgin tycoon Richard Branson. There is also a diary from Dawn French; Niall Ferguson’s The Square and the Tower, a look at social networks of the past; and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s take on the Obama era, We Were Eight Years in Power. While celebrities including Nadiya Hussain and Cara Delevingne are jumping into the lucrative children’s book market, there are new literary novels from two Man Booker prize winners – Hollinghurst (The Sparsholt Affair) and John Banville (Mrs Osmond) – but the biggest fiction seller is likely to be Philip Pullman’s long-awaited La Belle Sauvage, out a little later, on 19 October, along with 259 other new hardbacks. Despite the deluge of new titles, the Christmas No 1 may already be out.

Now universally accepted as a classic, Ridley Scott’s future-noir fantasy (from an android-hunting novel by Philip K Dick) flopped in 1982, widely dismissed as an exercise in ravishing emptiness, as eye-catchingly hollow as Rachael, the glamorous “replicant” played by Sean Young. Late-in-the-day recuts didn’t help, adding an explanatory narration and dopey happy ending following negative test screenings. Indeed, it was only when Blade Runner was reconfigured via a 1992 Director’s Cut, and later Scott’s definitive Final Cut, that its masterpiece status was assured, sitting alongside Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and Kubrick’s 2001 in the pantheon of world-building sci-fi. No such tribulations await Blade Runner 2049, which has opened to the kind of critical adoration that sorely evaded Scott’s original. Yet Arrival director Denis Villeneuve’s audacious sequel, co-written by original screenwriter Hampton Fancher, really is as good as the hype suggests, spectacular enough to win over new generations of viewers, yet deep enough to reassure diehard fans that their cherished memories haven’t been reduced to tradable synthetic implants. The action plays out 30 years after “blade runner” Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) gave up chasing down androids and fell in love with one instead. In the interim there’s been a “blackout” – 10 days of darkness that wiped digitally stored replicant-production records, creating a blank space in humanity’s database memory. Promos for the off-world colonies still burble through the acid rain, jostling for attention amid corporation logos for Sony, Atari, Coca-Cola and Pan Am. Through this dystopian swamp, Ryan Gosling’s “K” walks in Deckard’s footsteps, tracking down wayward androids and “retiring” them. “How does it feel?” asks Dave Bautista’s Sapper Morton, taunting this deadpan hunter that he can only do his job because he’s “never seen a miracle” – an enigmatic phrase that will haunt K (and us) as he attempts to unravel its meaning. K lives in a poky apartment with his virtual girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas), a holographic artificial intelligence who seems to exist in the same world as Samantha from Spike Jonze’s Her. In his post-mission debriefs, K is subjected to a Pinteresque form of interrogative word association that surreally flips the replicant-detecting Voight-Kampff tests previously administered by Deckard. After years of being an unflappable killer, the “Constant K” is experiencing doubts about his job, his memories and his nature. “I never retired something that was born,” he tells Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), musing that “to be born is to have a soul”. Joshi is unimpressed, insisting that in this line of work, you can get along fine without one. Such existential anxieties are at the heart of Villeneuve’s movie, which has the confidence to proceed at a sedately edited pace utterly at odds with today’s rapid-fire blockbusters. Mirroring and inverting the key themes of its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 swaps unicorns for wooden horses while retaining the visual grandeur that fired Scott’s film. From vast landscapes of grey rooftops and reflectors, through the rusted shells of post-industrial shelters, to the burned-ochre glow of radioactive wastelands, cinematographer Roger Deakins conjures a twilight world that seems to go on for ever. Bright candy colours are restricted to the artificial lights of advertising and entertainment. Architecturally, the production designs evoke Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all angular lines and expressionist shadows. Elsewhere, we encounter statuesque nods to Spielberg’s AI: Artificial Intelligence, along with a self-referential homage to Kubrick’s The Shining, outtake footage from which was incorporated into the original release of Blade Runner. The sights are staggering, yet the real triumphs of Blade Runner 2049 are beautifully low-key. Carla Juri injects real magic into a heart-breaking, dream-weaving scene; Sylvia Hoeks rivals Rutger Hauer as Luv, the ass-kicker with terrifying tears; and Ana de Armas brings three-dimensional warmth to a character who is essentially a digital projection. Narratively, Fancher and co-writer Michael Green pull off a remarkable narrative sleight of hand that leaves the audience as devastatingly wrongfooted as Gosling’s cosmic detective. As for Villeneuve, he teases away at the enigmatic identity riddle at the centre of Scott’s movie, brilliantly sustaining the mystery of a blade runner’s true nature (“It’s OK to dream a little, isn’t it?”) while chasing the spirit of Philip K Dick’s electric sheep. Composers Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer dance around memories of Vangelis’s themes, creating a groaning, howling soundscape that occasionally rises in horrifying Ligeti-like ecstasy. The first time I saw Blade Runner 2049, I was overwhelmed by its visuals and astonished by its achievements. On second viewing, a sense of elegiac sadness cut through the spectacle, implanting altogether more melancholy memories. Both times, I was reminded that Blade Runner editor Terry Rawlings had described Scott’s original as “a grandiose art movie” and marvelled at how perfectly that phrase fitted Villeneuve’s new dreamy vision. How’s that for a miracle?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/05/yomi-sode-theatre-poetry-roundhouse-kate-tempest","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T12:30:29Z","webTitle":"Feast of words: Yomi Sode and the theatre poets stirring a new style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/05/yomi-sode-theatre-poetry-roundhouse-kate-tempest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/05/yomi-sode-theatre-poetry-roundhouse-kate-tempest","fields":{"headline":"Feast of words: Yomi Sode and the theatre poets stirring a new style","bodyText":"‘It’s amazing how not-so-simple something simple can be.” This line, near the start of Yomi Sode’s show Coat, gains a fragrance and pungency over the hour like the tomato stew that he lovingly cooks up on stage, chanting its ingredients as he chops and stirs: “Olive oil, onion, tatashe, plum tomatoes, Maggi … and my secret ingredient.” He is preparing the stew for a meal with his mother while his child sleeps in a back room. What appears at first to be a simple act of hospitality darkens and deepens as he recounts the life story of a Nigerian like himself, who was transported to London at the age of nine. By the end, the meal has become a reckoning with his family’s expectations of him, and by extension with the social and racial identity of any 21st-century immigrants who find themselves stuck between two cultures. Coat itself is a show stuck between cultures. Sode comes out of the performance poetry circuit, making his name on YouTube and at festivals (he played Latitude last year). The show was revived for a single night this week by spoken-word producers Apples and Snakes at the Roundhouse in north London after an earlier sellout performance. Were it produced by a theatre company, it might have a four-week run, and be regarded as a play. It is neatly directed by Thierry Lawson and, though Sode is the only performer, he animates a range of characters and situations, from his inquisitorial mother to his estranged father back in Nigeria and his English schoolfriend, Rob, who – astonishingly to a young Nigerian – backchats his mum in a home that smells of air-freshener and has no pots in the fridge. This provenance matters because it affects the way a show is seen – or, in the case of spoken word, more often not seen. Poetry for the stage has always had a tricky relationship with poetry for the page, not unlike the relationship of a playtext with a novel: it is designed to be heard and not read. Its emphasis on words, and on a single poetic sensibility, means that it doesn’t quite belong to theatre, either. Yet Coat belongs to a growing body of work that is creeping up on the theatrical establishment, reasserting the dramatic power of the written word at a time when director’s theatre sometimes seems all-powerful. Among its highest profile proponents is Kate Tempest, whose most recent portrait of urban disadvantage, Let Them Eat Chaos, was shortlisted for a Mercury prize this year and published as a book-length poem. But there are plenty more up-and-coming stars, from Inua Ellams, whose autobiographical Evening With an Immigrant is currently touring the country, to Richard Marsh, whose Todd &amp; God, in which a petulant deity appoints a hapless Jewish sceptic her messiah, was a hot ticket on the Edinburgh fringe this year. The work of these theatre poets is at its most potent when the aesthetics of a marginalised art form chime with the representation of marginalised people: it can take you behind the cliche, beneath the skin – and in doing so it is winning audiences. The Roundhouse studio on Tuesday was packed with a young, predominantly black crowd who devoured the words with a palpable hunger, and were vocal in their appreciation. While Tempest’s work is propelled by anger, Sode – like Illams – is animated by a gentleness, a sweetly self-deprecating humour that itself offers a radical challenge to conventional ideas of masculinity. This plays through Sode’s words and also across his face, as Junior – whether he is a small boy discovering the thrill of Super Nintendo or a teenager ecstatically exploring his girlfriend’s breasts in the back row of a cinema. Scenes that might seem commonplace and simplistic in the written word become potent through performance. Perhaps because he is so appealing, the least convincing aspect of Junior’s psychological journey is the jeopardy in which his situation places him. “I’m not angry. I’m just stuck … Britain has whitened my insides,” he tells us. I would have liked to be shown more emphatically what “stuck” feels like. But that is a quibble. Overarching the show, holding it together, is the theme of cooking as both a physical act of communication and homage, and a metaphor for the ebb and flow of cultural power. A sly sub-strand involves the commercialisation of food culture, and its implications for those who aren’t part of the story it tells. “Man go like Jamie,” chants Junior, incanting celebrity chefs to himself as he brandishes his chopping knife over an onion. Tesco never advertises egusi, he remarks later. By the end he has cooked up his own place in the world, producing a meal that both satisfies his traditionalist mother and caters for a London-born child unfamiliar with very fiery food. Instead of a programme, we are issued with a tomato stew starter kit, which contains two cubes of Maggi seasoning, and the instruction that garlic and rodo (hot peppers) are optional. The secret ingredient remains a mystery – but it is undoubtedly there, and is what makes this show so special."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/05/world-cup-2018-qualifying-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-this-weeks-games","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T08:55:36Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2018 qualifying: 10 things to look out for in this week's games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/05/world-cup-2018-qualifying-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-this-weeks-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/05/world-cup-2018-qualifying-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-this-weeks-games","fields":{"headline":"World Cup 2018 qualifying: 10 things to look out for in this week's games","bodyText":"1) History repeating itself at La Bombonera? Lose or draw at home against Peru in their penultimate qualifier and Argentina could find themselves relying on favours from others just to make the play-off place for Russia that would pit them against New Zealand. Peru currently occupy the fourth and final automatic qualifying spot in South America, level on points and goal difference with Argentina but ahead of them by dint of goals scored. With their final match against Colombia, who may secure automatic qualification before the sides meet next Tuesday, six points will guarantee Peru qualification for their first World Cup finals since 1982, four will probably get them at least a play-off spot and even three could be enough depending on how teams below them fare. Argentina, by contrast, face an unappealing trip to Ecuador in their final game, where the high altitude could cause them all sorts of problems. The Argentinians have already switched this match to the cauldron of La Bombonera to give them every advantage and in a tight group where only Brazil have already secured qualification, what promises to be an extremely tense encounter should make for riveting viewing. It may not be prove an omen, but the last time Argentina failed to qualify for the World Cup finals was in 1970, when a 2-2 draw with Peru at La Bombonera ended their hopes of making Mexico. BG Agüero out for six weeks, claims Argentina team doctor 2) Will Iceland incur the wrath of Warnock? Just two points separate the top four in Group I, where Croatia are level on 16 points with second-placed Iceland, whom they lead on goal difference. Behind them, Turkey and Ukraine have 14 points each and are level on goal difference, with the Turks edging it courtesy of one extra goal scored. While things could scarcely be more exciting, the unlikely figure of Neil Warnock has been helping to stir things up, as only he can. The Cardiff City manager is outraged that Aron Gunnarsson has been summoned for international duty by the Iceland manager, Heimir Hallgrimsson, despite Warnock’s insistence that a muscle tear means the midfielder is unfit to play against Turkey or Kosovo. “It’s such an important game for them. These two, they’re really crucial, but if they play him and he [tears it again] we’ll be very, very annoyed,” said Warnock. “So we’ll make sure we send all the medical evidence over, and if they play him we want written agreement that if they see the scans it’s got to be their responsibility to pay his wages [if he is injured]. I don’t see why we should if they gamble on him.” With a place in their first ever World Cup finals within touching distance, incurring the fabled wrath of Warnock by risking their experienced captain is a punt Iceland may happily take. BG World Cup 2018: which teams can book their place this week? 3) A do-or-die Scotland debut for Callum McGregor? Having resuscitated their faint qualification hopes with three wins from four matches, Scotland hold their destiny in their own hands with matches to come against Slovakia and Slovenia. Beat both and they’ll finish second in the group and hopefully not end up as the side that misses out on a play-off. Scotland, being Scotland, have now been hit by a midfield injury crisis, with Matt Ritchie, Scott Brown and Stuart Armstrong all ruled out of the crucial double-header. Callum McGregor and John McGinn have been called in as cover. Not a manager renowned for taking risks, Strachan has faced calls to start McGregor, who has yet to make his senior international debut. The in-form Celtic midfielder has been playing well this season and scored two fine goals against Hibs to help maintain his side’s long domestic unbeaten run last weekend. He is unlikely to look out of place in Scotland’s engine room, although the smart money suggests the conservative Strachan may opt for the more experienced but arguably less effective Barry Bannan. BG Strachan seeks focus and patience for double-header 4) Will Northern Ireland’s ‘dirty’ half-dozen fall off tightrope? Even with second place in their group guaranteed, Northern Ireland cannot afford to relax in their forthcoming matches against Germany and Norway. As preposterously unlikely a scenario as it is, they could still technically overtake Germany with two wins but would need Azerbaijan to beat Joachim Löw’s side in Kaiserslautern next week to do so. Second it is, then, but failure to take any points in their final group games against Germany and Norway could damage their chances of making the play-offs or affect their world ranking and land them against tougher opposition in the eliminators. At Euro 2016 Iceland were the only team with a smaller pool of players than Northern Ireland, so with six of his players only one booking away from a suspension, O’Neill has a problem. Should he rest the players in question, field inadequate replacements and risk two defeats or pick the disciplinary tightrope half-dozen and order them to take it easy? His team’s approach to matches is nothing if not commendably full-blooded and their usual approach may well result in O’Neill losing key players to suspension for any play-off they end up contesting. As somebody who has barely put a foot wrong in his past four years managing Northern Ireland, it is no surprise that O’Neill has said he will not instruct his players to “tiptoe” through these matches. Only time will tell if they take his advice – or lack of it – on board. BG Northern Ireland v Germany has ‘air of a final’ says Löw 5) Will Holland sort their mess? Bidding to avoid the ignominy of failing to qualify for two successive major tournaments, Holland still have an outside chance of making the play-offs, but will have to beat Belarus and score an emphatic win over Sweden to do so. A tall order by any standards, not least considering their recent history. With few young players stepping up, it is perhaps a measure of just how grim things have got for Holland that Arjen Robben remains their most exciting player at the age of 33, while Ryan Babel has earned a recall at the expense of Wesley Sneijder. It gets worse: the coach, Dick Advocaat, has also been singing the praises of the Tottenham flop Vincent Janssen and seems to be pinning his hopes of qualifying for a play-off on Sweden not putting too many goals past Luxembourg. It’s hardly an exaggeration to say the Dutch situation is a total mess, but to paraphrase Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in No Country For Old Men: “If it ain’t it’ll do til the mess gets here.” BG Holland keep hopes alive with win over Bulgaria 6) Senegal must make most of second chance Senegal lie only third in their four-team group but, unlike the leaders Burkina Faso, they know that if they win their remaining matches they will reach the World Cup. That is because they have a game in hand following Fifa’s decision to order a replay of last year’s South Africa-Senegal match, which Bafana Bafana won 2-1 thanks to a penalty awarded by the referee Joseph Lamptey, who has since been banned for life. As a result, Senegal will play South Africa home and away next month – but in order to ensure that they still have their destiny in their hands by then, they must not lose on Saturday at Cape Verde Islands, the other team in the group who know winning their remaining matches will guarantee progress to Russia. Sadio Mané’s team have not been convincing on their travels so far, conceding a late equaliser to 10-man Burkina Faso last month, and will need to demonstrate their superiority against depleted hosts in Praia if next month’s replay is to have the significance they hope. PD South Africa-Senegal qualifier to be replayed after referee ban 7) Super Eagles ready to fly high Nigeria will confirm qualification for the World Cup if they beat second-place Zambia at home on Saturday but that will be no straightforward feat. The Super Eagles may have won in Lusaka last year – and, in fact, have not lost to Zambia since a friendly defeat 20 years ago – but the Chipolopopo have improved as this group has progressed, as exciting young talents such as the 19-year-old midfielder Enok Mwepu and the 18-year-old striker Patson Daka helped fire them to home and away wins over Algeria last month. But Nigeria have a wealth of young talent too – Moses Simon should continue dazzling – as well as the relative veterans who helped to inspire last month’s 4-0 thrashing of Cameroon, Victor Moses and Mikel Jon Obi. Even Odion Ighalo was impressive in that match and may retain his starting place ahead of Kelechi Iheanacho, while Alex Iwobi will probably have to make do with bench duty after returning from injury. Anything other than a home win looks improbable; but a cracking contest is likely. PD Abraham denies intention to switch to Nigeria 8) Crunch showdown in Cardiff The Republic of Ireland have not won a competitive match since their best player, Séamus Coleman, suffered a double leg-break as a result of a tackle by Wales’s Neil Taylor in March. Now the Irish need to win both of their remaining group games if they are to have any hope of qualifying for the play-offs. It is not a foregone conclusion that they will win the first of them – against Moldova on Friday – given that Coleman and Jonathan Walters are injured, Robbie Brady and James McClean are suspended, and Martin O’Neill’s creative approach seems a little haphazard. But even if they beat Moldova, and even if a Gareth Bale-less Wales drop points in Georgia, Ireland will still need to win in Cardiff on Monday and hope results elsewhere go in their favour, because only eight of Europe’s nine runners-up qualify for a play-off. The imperative for victory, coupled with the ill-will spawned by Taylor’s tackle, means the Wales-Ireland match will be a gripping showdown. PD Dave Edwards: ‘I’ll always put the team ahead of myself 9) No margin for error for Australia against Syria The cow-grass pitch to be used in Thursday’s first leg in Malaysia will be bumpy and tricky and evoke memories of the one on which Australia played when drawing with Thailand early in their group campaign, a result that ultimately cost them automatic qualification and forced them into a dicey play-off with Syria. But the pitch was not the only factor in that result: imprecise finishing and the shabby use of a back three were also factors. If those faults are not corrected this week, then Australia’s hopes of reaching a fourth successive World Cup – via another playoff, against either Honduras, Panama or USA, could be dismantled by Syria. The underdogs are well organised and highly spirited and, in Firas Al-Khatib, Omar Kharbin and Omar “The Arabian Zlatan” Al-Soma, they have dangerous attackers who could exploit any defensive shortcomings by the Socceroos. PD John Duerden: Pragmatic Syria have attacking threat to upset Australia 10) European champions bid to get on to the world stage Greece were the last European champions to fail to qualify for the subsequent World Cup but they did not have Cristiano Ronaldo. On the other hand, even if they are only second in their group with two games to go, Portugal have performed better than the Greeks did in the 2006 qualifiers, when they finished fourth in their group behind Ukraine, Turkey and Denmark. Portugal are behind a decent Switzerland side – whom they could leapfrog by winning when the countries go head-to-head in Lisbon on Tuesday. Mind you, both teams have tricky games before that: not in terms of the result – both will certainly win – but of attendant hazards: Portugal’s opponents, Andorra, were absurdly rugged when losing 6-0 (and having two players sent off) when the sides met earlier in the group, so Ronaldo may be spared from playing against them this time; meanwhile, Switzerland may omit the midfielder Ricardo Rodríguez from their meeting with Hungary so that he will not get a yellow card that would rule him out of the duel in Portugal.

Once you know what you are looking for, you can decode the forest floor or riverbank and unlock the secrets of where a badger has been sleeping, what a fox has been eating and where an otter has been playing. You will need beady eyes – and occasionally a willingness to sniff some horrid things – but you will be rewarded with new insight into the lives of some of Britain’s most delightful mammals. If you want to know for sure which wild beasts are waiting in the woods or hills near you, learning the signs of these five critters is a good place to start. Fox First, learn what a dog’s pawprint looks like, for elimination purposes: that’s the one you are most likely to find in the countryside. Both animals have four toes, but dog prints tend to be square-shaped, says veteran tracker Simone Bullion, a senior conservation adviser at Suffolk Wildlife Trust. “A fox has quite a small palm pad and if you drew a box around the print it would be rectangular. It is a narrow print; they are quite delicate-looking.” Fox droppings are long and thin, between little finger and index finger size. “They usually have a long, wispy end,” says Bullion. They are often greyish, “because they tend to contain the fur of things such as rabbits. But if a fox has been eating blackberries it will be purpley”. Badger “Badgers have a bean-shaped palm pad, very large compared to the size of the toes,” says Bullion. The toes in front of the pad will be almost aligned and the front paws leave a distinctive claw mark. Be aware that badger tracks can be deceptive: they have five toes, but sometimes the fifth toe doesn’t print. Look for their setts in banks – the entrance will be around 30cm (1ft) across. “Badgers are fantastic excavators, so they would excavate a large amount of soil, which would be in front of the hole.” Want to know what a badger has been eating? Look for a small pit of droppings near the sett. If it is filled with what looks like diarrhoea, that means they have been munching earthworms. “Badgers tend to deposit their droppings in a pit they have dug themselves,” says Bullion. “You might find several pits close by in a small area, invariably made by the same badger or the same badger clan.” Badgers use these pits to mark the boundaries of their territory. Otter Look for large paw prints, with five small toes arranged in a semicircle around the palm pad. With a good print, you might be able to see that the otter’s paw is webbed. The otter is a large animal, but their droppings, called spraints, are surprisingly small. Given the fishy contents, they smell sweet and aromatic. They deposit them in obvious places – obvious to other otters, that is. “They would put them on a tussock of grass, a mound, a molehill, a piece of wood by the water. If there’s only one tree, go to the base of that tree.” The spraints “are crammed with fish bones and scales. When they are fresh, they are very black; old ones turn grey.” Hedgehog If you open up a small, dark, sausage-shaped dropping – about the size of your little finger – and it is crammed with the remnants of insects, such as “beetle wing cases that look quite shiny”, it can only be a hedgehog’s, says Bullion. In long grass, the spiny mammals are almost impossible to find, but you may spot them on lawns or on playing fields. “It is a bit needle-in-a-haystack,” admits Bullion. You probably won’t spot their pawprints in the wild, but you can buy or make a simple tunnel for your garden that you can fill with bait, an ink pad and a sheet of paper to capture a print. Harvest mouse You won’t be able to track droppings or paw prints, but you can spot a harvest mouse’s nest. It is about the size of a tennis ball, says Bullion. “Look for a woven nest in grass, in areas that aren’t regularly mowed. If it is low-growing, tussocky grass – a species such as Ccock’s-foot – they would form a woven nest at the base. In taller grasses, the nest will be higher up – even as high as chest height.” They are made the same way: living blades of grass are shredded and weaved into a ball-shaped nest, which forms part of the plant. This time of year is the best to spot them as surrounding vegetation dies back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/08/councils-fear-surge-in-evictions-as-universal-credit-rollout-accelerates","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T14:37:48Z","webTitle":"Councils fear surge in evictions as universal credit rollout accelerates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/08/councils-fear-surge-in-evictions-as-universal-credit-rollout-accelerates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/08/councils-fear-surge-in-evictions-as-universal-credit-rollout-accelerates","fields":{"headline":"Councils fear surge in evictions as universal credit rollout accelerates","bodyText":"Councils and housing associations are braced for a surge in rent arrears and evictions as the introduction of universal credit accelerates across the country over the next few months. Landlords have signalled they are under increasing financial pressure to open eviction proceedings against tenants amid a rise in rent arrears associated with the new benefit. Ministers declared last week that universal credit was “working”, but on Friday the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said the number of rough sleepers in the city could at least double this winter unless Theresa May halted the much-criticised rollout. The National Housing Federation, which represents 900 housing associations in England, said universal credit was presenting a “significant challenge” to landlords as they worked to keep tenants from becoming homeless. Croydon council in south London, which piloted the universal credit full service, renewed its calls for a pause in the rollout. It said it would spend £3m this year helping thousands of tenants in arrears to avoid eviction, and said the 50% increase in support costs was unsustainable. “The government needs to slow down this full rollout process and consider lessons from pilot areas like ours or face a bad situation becoming much worse,” said Alison Butler, the council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for homes, regeneration and planning. Meanwhile, a Guardian investigation into people’s experiences of universal credit suggests there are widespread fears of eviction compounded by stressful and frustrating interactions with benefits bureaucracy. Claimants worry they will be made homeless because of rent arrears accumulated over the minimum 42-day wait for a first benefit payment. Others say the stress of dealing with the system, and its impact on their finances, has affected their mental health. Although the principle of universal credit was widely welcomed as a way of simplifying the benefits system, there is increasing concern that in practice its complexity and design shortcomings are failing some of the very people it was meant to help. “If claimants fall foul of just one of the many confusing rules, punishing pay schedules or unreliable computer systems dotted around this assault course, we know the outcome in all too many cases is either grinding poverty or destitution,” said Frank Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee. The work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, has rejected calls – including from 14 backbench Tory MPs – to pause the rollout while design flaws are fixed. In his party conference speech he described universal credit as a step towards a Tory vision of the modern welfare state that was “compassionate, practical and aspirational”. However, landlords are already reporting universal credit-related evictions, although many insist they open proceedings as a last resort and often only when tenants refuse to engage with attempts to help them settle arrears. A possession order is just the first stage and does not automatically lead to an eviction. Halton Housing Trust, a fifth of whose households are now on the full digital universal credit service, has reported a 100% increase year on year in the number of tenants against whom it has started eviction proceedings. Seven tenants owed arrears of at least £2,000 more than they had before going on to the benefit. Croydon council said it would spend an extra £1m this year to protect tenants from homelessness. In the first quarter of this year it issued 959 special housing payments to help households maintain tenancies, compared with 529 in the same period last year. Without this support, hundreds of tenants would have become homeless, it said. Gloucester City Homes, which has been operating the interim universal credit service, has evicted eight tenants, or 12% of all those in receipt of universal credit. In one case, a “model tenant” who always paid on time received a possession notice after an eight-week wait for payment led him into arrears of more than £500. Curo Group housing association in Bath, with 16 months’ experience of universal credit, has sought 160 court orders against tenants since April, up from 130 in the same period the previous year. It says it will not always take action against tenants it knows have fallen into arrears directly as a result of universal credit payment delays. Sarah Seeger, the head of customer accounts at Curo, said: “We have a concern that the rapid expansion will put the universal credit system under severe pressure and we’ll see a deterioration of the quality and timeliness of the service, the consequences of which will be very difficult to manage for customers on low or in some cases no income.” Landlords say continuing increases in the number of tenants going into arrears as universal credit is rolled out are financially unsustainable and will affect the ability to build new homes. Many landlords have increased the levels of cash they have to set aside to cover bad debts related to arrears. Sue Ramsden, head of policy at the National Housing Federation, said housing associations were working hard with tenants to sustain tenancies and minimise arrears. “The introduction of universal credit is presenting a significant challenge for housing providers and their tenants,” she said. “Despite some assurances from the Department for Work and Pensions that the process to assess claims has improved, we still have real concerns around the impact of the long wait for families on very low incomes to receive the benefit.” A DWP spokesperson said: “The best way to help people pay their rent is to help them into work and under universal credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. We also know that over time people adjust to managing monthly payments, and clear their arrears. “We continue to work closely with landlords, local authorities and other organisations to ensure claimants are supported. The majority of people are comfortable managing their money but budgeting advice, benefit advances and direct rent payments to landlords can be provided for those who need it.” The Scottish government, which has called for a halt to universal credit, has used its devolved powers to introduce flexibilities to the way the new benefit is administered in an attempt to prevent rent arrears and make it easier for tenants to cope with the financial shock of the switch. Scottish tenants moving to universal credit will be able to choose to be paid fortnightly and request that the housing benefit element is paid directly to their landlord. Many tenants, especially those who are used to weekly or fortnightly budgets, have struggled to budget using a system that pays people on a monthly basis. Scotland’s minister for social security, Jeane Freeman, said: “We have no powers to deal with the worst aspects of universal credit, including delayed payments, cuts to the work allowances, and the appalling ‘rape clause’ applied to the tax credits within universal credit. But where we do have powers, we act to improve where we can this flawed UK benefit.” The Guardian’s investigation found common reports of problems such as incorrect and irregular payments to claimants, claims being closed without explanation, myriad IT errors, difficulties in contacting benefits officials and lengthy waits for mistakes to be corrected. The investigation heard accounts from 68 claimants. Their stories tallied closely with the findings of surveys by charities such as Citizens Advice and evidence from claimants submitted to the Commons work and pensions select committee. Several claimants complain about the high cost of using an official 0345 helpline to try to resolve benefit errors. One told the Guardian: “Not only does it cost money to get through, my maximum [call length] has been just shy of an hour. Not great when you can’t buy a tin of beans to keep you alive.” A common complaint is that some universal credit staff struggle with the complicated rules. Some claimants report they have been given contradictory advice by different officials for the same problem. One self-employed businessman told the Guardian: “I spend an insane amount of time dealing with universal credit and still have to chase my payments every month when [they] are not paid. Having everything in one place is theoretically a good idea. In reality, it is incredibly frustrating.” Another person said the system was not responsive to the very different needs and circumstances of claimants. “It claims to be an easy system that benefits everyone and gives you a fair assessment. However, it extricates human interaction from the process and in doing so cannot cater to individual needs and cases.” There are signs that claimants do not welcome the prospect of moving into the new system. One respondent reported that she anticipated having no money for the Christmas period after she moves on to universal credit at the end of November, when her son turns five and her benefit circumstances change. “Universal credit will give me a loan [to tide her over the six-week waiting period for a first payment] but that is just putting me in more debt than I’m already in. I don’t think I can afford to pay it back. So how can I feed us and heat our house up, as well as get my son some presents for Christmas?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-intelligent-gambler-gun-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T15:25:09Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas shooter recalled as intelligent gambler well-versed on gun rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-intelligent-gambler-gun-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-intelligent-gambler-gun-rights","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas shooter recalled as intelligent gambler well-versed on gun rights","bodyText":"An Australian man who came to know Stephen Paddock intimately in recent years has offered the most detailed public portrait yet of the Las Vegas mass killer. He said Paddock was a highly intelligent, strategic though “guarded” individual who won a fortune applying algorithms to gambling, and studied arguments for his right to own weapons under the US constitution. Their encounters came via their respective girlfriends, Philippine-born sisters – one of whom, Marilou Danley, has returned to the US to be interviewed by the FBI in the wake of Paddock’s meticulously planned massacre. Their acquaintanceship, through more than half a dozen encounters in the US and the Philippines between 2013 and 2015, revealed Paddock’s generosity – which had his overseas guests living in “palatial” style – and the existence of a “gun room” at his home in Mesquite, Nevada. “Yes, I was familiar with him,” the man, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian at his Brisbane home on Wednesday. “He was extremely intelligent, methodical, conservative – guarded – and strategic. A planning, thinking type of guy.” But nothing at the time, including their “robust” discussions about US gun laws, rang alarm bells to suggest that he was capable of “such an inhumane, terrible, vicious act”. Investigators hope Danley can provide clues to unlock the motives that drove her partner to a premeditated onslaught that killed 59 and injured more than 500 at a country music concert. Paddock reportedly dispatched Danley to the Philippines and wired her $100,000 before carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history on Sunday night. The Brisbane man said he met Paddock “on a number of occasions” in the Philippines, where the sisters’ family held reunions. They also met up in in Reno, California, and in Las Vegas, where the man and his then partner stayed in extravagant accommodation courtesy of Paddock via casinos where he was a frequent and prodigious gambler. “We lived fairly palatially for quite some time,” the man said. “That was quite a lovely experience and he was a generous man.” The couples also met at the Venice Beach home of Danley’s daughter, who is a successful entrepreneur in Los Angeles. The man says he further spent time with Paddock at his apartment in Reno opposite a casino that was his regular haunt, as a well as “a fair degree of time” at the home Paddock shared with Danley in Mesquite, Nevada. It was on that first stay in Mesquite that Paddock gestured in passing to his “gun room”. Its presence in the two-bedroom home made an impression on the man – who opposes the US’s lax gun laws – but he “didn’t pursue it” with Paddock. “His comments were that it’s a substantial hobby that needs to be protected: ‘a gun room’,” the man said. Paddock did not take him inside or show off his collection of weapons, “nor was I interested – it was left at that”. What did pique the Australian’s curiosity was Paddock’s way of making a living, “as I’d not met a professional gambler” before. Paddock was forthcoming in “great detail” on matters from his “float”, or cash gambling base, to his annual income, which was “very much well over a senior executive’s wage in the US”. “And how he obtained that: the algorithms behind his methodology of gambling – only on machines, not on tables,” he said. The men came to have “robust conversations” about the second amendment of the US constitution and the right to bear arms. It is a debate the Australian said he had had many times – but Paddock’s grasp of the detail seemed superior to most defenders of the second amendment. “I’ve asked that question of many people I know from the US, and sadly enough, the answer is very similar in many ways: that people have this belief that the constitutional amendment is their right, with very little understanding of the content of that actual bill,” the man said. “I think it’d be fair to say [Paddock] indicated to me that he certainly knew more than most.” Asked if he could reconcile what he knew of Paddock’s personality and his brutal acts in Las Vegas, the man said it was “unimaginable” to foresee this in anyone. “It’s not within my nature to see the activity that is generating this terrible loss and tragedy into the demeanour of any individual that I’ve met,” he said. “I could never really imagine that another human being could bring such an inhumane, terrible, vicious act upon any single soul – let alone the many hundreds and literally thousands of people that this horrible situation will impact for many, many years to come.” Danley’s two Australian-based sisters also on Wednesday told Australia’s Channel Seven she would be haunted by what her partner had done. “No one can put the puzzles together,” one said. They said they were shocked to discover their sister had arrived in the Philippines two weeks ago at the sudden urging of Paddock, who then wired her $100,000. “She didn’t even know that she was going to the Philippines until Steve said, ‘Marilou, I found you a cheap ticket to the Philippines,’” her sister said. Paddock’s motive remains unclear, but investigators said Danley’s arrival in the US could hasten their inquiry. “The investigation with her is ongoing and we anticipate some further information from her shortly,” the Clark County sheriff, Joseph Lombardo, told reporters. Lombardo said he is “absolutely” confident authorities will determine Paddock’s motive. Danley arrived in the Philippines on 15 September, according to immigration documents obtained by the AP. She departed on 22 September, travelling on an Australian passport, then returned three days later on a flight from Hong Kong. “They don’t know a lot about who the girlfriend is and why she left the country a week prior to the shooting,” said Nevada senator Dean Heller, who had been briefed by authorities. “She is someone they need to have this discussion with to better understand the shooting and what his thought process was.” On Tuesday, officials offered new information on Paddock and how he planned the attack. An agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said that 47 firearms had now been found in three different locations, including the hotel room in Las Vegas, and Verde and Mesquite, Nevada. Of those weapons, 12 had devices known as bump stocks attached that allowed semi-automatic rifles to mimic fully automatic gunfire. The ATF agent, Jill Snyder, said officials had determined the devices were legal. The weapons – rifles, shotguns, pistols – were purchased in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas, she said. The sheriff’s office also released police body camera footage of officers responding during the shooting. The rapid gunfire bursts can be heard as officers shelter beside a wall and yell at civilians to “get back”. One video shows officers beside a patrol car when one is shot. The first report to police came at 10.08pm and Paddock continued to fire for “somewhere between nine and 11 minutes”, officials said. Police also confirmed on Tuesday that Paddock had set up cameras inside and outside his room, including two in the hallway and one in the peephole of his hotel room door. “I anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody,” Lombardo said at an afternoon press conference. The evidence offers an insight into Paddock’s careful planning of the shooting. Lombardo said: “I’m pretty sure he evaluated everything that he did in his actions, which is troubling.” Lombardo added: “It’s an ongoing investigation and when I say I don’t know, I may know … I assure you this investigation is not ended with the demise of Mr Paddock.” Leaked photographs from inside Paddock’s suite show an array of assault rifles strewn about the room including at least one AR-15 and AK-47 and shell casings littering the floor. Some of the reported 23 guns were mounted on bipods to steady shooting. Some were also clearly outfitted with bump stocks. Many of the weapons were also fitted with extended-capacity cartridges to hold a high volume of ammunition and with advanced scopes for accuracy. An anonymous hotel worker told the New York Times Paddock had checked in on Thursday and kept the “do not disturb” sign on his door for the next three days so no maids checked the room. Donald Trump is set to travel to Las Vegas with the first lady, Melania Trump, on Wednesday to meet with public officials, emergency responders and some of those injured in the attack. Trump told reporters as he boarded his helicopter en route: “Well, it’s a very sad thing. We’re going to pay our respects and to see the police who have done really a fantastic job in a very short time. And yeah they’re learning a lot more. And that’ll be announced at the appropriate time. It’s a very, very sad day for me, personally. Thank you.” On Tuesday, asked about the prospect of gun control measures in response to the murders, the president said “we’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by”.

Their win is for work on a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy that has allowed scientists to study biological molecules in unprecedented sharpness, not least the Zika virus and proteins thought to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease. Being able to capture images of these biological molecules at atomic resolution not only helps scientists to understand their structures, but has opened up the possibility of exploring biological processes by stitching together images taken at different points in time. Experts add that the information gleaned through cryo-electron microscopy has proved valuable in helping scientists to develop drugs. “It has been used in visualising the way in which antibodies can work to stop viruses being dangerous, leading to new ideas for medicines as just one example,” said Daniel Davis, professor of immunology at the University of Manchester. Why do we need cryo-electron microscopy? Microscopes allow scientists to look at structures that cannot be seen with the naked eye – but when these structures are very tiny, it is no longer possible to use rays of light to do the job because their wavelengths are not short enough. Instead, beams of electrons can be used – with a technique known as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) – or scientists can employ a method known as x-ray crystallography in which x-rays are scattered as they pass through samples, creating patterns that can be analysed to reveal the structure of molecules. The trouble is, x-ray crystallography relies on biological molecules forming ordered structures, which many fail to do, and the technique does not allow researchers to probe how molecules move. Historically, TEM also presented difficulties. The beam itself fried the biological molecules being studied, while the technique involved the use of a vacuum which resulted in biological molecules drying out and collapsing, throwing a spanner in the works when it came to probing their structure. This year’s chemistry laureates tackled these conundrums, enabling scientists to use TEM to image biological molecules in incredible resolution. What did they do? Henderson and his team, using a glucose solution to prevent molecules drying out, combined a weaker beam of electrons with images taken from many angles and mathematical approaches to build up a 3D image of a protein neatly organised within a biological membrane. It was a breakthrough moment. Henderson later succeeded in unveiling its 3D structure at atomic resolution – a first for a protein. Meanwhile Frank developed ingenious image processing techniques to unpick TEM data and build up images of biological molecules as they are in solution, where they point in many different directions. Dubochet came up with a sophisticated approach to prevent molecules from drying out. Henderson’s technique did not work for water-soluble biological molecules, while freezing samples resulted in the formation of ice crystals which caused damage and made the resulting images challenging to interpret. Dubochet’s solution was to rapidly cool samples at such speed that the water molecules did not have time to adopt a regular structure. Rather, they were left pointing every which way, resulting in a glass within which biological molecules were frozen in time – in their natural shape. What’s next? The trio’s work, and subsequent efforts to perfect these approaches, has already led to astonishing developments. “The technique of cryo-TEM has really opened up the molecular world of the cell to direct observation,” said Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London. Among the processes it has made clearer is the mechanism by which DNA is copied into the single-stranded molecule RNA. But the future is also exciting, with scientists using the technique to probe the structure of drug targets, as well as components within cells involved in sensing pain, temperature and pressure. Further improvements in resolution are also afoot. “Cryo-electron microscopy is one of those techniques so basic and important that its use spans all of biology – including understanding the human body and human disease and in designing new medicines,” said Davis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/womens-lifestyle-magazines","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"I bought my first magazine aged six – and I’ve never looked back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/womens-lifestyle-magazines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/womens-lifestyle-magazines","fields":{"headline":"I bought my first magazine aged six – and I’ve never looked back","bodyText":"I think the first magazine I bought with my “own” money was an official Sindy doll magazine.

The Sindy magazines were very pink and I loved them, but as a teen my tastes shifted wildly. Between 12 and 16, I made room for that dentist waiting room stalwart, Reader’s Digest, becoming obsessed with the idea of publishing a joke in its pages one day. I also gleaned questionable “wisdom” from the pages of J-17 and More!, learning things I had no business knowing. At uni, I went through a mild fake-ladette cycle and subscribed to trashy and upscale men’s magazines that now make me cringe. I went through a Vogue stage, as many young women do (alongside Marie Claire and Elle). As a resident of the city in my 30s, I have subscribed to the New Yorker because I never met a cliche I could not inhabit. Most recently, I have started reading a certain sort of women’s lifestyle magazine – made for women wealthier and more concerned with ageing than I am, as far as I can see – and found my happy place. There is a distinct pleasure in reading, for example, an 86-word piece titled How To Rake Leaves With Ease. To be clear: I live three flights up, have no outside space and don’t own a rake.

The windows offer a panoramic view of central London, which turns out to be perfect for illustrating her conversation. You can see Regent’s Park, where Mick Jagger took her for a walk after lunch in 1967 and convinced her to leave her job as a backing vocalist for Ike and Tina Turner and become a solo singer; she signed to Immediate, the record label founded by the Stones’ Svengali-like manager Andrew Loog Oldham. Over there is Soho, where the studios were and where Arnold recorded umpteen sessions, gradually notching up one of the most extraordinary CVs in pop. She is presumably the only artist in history who can claim to have worked with Nick Drake and the KLF. “Trident, that was down by Denmark Street,” she remembers, her face lighting up. When she smiles, she looks almost eerily unchanged, as girlish at 70 as she was in the late 60s. “That’s where I sang with Dr John. Fan-tastic! He had all the voodoo stuff on, he was lighting incense and doing the whole gris-gris thing. It was like New Orleans in that place.” Arnold is back in London from her home in Spain to promote a new solo album, which in itself seems astonishing. The last time she released one, it was 1968 and she was, as the slogan had it, The First Lady of Immediate, author of a string of Summer of Love hit singles: The First Cut Is the Deepest, Angel of the Morning, If You Think You’re Groovy. To complicate matters further, the “new” album she’s promoting is actually 47 years old. Recorded in 1969 and 1970, but shelved as a result of what she describes with a sigh as “politics, politics, politics”, The Turning Tide is fantastic, blessed with a supporting cast that gives you an idea of the regard Arnold was held in by the era’s rock aristocracy. Half of it was written and produced by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, the rest by Eric Clapton, with the nascent Derek and the Dominoes as her backing band; the Stones’ touring saxophonist Bobby Keys performs on it, as do Elton John’s sometime backing band Hookfoot. After it was shelved, she says, she spent years trying to track down the master tapes and attributes its eventual appearance, at least in part, to taking up meditation. Hang on: meditation? She nods. “I was thinking about retiring, I was getting stressed out with work. So I stopped and I just worked on myself. I really got into meditating and doing affirmations. And then it seemed like that all those affirmations, I suddenly became them – I started being more positive and started attracting positive things and here I am, you know?” If all this seems extraordinary, pretty much everything about PP Arnold’s career is extraordinary, not least the fact that she never intended to become a singer in the first place. At 17, she was already a wife and mother of two, working two jobs and trapped in an abusive marriage in California, when two friends called and asked her to accompany her to an audition for the Ikettes. “She goes: ‘Pat, you gotta help us, the third girl’s dropped out.’ I said, straight away: ‘I can’t go, my husband won’t let me.’ They came anyway, and the next thing I know I’m at Ike and Tina’s house and we’re singing Dancing in the Streets. Tina says: ‘Right, you got the gig.’ I’m like: ‘Oh no, not me, I’ve got to go home, my husband doesn’t know I’m here, he’s gonna kick my butt.’ Tina said if I was going to get my butt kicked for nothing, I might as well ride up with them to Fresno and see the show that night. So I went, and it was amazing, and I didn’t get home until six the next morning. My husband was waiting for me at the door. Soon as I walk in, it’s: Bam!” – she mimes throwing a punch – “and it was like he knocked some sense into me, really. I thought: ‘This morning I didn’t have a way out, I was praying to God to show me a path out of this hell I’d created for myself, and now I’ve got a way out.’” She left her children with her parents and went on the road in 1964, touring the chitlin circuit at a time when the south was still segregated – “It was eye-opening: bathrooms for coloureds only; we couldn’t stay in Sheratons or Hiltons, no one would get off the bus when we stopped at a gas station” – and experiencing what she tactfully calls “the pros and cons” of life as an Ikette: “The music was great – the shows, the musicians – and even though he was who he was, Ike was an amazing bandleader. But Tina had kind of saved me from my scene, and I had no idea that she was living the same thing. Ike had all these women and there was physical abuse. Watching her go through that was really hard, because I had already been a victim.” Eventually, the revue fetched up in the UK, supporting the Rolling Stones, with whom Arnold quickly became friends – “I was the one everybody least expected to do that, because I was so shy and introverted, but I hadn’t had a teenage life, because I had kids real young, and I just decided to have fun” – and who encouraged her to stay in the UK. Within six months, she had sent for her children to join her: she was a star and a fixture on the London music scene, nicknamed PP by hip photographer Gered Mankowitz, collaborating with everyone from Rod Stewart to the Small Faces. There’s a great clip of her performing Tin Soldier with the latter on YouTube, dancing in a purple minidress, wearing the smile of someone who can’t quite believe their luck. “Happy to be part of the industry of human happiness,” she says, quoting the old Immediate Records slogan, although not everything about swinging London was quite as permissive and groovy as you might expect. Her relationship with Small Faces frontman Steve Marriott had to be kept secret – “Having an affair with a white guy, that was still really taboo in those days, not only on the white side, on the black side, too” – inspiring her to write her first song, the heartbreaking Though It Hurts Me Badly: “Every time that he sees me, he pretends that he can’t see me.” But after Immediate folded and Barry Gibb and Clapton’s manager Robert Stigwood blocked the release of The Turning Tide, her career floundered. It was as if record labels at the time didn’t know what to do with a black female artist from the soul tradition who didn’t make straightforward soul records. She nods. “You got that spot on. People know me as PP Arnold, American soul singer, but I was produced in England, by English producers, so my sound was unique. But when I went back to the States, people thought my stuff was lame. That was the beginning of my lost time.” After what sounds like a fairly hair-raising experience performing in a rock version of Othello called Catch My Soul alongside PJ Proby – “Who would arrive every day sloppy drunk on that Boone’s Farm apple wine, the cheap stuff” – and late impresario Jack Good, who elected to play the title role himself, in blackface (“Which created some tension”), she spent the 70s trying and failing to get new musical projects off the ground while doing sessions as a backing vocalist. She worked on some incredible albums, not least Nick Drake’s Bryter Layter, but her solo career became a mass of frustrating dead ends, exacerbated by personal tragedy: her eldest daughter Debbie was killed in a car crash in 1977. It was a similar story in the 80s: she appeared in Starlight Express and sang with Peter Gabriel, but another car accident left her temporarily unable to walk. By the end of the decade, she had developed an unlikely sideline singing on house and hardcore hit singles – everything from Altern-8’s E-Vapor-8 to the Beatmasters’ Burn It Up and a succession of tracks with the KLF, whose name causes her face to cloud over: “The deal was that, if they used my solo bits for anything, I got 5%, then they went and burned up all that money before they paid me my 5%.” It took Britpop’s obsession with the 60s to really reinvigorate her career. Leaving a Birmingham theatre where she was appearing in a musical one night in the mid-90s, she found the members of Ocean Colour Scene waiting at the stage door to pay homage. “They had all these flowers with them,” she says. “They wanted me to come with them to their studio around the corner. It was truly a beautiful thing.” The band’s guitarist Steve Cradock is currently producing a solo album for her, to be called The New Adventures of PP Arnold; Paul Weller is among the contributors. For someone who was thinking of retiring not that long ago, everything seems to be happening again: this old album, that new album, a forthcoming autobiography, a tour. It has always been like that, she laughs, right from the moment her girlfriend rang telling her to come to Ike and Tina’s house. “The unexpected always rules in my life,” she says. “Destiny takes over. I just put it in God’s hands and the unexpected brings some kind of situation that’s good for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/jon-boden-afterglow-cd-review-more-somnolent-than-superlative","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:30:30Z","webTitle":"Jon Boden: Afterglow CD review –  more somnolent than superlative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/jon-boden-afterglow-cd-review-more-somnolent-than-superlative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/jon-boden-afterglow-cd-review-more-somnolent-than-superlative","fields":{"headline":"Jon Boden: Afterglow CD review –  more somnolent than superlative","bodyText":"A frock-coated, Matrix-style movie star beholding a burning city before him, Jon Boden presents himself on the cover of Afterglow as the ambitious, genre-busting folk artist he’s always been.

The sturm-und-drang lyrics find an odd partner in the music, however, which largely wallows in a glossy, lovelorn Waterboys-style soundworld. This dilutes the urgency the story really needs; only the ragged guitars in Burning Streets, and the excellent penultimate track, Yellow Lights, driven by dark, low strings, offer that. Throughout, Boden also uses similar images and phrases, so the narrative appears to be circling like a whirlpool, rather than racing on.

Discuss with spoilers","bodyText":"There will be better-reviewed films than Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 in 2017, but most of them will be little-seen art-house confections rather than bona fide blockbusters. This belated sequel to Blade Runner, released 35 years after the first movie hit cinemas, boasts a barely believable rating of 95% “fresh” on the reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. In a five-star review, Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw described it as a “gigantic spectacle of pure hallucinatory craziness”, and there is already talk of its awards-season potential. Did Blade Runner 2049 offer satisfying answers to all of the first movie’s nagging questions, and is there potential for more films in the series? How much did we truly learn about this future world where man and replicant walk the streets hand in hand? Here’s your chance to weigh in on the film’s key talking points. Harrison Ford’s Rick Deckard and replicant identity Does Blade Runner 2049 finally and definitely reveal whether Deckard is a replicant? The answer would seem to be no. Jared Leto’s Niander Wallace teases Harrison Ford’s grizzled ex-cop over his identity during that mesmerising scene at the mogul’s headquarters, but seems to offer no final answer. However, if Deckard and Rachael really were encouraged to meet and fall in love (so that the first replicant child might be born, as Wallace reveals) in the first movie, it would make sense if Deckard is a replicant. Why would Blade Runner’s Eldon Tyrell have invited a mere human cop to mate with his newest model? Still, the question remains an enigma. Who was Ryan Gosling’s K – and why did he have to die? I was a bit disappointed that K wasn’t the son of Deckard and Rachael after all, but was a clone of memory designer Dr Ana Stelline, the true firstborn replicant, designed to mask the identity of his genetically identical twin “sister”. This revelation begs more questions: who cloned Stelline, and what was their motivation? Are there replicant scientists working on the liberation of their people? Or was a sympathetic human replicant maker involved? K’s death also felt like a waste. Did Villeneuve kill off the blade runner to underline the replicant’s existential tristesse, the pointlessness of life when faced with the reality that you are just an ersatz version of the real thing? I also wondered if Stelline’s confinement to that glass dome was a smokescreen to avoid anyone working out that she had replicant DNA? (Surely replicants must have DNA to be able to reproduce.) And does she know her true identity? Her tears up in an early scene in which she examines K’s implanted memories suggesting she at least has an inkling. Ana de Armas’s Joi Joi might just be Blade Runner 2049’s greatest triumph. K’s hologram girlfriend suggests the film’s screenwriters were prepared to imagine artificial intelligence in forms that go beyond the existence of the first movie’s replicants. This is the kind of creative decision that ensures the new film will be seen as a work in its own right, rather than a shallow retread of its predecessor’s ideas. Joi’s existence also leads to fascinating existential questions. If software can empathise, fall in love and fear for its own death, then the idea that the concept of a soul is limited only to homo sapiens becomes even more preposterous. Villeneuve and others may have borrowed a little from Spike Jonze’s even more thoughtful film Her (with some of Westworld’s somewhat trashier prostitute androids thrown in for good measure), but this seems like a fresh addition to the pantheon of sci-fi automata, wouldn’t you agree? Sean Young got a rough deal We can only hope that the actor who played Rachael in the original movie received a weighty cheque for image rights this time around. Young seems to have been brought back to life via Peter Cushing-style “ghosting” techniques (or perhaps has simply been lifted wholesale from the first Blade Runner) when she’s not dead yet. What this says about the movie’s gender politics, when the original film’s male star is allowed to return as an aged version of his former self, while the female lead is killed off to remain young and beautiful for ever, is open to interpretation. Young hasn’t been a Hollywood A-lister since the 1980s – her last performance of note was, perhaps, getting thrown out of an Oscars after-party for not having a ticket in 2012. But surely it was cruel to bring her back digitally and then have her shot in the head within minutes of that spooky appearance in Wallace’s Matrix-like lair? A life less ordinary Blade Runner 2049’s definition of androids as artificial humans rather than robots doesn’t sound much different than the galactic utopian humanoid civilisation imagined by Iain Banks in his sadly unfilmed Culture novels, whose androids were genetically upgraded to live extended lifespans and boast narcotics glands that let them simulate the effects of party drugs but have no hangover. If replicants can reproduce, the boundaries between machine and man presumably come tumbling down, and we have to accept that we are all replicants now, or at least people will be in the future. Are replicants merely the next stage of human evolution? The original Blade Runner’s phrase to describe replicants as “more human than human”, repeated in 2049, has never been more relevant. At least the idea that homo sapiens will evolve into artificial supermen and women, rather than being destroyed by malevolent artificial intelligences, seems rather more appealing than the future predicted by rival sci-fi sagas such as Terminator. Then again, wasn’t the new John Connor in Terminator: Genisys a hybrid of man and machine? And didn’t something similar turn up in the 2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica, when the human-cylon child Hera Agathon was born (and later revealed to be Mitochondrial Eve?) I think we’ve seen this trope somewhere before. The prospect of a sequel One of the reasons Blade Runner 2049 seemed like such a good idea is probably that the first movie left so many plot threads open-ended. Fittingly, the equally nebulous sequel also acts as a standalone film, yet leaves us wanting to discover much more about the world of eternally dusky California and its grimly eccentric inhabitants. Don’t you want to see Wallace get his comeuppance, and find out more about the army of replicants waiting to take over the world? Is Deckard’s daughter really the replicant messiah? And what on this cursed Earth will they have to say to each other?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/05/vast-animal-feed-crops-meat-needs-destroying-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T09:02:58Z","webTitle":"Vast animal-feed crops to satisfy our meat needs are destroying planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/vast-animal-feed-crops-meat-needs-destroying-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/05/vast-animal-feed-crops-meat-needs-destroying-planet","fields":{"headline":"Vast animal-feed crops to satisfy our meat needs are destroying planet","bodyText":"The ongoing global appetite for meat is having a devastating impact on the environment driven by the production of crop-based feed for animals, a new report has warned. The vast scale of growing crops such as soy to rear chickens, pigs and other animals puts an enormous strain on natural resources leading to the wide-scale loss of land and species, according to the study from the conservation charity WWF. Intensive and industrial animal farming also results in less nutritious food, it reveals, highlighting that six intensively reared chickens today have the same amount of omega-3 as found in just one chicken in the 1970s. The study entitled Appetite for Destruction launches on Thursday at the 2017 Extinction and Livestock Conference in London, in conjunction with Compassion in World Farming (CIFW), and warns of the vast amount of land needed to grow the crops used for animal feed and cites some of the world’s most vulnerable areas such as the Amazon, Congo Basin and the Himalayas. The report and conference come against a backdrop of alarming revelations of industrial farming. Last week a Guardian/ITV investigation showed chicken factory staff in the UK changing crucial food safety information. Protein-rich soy is now produced in such huge quantities that the average European consumes approximately 61kg each year, largely indirectly by eating animal products such as chicken, pork, salmon, cheese, milk and eggs. In 2010, the British livestock industry needed an area the size of Yorkshire to produce the soy used in feed. But if global demand for meat grows as expected, the report says, soy production would need to increase by nearly 80% by 2050. “The world is consuming more animal protein than it needs and this is having a devastating effect on wildlife,” said Duncan Williamson, WWF food policy manager. “A staggering 60% of global biodiversity loss is down to the food we eat. We know a lot of people are aware that a meat-based diet has an impact on water and land, as well as causing greenhouse gas emissions, but few know the biggest issue of all comes from the crop-based feed the animals eat.” With 23bn chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks and guinea fowl on the planet – more than three per person – the biggest user of crop-based feed globally is poultry. The second largest, with 30% of the world’s feed in 2009, is the pig industry. In the UK, pork is the second favourite meat after chicken, with each person eating on average 25kg a year in 2015 – nearly the whole recommended yearly intake for all meats. UK nutritional guidelines recommend 45-55g of protein per day, but the average UK consumption is 64-88g, of which 37% is meat and meat products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-cd-review-simon-rattle-lso-christian-gerhaher-magdalena-kozena","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T14:30:26Z","webTitle":"Debussy: Pelléas et Mélisande CD review – luxury casting and vivid performances under Rattle and Sellars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-cd-review-simon-rattle-lso-christian-gerhaher-magdalena-kozena","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-cd-review-simon-rattle-lso-christian-gerhaher-magdalena-kozena","fields":{"headline":"Debussy: Pelléas et Mélisande CD review – luxury casting and vivid performances under Rattle and Sellars","bodyText":"The LSO’s January 2016 performances of Debussy’s opera at the Barbican in London, conducted by Simon Rattle and semi-staged by Peter Sellars, have been beautifully transferred to CD, and the result is a credit to the LSO’s own record label. It’s not a definitive performance – Christian Gerhaher’s Pelléas is too pointed, Magdalena Kozena’s Mélisande too worldly sounding to offer quite the last word on these endlessly elusive characters – but it is an exceptionally vivid one, not least thanks to the expressiveness of those two singers and, one assumes, the experience of working on the characters with the meticulous Sellars. Gerald Finley’s composed yet menacing Golaud is superb, and to have Bernarda Fink and Franz-Josef Selig as Geneviève and Arkel is real luxury casting. Under Rattle’s leadership the orchestra is a true protagonist in the drama; the colours of this great score are constantly evolving, intensifying and receding, and the interludes are wonderfully well played."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/06/europes-business-heads-aim-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-us-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T07:01:27Z","webTitle":"Europe's business heads aim to keep Iran nuclear deal despite US threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/europes-business-heads-aim-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-us-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/06/europes-business-heads-aim-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-us-threat","fields":{"headline":"Europe's business heads aim to keep Iran nuclear deal despite US threat","bodyText":"EU business leaders have said they are prepared to do everything they can to salvage the Iran nuclear deal in the event of a US withdrawal, as the Danish credit agency extended export guarantees to Tehran in the run-up to a showdown with Donald Trump. The US president has reportedly decided to decertify Iran’s compliance with the landmark nuclear deal next week. On Thursday, he told a meeting of US military leaders that Tehran was not living up to the “spirit of the agreement” and cryptically added they were witnessing “the calm before the storm”. If Trump decides not to continue certifying the deal it could unravel, but Europe’s business community hopes the economic benefits of the agreement would encourage Iran to stick to its commitments even if the US falters. Speaking at the Europe-Iran forum in Zurich this week, Helga Schmid, the secretary general of the European External Action Service, reassured business leaders that the EU was committed to the accord, saying that “as Europeans we will do everything to make sure it stays”. Business leaders from Iran and Europe gathered for the two-day conference in Switzerland to explore investment opportunities, but the uncertainty before Trump’s decision has created an atmosphere of apprehension, even though many believe the deal may eventually survive. Trump’s refusal to certify would not automatically mean that sanctions will snap back into place, although that remains as the worst case scenario. Trump said in his first UN address last month that “the Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”, calling it an embarrassment to his country. He has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance in the past, but he has indicated that he may refrain from signing the certification next week, which will throw the ball into the court of Congress. Schmid said on Wednesday that the agreement could not be changed unilaterally, adding: “We have passed a very clear message: the nuclear deal is working and delivering and the world would be less stable without it.” Reporting a 94% increase in Iran-Europe trade in the first half of 2017 from the same period in 2016, Schmid said it was important for Iranians to directly feel the benefits of the deal. She recognised ongoing difficulties with tier-one European banks, and said “as a sign of confidence in our future financial and economic relations, the European commission has proposed to allow the European Investment Bank operating in Iran in the future.” Major banks are still reluctant to handle Iranian transactions, but 30 Iranian banks have been reconnected to Swift electronic banking and more than 200 international lenders have started correspondent relations with their Iranian counterparts. Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, said in New York in September that the country would respond “decisively and resolutely” if the US walked out on the deal, but gave no details. Other Iranian officials have hinted that Iran may continue adhering to the deal provided that the US does not obstruct European investments. Jørn Fredsgaard Sørensen, the director of country, bank and sector risk department at EKF, Denmark’s export credit agency, said it had signed an agreement with Tehran’s finance ministry that would enable the EKF to provide 100% guarantees on financing to those willing to export Danish goods to Iran, even if sanctions were snapped back. Danske bank, the largest lender in Denmark, has also signed an agreement with 10 Iranian banks. “This should hopefully give comfort to banks that are not yet willing to work with Iran that they can work with Iran because we show our commitment to it,” Sørensen told the Guardian on the sidelines of Europe-Iran forum. “I think the Europeans are committed to the nuclear deal but we also believe in it because, if we didn’t believe that Europeans would uphold the agreement, then we shouldn’t be issuing these types of guarantees. “The right way is to keep interacting with Iran, if we in the west want Iran to be included in the western family of nations is we shouldn’t shut them off. We should engage with them and only if we engage with them can we have a dialogue and criticise if we think there’s something to criticise.” Austrian and Italian credit agencies have struck similar agreements with Iran, extending export guarantees and credit lines. Austria’s Oberbank has recently signed agreements with 14 Iranian banks to finance Austrian projects. A senior executive at a European multinational company, who asked to remain anonymous, said he expected the US president to decertify the deal but he believed it would not amount to the end of the agreement. “There is a lot of serious diplomacy by Europeans at all levels from prime ministers to policymakers to make sure the agreement would survive and there are talks of retaliatory legislation or protective legislations like the ones in place in early 2000s,” he said. Seyed Mohammad Eslami, a business commentator attending the forum, said there were mixed feelings in Iran about the future of the deal. “People are worried about what Trump would do on 15 October, but businesses are still continuing with the assumption that the deal will survive,” he said. “Europe would have to have a plan B, not only to ensure the durability of the agreement but also to protect their own interest because a lot of Europeans have already invested in Iran.” Adnan Tabatabai, the chief executive at the Bonn-based Carpo thinktank, said: “Europe needs to make sure that Iran gets enough economic and political benefit to keep complying with the deal. “That means continuing the effort to incentivise European businesses to invest in the Iranian market and develop creative financing mechanism to guarantee that that would happen despite US pressure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/oct/05/front-pew-why-churches-can-make-perfect-catwalk-venues","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:48:21Z","webTitle":"Front pew: why churches can make perfect catwalk venues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/oct/05/front-pew-why-churches-can-make-perfect-catwalk-venues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/oct/05/front-pew-why-churches-can-make-perfect-catwalk-venues","fields":{"headline":"Front pew: why churches can make perfect catwalk venues","bodyText":"Churches are for everyone, not just Christians. The first promise that would-be priests make to the Church of England is “to serve the community in which they are set, bringing to the church the needs and hopes of all the people”. No wiggle room there. And, as unlikely as it seems, that rubric has extended to the world of fashion, with places of worship commonly becoming venues for shows. In most instances, it is hard to see how anyone could be offended by what is on display. Reports on Gucci’s eccentric and colourful pre-spring/summer cruise collection at Westminster Abbey and Alexa Chung’s quiet, minimal show at the Danish Church of St Katharine in Regent’s Park last summer saw them as suitable venues. Most recently, French label Jacquemus used the Church of Saint-Merri, which openly supports gay marriage, a choice that makes perfect sense. Places of worship are no longer novel venues, but rather good fits for the creative narratives of some fashion shows. The reception has not always been positive, though. Last month at London fashion week, some of the hardcore faithful had their skirts blown up by an apparently “blasphemous” collection by rising star, Dilara Findikoglu, which took place at St Andrew Holborn, London, with reports “that models dressed as devils and vampires sashayed in front of the altar”. Among those unhappy with Findikoglu’s show was the theologian Dr Adrian Hilton, who wrote on his blog: “How is it possible that a sacred space can be used for what can only be described as Lucifer lauding? How does hosting a Satanic Fashion Show glorify God?” At this stage, we could make some theological points: doesn’t the doctrine of the atonement (Jesus’s death on the cross) mean that devil-worship is defeated once and for all? So can’t we just laugh and point at it like a piece of Commedia Dell’Arte? And how does all this outrage over a fashion show sit with a Jesus who, according to the texts, hung out with harlots and people in rags? There are plenty of us who believe that the church should try to emulate the medieval model and act as a secular, as well as a sacred, space during the week. True, this would have been an easier call in the days when community outreach amounted to keeping new-born lambs warm or ladling soup (though there’s precious few of us meeting even that threshold today). But what to do when we want to share our lovely churches with all sorts, including fashion designers wanting to show off their wares? I’ve hosted debates and conferences in churches on secular subjects – though for me, there is no secular subject that isn’t religious – ranging from the death penalty to City regulation. And one thing I do find quite pleasing is how these events can draw in a new type of demographic: people who wouldn’t normally come to churches. And now that demographic includes some of the fashion industry. At this stage, I concede soup kitchens are a very different beast to fashion shows. And I do have a problem with churches being used solely as commercial venues. When I took an idea for a series of plays to Canon Lucy Winkett, at London’s St James’s Church, Piccadilly, I was struck by her observation that it’s important to “have a conversation” with the place that you’re staging an event at. Again, yes, all subject matter is within the remit of the church, but it’s important to ask whether the show and the venue in question are suitably matched architecturally, culturally and aesthetically. A church or an abbey isn’t just anywhere – even, I’d suggest, to most of the irreligious. But this edict should be applied universally. I’ve bridled at wedding couples who have asked to be married at our church because it’s handy for the reception, which seems to signal that this conversation with the place hasn’t occurred. But the question that sparks that conversation – “Why do we want to be married in church?” – seems to me to be no more potent a question than: “Why do we want to hold a fashion show there?” We’re talking about a difference between a venue and a place, steeped in human history, its joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, accumulated for telling our common story. Eight years ago, I criticised the fashion industry in another newspaper during a shock-rev period that I now regret. It is something I would like to retract today, not least because of the po-faced and sanctimonious responses to recent fashion events in churches from some of my fellow clergy. It is unfair to say the fashion industry is solely commercial and venal. Clothing is part of our identity as human beings. It shows us who we are. It shows us who other people are. It may not be its intention, but it distinguishes the poor, who are always with us. And it is also art. • This article was amended on 6 October 2017.

They defended brilliantly after a slightly concerning start and scored a cracking goal to win the game in the first half, Jeff Hendrick sweeping home after a flowing move. They never looked like conceding after taking the lead, restricting Everton to nothing in the second half. It helped, of course, that Everton are utterly useless. I won’t bother running through why again – no point going over old ground, everyone knows the problem by now. Ronald Koeman is under huge pressure now. Burnley rise to sixth place, having taken 12 points from their first seven matches and maintained their unbeaten away record, but Everton stay 16th, two points above the bottom three. Huge cheers in the away end, loud boos from the home fans. For the second time in the space of three days, Everton walk off the pitch to the sound of jeers from the Goodison Park crowd. 90 min+4: Koeman is telling the fourth official that chestball is a penalty. Look it up, you fool! 90 min+3: Williams heads a cross on, Calvert-Lewin heads it goalwards and again Lowton deflects it wide, the ball going just past the post. Everton wail for a penalty again, but it clearly came off Lowton’s chest. 90 min+1: There will be four minutes of this swill for Everton fans to enjoy. 90 min: Sandro’s pass inside is cut out by Barnes, who buys a foul off Rooney. Burnley are eating up time. 88 min: Ashley Barnes replaces Jeff Hendrick, the Burnley goalscorer. Ronald Koeman, meanwhile, has sought an explanation from Jon Moss about his refusal to award Everton a penalty. It’s because it wasn’t an intentional handball. 87 min: Baines and Sigurdsson combine to release Calvert-Lewin, who scuffs a shot straight at Pope. 85 min: The corner’s cleared. Everton are camped in Burnley’s half now, though, and Davies winds up for a shot from the edge of the area. It looks to be heading towards the top left corner, but Wood heads it away. 84 min: Sigurdsson chips a cross to the far post from right. Rooney’s header hits Lowton’s outstretched arm and goes behind. Everton scream for a penalty, but it wasn’t intentional. 82 min: Sandro Ramirez replaces Oumar Niasse. Ronald was right! Moments later, Rooney shoots from 30 yards, but it isn’t 2003. 81 min: Gueye blams another shot over the bar. This is execrable from Everton. 79 min: Davies is furious after another potential award of a corner goes against Everton. 77 min: Strange to think Manchester City lost 4-0 to Everton in January. 74 min: Mee misses a cross from the right. The ball falls to Rooney, whose shot’s deflected wide by Tarkowski. Burnley deal with the corner, although they’re just starting to fall back a little and invite Everton on. 71 min: Arfield goes on a powerful surge down the right, a run that’s only stopped by a clumsy foul by Niasse, who’s lucky not to get booked. 70 min: Wood nods down a long free-kick and almost finds Hendrick in the Everton area. Pickford’s there. 69 min: Martina crosses, Calvert-Lewin heads wide. Tom Davies replaces Nikola Vlasic. 68 min: Baines’s cross causes a moment of uncertainty in the Burnley defence. Mee wallops his clearance straight into the unwitting Hendrick, who’s relieved to see the ball loop back to Pope. 67 min: Burnley counter for the first time in a while and the clever Arfield plays Brady through on the left. Williams is playing him onside. He wants to find Wood at the far post, but Pickford smartly gets in the way of his cross. 64 min: Gylfi Sigurdsson sends a shot well over the bar. He was worth £50m to Swansea. I’m not sure he’s worth that much to Everton. 63 min: This is Everton’s first good move of the half. Baines’s cross finds Niasse, who nods wide. At which point, enter Wayne. The disappointing Schneiderling departs, Rooney comes on. 61 min: What is Everton’s plan here? What are they trying to do? On the touchline, Wayne Rooney is readying himself. 60 min: Defour’s down. The physio’s on. I’m not sure what the problem is. 58 min: Niasse’s pressure on Mee seems to have done enough to win a corner for Everton, but not for the first time a goal-kick’s incorrectly awarded. Up the other end, Baines is harshly booked for a late tackle on Brady, who was sharper than the left-back to a loose ball. 55 min: Calvert-Lewin’s tame shot from 25 yards drifts straight into Pope’s clutches. 54 min: Baines hoicks a cross out for a goal-kick. 52 min: Williams pings a straight pass out for a goal-kick. This is grim. 51 min: After Burnley clear the corner, Gueye wafts a shot miles over from 25 yards. 50 min: Sigurdsson sprays a pass out to Martina on the right. He wins a corner. 49 min: Calvert-Lewin’s booked for a late tackle on Arfield. 48 min: A loose ball runs to Vlasic, whose shot’s blocked by Tarkowski. 46 min: Burnley get the second half underway. There were suggestions that Tom Davies was going to come on for Everton, but he’s still got his tracksuit top on. “I think that Arfield’s ‘dive’ falls into the category where it’s not a penalty, but it’s not a booking either,” says Matt Loten. “A lot of pundits and, seemingly, referees appear to think that it has to be one or the other, but sometimes it’s just a coming together. Penalty? Nah. Dive? Not for me, Clive.” Jon Moss’s whistle is greeted by boos from the Everton fans, but don’t let that obscure the fact that Burnley, in front thanks to a lovely goal from Jeff Hendrick, are 45 minutes plus stoppage time away from going sixth in the Premier League. 45 min: There will be one added minute. 44 min: Burnley are pressing strongly as the half draws to a close. A loose clearance falls to Cork on the edge of the area, but Schneiderlin deflects his shot over. Keane heads Brady’s corner away. “I think we may be witnessing the first game in a brand new derby,” says JR in Illinois. “With Everton’s sleeves adorned with “Angry Birds” and Burnley’s sporting “Play Golf Clash” I believe we have the first “Crap Mobile Phone Game App Sleeve Sponsor Derby”. Amazing world we live in, innit?” 42 min: Ashley Williams, who’s always good for one howler a game, smashes a clearance straight into a Burnley player and the ball runs back into the area for Arfield. Williams almost compounds the error when he tries to tackle Arfield, who collapses to the ground after minimal contact from the Everton defender. Penalty? No, Jon Moss rules it was a dive and books Arfield. A tight call. 41 min: Ward dashes down the left and knocks in a very good cross that’s just too high for the unmarked Wood in the middle. 40 min: Niasse’s shot from the left bobbles well wide of the far post. 39 min: Defour picks up a booking for dissent. 36 min: Vlasic’s cross drifts out for a goal-kick. He isn’t finding it easy. 34 min: Wood heads the corner away. 33 min: Niasse scoots to the byline on the left and wins a corner. 32 min: “WHY ARE YOU SO DEEP?!” an Everton fan shouts. 31 min: Hendrick slides a low ball across the Everton area from the left. This time, there’s no one there, but Burnley are making hay down the left. 30 min: Gueye’s long-range effort swerves wide. 28 min: This is good from Wood, who chases a long clearance and forces Williams to concede a corner. 27 min: The first howls from the home fans. 23 min: This is going to be a huge test of character for Everton now. They had been looking fairly impressive, but there’s a danger that the mood inside Goodison Park could turn if they’re behind for long. This is a brilliant goal! After patient passing from Burnley, who keep the ball for a long stretch, Ward hoicks a cross into the middle. It’s not a great delivery, but Wood does well to head it back to Hendrick on the edge of the area. He moves it to Arfield, who proceeds to slice Everton open up with a pass through to Ward, who’s got away from Vlasic again. Ward gets his head up this time and finds Hendrick with a low cutback. His first touch, combined with a drop of the shoulder, sees off Schneiderlin and sets him up to stroke a low finish past Pickford with his right foot. That was beautifully constructed! 19 min: Calvert-Lewin does well to reach a punt from Keane down the right. He holds off Mee before slipping the ball to Vlasic, who wins a corner. The Everton fans behind the goal appreciated Calvert-Lewin’s scampering there. It was nothing special, but it’s the kind of urgency Everton have been missing. 16 min: Everton counter, Sigurdsson charging through the middle and finding Niasse on the right. The best striker in the world cleverly prods a pass back to Sigurdsson, who gets the ball stuck under his feet before he can shoot and surely score from six yards out, allowing Jack Cork to make a superb saving challenge. Everton are playing quite well here. 13 min: Wood rumbles down the right channel, making the most of a hopeful long ball. He turns to find Brady arriving in support. The Irishman rather selfishly shoots from a tight angle. Blocked. Burnley continue to press, though, and Lowton’s low fizzing cross takes a deflection and forces the diving Pickford to make an important intervention. That was better from the visitors, who have looked shaky at the back so far. 10 min: Sean Dyche looks displeased with Ben Mee. 9 min: Sigurdsson heads Gueye’s pass over the Burnley defence, more in hope than expectation, but Niasse almost makes something of it, getting there before the dozing Pope and lofting it over the Burnley goalkeeper but away from goal. Everton continue to turn the screw, Baines crossing from the left, but Schneiderlin’s header hits Tarkowski and goes wide. Everton are annoyed to see a goal-kick awarded. 6 min: A mistake by Ben Mee, who fails to deal with a long punt, allows Calvert-Lewin to charge down the right. Here’s what Koeman was looking for. The young striker’s held up the recovering Mee, but he manages to find Sigurdsson, who plays a pass to Vlasic in the area. The young Croatian knocks it back to Sigurdsson, who’s got space for a shot, only to place a careful low side-footer too close to Pope. 5 min: Williams heads the corner away. Defour puts it back in the area, but Keane heads it out for a throw on the left. 4 min: Burnley mount their first attack, Vlasic allowing Ward to run unhindered down the left to send a lovely cross into the six yard-box, forcing Baines to shovel the ball behind for a corner. 3 min: Oumar Niasse, who may well be even better than Kylian Mbappe, has an early sighter, a shot hit with little backlift from 20 yards. It’s powerful, but it’s straight at Pope. 2 min: The good news is that Goodison Park is slightly louder than it was on Thursday. Peep! Everton, kicking from left to right, get the game underway. They go on the attack straight away, but Baines’s deep cross is well watched by Pope in the Burnley goal. Here come the teams. Everton are in their blue shirts, Burnley are in claret and blue. Ronald Koeman speaks! “The team is in a different situation than maybe expected. They have changed the style of playing for today. The way our opponent will approach the game today, two strikers in front. Niasse gives us more aggression. Maybe he is the player who is not struggling at the moment and it gives some freshness to the team. We played on Thursday. It is difficult to have the same line-up because we need fresh legs. I spoke with Wayne about this yesterday. He took this really good. Okay, he is not happy, everyone wants to start, but it is about the whole squad. Michael Keane is ready. He trained yesterday. He is okay to play and start and it is a big boost.” It’s Alan Ball Day at Goodison Park today. Everton make five changes from the side that drew with Apollon Limassol. Cuco Martina replaces Jonjoe Kenny at right-back and Michael Keane is fit to return in place of Mason Holgate against his old side, while further forward Ronald Koeman has introduced some youthful mobility in an attempt to give his team more vibrancy. Nikola Vlasic replaces Tom Davies after scoring his first Everton goal against Apollon, while Wayne Rooney and Sandro Ramirez have dropped to the bench. Oumar Niasse, ineligible in the Europa League (well in, Ron), and Dominic Calvert-Lewin start up front instead. Burnley are unchanged from last week’s goalless draw with Huddersfield. Expect them to focus primarily on being tough to break down and to look to counterattack as the game wears on. Everton: Pickford; Martina, Keane, Williams, Baines; Vlasic, Schneiderlin, Gueye, Sigurdsson; Calvert-Lewin, Niasse. Subs: Stekelenburg, Holgate, Davies, Klaassen, Lookman, Rooney, Sandro. Burnley: Pope; Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Ward; Arfield, Cork, Hendrick, Defour, Brady; Wood. Subs: Lindegaard, Vokes, Barnes, Gudmundsson, Westwood, Bardsley, Long. Referee: Jon Moss. Hello. Sometimes a manager can come up with so many convoluted ideas that he ends up looking like he doesn’t have any at all. Ronald Koeman, for instance, reckoned that Everton were too scared to play in their limp draw with 10-man Apollon Limassol at an eerily quiet Goodison Park on Thursday night. To those watching, however, it simply looked like Everton don’t have a way of playing - unless ponderous sideways football with no genuine width and as many No10s crammed into the side as possible counts as a way of playing. Into the third month of the season we go and still it remains unclear what Koeman wants Everton to do. He’s been given a lot of money to construct a team so slow it could be a Canadian kid who’s been put in the remedial class in his new school and the pressure will grow if they fail to win this one against Burnley. This, presumably, wasn’t what Koeman had in mind after the summer splurge. This, however, is what Evertonians are seeing at the moment. It’s difficult to know which have been more disappointing, results or performances, while it doesn’t exactly reflect well on Koeman’s judgement that it was down to the discarded Oumar Niasse to drag Everton out of the bottom three with a heroic substitute appearance against Bournemouth last weekend. While Koeman searches for the right balance, Burnley are reaping the benefits of the absence of any high-falutin’ ideas. There’s no talk of a philosophy, a project, a process at Turf Moor. But Sean Dyche’s instructions are understood and implemented by his players and we know what to expect from Burnley at Goodison Park this afternoon. A no-frills, ego-free approach has them in eighth place. Everton, two points behind Burnley, are 16th. It might not be that exciting, it might not be revolutionary, but it is a reminder that simplicity is underrated. Kick-off: 2.15pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/02/marriage-equality-women-young-voters-inner-city-postal-survey-enrolments","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T17:00:07Z","webTitle":"Women, young voters and inner-city dwellers drive survey enrolments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/marriage-equality-women-young-voters-inner-city-postal-survey-enrolments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/marriage-equality-women-young-voters-inner-city-postal-survey-enrolments","fields":{"headline":"Women, young voters and inner-city dwellers drive survey enrolments","bodyText":"An enrolment surge in which an extra 98,000 Australians put their names down to vote in the marriage law postal survey was driven by young people, women and inner-city residents, new figures have revealed. Women accounted for 57,152 new enrolments compared with 40,907 men, according to new Australian Electoral Commission statistics released late last week. In total 65,274 people aged between 18 and 24 added their names to the roll between 8 August, when the postal survey was announced, and 24 August, the deadline to participate. Two-thirds of the new enrolments were under 24. The figures are a boon for the Equality Campaign because polls show the highest rates of support for same-sex marriage are among women, the young and in the inner city. On Tuesday the Guardian Essential poll found a majority of both sexes support same-sex marriage, but with higher levels of support among women (63%) than men (52%) and less opposition among women (28%) than men (38%). According to the same poll, among people aged 18 to 35 supporters of marriage equality outnumbered opponents 65% to 28%. The addition of 98,000 new voters and more than 930,00 enrolment transactions (which includes voters changing details) has grown the electoral roll to 16m Australians, in what the Equality Campaign called the most successful enrolment campaign in Australian history. GetUp data analyst Ben Raue said the new figures “fit with a pattern we’re seeing that supporters of marriage equality really care about voting in the survey”. “Particularly young people, particularly women and various demographics that support marriage equality really want to make sure they vote,” he said. “That’s why we saw such a surge of people updating details and enrolling to vote.” Raue said the scale of new enrolments meant those who had joined the roll were unlikely to be “hardcore activists” but rather “ordinary people who don’t engage in politics and may not bother to keep updated for a federal election”. The Equality Campaign executive director, Tiernan Brady, said the enrolment figures “bode very well both in terms of the scale [of new voters] and who has registered”. “The enrolment campaign was a huge success,” he said. “The breakdown of who has registered is a reflection how important this issue is.” Brady said young people “show a real determination to stand up for their friends”, as they are more likely to have LGBTI friends. “The support levels among women have always been really brilliant for marriage equality. Women understand the challenges that face people as they try to be treated equally and fairly.” An analysis of the figures by Guardian Australia reveals the 10 electorates with the highest increase in voters were: Melbourne (1,487), Brisbane (1,305), Ryan in western Brisbane (1,249), Griffith in southern Brisbane (1,217), Sydney (1,140), Canberra (1,138), Melbourne Ports (1,092), Mayo in South Australia (1,048), Higgins in inner south-east Melbourne (1,004), and Fenner in the ACT (993). According to the ABC’s Vote Compass five of those (Melbourne, Sydney, Melbourne Ports, Higgins and Fenner) were also in the top 10 electorates with the highest support for marriage equality in a sign the yes campaign are likely to benefit from the new enrolments. The five electorates with the most young people (aged 18 to 24) to join the roll were also in the overall top 10: Ryan (921), Mayo (854), Canberra (834), Brisbane (749) and Griffith (749). These were followed by Wakefield (744), McEwen (716), La Trobe (676), Fenner (671), Barker (664) and Dickson (662). The 10 electorates with the fewest new voters added tended to be regional or outer suburban areas, especially in Western Sydney: Fowler, Werriwa, Blaxland, Parkes, Macarthur, Banks, Shortland, McMahon, Lyne, Braddon and Chifley. Each added between 300 and 400 new voters, less than a third of the rates of new enrolments of those with the biggest increases. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release an update on the number of Australians who have already voted on Tuesday. As Guardian Australia reported last Tuesday the yes campaign believed turnout had already topped 50% at that stage. The total number likely to have voted by the end of the survey period is now expected to be beyond 70%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/01/marriage-equality-campaign-cries-foul-over-divisive-ad-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T01:25:45Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality campaign cries foul over ‘divisive’ ad tactics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/01/marriage-equality-campaign-cries-foul-over-divisive-ad-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/01/marriage-equality-campaign-cries-foul-over-divisive-ad-tactics","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality campaign cries foul over ‘divisive’ ad tactics","bodyText":"The Equality Campaign has attacked a “divisive” advertisement that attempts to cast marriage equality supporters as intolerant by citing comments on social media labelling opponents “bigots”. The campaign’s executive director, Tiernan Brady, said the yes campaign had chosen not to highlight the abuse LGBTI people have suffered in the campaign because it did not want to divide Australians but warned the no campaign’s tactics could harm the country after the result of the same-sex marriage postal survey is declared on 15 November. The Coalition for Marriage’s “Love is Love” ad features ironic, jaunty music while displaying screenshots of abuse on social media from people it suggests are marriage equality supporters including calling opponents “homophobic maggots”, “bigots” and expressing hope that “someone kicks your teeth in”. The ad was given an M rating for mature audiences and was not shown during the AFL grand final although it is believed it will be aired in the NRL final on Sunday evening. The Coalition for Marriage said it was “disappointed” the ad would not be seen by all Australians due the rating it received because “what our opponents say is considered not suitable for young Australians”. Brady said that “that unfortunately lesbian and gay people understand what it feels like to be verbally harassed and bullied”. “We have chosen as a campaign not to highlight that because marriage equality needs to unite the country not divide it,” he said. “This ad is divisive. The majority of Australians are for marriage equality because they believe in the fundamental Australian value of fairness and they’re being called intolerant for believing in fairness.” Brady said the yes campaign was “utterly committed to a solely positive campaign because we know we all have to share the same country the next day”. “We all have to live with the tone that we set,” he said. “That’s why we have refused to go negative and will continue to be relentlessly positive.” Liberal MP Tim Wilson told Sky News there was “no place” for the type of abuse featured in the ad and it did not reflect the position of same-sex marriage supporters who “want to see a more united country where everyone is treated with respect”. But Wilson said the Coalition for Marriage’s decision to feature the abuse in an ad “seeks to inflame discussion” and the no campaign was “trying to bait people into being ferocious in the debate, and that’s not what we should be doing”. The no campaign’s attempt to highlight alleged intolerance stands in contrast to the Nationals senator Matt Canavan’s claim that marriage equality supporters needed to “grow a spine”, a comment labelled “very regrettable” by the mental health expert Patrick McGorry. LGBTI Australians have higher rates of suicide, which led to the peak body for psychiatrists supporting marriage equality to counteract the “significant and deleterious” impact on mental health from discrimination. On Monday ReachOut.com reported a 17% increase in the number of LGBTI young people seeking support through their service. On Sunday the Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz told the ABC the Coalition for Marriage ad “exposes some of the ugliness of the yes campaign”. “Once again, this commentary is all one-way traffic, suggesting that the no campaign is inflaming a situation when it is exposing what is occurring and will occur in the event of the yes campaign being successful.” Abetz has previously claimed that an alleged assault on Tony Abbott was a “foretaste” and “harbinger” of what would happen if marriage equality were legalised, despite the fact the man charged said it had nothing to do with Abbott’s views on marriage. On Sunday the Equality Campaign released polling that showed that 75% of women between the ages of 25 and 44 are voting yes in the marriage equality postal survey. Equality Campaign spokeswoman Janine Middleton said: “Women understand that marriage equality is about people who could easily be part of their families and why it is so important for everyone’s children and grandchildren, nieces and nephews to have the same dignity and legal standing. “Like LGBTI Australians, women have also had to fight for equal treatment.” • QLife is an Australian counselling service for LGBTQI+ people that operates every day between 3pm and midnight AEST.

All I have is time for people to move forward,” she told MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Saturday morning. “This isn’t about me, this isn’t about anyone. This is about lives that are being lost. This is a time where everyone shows her true colors.” Trump showed his the next day, referring in a tweet to “politically motivated ingrates” who have criticised his response in Puerto Rico’s hour of need. According to those who know her, Cruz certainly seems to be showing hers: as a no-nonsense leader with a talent for empathy to match. “She goes head first, chest first. She’s not going to let anybody do what she’s not willing to do,” said Luis Vega, a legislator in the US territory’s house of representatives. “She has no patience for red tape and that’s what we need right now,” Vega added. Now the two-term mayor has become perhaps the most visible communicator of the commonwealth’s challenges in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which devastated the island leaving virtually all of its residents without electricity and access to drinkable water and food. “What we are going to see is something close to a genocide,” Cruz said of what many have decried as a delayed and inadequate response to the urgent humanitarian needs of the island. “Mr Trump, I am begging you to take charge and save lives,” she added, pleading for a more robust federal response. Trump, as he has tended to during his brief political career, took Cruz’s comments personally and on Saturday morning responded via Twitter, decrying Cruz’s “poor leadership” and accusing her of being “nasty to Trump”. “I was asking for help. I wasn’t saying anything nasty about the president,” Cruz retorted. Cruz was a late, surprise candidate in the 2012 election but won handily, defeating a three-term incumbent to become San Juan’s third female mayor. The mainland political action group Our Revolution described her election as “the result of a grassroots effort which united in an unprecedented alliance groups which have traditionally been excluded from the democratic process”. Born in San Juan in 1963, Cruz has been a leader and a competitor since childhood. President of her high school student council, Cruz set track and field records as a teen before she went to the mainland US for college in the 1980s. In 2012, Cruz ran on a platform that emphasized progressive change on issues of gender equality, LGBT and disabled rights, and a municipal plan for universal healthcare. Citizen participation has been at the core of her administration, and the city has begun trialling a participatory budgeting process since she’s been in office. Cruz is a member of the centrist/centre-left Popular Democratic party, which favors Puerto Rico retaining that relationship with the mainland US, as opposed to full independence or statehood as other political parties advocate. In 2016 she dedicated her election win to Oscar López Rivera, a controversial figure in Puerto Rican politics, and a former member of a radical Puerto Rican independence group that committed several terrorist attacks on the mainland during the 1970s. “She’s a feisty one. I’m her friend and her ally and I’ve also fought with her because we’re both very opinionated,” Vega said. “I’ve never ever been prouder of her.” She was no stranger to the mayor’s office when she was elected in 2012. Cruz spent 20 years in Puerto Rican politics before her run, starting off with a stint as an adviser to Mayor Héctor Luis Acevedo in 1992. Before that Cruz spent 12 years on the mainland, much of that time at Boston University and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. There she was the first student to win the “spirit award” now presented annually to “the student with the greatest positive impact on the quality of life of their peers”. “She is a force of nature,” Jon Nehlsen, an associate dean at the school told the Pittsburgh Gazette. “She’s probably not 5ft 2in, but she’s this ball of energy, very charismatic. You can just tell she exudes leadership qualities.” A bit of that was on display at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, which is being used as a staging ground for relief efforts, on Friday. With tears in her eyes, Cruz greeted a stream of residents warmly, but was also candid about her frustrations with how the recovery efforts had been going so far. She hadn’t eaten lunch until 3.30pm, just before she delivered the speech that ultimately drew Trump’s ire. But there’s little reason to believe that Cruz will adjust her tack in light of Trump’s tweets. “I am done being polite,” she said on Friday. “I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell, so I am asking the members of the press to send a mayday call all over the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/30/northampton-harlequins-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T17:22:21Z","webTitle":"George North on the charge as Northampton go top of the table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/30/northampton-harlequins-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/30/northampton-harlequins-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"George North on the charge as Northampton go top of the table","bodyText":"The transformation, if never complete, is now very definitely under way. Northampton may have conceded seven tries and 40 points in the first 40 minutes of this campaign, but they now, somehow, sit at the top of the table, separated from Newcastle by four points worth of differential. It’s a wonderful advert for the purging benefits of a good hiding. That achievement, though, may yet be overshadowed by an allegation of gouging against Kyle Sinckler, Quins’ England and Lions prop. The incident occurred 10 minutes into the second half, when an enraged Michael Paterson claimed he had been victim of one of rugby’s cardinal sins. The ref put it up on the big screen, where Sinckler could be seen ripping off Paterson’s scrum cap, then briefly returning his hand to the environs of Paterson’s face. The footage was inconclusive, but Sinckler was penalised for the original decapping. Paterson told the referee on the field that “100 per cent” there had been “contact with the eye”, but Northampton would not comment further on the incident afterwards. John Kingston, Harlequins’ director of rugby, on the other hand, came out in defence of Sinckler, saying he “unequivocally” did not gouge Paterson. Instead, Kingston muttered darkly about the treatment meted out to Dave Ward, his hooker and captain, who played most of the match with a swollen eye he fought to keep open. “I know how it happened, because he’s told me, and I believe him. He’s not happy about it.” This is unlikely to be the end of the matter, the referee giving notice to the players on the field that the citing procedure will deal with anything they see fit to. Chris Catling, the citing officer, has 48 hours to decide. It was symbolic of a second half that deteriorated into the fractious after an opening period of more fluency. Northampton already had the bonus point when the flare-up occurred, then a 12-point lead when Harry Mallinder knocked over the subsequent penalty. It was no less than they deserved. There is definitely an improvement in simple zest among their ranks, as they leave that horrible opening 40 of the season further behind. But there remains a certain imprecision. They will wonder how they turned round a mere five points ahead after a first half of almost total dominance. Harlequins barely entered their half in the opening 30 minutes, other than for kick-offs and one breakaway score by Aaron Morris from out of his own 22, set up by a stray Luther Burrell pass. It was a waspish reply to George North’s early score, but the second quarter saw Northampton build a new lead with two tries of the highest calibre. Tom Collins further consolidated his reputation as a waxing star, hitting Mallinder’s inside pass to knife through the first line of defence and leave Marland Yarde and Morris floundering in his wake. Then came the best of the lot, just before the break. Ahsee Tuala was involved twice in a blur of sweet handling, which culminated in Courtney Lawes sending Mikey Haywood to the sticks for the sort of high note Saints have been struggling to hit of late. All the more infuriating for them, then, to see Quins stay in the match with a punch from the ropes, when Jamie Roberts galloped over on the cusp of half-time. No matter, Northampton responded with their fourth try a couple of minutes into the second half, Tuala quickest to Nic Groom’s chip before beating Smith and Yarde to the corner. Saints seemed the more thrown by the gouging allegation, or Quins somehow the more inspired by it. Ward battered his way over in the final quarter to pull the visitors back to within five. For a side stripped of 20 players, several of them key internationals, Harlequins’ tenacity was admirable. They were denied a bonus point, though, by a late penalty from Stephen Myler, on for his first appearance of the season. With a further phalanx of talents on the brink of a return, there’s a new momentum at Franklin’s Gardens, an idea that would have seemed utterly absurd at the start of the very same month.

Low-earning graduates will benefit from a delay in their student loan repayments under a Conservative scheme designed to defuse the political damage over tuition fees and attempt to woo younger voters. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, has said that it is a “national outrage” that so many people cannot afford to buy a home. (See 3.47pm.) He made the comment as he announced a four-point plan to improve conditions for people who have to rent: a mandatory ombudsman scheme for landlords; regulation for all letting agents; incentives to encourage landlords to offer longer tenancies; and consultations on a new housing court. (See 3.34pm.) David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, has said he expects the universal credit roll out to continue, despite warnings from Conservative party colleagues that the acceleration of new welfare system should be delayed because of fears about its impact on current claimants. A dozen Tory MPs have raised concerns with the department that claimants are being forced to use food banks because of the mandatory six-week wait for new UC claimants to get cash. Speaking at a fringe event, Gauke indicated that the roll out planned for next week would go ahead, but also suggested claimants needed to be more aware that they could claim emergency advance payments instead of waiting the requisite six weeks. He told the meeting: I wasn’t involved in the creation of universal credit other than a specific and peripheral way. I am not someone whose political reputation is tied up with universal credit. If I looked at it and thought this is a mistake I would be agitating to do something to stop it. But I don’t. The reality with advance payments is if you want one you can get it practically straight away. In the most extreme cases if someone says ‘I’m literally down to my last few pounds’ it is possible to do a same day bank transfer. I don’t want anybody who is in need to have to wait six weeks, or sometimes more, to get any kind of payment. Stephen Dorrell, the Conservative former health secretary and European Movement chairman, has said May should grant a second referendum on Brexit. Addressing an anti-Brexit rally in Manchester outside the conference, he said Brexit would be a “historic mistake”. He told the rally: Many people say to me I’m flying in the face of democracy. What is undemocratic about changing your mind? There was also a separate, anti-austerity rally outside the conference organised by the People’s Assembly. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has attacked the “Tory psychodrama” surrounding speculation over Theresa May’s leadership and ruled out standing as a candidate herself. At a fringe meeting she said: I’m not standing to be the leader of the party. I don’t sit in the House of Commons, let’s get back to why we are here - to talk about the real issues and not about the Tory psychodrama. At a fringe meeting David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, said he would rather be chancellor than prime minister. The former chief secretary to the Treasury laughed off suggestions he would like a chance to succeed Theresa May but said that he would prefer to be in Number 11. Gauke said after the election result, May had showed “a degree of resilience and I look at her and I don’t know I would have that resilience in those circumstances.” He added: I’m not someone who has ever wanted particularly to do that job. Asked if he had ambitions to be chancellor, he said: Maybe one day, I would like to do that. I spent seven years in the Treasury, mostly enjoyable years. Nick Macpherson, the former Treasury permanent secretary, would approve. He recently posted this on Twitter. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has welcomed the Conservative party’s decision to raise the threshold at which graduates have to start paying back their tuition fee loans. He said: Raising the repayment threshold to £25,000 is a reform I have been advocating, so naturally I welcome that pending a broader review of the whole system. The government also needs to restore student maintenance grants and put more funding into further education colleges. I just question where this money will coming from. Ministers keep telling us there isn’t a magic money tree. And Brexit will slow growth and reduce tax receipts. The Conservatives have belatedly discovered that there is a massive problem of unfairness between generations. But much more is needed than a panicky bribe. A stand-off between police and anti-Tory protesters near the Conservative Party conference has ended peacefully. the Press Association reports. PA says: Smoke bombs were thrown and demonstrators, some wearing masks to hide their identity, chanted “Let us out!” after police refused to allow a van join the march route because it did not have security clearance. About 25 police officers lined up to block the road and stood silently as the chants continued. Police vans and mounted officers were later sent to Liverpool Road as the protesters refused to move, and a force helicopter hovered overhead. The group was trying to join the People’s Assembly march as it made its way through the centre of Manchester. After about an hour, police searched the van and allowed it to be driven off. The tensions erupted as the march set off after a rally at Castlefield Arena. Hundreds of protesters gathered to call for the Tories to be kicked out of power. Waving placards and chanting “Oh Jeremy Corbyn”, the crowd took to the streets in protest at austerity. Public and Commercial Services Union boss Mark Serwotka called for a general strike on public sector pay to “bring the Tories down”, saying Tory policies were “literally killing people”. Here is the transcript of Andrew Marr’s interview with Theresa May (pdf) this morning. It was probably the most substantial broadcast news interview she has given since the general election. Andrew RT Davis, the leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh assembly, gave the final conference hall speech of the day. Davies said that Wales could not longer claim to be underfunded because of the steps taken by the government in London. Thanks to the Conservatives and the leadership of Theresa May, the decades-old complaint about underfunding in Wales is now over. We’ve signed major city deals in Cardiff and Swansea, and made significant progress on a North Wales Growth Deal. And in the summer, we had the biggest of the lot – a longstanding thorn in the side of the Welsh economy – scrapping of the Severn Bridge Tolls. Removing the tolls will deliver a £100million boost to the Welsh economy lifting productivity and prosperity for families and their communities. He criticised Labour’s record running the Welsh government. And we need to take that threat seriously, because in Wales we’ve seen first-hand what a Labour government can do to our people and communities. In Labour-run Wales you are twice as likely to be on an NHS waiting list … … Your children are less likely to achieve Five GCSEs above C … … And take-home pay is the lowest of all nations in the United Kingdom. And what about hardworking families looking to buy their own home? Labour have pulled up the ladder on aspiration scrapping the best housing policy ever delivered – Right to Buy. A Conservative policy which has done more for social mobility than any Labour government has ever achieved. My colleague Dan Roberts has been tweeting from the anti-Brexit rally in Manchester. And this is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth on Ruth Davidson’s speech. In his speech to the conference James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, urged the parties in Northern Ireland to resolve their differences and restore the power-sharing executive. He said: Over the years, the political parties in Northern Ireland have found a way through the issues that have divided them. They have shown leadership in resolving hugely challenging and sensitive issues. They have created political stability which has been an example to world. As President Clinton said to me recently, we just can’t go backwards. So my message to the parties is now is the time to reach agreement. ITV’s Robert Peston says Ruth Davidson’s speech was the conference highlight today. In her speech Davidson also said that the UK was too London-centric and that the imbalance of the UK was “crazy”. Our Union continues to be far too London-centric. Compare us to our friends around the world. New York’s global status doesn’t diminish Washington’s political clout, or LA’s creativity, or Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurialism. Instead, America has a cluster of great global cities. Or look at Germany – where Berlin’s political heft is balanced by the financial hub of Frankfurt and the industry of Munich. We’re the odd one out – in fact, among major global capitals, only Moscow accounts for a greater share of national product than London. And this imbalance is getting crazy. We live in a country where the property values of London’s top 10 boroughs are worth more than all of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales combined. Where you can sell a three bed semi in Ilford, and buy half of Sutherland. Where, in a capital city already zooming forward on the jet fuel of high finance, the economy is further boosted by enough civil servants to fill Wembley. It is time for change – to fulfil the plans we set out at the election this year … … to give Britain a shake and spread more of our Union outside the capital. To see our great metropolitan cities have a larger share in the government of our country. To ensure that – if our civil service and cultural bodies are to claim to be UK institutions - they must be present across our whole United Kingdom. Davidson said industrial policy, and the relocation of government agencies outside London could address this. In a passage about devolution, Davidson says that a “power surge” will hit the UK after Brexit. And let’s say it loud and proud – that this is a Union that that does not hoard power to the centre, but has sought to push it out. And again, did so thanks to a Conservative party which – as Edinburgh, as Cardiff, Manchester and Teeside will attest – is now THE party of devolution. Not Labour, certainly not the LibDems. Us. And a party that now wants to use Brexit to go further – to ensure that the power surge that will hit Britain when we leave the EU is felt in Edinburgh, in Cardiff Bay and in Stormont too. Davidson’s line about Brexit having the effect of a “power surge” was intriguingly ambiguous. Ostensibly she was being positive. But Davidson is on the record as saying she fears Brexit could damage the economy permanently, and she ended up using a metaphor that conjured up images of what might happen if you were to stick your fingers in an electric socket. Davidson says the Tories must be a party for everyone - including immigrants. From the people who voted to leave the UK, to the majority who voted to stay… From the people who voted to remain in the EU to the people who voted to leave. From the people who can trace their ancestors back through generations, to people who’ve settled here from somewhere else. … who pursued that innate Conservative instinct to better themselves and their families and build a new life in a new land. We need to stand together, Not defensive in this diversity and our sometime disagreement – but to be confident in our ability to embrace difference and debate. Davidson says the Tories must stand for social mobility. These people are looking to us for answers - and for action to make their lives easier. It’s our duty to deliver. Also, to make our country fairer. To make it clear: this party isn’t there for those at the top of the ladder – this party is a ladder. Davidson says a Labour victory is not inevitable. I have watched, with incredulity, the response to the Labour party conference this week. Commentators, who should know better, declaring Jeremy Corbyn as a shoo-in to number 10, just because Glastonbury chanted his name to the White Stripes. Folks, he hasnae even won a raffle. Well, conference I have been here before and I can tell you how this story ends. I have watched as Nicola Sturgeon sold out rock venues. As she released a line of signature clothing. As she sold foam fingers to the faithful so they could point at the sky as she flew in a helicopter she’d slapped her face on, over their heads. I’ve read the commentary that said her momentum was irresistible, that everything would be swept before her ... Just as the SNP came crashing down to earth. Just as they lost 40 per cent of their seats in June. Just as half a million Scots chose to take their vote away. So too can the Corbyn bubble burst, but only if we work hard to make it so. Because, you know what? People tire of being offered free unicorns. Of easy promises that don’t add up. They want serious solutions to the issues facing their world. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, is speaking now. On the basis of how she starts, it is the only first-rate speech we’ve heard so far. She starts with a joke. It’s great to be here in Manchester. Or as I call it, the Southern powerhouse. She recalls the Conservative campaign in Scotland in 2015. We started with one MP. We ended with one MP. We’d survived the SNP tsunami, but were no further forward than when we began. …we were still outgunned by those sodding pandas. Then she goes on: This time, it was different. This time people were looking for a serious alternative to a nationalism that had let down our schools and was more concerned with division than delivery. And we went from one MP to 13. Our best result in decades. After years of heroically holding the line on his own, suddenly David Mundell got some company. The pandas are going to have to go some, to catch up now... That may be the first time that the Tory conference has been exposed to a panda shagging joke. In his speech Sajid Javid announced a series of measures intended to help people renting their homes. He said that although the Conservatives were committed to boosting home ownership, they also had to face up to the “hard fact” that many people had to rent because they could not afford a home. On the subject of home ownership, he said the fact that it was so hard for people to buy a home now was “a national outrage”. The injustices in our housing market go beyond social housing. For my generation home ownership was something that, if you worked hard enough, you could afford. It was something you could earn. An opportunity available to everyone, from every background. Like my parents, when they moved to the UK, who bought their first home for just £500. For too many growing up today things are very different. Walk down any high street and you’ll see young people with their faces pressed against an estate agent’s window. Trying, and failing, to find a home they can afford. For them, increasingly, a house seems like something that you have to inherit. The opportunity my generation took for granted now seems lost to many. This is a national outrage. And the biggest barrier to social progress in our country today. It’s no wonder that we see so many young people angry, feeling left behind. This is a clear injustice at the very heart of our society. But the problem is not that we have a market. The problem is that we have a market that is broken. For decades our planning system has failed to plan for the number of homes we need. Javid also said that it was because of the Tories’ failure on housing that Jeremy Corbyn was being taken seriously. It’s a mark of our failure on housing that the Labour party, a Party led by Jeremy Corbyn, is being taken seriously again. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, is speaking now. He has got four housing announcements in the speech (although some were trailed overnight.) This is from the CCHQ press release explaining them. • We will make it mandatory for every landlord to be part of an ombudsman scheme, either directly, or through a letting agent. At the moment landlords, unlike letting agents, are not required to sign up to ombudsman (redress) schemes. We will change the law so that this becomes a requirement, giving all tenants access to quick and easy dispute resolution over issues like repairs and maintenance. • We will require all letting agents to be regulated in order to practice. Currently, anyone can operate as a letting agent without any qualifications or professional oversight. We will change the law so that all letting agents must register with an appropriate organisation. This will mean that letting agents would be required to satisfy minimum training requirements and comply with an industry code of conduct. • We will create new incentives for landlords who offer longer term tenancies. Working with the Treasury we will announce at the autumn budget a new set of incentives for landlords who offer tenancies of at least 12 months. • We will consult with the judiciary on the case for a new housing court to streamline the current system. We will explore whether a new housing court could improve existing court processes, reduce dependence on legal representation and encourage arbitration, with benefits for both tenants and landlords. We will consult with the judiciary on whether the introduction of a new housing court can meet the aim of saving time and money in dealing with disputes. Justine Greening, the education secretary, used her speech to the conference to announce a series of modest measures intended to help schools and improve teacher retention. They were: Piloting a new student loan reimbursement programme for science and modern foreign language teachers in the early years of their careers. In a briefing note the Tories said: The pilot scheme will benefit around 800 MFL and 1,700 science teachers a year. A typical teacher in their fifth year of work would benefit by around £540 through reimbursement – in addition to £360 from the newly-announced student loan repayment threshold rise from £21,000 to £25,000 – and this would be more for teachers with additional responsibilities. Piloting new bursaries for maths teachers, with upfront payments of £20,000 and early retention payments of £5,000 in the third and fifth year of a teacher’s career. Sums of £7,500 would also be available to encourage the best maths teachers to teach in more challenging schools, the Tories said. £30m for schools that struggle with teacher recruitment and retention. A £6m investment to expand maths hubs. A new national network of English hubs, focusing on early language and literacy, starting with £12m in the north. Damian Green, the first secretary of state, spoke after Sir Patrick McLoughlin. His speech was a broad and general defence of the government’s record, most notable for what he said about Labour. Green claimed that the Labour party was a “nasty party’ and “a front operation for the hard left”. [Labour] is a front operation for the hard left. A Labour party with MPs that abuse Prince Harry for his service in Afghanistan, and that tolerates an under-current of antisemitism. There was a time when we needed to be warned about sounding nasty. I tell you there is still a nasty party in Britain in 2017 and it’s called the Labour party. He said claims that the Tories were unfeeling were “fake news”. So let’s be clear that when the Labour Party tries to paint us as unfeeling and hard-hearted, they are Britain’s biggest purveyor of fake news. We are helping more people into work than ever, allowing more mental health trained professionals to treat patients than ever, seeing more children from disadvantaged backgrounds go to university than ever. That’s modern compassionate Conservatism in action, and Labour’s Twitter trolls can go and stick that in their timeline. Here are some pictures from the anti-Brexit march. The Scottish secretary, David Mundell, has just been very rude about Boris Johnson at a Tory fringe event, albeit in an amusing and slightly roundabout way. Mundell was on a panel of Scottish Conservative MPs and MEPs discussing how the party could better connect with young voters, and they were asked how he thought Johnson would go down with young Scottish people if he became leader. Mundell said the panel would not be answering “hypothetical questions”, but added: I do recall that Boris Johnson once stood as rector of Edinburgh university. You can look at the results of that. This brought laughter from the audience, and it’s easy to understand why: it was not a race which went well for the then-shadow higher education secretary back in 2006. Showered with beer and greeted with chants of “Bog off Boris, you top-up Tory,” when he visited the university, he eventually finished a fairly distant third in the race behind Green MSP Mark Ballard and journalist Magnus Linklater, beating only the radical filmmaker John Pilger. Davidson, when asked earlier about Johnson, said only she did not to talk about “Tory psychodrama”, but hailed the success of the Tories in Scotland. She said: We are a party on the up in Scotland. We’ve got a clear purpose, and that is to spend the next three years to show that we can be the next government of Scotland. Another of the speakers, the newly-elected Conservative MP Paul Masterton, said the party must do more to appeal to young voters. He said: People now think that they will be more prosperous and secure under a hard-line Labour government, than under a Conservative government. That shouldn’t worry us - that should shame us, and we have to have really serious discussions as a party as to how it got to that point. The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) has published a new election analysis this morning arguing that that Brexit has reshaped political loyalties. Age and education are now key dividing lines, it says. Here is an excerpt from the blog. As analysis of data collected by NatCen’s unique random probability panel shows, rather than just having two main political groupings, Britain now has no less than six. Just two of these groups are distinguished by how left-wing or right-wing they are: • Comfortable Britain (26% of the electorate): Mostly older people in professional occupations and who own their own home. They typically have relatively right-wing views, but are not especially concerned about immigration. • Traditional Working Class (14%): Older working class voters who are relatively left-wing but are not especially socially liberal. Three of the groups are distinguished primarily by their age and/or educational background and by how socially liberal or conservative they are: • Liberal Elite (18%): Mostly graduates in professional occupations who are socially liberal and voted heavily to remain in the EU. • Liberal Youth (16%): These are mostly younger people in middle-level non-graduate jobs and tend to think of themselves as working class. They are relatively liberal and positive about immigration. • Socially Left Behind (11%): Middle aged and older working class voters (together with some small employers) who are not particularly right-wing but are socially conservative, concerned about immigration and nearly all voted Leave. Meanwhile, one group consists of young voters who are relatively disengaged from any kind of politics: • Young, disaffected JAMs (16%): Younger working class voters with mixed views whose main distinguishing characteristic is that half did not vote in 2015. The NatCen blog has a chart showing how each of these groups voted in the general election, and whether the Tories or Labour were gained or lost votes amongst these groups between 2015 and 2017. NatCen says: Labour support was highest – and increased most since 2017 – amongst the two most socially liberal groups in Britain – the Liberal Elite and Liberal Youth. Meanwhile, although the Conservatives retained their support amongst the relatively right-wing voters who belong to Comfortable Britain, the party advanced most amongst a very different group - socially left behind voters who are concerned about immigration who hitherto had been the bedrock of support for Ukip. Here are some more lines from Sir Patrick McLoughlin’s speech. McLoughlin, the party chairman, said that although the general election result was disappointing, the Tories did win. And they acheived “some remarkable results”, he said. We increased our share of the vote for the fifth election in a row. We won seats like Stoke on Trent South and Mansfield. We haven’t held a Stoke seat since 1935, until Jack Brereton. We’ve never won Mansfield before - until Ben Bradley. He claimed that the the Tories “securing the union” with Scotland with their election result. We achieved a tremendous result in Scotland, winning thirteen seats where we only had one. With Ruth and the prime minister, we have secured the Union. And - conference. Alec Salmond was defeated by Colin Clark, the new Conservative member of parliament for Gordon. Because of your hard work, we’ve been joined by new MPs. Lee Rowley in North East Derbyshire, Simon Clarke in Middlesbrough South &amp; East Cleveland. Kirstene Hair in Angus. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, made the same claim in an interview with the Times on Saturday. McLoughlin said that, as party chairman, he was reintroducing contributions from the floor at this year’s conference. He defended the government’s record on tax and employment. When we came to office in 2010, the Labour government took income tax from people earning just £6,500. In 2017, taxpayers don’t start paying income tax until they earn £11,500 thanks to Conservatives in government. It means that a basic rate tax payer keeps over £1,000 more of their earnings each year. In 2010, under Labour, unemployment was at almost 8%. Now, under the Conservatives, it’s at just over 4%. It means more people in work, earning a pay packet and supporting their family. In 2010, under Labour, corporation tax was 28%. Now, under the Conservatives, it’s 19%. In the last year that Labour were in power, it brought in £36.6 billion and in 2016 it brought in £49 billion. Despite cutting the rate. McLoughlin also said it was 40 years since he attended his first conference. The 1977 one was famous for the speech William Hague delivered as a schoolboy. Sir Patrick McLoughin, the Conservative chair, is giving a speech to open conference proceedings. Some of the election results were “outstanding”, he says. He is talking about the local elections. We had brilliant local election results. We also had a general election that nobody expected to take place. We did not get the result we hoped for. Ahead of those local elections in May, I was out with our members across the country. I saw the hard work and dedication of our volunteers and our candidates. It is because of you that we achieved some outstanding results, winning overall control of ten more councils, gaining over five hundred and fifty councillors. For a sitting government, it was an incredible result. We took overall control of Lincolnshire. Norfolk. Cambridgeshire. Gloucestershire. East Sussex. Suffolk. Warwickshire. The Isle of Wight. Lancashire. In my own county, Derbyshire, we delivered a majority of ten on the County Council - something that has not happened in decades. Katie Perrior, who used to be Theresa May’s communications director in Number 10 until the general election, has described the policy offering announced overnight as “mediocre”, the BBC’s John Pienaar says. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has been addressing the anti-Brexit rally in Manchester. He told the crowd: We are in Manchester because the Conservative party are here and we want them to hear our voices – to tell Theresa May and Boris Johnson that we are not ‘citizens of nowhere’, but people who are proud to be British, and proud to be European. We must tell the government what is at stake here. Take the great research institutions in Manchester, such as the National Graphene Institute developing a new wonder material. Or the Human Brain Project. Or Cancer Research – each have received €1bn in EU funding, the largest research commitments the EU has ever made: what is their future? Damian Green, the first secretary of state, claimed this morning that Theresa May could lead the party into the next election. (See 12.37pm.) But Grant Shapps, the Conservative former party chairman, told Peston on Sunday that Green was wrong. Shapps said: [Green] has got to say that, in the same way that she does. But if you run any organisation ... and something goes monumentally wrong, as it did at the election ... the buck does have to stop with that individual. The reality is that every serious person, every serious MP, every commentator knows she can’t lead us into the next election. Of course she can’t. Lord Heseltine, the Conservative former deputy prime minister, said the same thing on the BBC’s Sunday Politics. Asked about the prospect of May still being leader at the time of the next election, he replied: I don’t think there is any prospect of that. There are two rallies in Manchester today to coincide with the start of the Conservative party conference: A pro-European one, and a People’s Assembly anti-austerity one. Here are some of the People’s Assembly protesters. Damian Green, the first secretary of state and thus the de facto deputy prime minister, has been giving various interviews this morning. Here are the key points. Green implicitly rebuked Boris Johnson for disloyalty. Asked on Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics if he had told Johnson not to air his Brexit differences with Theresa May in public, Green said he did not discuss private conversations in public. He went on: I am happy to make a general point that it is understandable that any group of politicians faced with a big issue will have a range of views. It is extremely sensible when you are in government to express those views in private rather than public. It’s advice for everyone. It’s advice for all my colleagues at all times. That if you feel strongly about something then make your pitch in private. And then, when the government has come to a collective decision, stick to it. Green said that Johnson had “huge strengths” but that he should abide by collective cabinet responsibility. He said: I think Boris clearly has huge strengths. He is an asset to the government. He is an asset to the party. But, on Brexit, the government’s policy was agreed by the whole cabinet and was shown in the Florence speech which the Prime Minister made a couple of weeks ago and that’s our policy, and that’s what remains our policy. We know that Boris likes giving interviews and writing articles, but the government’s policy is absolutely clear, it’s what was in the Florence speech. Green defended May’s decision not to sack Johnson. When it was put to him that May should sack Johnson, Green replied: No, Boris clearly has huge talents and having him in the cabinet gives us those strengths. Inevitably on big issues people will express views. Boris has a good record as mayor of London, so it’s a good thing to have him in the cabinet. Green said he “absolutely” believes May will lead the party into the next election in 2022. He also said he expected speculation about her leadership to be laid to rest. He said: I think it will be and I think it needs to be for the sake of the country. It doesn’t help our negotiating team in Brussels to have constant speculation, so I think it will stop and I think it has to stop as well. She has a big agenda that she wants to get through. Clearly the election didn’t go well, but we now have four and a half years ahead of us in which we can not only get the Brexit deal that’s best for the country but also implement that domestic agenda. Green said the Conservative party membership was now “about 120,000”. John Strafford, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, has claimed that the membership is now around 100,000. Here are some of the anti-Brexit campaigners who have come to Manchester for a rally to coincide with the Tory conference. Grant Shapps, the former Conservative party chairman, told Peston on Sunday that he thought the Pickles report (see 11.35am) was “very sensible”, but that it did not acknowledge how bad the manifesto was. He told the programme: What it doesn’t say is that the main problem in the campaign was that we had a manifesto that dared you to vote for us, telling our own supporters ‘If you’re brave enough, vote for us and we’ll do a bunch of very nasty things, in terms of your old-age pensions and the rest of it. We dare you to do it’. It’s not a good place to be. Lord Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister and arch pro-European, has been giving interviews this morning. Boris Johnson succeeded him as MP for Henley, but Heseltine is a fierce critic of Johnson’s and today he accused Johnson of peddling “phoney” and “duplicitous” arguments and creating an “unsustainable” position for the cabinet. Heseltine told Sky’s Sunday with Paterson: The whole thing is unsustainable - you cannot have a government in which members of the cabinet are voicing opinions which are not consistent, one with the other. He said Johnson’s Brexit arguments were bogus. I understand those arguments but they are phony, they are duplicitous. Look at Bombardier, what’s going on there - that’s the real world of international trade, as anybody who has spent any time in the export market fully understands. Talking about a world hungry for new British exporters to suddenly come over the horizon is just talking about something that doesn’t exist. Heseltine, who resigned from Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet, said Johnson ought to resign. Heseltine said: I resigned, I think it’s very difficult for Boris to go on making the sort of interventions he is and remain in the government. But Heseltine said he could understand why Theresa May had not sacked him yet. Leaving him there until he completely oversteps the mark is a wise thing to do. The Conservative party has published its review of the general election, conducted by the former communities secretary Sir Eric Pickles. You can read it here. Pickles has written a blog about it here, for ConservativeHome. And here is the Press Association story about what it says. A Conservative post-mortem of the June 8 general election has recommended changes to the way the manifesto is drawn up, in order to ensure it is fully backed by senior figures across the party. The proposal for a new manifesto committee - one of 126 recommendations in the report by former minister Pickles - comes after reports that Theresa May did not consult Cabinet colleagues over key elements of the 2017 manifesto, including the controversial “dementia tax”. Pickles found that the election, which saw Tories increase their share of the vote to 42% but lose their overall majority in the House of Commons, revealed “a clear campaigning deficiency” in the party and the need for “a fundamental re-evaluation” of the way it runs campaigns. He called for changes to attract more young people and members of ethnic minorities to join and support the Conservatives. He also put forward plans to prepare more effectively for future polls, including starting the process of drawing up a manifesto within 12 months of the last election. The creation of a Conservative manifesto committee appears to be designed in response to complaints that May and close advisers Nicholas Timothy and Fiona Hill were not open enough with senior ministers and party officials about the content of this year’s platform for election. Pickles states that the committee should included the PM, chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary, party chairman and chief executive and chief whip - or their equivalents in opposition - as well as up to three others appointed by the leader. Crucially, it states that all secretaries of state must be consulted on every issue relating to their area of responsibility before proposals are included in the manifesto, and must be able to appeal to the committee against any measures he or she objects to. However, it adds that the leader’s right to hold the final say on manifesto contents is “unaffected”. In response to the swing in young people’s votes towards Labour at the June poll, the report calls for the creation of a “vibrant youth wing” in the Conservatives and says there must always be under-30 representation on the party board and on candidate selection panels. Before any new policy is announced, there should be active consideration of its relevance to young people, Pickles found. He also called for an increase in the number of candidates who are women or from diverse backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, admitting that the Conservatives have not done enough to engage with Britain’s black and ethnic minority communities. Pickles acknowledged that, despite the Tories achieving their best share of votes since 1983, “the only numbers that count” in a general election are the MPs elected. With an overall loss of 13 seats, it was a “glum” night for the Tories, with only the improved performance in Scotland providing some cheer. However, the former communities secretary said he decided not to produce a report full of “blame and recrimination” or “sensational stories about what went wrong behind closed doors”, but was aiming to make the party “stronger and more adept and campaigning”. “At this election I felt the loss of our seats, along with colleagues I had worked with, very keenly,” said Pickles. “That has not blinded me into the delusion that one thing caused our setback. “Many of the problems we encountered have been present at previous general elections, in some degree or another. I hope that this is a frank and unblinking look at our party, which will set a series of reforms in motion.” When he was interviewed by the Observer, Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, conveniently claimed he was out of time when asked if he thought Theresa May should lead the party into the next general election. He now seems to have had time to clarify his thinking. In an interview this morning he expressed his “absolute confidence” in May and said he fully expects her to lead the Conservatives into the next election. He told BBC Radio 5’s John Pienaar show: That’s what I desire, and that’s what I expect. She has the backing of her the cabinet her ministers, the party, we are all united. Javid dismissed the idea Boris Johnson was seeking to undermine May, and used the Boris-as-naughty-spaniel excuse common nowadays from ministers to explain the foreign secretary’s manoeuvres on Brexit. He said: We all know Boris, he can get a bit excited now and again. But the fundamental point is, he’s someone just like me and everyone else in the cabinet that is backing the PM in this agenda that we’ve got. While he talked up the Tories’ new youth-targeted policies such as an expansion of the help to buy scheme, Javid did concede the party had been guilty of neglecting younger people over housing. He said: I think all governments, including previous Conservative governments, have not taken this issue seriously enough in the past. We have been listening too much to those people that are against development under any circumstance. They bought their homes 20, 30, 40 years ago, they’re sitting on a nice nest egg and they don’t want to see the next generation go ahead. And that has been completely wrong, and we have recognised that. Here is some comment on Theresa May’s Andrew Marr interview from journalists. From Sky’s Beth Rigby From the Spectator’s James Forsyth From the Times’ Sam Coates From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From the Guardian’s John Harris From ITV’s Paul Brand From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire Here are the main points from Theresa May’s interview with Andrew Marr. May refused to deny that Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has become “unsackable”. Johnson yesterday used an interview with the Sun to set out four personal red lines for Brexit, all of which go beyond the cabinet position set out in May’s Florence speech and at least one of which may prove to be impossible. Asked if he was now unsackable, May laughed at the question and just said he was “absolutely behind” the plan for Brexit she set out in Florence. She did not use the line she used in July, when she was in a stronger position and told LBC: “There’s no such thing as an unsackable minister.” She rejected claims the cabinet was divided over Brexit, describing it as “united”. She said: What I have is a cabinet that are united in the mission of this government, and that is what you will see this week. She refused to say whether she would or would not resign if she failed to get a Brexit deal. She just said she wanted to ensure there was a deal. She refused to say whether or not the UK would accept any changes to EU law introduced during the two-year transition period she is proposing. She said in Florence that existing EU law would apply to the UK during this period, but it is not clear whether the UK will also agree to accept new EU regulation introduced between March 2019 and March 2021. The EU’s Brexit negotiating guidelines imply that the UK would have to accept new rules. As one of his four red lines (and probably the most significant one), Johnson said this would be unacceptable. Asked about this, May refused to say one way or the other what would happen, and said this was a matter for the negotiation. She said that she was “sorry” the election did not produce the result that she wanted, but she refused to explicitly apologise for her decision to call it. Asked if she would be apologising to the party, she said: I have been very clear that I called the election, I led the election, I take the responsibility and I am sorry that some very good members of parliament lost their seats and some very good candidates didn’t gain seats. I have spoken to my members of parliament and I will be speaking later today to the party activists. When it was put to her that being sorry about something was not the same as apologising, she just repeated the line about being sorry. In a separate interview, Damian Green, her close ally and the first secretary of state, said May would apologise when she addresses the national Conservative convention behind closed doors. In her Marr interview May also refused to accept that calling the election was a mistake. When it was put to her that this was a mistake, she replied: No. Is it ever a mistake to give people the opportunity to vote? I don’t think so. She refused to rule out replacing tuition fees with a graduate tax. This is a proposal that the Lib Dems are actively pursuing. May said the government would review tuition fee policy. She would not rule out a graduate tax, but she did not express enthusiasm for the idea either. She refused to commit to delaying the roll out of universal credit. She said the overall principle behind universal credit was good, and that it was important to roll it out. She acknowledged there were problems with the system. But she said the department for work and pensions was looking at these and that performance was improving. She said she could understand why Southern Railway passengers favoured renationalisation. But overall privatisation of rail had been a success, she said. She said there was more reliability and better choice. Here is the video of Theresa May’s initial response when asked if Boris Johnson has become “unsackable”. The best line was probably the one that came out right at the end. Theresa May refuses to deny that Boris Johnson has become “unsackable”. I will post a snap summary of the main points from the interview shortly. Q: Do you accept it was a mistake to call the election? May says it is always good to give people a choice. She says she did not get the result she wanted. Q: Your cabinet are fighting. One minister said you should sack Boris Johnson. Do you accept there is a problem? May says the cabinet is united in its mission. It backs the Brexit position she put in her Florence speech. Q: If it is a nest of singing birds, it has one enormous cuckoo in it. Johnson is saying you must do this, this and this. How can you tolerate this? May says Johnson is behind the Florence speech. Q: Is Boris unsackable? May does not answer yes or no. She says they are united. And that’s it. Q: What will you do if there is no deal? May says she hopes there will be a deal. Q: Business people are scared witless of there being no deal. What will happen? May says government departments are looking at this. Q: No deal would be so bad for this country, people say. If you can’t get a deal, will you resign. May says she is working to get a deal. The deal that works for the UK will also work for the EU. Q: I’m asking you straight questions, and you are not answering. [Marr plays the “nothing has changed” clip from her election press conference.] Your own advisers were aghast at that point. Why don’t you admit things have changed? May says she has announced a change to tuition fees. The point she was making during the election was that the principle behind that system had not changed. Q: During the transition period, if EU law changes, will we accept those changes? May says the use of the word implies the UK might not leave. She says by the time the UK leaves, the UK will know where it is heading. She says there will be a two-year implementation period to implement Brexit. Q: And, if EU laws change during that period? May says the EU law will continue to apply. Q: But what happens if EU law, affecting, say, banking changes? May says this will be a matter for the negotiation. Q: So that is not a yes or a no. May says she is heading into a negotiation. Q: You spoke to Angela Merkel this week. Does she think your Florence speech changed things? May says she thinks the speech has unblocked things. That was clear from what Michel Barnier at the end of his press conference on Thursday. Q: The EU says the European court of justice must continue to have a role safeguarding the rights of EU nationals. May says the UK courts would take account of ECJ judgments. Q: Two thirds of people want rail renationalised. Can you tell people privatisation is working. May says she can understand why people think that, especially if they are a Southern Railways customer. But she can remember what the trains were like under nationalisation. The service is better now. There is better reliability and better choice. Q: Louise Casey, the former civil servant, has criticised the way this is being handled. She says some families will lose their children. May says overall the reform is a good one. But as it is rolled out, the government must address the problems. Q: The BBC recently interviewed a woman with 4p left because she was not getting her UC. May says she accepts there are problems. The government is looking at this. Performance has been improving, she says. Q: With the rollout of universal credit, some people will get no money for six weeks. How will people eat? May says she recognises there is a problem. David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, is looking at this. Q: Could you pause the rollout? May says it is important to roll out the system. But the government needs to address these issues too, she says. May says the government will incentivise landlords to offer longer tenancies. And it will also offer new safeguards for tenants. Q: During the election you said there was no magic money tree. But in the last few minutes you have spent about £12bn. Where is the money coming from? May says the government will set out its plan in its budget. Q: Average weekly wages have fallen. People feel worse off because they are worse off. And if you are under 40 your chances of saving for a deposit for a house are worse then ever. May says she recognises that. The focus of the party conference will be a party that works for everyone. The Conservatives want to ensure every generation can be better off than the last one. That is why the government is focusing on housing. Q: How much extra money is there for housing? £10bn, says May. Q: And where will the money come from? May says the government will set out its plans in its budget. May says the government is dealing with the deficit, and also putting more money into services. And there are 3m more people in work, she says. Q: What is the average wage at the moment? May says average earnings are around £25,000. Q: The average weekly wage is £505. Has it gone up or down on your wage. May says people are feeling a squeeze on their incomes. Q: Could you end up with the taxpayer paying most of these fees. Labour would get the taxpayer to pay the entire sum. May says Labour wants people who don’t go to university to pay for those who do. She says people who go to university make contributions to society. But so are people who don’t go to university. Q: People have debts of up to £50,000. Will that debt be affected? May says the government is making two changes: raising the repayment threshold. That will be worth £30 a month, she says. Q: To students who are watching, compared to the banquet Jeremy Corbyn is offering, that will sound like a dry biscuit. May says Labour cannot afford its banquet. At the Labour conference Labour themselves said they would bankrupt the economy. Q: They did not say that. They said there would be a run on the pound, says May. Q: Do you accept the tuition fee announcement is an U-turn? May sidesteps the question. This is not just an issue for students, she says. Parents and grandparents worry about the debt being built up too. She summarises the policy. Q: You defended that policy for years. Was that a faiure? May says the policy has meant there is money for university. Q: So why are you freezing it? May says the govenrment expected universities to vary their fees. That has not happened. So the government will look at it again. Q: Will you consider a graduate tax? May says the government is looking at the policy again. Theresa May is here. Q: Can you apologise to your party for what happened at the election? May starts with a long spiel about the conference. Then she says she takes responsibility for the election. She is sorry some good candidates last their seats. Q: Being sorry is not the same as apologising. Can you apologise to the party? May says she has spoken to MPs. She will be speaking later today to activists. She has worked for the party all her life. She is sorry the result was not the one they wanted. May refuses to issue direct apology to Conservative party for the election result. And this, from MLex’s Matthew Holehouse, is good. Theresa May will be on the Marr Show in a moment. Here is an assessment from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. Here is Sky News’s political editor Faisal Islam on the Conservatives Help to Buy announcement. (See 8.45am.) Q: Why did you organise at Brighton to stop a debate on Brexit? There was lots of debate about Brexit. Q: But no vote. There was a vote on the NEC statement on Brexit, Lansman says. He says Labour wanted to focus on other issues. Q: There has been a lot of debate about antisemitism in Labour. As a Jew yourself, how do you feel about that? Lansman says antisemitism is a problem throughout society. It would be strange if that were not a problem for Labour too. That is why he is so please the NEC passed a new rule change addressing this. Q: So what do you feel when you hear people like Len McCluskey and Ken Loach saying it is not a problem in Labour? Lansman says you have to be a Jew to experience anti-semitism. He knows it is a problem. On the Marr Show Andrew Marr is interviewing Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum. Q: Would you say you are a revolutionary? No, says Lansman. He is someone who wants to transform society. Q: Radical socialist? Lansman says he is happy with that. Q: In the 1970s and 1980s people on the left seemed to hate each other more than the Tories. Is that still an issue? Lansman says he has learnt a lesson from that. “We have put that behind us,” he says. Labour is now a united party. He says Momentum campaigned for candidates from all wings of the party. Q: What is your message to MPs worried about being deselected? Lansman says Momentum is organised in all constituencies. It wants to unseat Tory MPs. Here is some reaction to the tuition fees announcement. (See 8.45am.) Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said this was “a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass”. She said: The fact Theresa May thinks she can win over young people by pledging to freeze tuition fees only weeks after increasing them to 9,250 shows just how out of touch she is. Another commission to look at tuition fees is a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass because they have no plans for young people and no ideas for our country. They are yesterday’s party. The next Labour government will scrap tuition fees entirely and introduce a National Education Service for lifelong learning for the many, not the few. This is from the Labour MP Luke Pollard. This is from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, a former education minister. But Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has welcomed the move. He posted this response on Twitter. This is what Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the Conservative chairman, told BBC Breakfast this morning about the tuition fees announcement. He said: I think it will reassure people that they won’t have to start paying back their loan until they earn a good salary. It was the Labour party that introduced tuition fees and it was the Labour party that said they were necessary to see expansion. We’ve listened, we’ve accepted that there was very great concern. We are taking a very balanced approach and doing what is affordable. A Conservative MP has said the party’s conference in Manchester is being targeted by “fascists” after pictures circulated on social media of a banner reading: “Hang the Tories”, the Press Association reports. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and local Labour MPs denounced the banner, which was strung across a footbridge with two human effigies dangling by their necks below, PA says. It goes on: Theresa May’s party is facing a weekend of protests in Manchester, with a national anti-austerity demonstration expected to attract thousands on Sunday and a cross-party pro-European rally due to be addressed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Tory ex-minister Stephen Dorrell. Delegates arriving at Manchester Piccadilly station on Saturday evening ahead of the conference at the Manchester Central Convention Complex were greeted by an “unwelcome party” protest led by a choir singing anti-Tory songs. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the banner, which was ironically described as “charming” by Conservative MP Michael Fabricant. Andy Burnham condemned the banner on Twitter. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has denied a claim in last week’s Sunday Times that he sent Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, a text on election night offering to support him as a future leader. Hammond said: I do not recognise the words, or indeed the sentiment, that I saw written in the Sunday Times. When you read the article carefully, it didn’t say, ‘The text said 100% behind you’. Instead, it reads, ‘Boris said I’ve had a text from Phil Hammond - he’s 100% behind me’ - not quoting me, but interpreting me ... It’s completely against my character to write down anything like that. I do not write people texts of that description. The Conservative party conference starts in Manchester today and last night the staff at CCHQ were doubtless checking the #tomorrowspaperstoday hashtag to see what sort of media backdrop they face, and how their overnight policy announcements have gone down. They found one splash they liked so much that they retweeted it. The Sunday Telegraph’s front page is also reasonably positive - although, as we’ll see in a moment, it may also win a prize for the most elastic use of the word “revolution”. But, after that, it started to get a lot worse. Here are the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday, two papers that in normal circumstances are well disposed towards the Conservatives. As ever, for the most reliable overview, you can’t beat the Guardian/Observer. We think Theresa May arrives at her conference in a perilous position. Here is the Observer front page. And here is the Observer splash. The Observer story also contains details of the three announcements made by the party overnight. Amid growing signs that cabinet discipline is breaking down and support for the prime minister is draining away, May will announce a series of policy changes in the hope of halting her party’s potentially disastrous loss of support among voters under 45. These will include freezing tuition fees, which are due to rise with inflation from £9,250 in 2017-18 to about £9,500 in 2018-19, while ministers look again at the system. She will also announce that the earnings threshold at which graduates start to pay off their loans will be increased from £21,000 to £25,000, and will go up in line with earnings after next year. That will mean a saving of about £360 in 2018-19 compared with this year for graduates earning at least £25,000. There will also be more help offered to aspiring homeowners, and to renters. As well as a £10bn expansion of the Help to Buy loan scheme, [Sajid Javid, the communities secretary] will announce that all private landlords will be required to join a redress system that allows tenants to complain and see those in breach sanctioned. Javid will also oblige letting agents to be registered with a professional body and require them to meet a set of minimum standards. Taking issue with the Sunday Telegraph, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, was one of several people last night on Twitter to point out that a relatively modest reduction in the amount graduates will have to pay for tuition fees doesn’t amount to a “revolution”. Quite soon we’ll found out what May herself has to say about this. As is customary, she is starting the conference with an interview with Andrew Marr. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Theresa May gives an interview to the Andrew Marr Show. 10am: Damian Green, the first secretary of state, is interviewed on Peston on Sunday and on Pienaar’s Politics. 10am: Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, is interviewed on Sky’s Paterson on Sunday and on Pienaar’s Politics. 10.30am: Conservative members attend private meeting of the national conservative convention at the conference hotel. It is expected that May will use this to issue a qualified apology to members for her role in the disastrous election campaign, which saw the party squander a huge poll lead and lose its overall majority. 2.10pm: Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the party chairman, will open the conference proceedings. 2.30pm: Damian Green speaks. 3pm: Justine Greening, the education secretary, speaks. 3.20pm: Sajid Javid speaks. 3.50pm: Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, speaks. 4.05pm: James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, speaks. 4.15pm: Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader, speaks. We’ve been told Greening and Javid will both be making policy announcements in their speeches. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Unnerved by daily tremors, and uncertain about the exact border of the danger zone – between 9-12km from the summit of Mt Agung – tens of thousands more than necessary have fled. “Only people from 27 villages must evacuate,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, from Indonesia’s national disaster mitigation agency, referring to the communities inside the unsafe zone. “The rest can go home. They can either go home independently or with the help of the government.” As Mt Agung continues to rumble, several Balinese priests have courted controversy in recent days after they hiked to Agung’s crater. One priest, Mangku Mokoh, posted photos and a video from the volcano’s steaming peak, footage of which has gone viral on social media. Responses showed some were in awe, applauding his audacity, while others criticised Mangku Mokoh for his recklessness and potentially encouraging others to do the same. The alert status of Mt Agung was raised to the maximum danger level of 4 after its seismic activity rose to the highest ever recorded levels. The last time Agung erupted was more than half a century ago in 1963, when it killed more than 1,000 people. Fearing it will again blow, tens of thousands of Balinese have sought shelter in village halls and temples, some sleeping on rough concrete with limited sanitation facilities. By day they venture into the danger zone, to check their on their livestock and homes. Each morning for the past week, mountain guide Komang Sabda, 34, has returned to his home 1.5km from Agung’s summit, which is the highest point on Bali. “I have to go check on my flowers,” he says, reaching for his phone to show a photo of his small field of golden marigolds. Unable to lead hikers up the mountain now, Sabda hopes he will still be able to make money by harvesting his marigolds, the petals of which are used in canang – daily Balinese offerings made from banana leaves. No one can say for certain if and when Mt Agung might erupt but volcanologists say the risk has not gone down. “Agung is still showing high numbers of seismicity and yesterday we had 794 volcanic earthquakes,” said Devy Kamil Syahbana, a seismologist from Indonesia’s volcanology centre, on Sunday. “It is not accelerating but it is on the same level. For example, three days ago you had 800 events [earthquakes] and then now you have almost 800 events. It is zero acceleration but still a high level of seismicity.” The amplitude of the quakes has decreased but Syahbana said that did not indicate the fracturing or movement of magma within Mt Agung had dropped. At the same time the number of shallow volcanic tremors has risen. In the event of an eruption, Indonesian authorities have prepared 10 regional airports should flights need to be diverted from Bali’s Ngurah international airport due to volcanic ash flows. The national disaster mitigation agency has installed six warning sirens that will be heard for two kilometres in the event of an eruption, and warning signs at 54 points across the danger zone telling people not to enter. The agency has also warned local communities of the possible dangers, including hot clouds with a temperature of between 600-800C that might speed down Agung’s slope at up to 300kmh in the event of an eruption."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/01/bill-shorten-and-di-natale-rally-yes-vote-as-marriage-campaigns-take-to-skies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T04:41:45Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten and Di Natale rally yes vote as marriage campaigns take to skies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/01/bill-shorten-and-di-natale-rally-yes-vote-as-marriage-campaigns-take-to-skies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/01/bill-shorten-and-di-natale-rally-yes-vote-as-marriage-campaigns-take-to-skies","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten and Di Natale rally yes vote as marriage campaigns take to skies","bodyText":"Bill Shorten has spoken at a marriage equality rally in Melbourne, urging supporters of the yes campaign to fight “one day more” than the no campaign to help return a yes vote on the voluntary postal survey.

Speaking to the crowd before the march began, Shorten praised the work of the yes campaign and asked them to keep their endurance up in the final five weeks of the vote. “Ask yourself, have you got it within you to go one day more than the no case?” he said. “That is the contest. Are you strong enough to go one day more for the yes case than the no case?” The Australian Bureau of Statistics will not accept any votes on the postal survey past 7 November and the results will be posted on the ABS website on 15 November. If the results show a majority yes vote, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told Sky News on Sunday, the government would facilitate bringing a private member’s bill before parliament in the final sitting weeks of the year to change the Marriage Act and allow same-sex couples to marry. Cormann said there had been a “high level of enthusiasm” in the survey and he expected it would show a “credible participation rate”. From this week, the ABS will publish weekly estimates of how many survey forms have been received. Shorten said he believed the yes vote was winning but added that the vote was “by no matter concluded”. He criticised what he called the “distracting arguments” of the no campaign, which have included arguing that a yes vote on marriage equality would support the safe schools program and facilitate an attack on religious freedom. While the crowd was gathering in Melbourne, two airborne messages, one in support of marriage equality and one against, took to the skies above Sydney and the Gold Coast. A helicopter towing a large rainbow flag was flown across Sydney, where two weeks ago the no campaign raised $2,500 for a sky writer to write “vote no”. At the Gold Coast in Queensland, another plane towed the message “safe schools just the start vote no”. Speaking at the rally in Melbourne, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, thanked the yes campaign for standing up for “a country that is more loving, a country that is fairer, that’s more decent”. “Today we stand together united knowing that we have got a few more weeks left on this long journey and they’re some of the longest, most difficult weeks ahead of us,” Di Natale said. “Because we have to knock on every door. We have to make those phone calls. We have to engage our neighbours in conversation to let them know that in saying yes we take nothing away from anyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/01/gst-could-be-used-to-force-states-to-develop-gas-cormann-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T02:50:23Z","webTitle":"GST could be used to force states to develop gas, Cormann says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/01/gst-could-be-used-to-force-states-to-develop-gas-cormann-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/01/gst-could-be-used-to-force-states-to-develop-gas-cormann-says","fields":{"headline":"GST could be used to force states to develop gas, Cormann says","bodyText":"The federal government has indicated it could use the GST to try to force states to end bans on gas exploration and development. As it seeks to avoid long-term gas shortages, the Coalition is escalating pressure on state governments to ease restrictions. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the federal government just wanted all jurisdictions to develop their economies to their full potential. “We want states like New South Wales and Victoria and the Northern Territory to step back from their moratoriums on gas exploration and development of their resources,” he told Sky News on Sunday. “GST-sharing arrangements are a potential lever to encourage and incentivise the states and territories to develop their economies to their full potential.” The Commonwealth Grants Commission – the independent body that carves up the GST pie – has indicated it will consider coal seam gas development as part of its 2018 update and 2020 review of the formula to split the tax take between jurisdictions. In a discussion paper released late last week, the commission notes Queensland and South Australia have no bans on gas exploration or development, but all other jurisdictions (bar the Australian Capital Territory, which doesn’t have any gas reserves) have some form of restriction. “The commission could take the view that all states that have CSG have the opportunity to exploit it and whether they do or not solely reflects policy choice,” it states. If the commission assumed that states had the capacity to raise money from their gas resources, it could potentially withhold GST or give them a lower share in a similar way it now treats gambling revenues. It said the “same considerations” appled to mining uranium. Cormann said that use of levers to encourage states and territories to develop their economies was “in the national interest”. “It is important that every individual state and territory jurisdiction puts its best foot forward,” he said. “Clearly we need to increase the domestic supply of gas and to have three key jurisdictions locking up their supply of gas is manifestly not in our national interest,” he added, in reference to NSW, Victoria and the Northern Territory On Wednesday three major gas companies agreed to fill the shortfall in the domestic gas market next year, saving the government from having to enact its export control trigger. Santos, Origin Energy and Shell agreed to quarantine additional supply after meeting the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, his deputy, Barnaby Joyce, and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg. But the government did not confirm how many additional petajoules were being set aside. Turnbull would only say that another meeting had been scheduled for Tuesday at which the government hoped to finalise the agreement. Cormann said the prime minister had “shown great leadership … in relation to the decision by exporting gas businesses on the east coast diverting increased supply into the domestic market”. The topic of gas exploration bans may also be raised at a Council of Australian Governments meeting on Thursday, although it has been called specifically to discuss terrorism. Asked about resistance from AGL to the government’s proposal for it to sell the Liddell coal-fired power plant to a responsible buyer to keep open beyond 2022, Cormann noted the company had 90 days to develop alternative proposals and the government would “cross that bridge when we come to it” if AGL refused to sell. “Our unequivocal focus is taking every possible step to bring down the cost of electricity, and to increase the reliability affordability of energy supplies,” he said.

I fully agree with your recent comments that broadcasters are making “woeful progress” in representing the diversity of our society, including the representation of people from BAME backgrounds. As you made clear, this “shocking” failure creates a “cultural disconnect” between programme makers and viewers. This will only change if Ofcom put in place clear requirements that broadcasters must meet. In order to regulate diversity of the broadcasting industry successfully, Ofcom must have a clear definition of what constitutes a “diverse BAME production”. Sir Lenny Henry has sought to solve this issue by proposing a definition that involves a production, meeting two of three criteria. In summary: (1) at least 50% of the production staff measured against cost must be BAME; (2) at least 50% of on-screen talent measured against cost must be BAME; (3) at least 30% of senior personnel must be BAME. Ringfencing funds for production and programming has proven a successful method of widening access to the broadcasting industry across the regions and nations. Building on this success, I am writing to ask that Ofcom consider expanding this approach with the aim of improving BAME diversity. Measuring progress is essential for improving BAME diversity across the broadcast industry, but without clear targets, progress cannot be properly assessed and tracked. Ofcom is in a position to significantly improve this process by requiring broadcasters to provide more consistent and accurate statistics. The three proposals I have highlighted above are straightforward steps Ofcom can take to improve the lack of progress on BAME diversity in the broadcasting industry. I believe the promotion of diversity in broadcasting is not only vital for the culture and profile of the UK but is critical for ensuring the commercial success and sustainability of one of the most important drivers of the London economy. London is proudly one of the most diverse cities in the world, and we should be aiming for nothing less than for that to be reflected in an equally diverse broadcasting industry. Yours sincerely, Sadiq Khan Mayor of London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/30/theresa-may-survival-sajid-javid-tories-knives","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T22:03:00Z","webTitle":"Theresa May in battle for survival as Tories sharpen knives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/30/theresa-may-survival-sajid-javid-tories-knives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/30/theresa-may-survival-sajid-javid-tories-knives","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May in battle for survival as Tories sharpen knives","bodyText":"An increasingly desperate Theresa May will try to shore up her flagging premiership with a raft of new policies aimed at young voters, as another cabinet minister refused to endorse her staying in office until the next election. In an interview with the Observer on the eve of the Tory conference, which opens in Manchester on Sunday, communities secretary Sajid Javid declined to reply when asked if May should lead the Tories into the next election campaign. After a 40-minute discussion during which he lamented the way the last campaign had focused too much on Brexit and May herself, Javid laughed when asked the question, then stood up and declared: “I think we are out of time.” Amid growing signs that cabinet discipline is breaking down and support for the prime minister is draining away, May will announce a series of policy changes in the hope of halting her party’s potentially disastrous loss of support among voters under 45. These will include freezing tuition fees, which are due to rise with inflation from £9,250 in 2017-18 to about £9,500 in 2018-19, while ministers look again at the system. She will also announce that the earnings threshold at which graduates start to pay off their loans will be increased from £21,000 to £25,000, and will go up in line with earnings after next year. That will mean a saving of about £360 in 2018-19 compared with this year for graduates earning at least £25,000. There will also be more help offered to aspiring homeowners, and to renters. As well as a £10bn expansion of the Help to Buy loan scheme, Javid will announce that all private landlords will be required to join a redress system that allows tenants to complain and see those in breach sanctioned. Javid will also oblige letting agents to be registered with a professional body and require them to meet a set of minimum standards. In an eve-of-conference message, May said the policy announcements were “key parts of my plan to spread opportunity and build a better future for our country”. However, Conservatives will arrive in Manchester amid an air of gathering crisis not only over the prime minister’s ability to cling to office but also over her loss of support, particularly among younger voters. Polling by Opinium for the Social Market Foundation published by the Observer shows that more than twice as many voters under the age of 45 now think Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is “on their side” than believe the same about the Tories. Commenting on the figures in an article on theguardian.com, Phillip Lee, a minister in the justice department, says the Tory party is now a “huge turn-off” for most younger people. Also commenting on the party’s problem with younger voters, Paul Masterson MP said his party had to make sure it didn’t “get to the stage where it is seen as an analogue party in a digital age”. He said: “If the party wants to win over young voters, it must become a dynamic force for modern, inclusive, open and – yes – liberal conservatism that speaks to their most basic of wants: the chance to buy their own home, a decent job, a safe environment for their families and a fair crack at fulfilling their potential.” The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, fuelled suspicion that he wants to replace May as leader when he used an interview in the Sun to make further provocative demands over Brexit, including an insistence that the transition period announced by the prime minister last “not a day longer” than two years. Johnson’s remarks appeared to break a cabinet agreement that the precise duration of transition be left open. The foreign secretary also appeared to suggest that there could be no role for the European court of justice during a transition period, which he knows Brussels will refuse to accept. While May wants to focus the conference on her domestic agenda, it seemed increasingly likely on Saturday night that issues of leadership and Brexit would dominate. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, will lead a mass anti-Brexit protest outside the conference. Johnson’s interventions have been met with a mixture of concern and withering contempt by key EU leaders even as the tone of the negotiations improved following May’s speech in Florence. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is understood to be interested in the idea of a transition period but worried by the uncertainty in the UK over what is being sought, both in its length and its terms. Matti Maasikas, the deputy prime minister of Estonia, which currently holds the rolling European council presidency, voiced the widely held belief that hopes of gaining the support of leave voters ahead of the scheduled 2022 UK general election were driving those seeking a two-year limit on the transition ending in 2021. “Am I mistaken,” he asked, “if I say that so far these dates, the possible numbers on the duration, have more to do with British domestic considerations?” The length of the transition period should, he added, be determined by how long it takes the UK to get its new systems of controls at the border ready, and by whether it remains “beneficial to the EU”. Maasikas also insisted that those, including Brexit secretary David Davis and Johnson, who believe the UK would be outside of EU law and the remit of the European court of justice during that period would face a wholly united and opposed EU27. “Should the single market arrangement be there, it is the whole package, with the acquis [EU law],” he said. “Preserving the integrity of the single market, this is one of the crown jewels of EU integration. I expect the EU to be very rigid about this.” Asked whether the EU would open talks about a transition period at the European council summit later this month, as the UK hopes, Maasikas, said: “No.” He added, though, that it was up to the EU’s chief negotiator to ask leaders for a mandate to do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/18/country-diary-tamar-valley-scent-apples-pears","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T04:30:44Z","webTitle":"Country diary: the air is heavy with the scent of apples","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/country-diary-tamar-valley-scent-apples-pears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/18/country-diary-tamar-valley-scent-apples-pears","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: the air is heavy with the scent of ripe apples","bodyText":"Sheltered from rain, inside the display tent at Cotehele’s Apple Day, the perfume of juice and ripe fruit pervades the damp air. Examples of different varieties are pinned to a board and Mary and James (my sister and brother-in-law) have laid out a lavish array from their orchard of local varieties, gathered on rare dry days during recent weeks. A basket of pears, decorated with swags of rose hips and sloes, includes the large Aston Town (originally found in a pub garden at Launceston), Green Chisel (possibly the Hastings pear), green sweats, various harvest pears, grey and red Catterns, all awaiting the results of genetic tests to confirm their identities. Golden Wonder apples compete for size with the striped Colloggett (valued for cider), and children are tempted by the shiny Crimson Queens, rescued from the dilapidated Slew orchard further up the Tamar and exhibited by Veitch of Exeter way back in 1883. Most of the apples brought for identification are modern, but from a derelict market garden at Forder (near Saltash) comes a Black Rock, the local name for Mère de Ménage, an old European apple and a reliable heavy fruiter. Specimens illustrating diseases such as scab, bitter pit and brown rot contrast with the brilliance and lusciousness of the apples on show – which are mostly capable of withstanding the damp mildness of the south-west. Despite the dull wet summer, Lady’s Fingers, Cornish Aromatic and King Byerd have thrived in the nearby orchard overlooking the river, where unpicked fruit gleams red in the misty drizzle. Next day, during a brighter interlude, I pick up a third batch of apples (Sanspareil and Tamar Beauty) for juicing. Close by, South Devon cows and calves turn flanks towards the warmth; rows of straw from late-combined barley will soon be overgrown by grass and there remain acres of uncut cereals. Here, on this sunny, south-facing, slope, ivy flowers are a magnet for bees and butterflies (particularly red admirals), a chiffchaff sings overhead, trees appear burnished, and the undersides of fading leaves on regenerated oaks are colonised by myriads of spangle galls awaiting leaf-drop and the next stage in their transformation into tiny wasps.

They have built their success on retaining possession, but Leicester showed Exeter how to use it as they turned three visits to their opponents’ 22 into 17 points. It was Leicester’s third successive victory, built on the defiance, attitude and opportunism that were absent in their defeat at Northampton. Exeter were without their England wing Jack Nowell who returned from England’s training camp with a dead leg, while the Tigers’ prop Ellis Genge, who had also spent the first part of the week with the national squad in Oxford, withdrew after suffering a back spasm during the warm-up. Exeter like to wear down teams but Leicester’s stamina endured, even when they lost two forwards, Mike Williams and Harry Wells, in the final quarter with head injuries. They kept hitting rucks with ferocity, rushing up in defence and plundering turnovers. They defused the Chiefs’ strike weapon by repelling three driving mauls and played like a team that knew its limitations. Exeter, who had lost one of their previous 10 away matches in the Premiership, had wider boundaries but strayed off course. They took the lead with a Gareth Steenson penalty after four minutes when Ben Youngs strayed offside at a ruck, but found few holes in a defence held together by zeal. After 20 minutes, Exeter had enjoyed 90% of the territory and their three-quarters had touched the ball 30 times compared to Leicester’s one. Having been in total control they found themselves behind after 26 minutes. First, a 15-phase move ended with the ball spilled a metre from the home line by Jonny Hill, then Exeter’s former Leicester flanker was sent to the sin-bin for a no-arms tackle. After Telusa Veainu stepped out of Mitch Lees’s tackle and reached the Chiefs’ 22, the Tigers used an attacking scrum to draw defenders and crisp passes from George Ford and Matt Toomua gave Nick Malouf the room to score on the right wing. Malouf was then fortunate not to receive a yellow card after taking out Phil Dollman in the air. The momentum had shifted: Ian Whitten and Henry Slade messed up a move on the outside of Ford and Leicester, sustaining their ferocity at the breakdown and in the tackle, extended their lead when Ford added three more points with a 35-metre drop goal. Ford extended Leicester’s 10-3 interval lead with a 40-metre penalty eight minutes after the restart. The Tigers were showing no indication of fatigue and Nowell’s replacement, Lachie Turner, was enduring an afternoon that was as miserable as the weather, handling and tackling errors in the opening period compounded by a soft penalty he gave away after being tackled. Exeter’s early efficiency had melted into uncertainty. They even messed up their staple, a driving maul, when Steenson’s penalty kick to touch earned them a throw five metres from the Tigers’ line: as the Chiefs set themselves up for a drive to the line, Sione Kalamafoni helped himself to the ball. Exeter, though, are not a side to feel comfortable against. Leicester conceded a rash of penalties within range of their posts. The Chiefs declined to go for three points each time and the referee was playing advantage when Dollman’s pass to an unmarked Turner was deliberately knocked-on by Veainu. The full-back was sent to the sin-bin and in a case of double jeopardy Exeter were awarded a penalty try. The champions reverted to hogging the ball but Kalamafoni disputed their monopoly. He stalled another driving maul near his own line and then forced a turnover off Slade in the home 22. It meant Exeter failed to exploit their temporary one-man advantage and when Veianu’s 10 minutes were up, Leicester immediately increased their lead. Dollman dropped Ford’s high kick and Olly Woodburn was among the Exeter players anticipating a scrum, but Ben Youngs played advantage, running across the field to put himself within passing range of Jonny May and the Tigers had their 10-point lead back. There was time for Exeter, who continued to turn down the option of three points from penalties, to mess up another driving line-out. The threat of Kalamafoni led Elvis Taione to throw the ball in the direction of his scrum-half. Leicester were awarded a penalty at the resulting scrum and when Steenson finally went for the posts one minute from time and hit the right-hand one, it looked as if the Chiefs would fail to secure a point for the third time in 60 Premiership matches, but a collapsed scrum in front of the posts provided him with atonement.

In a strongly worded letter to Ofcom head Sharon White, backed by the performer Lenny Henry, Khan urges that money to make more ethnically diverse television programmes should be ringfenced. “The BBC, Sky TV, Channel 4 and the BFI all have different definitions, which at times are so broad that they can be met without employing a single person of colour either on or off-screen,” he writes, endorsing Henry’s plan for every qualifying BAME production to have 50% or more of its staff and talent BAME, as well as 30% of senior personnel. “This year,” he told the Observer, “marks the 30th anniversary of Black History Month in the UK. It’s time our broadcasters step up to the plate and redouble their efforts to be properly representative of the population as a whole.” Taking White up on comments she made to the Guardian last month describing progress when it comes to BAME representation as “woeful” , the mayor argues that Ofcom should be prepared to act across the board. He joins forces with campaigners such as Henry, Meera Syal and Idris Elba. Supporting the letter, Henry said: “We all know that ‘if you can’t see, you can’t be’. Mr Khan’s words are a direct plea to Ofcom to put pressure on broadcasters to represent minorities both on screen and behind the camera.” The mayor also criticises the BBC for failing to show leadership. A series of mathematical dodges, he claims, has distorted the issue. “Currently, statistics published by broadcasters on BAME employment in the broadcasting industry are inconsistent and, at times, misleading. They often merge those working in financial and commercial departments with those working on the creative or production side of the industry, thereby distorting the creative input of BAME representation in the broadcasting industry. “At times, the statistics give little detail of who occupies editorial positions and levels of seniority of BAME staff. Furthermore, some statistics merge those working in overseas departments with those working in the UK, which can give a misleading impression of the level of BAME employment in the broadcasting industry among the UK population. It is clear that a more robust approach is needed.” An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We share the Mayor’s concern that broadcasters must do more to improve diversity on and off screen. We hope to meet the Mayor soon to discuss our current work on this important issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/30/dschingis-secret-enable-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-chantilly","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T15:52:50Z","webTitle":"Dschingis Secret is value to upset Enable in Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/30/dschingis-secret-enable-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-chantilly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/30/dschingis-secret-enable-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-chantilly","fields":{"headline":"Dschingis Secret is value to upset Enable in Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe","bodyText":"It was sunshine and shirtsleeves here on Saturday for the first afternoon of Arc weekend and the best news of all for thousands of racing fans making the trip to France was that a forecast of heavy rain for the track on Sunday has dwindled to little or no rain at all. Enable, the hot favourite for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, now seems unlikely to face a muddy slog and that may be enough to persuade many waverers that she is a good thing to win her fifth Group One race of the season. Most bookmakers make Enable an even-money chance for the big race, though another suggested on Friday that she could drift to a shade of odds-against on the day. For practical purposes, though, she is a 22-carat evens chance, a coin-toss to beat 17 opponents, and every punter will have their own idea about the factors that matter most as they weigh up which way to call. Bottomless ground may now be less of a worry for favourite backers, but simple bad luck in running could beat Enable too: a slow start, a gap closing or a run checked at a vital moment. She is the clear form horse in the race and none of Frankie Dettori’s rivals will be doing them any favours. But Enable’s rider has always been the jockey for the big occasion and if anyone can be trusted to steer an effective path from stall two it is Dettori. Above all, though, there is the chance that Enable will beat Enable, not through any failing of courage or attitude but simply because, at the end of a six-race season that started on 21 April and has included four Group Ones, scaling one final peak will prove too much. This is the question that really makes the race and the market, the one that can be answered only when the stalls open this. Some pointers imply that it is a significant concern, such as the fact that no three-year-old filly trained in Britain or Ireland – where the best of them tend to race regularly at the top level through the summer – has won an Arc. Others, such as John Gosden’s form and record in the biggest autumn events, suggest otherwise. Enable may not need to run up to her King George form to win, but she will have to get quite close and my own view is that the lingering effects of an outstanding season are enough of a worry to rule her out as a bet at even money. Many will disagree, and they may well be queueing at the PMU windows to collect here after a hugely popular success, but Enable’s short price invites an each-way bet against her. The King George form – when Enable beat Ulysses by four-and-a-half lengths – suggests Ulysses is unlikely to bridge the gap and his draw in stall one will also make life difficult for a horse that seems sure to be held up. Winter, the other top three-year-old filly in the field, has attracted support after Ryan Moore picked her out from Aidan O’Brien’s five runners, but, like Enable, she has been busy all year. Unlike Enable she is unproven at the trip and not an obvious candidate to get it. O’Brien had the 1-2-3 last year and completed a Group One double at Newmarket on Saturday with Clemmie, the favourite, in the Cheveley Park Stakes and US Navy Flag, a 10-1 second-string, in the Middle Park Stakes. On that basis, Order Of St George and Capri, and perhaps even Seventh Heaven, deserve respect, but Moore has ridden all of them in the past and opted for Winter. The French challenge looks unusually weak, with Brametot, another trying the trip for the first time, having finished well beaten last time out and Zarak, who has yet to show the level of form required here, drawn on the wide outside. Satono Diamond looks below the standard of recent Japanese challengers that have tried and failed. Dschingis Secret, though, looks much more like what is required. Horses trained in Germany rarely receive much attention or respect from British backers and bookies, but Dschingis Secret has put together a run of excellent performances over the year, including a convincing win in the Prix Foy with Satono Diamond well beaten.

This felt more like a victory for Marco Silva’s resilient side, who recovered from being 2-0 down inside 21 minutes against notoriously difficult opponents to salvage a thoroughly deserved point courtesy of yet another last-gasp goal from Richarlison. The Brazilian, who scored a 90th-minute winner against Swansea a week ago, is looking like one of the signings of the summer. Bought from Fluminense for £11.5m, he has already scored three times in the Premier League and Silva has no doubt that he has a special player on his hands. The Watford manager talked afterwards about a “huge talent” and a striker who “will achieve fantastic things in his career”. As well as scoring the equaliser, Richarlison had a hand in Watford’s opening goal, which gave them a platform to claw their way back into a game that was in danger of passing them by when West Bromwich Albion scored twice in three minutes. Salomón Rondón, with only his second Premier League goal this year, got the first and Jonny Evans headed in the second. Watford, however, never looked like downing tools and the goal that Abdoulaye Doucouré pulled back eight minutes before half-time felt like just reward for their persistence. Albion lived dangerously thereafter, although it had looked as though they would hold on for a win until Richarlison met José Holebas’s free-kick with a towering header. Tony Pulis was furious. The Albion manager was annoyed that his players had been so careless to allow Watford to break upfield so late in the game but more aggrieved with Michael Oliver, the referee. Pulis felt that James McClean should never have been penalised for a foul on Richarlison and pointed out that the goal was scored in the 95th minute, despite the fourth official signalling there would only be four minutes of added time. “It was disappointing. The challenge from McClean is fair. He plays the ball. And the referee again has got a great view of it, that’s two games in a row where a decision that has gone against us has cost us a goal,” said Pulis, referring to the defeat at Arsenal on Monday. “Having said that I still think we should have been more set up to make sure they didn’t counter-attack.” Silva, who had seen his side win their previous three Premier League away games, was full of praise for his players’ “character, personality and spirit”. The fact they enjoyed 65% possession and registered 15 shots to Albion’s nine supported the Watford manager’s claim that the least his team deserved was a draw. That outcome looked unlikely, however, when Albion struck twice early on. Rondon’s opener owed much to the vision of Grzegorz Krychowiak, whose lovely pass from deep encouraged the Venezuelan to sprint clear. After outmuscling Christian Kabasele and with the angle against him, Rondon beat Heurelho Gomes at his near post with a neat finish. Evans then doubled Albion’s leader when he headed in a Matt Phillips corner and both Jay Rodriguez and Ahmed Hegazi had chances to score a third for the home side. Watford badly needed to gain a foothold in the game again and, to their credit, they managed to do so. André Carrillo ought to have scored with a header from three years out before Doucouré , running onto Richarlison’s clever flick, drilled a low left-footed shot across Ben Foster and into the far corner. Richarlison spurned one chance to head in at the far post but was not so forgiving when presented with a second opportunity late on. “An amazing boy,” said Silva. “When I told our board I want that player, I saw in him different things than are normal for a Brazilian footballer. But of course you never know if a 20-year-old boy can adapt as fast as him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/30/thousands-march-in-dublin-calling-for-end-to-irelands-abortion-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T18:34:04Z","webTitle":"Thousands march in Dublin calling for end to Ireland's abortion ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/thousands-march-in-dublin-calling-for-end-to-irelands-abortion-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/30/thousands-march-in-dublin-calling-for-end-to-irelands-abortion-ban","fields":{"headline":"Thousands march in Dublin calling for end to Ireland's abortion ban","bodyText":"Thousands of people have protested in Dublin, calling for an end to Ireland’s strict abortion laws. Campaigners took part in the March for Choice in the capital’s city centre, chanting: “Hey, hey Leo, the eighth amendment has got to go” and carrying banners which read: “Keep your rosaries off my ovaries” and “Parent by choice for choice”. This year’s march, the sixth in a series of annual events, was more significant than ever given the recent confirmation there will be a referendum on abortion next year. The government recently set a potential timescale of early summer 2018 for a referendum on the eighth amendment, the section of Ireland’s constitution imposing tight legal restrictions on terminations. The amendment, which was voted into the constitution by referendum in 1983, affords equal rights to unborn babies and pregnant women and gives foetuses the right to life by law. Terminations are only permitted when the life of the mother is at risk, and the maximum penalty for having an illegal abortion in Ireland is 14 years in prison. Thousands of Irish women travel to England each year to have a legal termination. Campaigners gathered at the Garden of Remembrance at lunchtime, making their way down the city’s main thoroughfare, O’Connell Street. They marched along the river Liffey and past the landmark Custom House before reaching the Irish parliament. Among those who spoke at the end of the march in Merrion Square were the civil rights leader and former politician Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, comedian and actor Tara Flynn, British Labour MP Stella Creasy, and poet and LGBT activist Matt Kennedy. Anti-abortion activists staged counter-events in Dublin and across Ireland calling for the eighth amendment to be preserved, indicating protests from both sides are likely to intensify in the lead-up to the referendum. A pro-choice rally was staged outside the Irish embassy in London on Saturday, with campaigners highlighting the numbers of Irish women who have travelled to Britain for an abortion in the last three decades. A few hundred demonstrators gathered outside the embassy, chanting: “34 years since ’83, stop sending women across the sea” and holding placards which read: “Healthcare not Ryanair” and “Irish women deserve better”. The campaigners also attempted to make more than 205,700 white chalk marks on the pavement to represent the number of women who have travelled to mainland Britain from both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland since 1983 to access a safe abortion. Maeve O’Reilly, from the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign, said: “These journeys, which are often taken in silence and are very stigmatised and shameful in the eyes of our government, we wanted to make them visible by making these physical marks on the pavement here today.” She said campaigners were encouraged by recent polls which she said have shown that “most Irish people want to see a liberalisation of Irish abortion laws.” She added: “We’re really confident that the Irish public will engage with this issue, will have a good debate and people will begin to see that abortion is already happening. It’s just not happening in Ireland. “And the time has come to kind of wake up to that and do better for our women and offer this care at home, rather than exiling them to other countries.” • This article was amended on 5 October 2017 to amend a geographical reference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/01/rafa-benitez-newcastle-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Rafa Benítez: ‘Create a good atmosphere and you can win trophies’ | Louise Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/01/rafa-benitez-newcastle-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/01/rafa-benitez-newcastle-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Rafa Benítez: ‘Create a good atmosphere and you can win trophies’","bodyText":"Rafa Benítez likes to list the very real similarities between the cities of Liverpool and Newcastle and their respective football clubs. He relishes the hallmark, often razor‑sharp humour common to both sets of supporters, appreciates the broad socioeconomic parallels and understands shared fears that their teams are in peril of turning into perennial also-rans. If such worries are markedly more pronounced on Tyneside, it is approaching six years since Liverpool last won a trophy – the 2012 League Cup, under Kenny Dalglish. Accordingly their supporters head to St James’ Park for Sunday’s meeting with Benítez’s Newcastle United anxious about the balance of Jürgen Klopp’s often thrillingly attacking yet defensively vulnerable side. With memories of Liverpool’s 1980s hegemony increasingly distant, the days when the Spaniard lifted four trophies – most notably the 2005 Champions League – at Anfield are now a source of nostalgia. Before kick-off, Liverpool’s former manager – whose still lives on the Wirral and whose wife, Montse, runs a local charity foundation – is expected to receive an ovation from all corners of the ground as his past and present collide. It seems fitting that he and Klopp are good friends. “It will be a really special day,” says Benítez. “Very emotional.” If much has changed since he parted company with Liverpool in 2010, quite a lot has stayed pretty much the same. This explains why a man desperate to deliver Newcastle’s first major trophy since the Fairs Cup in 1969 sympathises with the challenge confronting Klopp. “When I arrived at Liverpool, the budget was £20m gross,” says the Spaniard whose narrow failure to win the Premier League in 2009 remains an itch he cannot scratch. “When I left it was £17m, but still people said I must win the title. Manchester United had around £50m more every year, but they said I must compete against them. “After United you had to compete with Chelsea and Arsenal. Now you have Manchester City and Tottenham, too. But it’s always been similar. There are massive clubs with massive amounts of money and Liverpool were always a little bit behind. But if you create a good team, a good atmosphere and work hard you can get there. You can win trophies.” Cups are one thing but titles quite another. “We had 86 points one year and finished second behind United,” says Benítez. “You can be Leicester and win the title because the three or four top teams were not performing but probably 90% of the time the title winners have the most money. “It’s quite difficult for Jürgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino. They have to build teams good enough to compensate for the difference. They can win the title but it’s hard. The only way is to be really good one year and hope two or three of the others have bad years at the same time.” Benítez’s memories of Liverpool are dominated by seasons that were so sunny there seemed a time when the 57-year-old envisaged staying at Anfield until retirement. “In the days when David Moores and Rick Parry were in charge it was really, really good. They were people who really understood football. It was like a family, very close. Then the club had to be sold and everything changed, they changed directors and the new owners ran it more as a business.” An increasingly cordial relationship with Mike Ashley has recently involved Benítez talking to Newcastle’s distinctly business-minded owner on the phone and discussing a prospective dinner date that is expected to prompt potential negotiations over a contract. Even so, few close observers expect a manager much admired by West Ham to end his career at St James’ Park. There may be an apparent air of harmony but he will not forget this summer’s transfer market failures. Meanwhile, the presence of Keith Bishop, Ashley’s PR adviser, at Benítez’s media briefings in recent weeks could be interpreted as an unwelcome attempt to neuter his messages to the media. Yet if there is a sense he can glimpse a life beyond Tyneside, Benítez has undeniably developed powerful bonds with his latest club, city, public and players. When asked if Newcastle can win trophies, his reply is instructive. “Yes, for sure,” he says. “It can happen but it depends on a lot of things. Our young players can improve but you also need experienced people to help them develop. If in January or whenever, we sign three or four players and they’re good players that would be massive.” Like the supporters he meets in the city, Newcastle players frequently talk about Benítez’s warmth but some of his old Liverpool squad recall a much cooler figure and suggest he is now a different character. “When you’re a young manager and trying to build something, you work very, very hard,” he says, looking slightly sceptical. “Little by little you have more staff and more experience and then you can manage in a different way. When that happened my relationship with players like Stevie [Steven Gerrard] or Carra [Jamie Carragher] was normal. “There was difference in age so I couldn’t talk about PlayStations but you have to understand players and talk normally to them about football and families. Nowadays, I have more experience and I sometimes give them more space. If they play golf, I ask them about their handicap – but it’s not a big difference from Liverpool.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/30/spanish-ambassador-to-uk-calls-catalan-referendum-a-coup-detat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T16:13:45Z","webTitle":"Spanish ambassador to UK calls Catalan referendum a ‘coup d’etat’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/spanish-ambassador-to-uk-calls-catalan-referendum-a-coup-detat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/30/spanish-ambassador-to-uk-calls-catalan-referendum-a-coup-detat","fields":{"headline":"Spanish ambassador to UK calls Catalan referendum a ‘coup d’etat’","bodyText":"The Spanish ambassador to the UK, Carlos Bastarreche, has claimed that Europe is watching “a slow-motion, low-cost coup d’etat” by the Catalan government. He also urged the British people to disregard David Cameron’s decision to grant an independence referendum to the Scottish people in 2014, saying it was not comparable to the Spanish government’s decision to block the Catalan vote. The ambassador warned the UK may be the first to be affected if Catalonia breaks away after Sunday’s referendum. Bastarreche believes it would revive calls by Scottish nationalists for Scotland to stay in the EU after Brexit, and possibly create a split. He said: “If the Catalan government succeed it will be a drama for Europe, starting with the UK, because it will mean that a region can disobey the rule of law.” Numerous British commentators have suggested that the Spanish government should follow the example of Cameron’s coalition government, which granted the Scottish people a referendum. The Catalan government is pressing ahead with a referendum in the face of obstruction by the Spanish executive, judiciary and the police. The Catalan parliament has declared that the result will be binding, but the Spanish government says it is illegal. The possibility that Catalonia will be stripped of its legal powers of self-government, or even that the army will be sent in, has not been ruled out. The Spanish court has also ordered public officials not to cooperate with the ballot, and has vowed to close any polling station, as well as seize ballot papers, in order to disrupt what has been decreed an illegal referendum called by the Catalan parliament in breach of procedures. Bastarreche, who was appointed ambassador in February, said: “Catalan secessionist leaders are running a sort of slow-motion, low-cost coup d’etat, using soft violence, that has serious implications for European stability.” He said comparisons to Cameron granting a Scottish referendum were “not valid or helpful to explain the situation in Catalonia because of Spain’s written constitution, which is a product of a different history”. “This is not a dispute between Madrid and Catalonia. On the one side is a democratic Spain and its independent judicial system, and on the other side not Catalonia, but a group of radical nationalists and leftwing extremists in the regional power that are not complying with the law,” Bastarreche said. He argued the UK was unusual in not having a written constitution, and most constitutions in Europe underline the indivisibility of the nation state. Catalonia joined the rest of Spain in endorsing the written constitution with a referendum in 1978. Bastarreche said: “Most countries have written constitutions, and the Spanish one is a product of our 500-year history, and one of its central principles is the indivisibility of the kingdom.” Although the Spanish government has the strong support of the UK government in its struggle with Catalonia, there is a frustration in Madrid that the British experience with the Scottish referendum has led to political sympathy for the Catalan demand for a legally recognised referendum. Bastarreche said: “Bavaria cannot be a separate state and neither would the German court allow it. California has not been given the right to secede. The Spanish territory is not divisible but to fit its diversity there is a very decentralised system. “There is nothing in international law that gives any region a right to self-determination in a democratic state.” Spanish sources point out that even though Scotland was granted a referendum in 2014, now it was not being given the right to decide whether to remain inside the EU, even though Scotland voted heavily against Brexit. Bastarreche added: “We have a rich cultural diversity, in particular the Basque country, Andalusia, Galicia and the Canary Islands, and Catalonia adds to that diversity. Without Catalonia, Spain is no longer Spain. States must always uphold the law.” Explicit political support for the Catalan referendum in the UK has been confined to Scottish nationalists, and some Greens who have written to Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, criticising his methods. Alan Duncan, the Europe minister, has said: “Spain is a great ally of the United Kingdom.” Asked about the situation in Catalonia, he insisted Theresa May’s government was “on the side of the rule of law and the Spanish constitution”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/30/leanne-mckie-detective-greater-manchester-police-body-found-cheshire-lake","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T16:04:33Z","webTitle":"Body in lake confirmed as Greater Manchester police detective","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/leanne-mckie-detective-greater-manchester-police-body-found-cheshire-lake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/30/leanne-mckie-detective-greater-manchester-police-body-found-cheshire-lake","fields":{"headline":"Body in lake confirmed as Greater Manchester police detective","bodyText":"The body of a woman found in a lake in Cheshire is that of a serving detective with Greater Manchester police, a police chief has confirmed.

At the start of the Conservative party conference, when the government is expected to push the case for free trade, the musicians, actors and authors have signed an open letter, co-ordinated by Oxfam, in which they claim that the government’s “double standards” on Yemen have helped fuel the world’s “worst humanitarian crisis”. The letter, published in the Observer, and also signed by the actor Simon Pegg, photographer Rankin and writers Philip Pullman and David Nicholls, among others, states: “As proud Brits we can no longer stay silent about our government’s double standards on Yemen. Even as the UK sends aid to Yemen, British-made bombs are fuelling the conflict there. We are too proud of our country to allow this to continue. We are better than this.” Britain has sold almost £4bn of arms to Saudi Arabia since a coalition led by the kingdom began its bombing campaign in Yemen. Last month, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, signed a new military and security co-operation agreement with the kingdom. Numerous human rights groups, the UN and politicians have claimed the campaign is in breach of international human rights laws because it has allegedly targeted civilians. The UN human rights council has agreed to appoint a group of experts to examine the claims. Some countries had pushed for a full independent international investigation but this was blocked by Saudi Arabia, which threatened economic retaliation. Amid the bombing, almost three-quarters of a million people in Yemen now have cholera, according to the World Health Organisation. The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that the number could surpass one million by the end of the year. Famine is threatening much of the country. Oxfam says that many displaced families in Yemen have been forced to choose between treatment for cholera or food. With nothing left to sell, weakened by hunger and lack of clean water, they are more vulnerable to cholera and are struggling to get treatment, the charity says. It estimates that only 45% of health facilities in Yemen are fully functional because of the war. According to the UN, the number of people unable to access healthcare has increased by 76% since the escalation of the conflict. “Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and it is getting even worse,” said Nigel Timmins, Oxfam’s humanitarian director. “More than two years of war have created ideal conditions for the disease to spread. The war has pushed the country to the edge of famine, forced millions from their homes, virtually destroyed the already weak health services and hampered efforts to respond to the cholera outbreak.” A legal action forcing the government to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia failed in the high court. Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), which brought the case, is appealing against the decision. The court heard that monitoring of the Yemen bombing is being conducted by the Saudi-backed Joint Incidents Assessment Team. Of the nearly 300 reported bombing incidents, the team has so far investigated 36. “With fighter jet negotiations ongoing ... the message coming from government is that Saudi forces can do no wrong,” said Andrew Smith of CAAT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/30/ben-stokes-arrest-england-joe-root-ashes-prospects-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T17:00:38Z","webTitle":"Has Ben Stokes’ late night out and arrest already lost England the Ashes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/30/ben-stokes-arrest-england-joe-root-ashes-prospects-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/30/ben-stokes-arrest-england-joe-root-ashes-prospects-australia","fields":{"headline":"Has Ben Stokes’ late night out and arrest already lost England the Ashes?","bodyText":"1) How have England ended up in this mess? Their nightmare week began last Sunday when, towards the fag-end of what has been the longest and busiest international summer and in keeping with the management’s relaxed approach to post-match celebrations, members of the limited-overs squad ventured out into Bristol city centre to toast their 124-run win over West Indies in the third ODI. At 2.35am, Ben Stokes was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm after an altercation in the Clifton area that left a 27-year-old man in hospital with facial injuries. Stokes was released under investigation and named in England’s Ashes squad on the Wednesday, while retaining the vice-captaincy role he assumed back in February. But after alarming footage of the incident was published by the Sun that evening, he and Alex Hales, who was present at the time, were suspended indefinitely on full pay by the England and Wales Cricket Board pending the outcomes of the police investigation and the governing body’s own internal inquiries. 2) Will Ben Stokes play in Australia? Picturing a scenario where Stokes travels and is available from the outset – a broken finger from the incident notwithstanding – is extremely difficult. It remains a fluid and hugely unpredictable situation, however, with the ECB desperate not to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation by Avon and Somerset police. Accordingly, the governing body has handed the internal case of the two players to the independent Cricket Discipline Commission but this process will not kick in until the police have completed their inquiries. The timeline of events from here is therefore out of the ECB’s hands as Stokes waits to discover whether he will be charged. England’s coaches and players are privately desperate for him to tour given his lynchpin status in the side but also the sport’s public image is at stake, coming at a time it is looking to broaden its family appeal and attract sponsors for Test cricket and the new Twenty20 league. If Stokes somehow emerges from all of this available, Andrew Strauss, the team director, may still decide his presence would prove too great a distraction, or too great a burden for the player himself, given the inevitable media circus that would result. 3) If Stokes does not tour Australia, what are England’s options on the field of play? Stokes is unquestionably the heartbeat of the side, both as a totemic presence in the dressing room that team-mates gravitate towards and as the world’s premier seam-bowling all-rounder. He is capable of producing jaw-dropping interventions, be it with bat, ball or through his electric fielding, and there is simply no like-for-like cricketer waiting in the wings. His absence may mean England react by calling up a batsman and a bowler, such is the two-in-one player they would be trying to replace. The Essex No3 Tom Westley was the batsman to miss out originally but if the desire is to match the power-hitting of Stokes, it will bring Jos Buttler or Liam Livingstone into consideration. Bowling-wise, it would be between the brawny splice-thudding talents of Liam Plunkett or the mercurial fast-medium threat of Steven Finn. Mark Wood is another alternative – and in theory the quickest – but he first needs to prove his fitness on the Lions training camp that shadows the senior tour. As for the team that takes the field at the Gabba, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes are all capable of moving up a spot should they play the extra bowler but this will increase the pressure on those at the top – England’s area of weakness in the past two years. Pack the batting and it will up the workloads for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, which is far from ideal. In short, Stokes holds the whole thing together. 4) What are the implications for the tourists in terms of their behaviour and conduct? The events of last Sunday night have prompted a review into the team’s rules and conduct by Strauss. The former captain hired the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, back in 2015 to put in place a laid-back team atmosphere that allows players to perform unimpinged but the pair are furious how far the players have taken it. Three of them, understood to be Bairstow, Jake Ball and Plunkett, were also out drinking that evening, albeit not present at the incident, and are in a disciplinary process too. Australia is a hostile country for touring cricketers – the media storm that engulfed South Africa’s Faf du Plessis last winter when charged with ball-tampering is one such example – and England’s players will doubtless have their off-field responsibilities drilled into them before they depart for Perth on 28 October. The ECB have played down a report that they will employ minders to chaperone the squad on nights out but Bayliss has admitted he is pondering a possible curfew, something that would go against his philosophy. 5) What have Australia made of all this disruption? The Australia players and management on the current tour of India have offered a straight bat to what have been sparse questions about Stokes. David Warner, he of the Walkabout punch in 2013, was incredibly not asked about it at all last week. But the newspaper columns have been filled with reaction to England’s chaos. Malcolm Knox, in the Melbourne Age, accused the ECB of “contorting themselves into a pretzel in an attempt to retain both Ben Stokes and their principles” and added their “desperate desire to win the series in Australia can be measured by Stokes not having been sacked”. Andrew Wu stated: “There is a belief that an Australian player would have had his contract torn up had he behaved in such a way.” Ian Chappell, the former Australia captain, put England’s predicament over Stokes in typically blunt fashion: “I don’t think they’ve got a hope in hell without him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/01/cambridge-analytica-big-data-facebook-trump-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-30T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"British courts may unlock secrets of how Trump campaign profiled US voters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/01/cambridge-analytica-big-data-facebook-trump-voters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/01/cambridge-analytica-big-data-facebook-trump-voters","fields":{"headline":"British courts may unlock secrets of how Trump campaign profiled US voters","bodyText":"A US professor is trying to reclaim his personal data from the controversial analytics firm that helped Donald Trump to power. In what legal experts say may be a “watershed” case, a US citizen is using British laws to try to discover how he was profiled and potentially targeted by the Trump campaign. David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York, has discovered a transatlantic legal mechanism that he hopes will give him access to information being sought by both the FBI and the Senate intelligence committee. In recent weeks, investigators looking at how people acting on behalf of Russia targeted American voters have focused on Trump’s data operation. But although the FBI obtained a court order against Facebook to make it disclose evidence, the exact way in which US citizens were profiled and targeted remains largely unknown. But British data protection laws may provide some transparency on the company at the heart of Trump’s data operation – Cambridge Analytica – and how it created profiles of 240 million Americans. In January, Carroll discovered he – and a group of other citizens – had the right under UK law to ask for his personal data back from the company, and when it failed to supply it, he started filing pre-trial actions to sue the company under British law. The lawsuit is the result of a unique situation, according to Ravi Naik of Irvine Thanvi Natas, the British solicitor who is leading the case. It arose because although Cambridge Analytica is largely owned by Trump’s biggest donor, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and though its vice-president at the time of the US election was Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the company was spun out of an older British military and elections contractor, SCL, with which it still shares staff, directors and a London office. Naik says: “It’s this fascinating situation because when it became apparent that Cambridge Analytica had processed Americans’ data in Britain, it suddenly opened up this window of opportunity. In the US, Americans have almost no rights over their data whatsoever, but the data protection framework is set up in such a way that it doesn’t matter where people are: it matters where the data is processed. “I’m a human rights practitioner and in the past most of my cases were national security issues, but increasingly it’s about data protection and the way people are affected by the misuse of their data. I see this as an issue affecting fundamental rights and it’s taking citizen activism to uncover what’s going on, to request data. I really hear echoes of the civil rights movement in people becoming more aware, more resistant and willing to fight.” As an academic, Carroll had studied advertising, data and design, but he was still shocked when Cambridge Analytica eventually sent him a “profile” that it had created about him though not the data it was created from. “It was very strange and unsettling because they had given me ‘scores’ for different issues but I had no idea what they’d based this on.” The company scored him 3/10 on “Gun Rights Importance”, 7/10 on “National Security Importance” and “unlikely” to vote Republican. “I was perplexed by it. I started thinking, ‘Have I had conversations about gun rights on Facebook? Where are they getting this from? And what are they doing with it?’” He reported the firm to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which is investigating the use of data in political campaigning; he has also launched a CrowdJustice campaign and is appealing to the public to help him take the case as far as he can through the British courts. “There are so many disturbing aspects to this. One of the things that really troubles me is how the company can buy anonymous data completely legally from all these different sources, but as soon as it attaches it to voter files, you are re-identified. It means that every privacy policy we have ignored in our use of technology is a broken promise. It would be one thing if this information stayed in the US, if it was an American company and it only did voter data stuff.” But, he argues, “it’s not just a US company and it’s not just a civilian company”. Instead, he says, it has ties with the military through SCL – “and it doesn’t just do voter targeting”. Carroll has provided information to the Senate intelligence committee and believes that the disclosures mandated by a British court could provide evidence helpful to investigators. Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, author of The Black Box Society and a leading expert on big data and the law, called the case a “watershed moment”. “It really is a David and Goliath fight and I think it will be the model for other citizens’ actions against other big corporations. I think we will look back and see it as a really significant case in terms of the future of algorithmic accountability and data protection. These issues are so critical and in the US there are only these incredible, lethargic data laws largely because of the incredible power of the lobbying industry.” Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who has created the firm PersonalData.IO to help people reclaim their data, and who helped Carroll with his quest, said it was important that people realised that there are tools they can use against big corporations. “In the US election, the FBI has been trying to get information from the top down but this doesn’t help with regard to the French election or Brexit,” Dehaye said. “And we know we just cannot trust Facebook, even with good intent, to run our elections fairly. There are a few huge companies amassing vast amounts of data on vast amounts of people and there’s no democratic oversight.” Pasquale said news that Facebook information had been used by Russian agents to target US citizens may prove to be a tipping point. “It shows this information has now been weaponised by a state actor. What we’re seeing is really a failure of the first order. Mark Zuckerberg wrote this 6,000-word letter about creating a global political community and yet we now know that Facebook was a platform for a devastating attack on the most robust democracy in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/25/donald-trump-star-spangled-banner-smithsonian","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Protest and patriotism: a visit to the original star-spangled banner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/donald-trump-star-spangled-banner-smithsonian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/donald-trump-star-spangled-banner-smithsonian","fields":{"headline":"Protest and patriotism: a visit to the original star-spangled banner","bodyText":"It is two centuries old, spans 30ft by 34ft and has suffered the effects of age and being snipped for souvenir hunters. The original star-spangled banner, the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the song that would become the US national anthem, lies horizontally at a 10-degree angle of elevation in a low light chamber at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington. Visitors file past silently and reverently as if beholding a religious relic. “Patriotism: love of country,” Marcia Walker, 71, a retired nurse from Granite City, Illinois, said during a visit on Monday when asked about the meaning of the flag. “It’s not just for the military but it’s a feeling each and every American should have for our justice system and our ability to love and respect each other.” Such questions have taken centre stage over the past weekend after Donald Trump argued that football players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired. “Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag – we MUST honor and respect it!” he tweeted, conflating the stars and stripes with the military. But just as “USA! USA! USA!” is sometimes chanted on the streets by both Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters at the same time, the flag and anthem are as contested as the debate over what it is to be American. After viewing the original flag, made in 1813 by Mary Pickersgill with the help of her daughter, two nieces and an African American indentured servant, museum patrons hear clips from different versions of The Star-Spangled Banner, ranging from traditional to Jimi Hendrix on a Fender Stratocaster at the Woodstock festival in 1969. His howling, feedback-heavy rendition was widely interpreted at the time as a political statement against the Vietnam war although, according to biographer Charles Cross, when Hendrix was asked to explain its meaning, he replied: “We’re all Americans... It was like ‘Go America!’... We play it the way the air is in America today.” Patrons are also shown a video loop of the US flag’s many manifestations: carried by women demanding suffrage, first world war recruits, the Ku Klux Klan marching in Washington, people celebrating victory in the second world war, civil rights marchers in Selma, protesters against the Vietnam war, a prisoner of war returning from Vietnam and participants at a disability rights rally, immigrant rights rally and gay pride march; worn by a freed slave at the end of the civil war; flying in a playground on Ellis Island, New York; hoisted by soldiers in Iwo Jima and firefighters in the ruins of the World Trade Center; hanging at Robert F Kennedy’s funeral train and an Olympic stadium; planted by the first men on the moon. The flag is also frequently seen flying outside suburban homes – far more so than in other western countries such as the UK. Its appeal is never more evident than at naturalisation ceremonies for new citizens, who often clutch miniature stars and stripes with pride. The anthem started in an act of military defiance by a young nation seeking to assert its identity. In 1812, the US declared war on Britain, smarting over what it saw as British interference in trade. But it suffered numerous setbacks, including being helpless in August 1814 to prevent British troops marching on Washington and setting the White House ablaze. A month later, the British spent 24 hours bombarding Fort McHenry, which protected Baltimore. By the “dawn’s early light” on 14 September, the lawyer Francis Scott Key, who was aboard a ship several miles away, could just make out the American flag flying above Fort McHenry. He realised that British ships were pulling out of Baltimore and the US had survived. He began to compose a poem on the back of a letter under the title The Defence of Fort McHenry. Copies were given to every man at the fort and around Baltimore. The published work included instructions that it be sung to the 18th-century British melody To Anacreon in Heaven. The first documented public performance of the words and music together took place in Baltimore on 19 October 1814. A music shop published the words and music under the title The Star-Spangled Banner. Heather Cox Richardson, a history professor at Boston College, said: “For Francis Scott Key, it was: ‘Is this republic going to be here tomorrow – a republic entrenched in the Enlightenment idea of democracy – or is America going to be annexed by the British again to become part of an oligarchy?’ “That’s the story of America. It’s a nation built on an ideal, built on ideology, but the ideology is built out of individualism, which is paradoxical.” It gained special significance during the civil war and, by the 1890s, had been adopted by the military for ceremonial purposes. After a campaign lasting decades, it finally became the official national anthem in 1931. But in the 1960s, as the Vietnam war raged amid social upheaval, some burned the flag and others rallied in its defence. Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s epic PBS documentary The Vietnam War explores how the war raised questions of different types of patriotism: among those who fought the war and those who demonstrated against it. In 1968, Congress passed the Federal Flag Desecration Law, making it a federal crime to “knowingly cast contempt upon any flag of the United States by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning, or trampling upon it”. Richardson said: “The whole identification of the flag with the right wing really takes off with Richard Nixon. George W Bush takes this to new heights after 9/11. Donald Trump is a loose cannon.” Marliss Bates, a 73-year-old African American teacher from Louisiana, was so engrossed in the information panels on Monday that she walked past the giant flag without noticing. Before heading back for a second look, she said: “It’s freedom, liberty. That’s what it’s supposed to mean. Francis Scott Key could see the flag waving so that meant we were still free people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-heresy-is-the-pope-catholic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:48:19Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on heresy: is the pope Catholic? | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-heresy-is-the-pope-catholic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-heresy-is-the-pope-catholic","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on heresy: is the pope Catholic?","bodyText":"A group of conservative clerics has accused Pope Francis of heresy for his attempts to liberalise the church’s treatment of divorced people. This raises an interesting question: how long must a pope be dead before his opinions can safely be ignored? For many people the answer is “no time at all”: it is not just humanists, Muslims and Protestants, but the vast majority of the world’s Catholics who take little notice of Catholic doctrine when they disagree with it. The Catholic right ignores more than a hundred years of consistent papal teaching against the excesses of capitalism, along with more recent denunciations of the death penalty, of wars of aggression and of environmental destruction. The Catholic left ignores the pope’s teachings on sexuality – and everyone ignores the ban on contraception. Popes themselves, however, are meant to take their predecessors very seriously even though neither party is writing infallibly. Papal encyclicals read like legal documents, buttressed with footnotes to prove that doctrine has not changed, and that they are just repeating what their predecessors meant, even when they contradict what was plainly said. Those magnificent robes conceal some very fancy footwork at times. It is an article of faith – literally – that doctrine can never change, only develop, and the eye of faith can clearly see the subtle differences between change, development and decay. So the 19th-century denunciations of democracy and freedom of thought and conscience are now ignored, but pope John Paul II’s refusal to admit women priests looks certain to stand for another couple of centuries at least. What, though, of Pope John Paul II’s equally clear denunciation of divorced and remarried couples taking communion, restated forcefully only 14 years ago? “Those who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin”, as he referred to remarried divorcees, are to be banned from participation in the central rite of the church. Even at the time, this was widely ignored – his letter is one of those laws from which historians can conclude that the conduct banned was commonplace. There can be very few Catholic congregations in the west without divorced and remarried communicants and everyone knows this. To turn them away at the altar rails would cause a public scandal, and that is also banned. So it’s unlikely that the letter had any effect on the facts on the ground. But the efforts of the present pope, Francis, to reverse his predecessors’ policy have provoked a vigorous backlash. Whether he is changing doctrine, as his opponents charge, or merely the interpretation of doctrine, as his supporters claim, there is no doubt that he wants the church to encourage some of the people who are in breach of its regulations on sexuality to take communion. The issue is simply no longer controversial in any other church, despite Jesus’s clear statement of principled opposition to divorce. Only the Catholic church has the combination of bureaucracy and authoritarianism that makes it so difficult for the clergy to learn from the experience of their flocks. The very idea that the church should learn from the world and not teach it outrages some Catholics. The most recent development is the publication of a long letter accusing the pope of heresy for his beliefs about remarriage, signed by 62 conservative clergy, who appear keen on refighting the Reformation 500 years on: they also accuse Francis of various Lutheran heresies incomprehensible to the untrained mind. Francis sees the church as a hospital; his enemies see it (as Luther did) as a kind of fortress against error and infidels. The important thing, though, is that Francis after years of debate is winning the argument. There are 4,000 bishops in the worldwide church; only one, who is 94, has signed it. Plenty of Catholics may disagree with Francis. But no one in the hierarchy dares publicly ignore him, at least while he’s alive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-plans-pricey","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:49:25Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Labour’s economic plans: pricey | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-plans-pricey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-plans-pricey","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Labour’s economic plans: pricey","bodyText":"In a conference speech stuffed with more crowd-titillating plums than the proverbial pudding, John McDonnell betrayed a confidence in the Labour party’s prospects of power that he may come to regret. But however much Conservatives make hay with the cost implications of what even his friends would regard as a wildly ambitious economic agenda, the shadow chancellor put one new and important policy on the table: the huge and continuing cost of private finance initiatives (PFIs). For more than 20 years, successive administrations have depended on what are essentially hire purchase deals to buy new schools, hospitals and prisons. In 2006, the peak year, contracts were signed for more than 70 projects worth more than £7bn. The deals allowed long-overdue renewal of the public infrastructure, but at a cost that is now eating into the sustainability of the services they were built to provide. Mr McDonnell was – it soon emerged – exaggerating when he told an ecstatic conference that Labour would take them all back in house (a project with an incalculable price tag), but the party is right to pledge to try to find ways of cutting the cost. PFIs, where government departments or local authorities sign a contract with an independent operator to build and maintain an asset and then pay an annual charge for the service over the contract lifetime (sometimes as much as 40 years), have always had their detractors; but the renewal of the fabric of public services seemed a powerful rebuttal. Now, if the bailiffs are not quite at the door, research from the Centre for Health and the Public Interest based on Treasury data, has set out the eye-watering cost: in the NHS alone, by 2022, nearly £1bn will go – merely on interest payments – to the handful of companies that own the hospitals. That’s a fifth of the extra cash announced for the NHS in 2015 – and it goes in the main to offshore companies that do not pay UK tax. The National Audit Office warned in 2009 that many of these deals were risky and sometimes unjustifiable. The Commons public accounts committee long since called them unsustainable. So it has proved. In the past six years, these asset-holding companies have taken from public service budgets profits of more than £800m, half of which has been paid out in dividends to shareholders. Recent Treasury figures put the capital investment value of current private finance deals at £58bn; yet there are outstanding cash commitments of £232bn – nearly four times their original value. The MP Stella Creasy is right when she calls the companies behind them “legal loan sharks”: this is low-risk borrowing backed with government guarantees. Yet – until now – the allure of off-balance-sheet spending in an age of spending restraint has remained hard to resist. Labour is right to call a halt. But unpicking existing deals won’t be easy. One or two smaller projects have been successfully taken back into the public sector. But there are more than 700 separate contracts, each to be dealt with separately. Labour’s plans for individual examination of each against a set of criteria, and potential nationalisation with compensation set by parliament, have to be set against the continuing need to persuade the markets to lend the government money. Labour’s success in persuading voters that there is an alternative has been a vital part of its appeal. The broad vision of a redistributive economy that treats workers fairly, rebuilds infrastructure and rebalances finance towards greater productivity underlies the sense of possibility that permeates the buoyant Brighton mood. The party is slowly gaining ground in public esteem as an alternative government. Monday’s Guardian-ICM poll shows Jeremy Corbyn overhauling Theresa May on a growing number of voters’ concerns. But on the economy, Brexit, immigration and security the Tories remain comfortably ahead. Mr McDonnell relishes challenging economic orthodoxy. But as it stands his policy seems unlikely to survive an election campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/25/liverpool-manchester-united-fans-warned-behave-or-face-long-stay-in-russia-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T17:17:02Z","webTitle":"Liverpool and Manchester United fans warned to behave or face ‘long stay in Russia’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/25/liverpool-manchester-united-fans-warned-behave-or-face-long-stay-in-russia-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/25/liverpool-manchester-united-fans-warned-behave-or-face-long-stay-in-russia-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool and Manchester United fans warned to behave or face ‘long stay in Russia’","bodyText":"Liverpool and Manchester United supporters have been warned they face “a long stay in Russia” should trouble occur at their Champions League fixtures in Moscow this week. The north-west rivals are both in action in the Russian capital, with Jürgen Klopp’s team facing Spartak Moscow on Tuesday and José Mourinho’s side playing CSKA on Wednesday. Security teams from Liverpool and United have been working with their Russian counterparts in an attempt to avoid problems for the estimated 2,000 away fans expected in Moscow. However, the head of the Russian Football Union’s security committee, Vladimir Markin, has warned there will be severe penalties for anyone found guilty of hooliganism. Markin told the Tass state news agency: “I don’t want to scare anyone but I warn those who plan to come here not to support their side and see the country but to commit hooliganism: the law is the same for all, not just for Russians. Those who break it will face a suitable punishment, possibly in the form of a long stay in Russia, in conditions our guests won’t like.” Spartak and CSKA have had problems with the behaviour of their own supporters recently. Liverpool’s opponents were last week fined €60,000 by Uefa and their fans banned from Spartak’s next Champions League away fixture in Sevilla after a flare was fired towards the referee during their 1-1 draw with Maribor in Slovenia. The Russian authorities are under scrutiny to deal with hooliganism in the country before next summer’s World Cup but, as Markin has made clear, their focus is not only internal. Liverpool and United have advised their fans not to wear club colours or travel alone in Moscow and there will be a heavy security presence at both Champions League fixtures this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/25/britain-elite-white-men-colour-of-power-national-self-interest","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T18:20:24Z","webTitle":"Britain’s elite is bright white – but doesn’t brilliance come in all colours? | Simon Woolley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/britain-elite-white-men-colour-of-power-national-self-interest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/25/britain-elite-white-men-colour-of-power-national-self-interest","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s elite is bright white – but doesn’t brilliance come in all colours?","bodyText":"An uncomfortable truth can, in time, become a great potential asset. But first we have to be brave enough to acknowledge it, and then bold enough to deal with it. That’s been the hope throughout, as Operation Black Vote, the Guardian and Green Park recruitment have worked on the groundbreaking research project, The Colour of Power. We expected, on looking at who has the most powerful jobs, to find a worrying picture. Even then, what emerges is shocking. We looked at more than a thousand top jobs. Black and ethnic minorities held just 3% of them. Scan wider and you find the figures aren’t great for women either. Their representation in our snapshot came in at a paltry 23%. Given that BME population is close to 14%, and women are around 50%, the data tells us at the top level the white male stranglehold is vice-like. Top jobs such as high court judges and senior police officers, and in the top consultancy, accountancy and advertising agencies, are held as if by right by this perennially dominant group. Perhaps the issue is class not race, you say. But it’s not. Look at other professions that should be more accessible, trade union leaders and Premier League football managers: the disparity, the scale of the problem is much the same. Does this matter? Very much so, and for a number of reasons. It is morally unarguable that pathways to the top jobs in our country should be open to anyone. Some will fight against what they deride as “identity politics”. What they fail to understand is that these disparities are themselves the result of identity politics, protecting the advantages of an already favoured group. But surely, beyond the moral imperative, perhaps the biggest driver for change should be self-interest. Britain hasn’t known such deep-rooted economic uncertainty since the 1970s. Already we’ve seen 10,000 finance-sector jobs disappear, their multimillion-pound earnings vanishing with them. The NHS is at crisis point. In the years to come we will need the best talent in the jobs that matter. But right now, the path to power for minorities is strewn with rocks and hurdles. A BBC study last year – accompanying David Harewood’s documentary Will There Ever Be a Black Prime Minister? – highlighted the fact that in 2011-12 three prestigious private schools and two elite colleges produced as many entrants to Oxford and Cambridge as 1800 state schools and colleges. Earlier in the crucial process that is education, we see minority children held back at school, victims of low expectation by too many teachers. Tests show that when minority children have their work marked blind – with no name or identifying material attached – lo and behold, their marks dramatically increase. Colour-blind marking – and, indeed, colour-blind recruitment – have their place, but only to a point. At some point people have to reveal themselves in a classroom or interview for who they really are. Then what? We need to change practices, but we also need to reassess the mindset that determines how we pre-judge people and assess their potential, particularly women and BME individuals. But there is another piece to this jigsaw and that lies within minority communities ourselves. We must confront our lack of self-worth. Like too many women, BME individuals are simply not applying for top roles in sufficient numbers to force the issue on to the agenda. Applying for the chief executive post seems a mountain too high to climb. We need to reset our goals to include the highest echelons of sport and business and the judiciary and government. Daunting as it may seem, we need to take that leap of faith. Ultimately, the goal of The Colour of Power is not to knock brilliant white men, but to say the talent pool and therefore our communal success could be so much bigger if we seriously open up opportunities to all who do, or could, exhibit brilliance. We have the evidence and a way ahead. Do we have the will? • Simon Woolley is the director of Operation Black Vote • This article was amended on 29 September 2017. An earlier version said that 50% of the 2014 intake for Oxford and Cambridge University was taken from five private schools.
