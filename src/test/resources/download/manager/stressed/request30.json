Proper mayo, gently wobbly and yolk-yellow, is a quite different beast: too good to hide away in a sandwich, it deserves to be the star of the show, served with crunchy baby veg, fresh seafood or just a big pile of hot, salty chips. Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Makes 300ml 1 egg yolk 1 big pinch salt 1 tbsp dijon mustard 1 tbsp white-wine or cider vinegar, or lemon juice 250ml light olive, grape seed, sunflower or other neutral oil 25ml extra-virgin olive, walnut or rapeseed oil 1 Prepare the ingredients Ensure everything is at room temperature before you get going. This makes the finished product much less likely to split. So, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, take them out at least 30 minutes before you start work. 2 Choose your tools This small amount of mayonnaise is hard to make in most food mixers, but electric beaters will do the trick, as will a whisk and a bit of elbow grease. You will also need a large, sturdy bowl. If you happen to have a stick blender and a tall jug in which it fits snugly, go to step 7. 3 Start whisking Put a damp cloth under the bowl to anchor it, then put the egg yolk and salt in the bowl. Whisk for about 20 seconds, until slightly thickened, then add the mustard and acid (and a teaspoon of cold water if you’re nervous, though it’s not strictly necessary). Whisk for another 30 seconds. Familiarise yourself with step 6 before going any further. 4 Start to incorporate the oil Begin to add the oil into the bowl, drop by painstaking drop, whisking all the time. Don’t be tempted to use extra-virgin olive oil, because this will make a heavy, often bitter mayonnaise, especially if you’re using electric beaters. It’s far better, and cheaper, to start with a neutral oil and add some extra-virgin at the end. 5 Finish adding the oil Keep whisking and pouring until the mayonnaise begins to thicken, at which point you can begin to add the oil more quickly, followed by a second, more flavourful oil, if you like. Once all 275ml of the oil has been incorporated and you have a thick, glossy mixture, season to taste. If you’d prefer a thinner consistency, beat in a little water, lemon juice or vinegar. 6 Don’t panic if the mayo splits If your mayonnaise splits, it’s easily rescued, as long as you have another egg yolk. Crack this into a fresh bowl, whisk for a minute until thick and sticky, then gradually beat in the split mayonnaise a little at a time, followed by any remaining oil. 7 Alternatively, use a stick blender If you have a stick blender, put all the ingredients except the extra-virgin olive oil into a jug just slightly wider than the blender head. Plunge the blender down to the base of the jug, then turn on and, keeping the blender still, blend on high power for 10 seconds, until you can see the mixture start to emulsify. 8 Finish by hand Once the mayonnaise begins to billow out from the sides of the blender, very slowly move the head upwards through the oil until you have a creamy mayonnaise (repeat this process, if necessary). Beat in the extra-virgin olive oil by hand, then season to taste. 9 Customise to taste Mayonnaise is easy to tailor to need or occasion: fold in a clove of crushed garlic, or a handful of chopped herbs, the zest of an unwaxed lemon, black pepper, chilli sauce, horseradish or wasabi, smoked paprika and lime juice, crumbled blue cheese and chives, curry powder, finely chopped capers anchovies or cornichons, wholegrain mustard – but preferably not all at once.

Wince through a punnet of slightly sour strawberries and pretend it’s a bright Wimbledon day. Perch next to the radiator with a Twister and bring the summer bank holiday to your living room. This cheesecake is an exercise in exactly that kind of wishful thinking: ricotta, apricot, orange blossom and amaretti will transport you to the bliss of a lazy, sun-drenched Italian holiday. Slap on a bit of suncream and have a row over the satnav, and the full immersive experience will be complete. Orange blossom ricotta cheesecake with amaretti base Prep 35 min Cook 1 hr Chill 2 hr Serves 8-10 75g unsalted butter 75g amaretti biscuits, finely ground 75g digestive biscuits, finely ground 150g dried apricots, roughly chopped Orange blossom water, to taste 125g caster sugar 3 tbsp cornflour 500g ricotta 2 large eggs, lightly whisked 150ml double cream Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Melt the butter over a low heat, then stir into the amaretti and digestive biscuit crumbs. Press the mixture firmly into the base of a 20cm round springform cake tin (I find it’s easiest to use the back of your knuckles/fingers). Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool. Meanwhile, prepare the fruit layer: put the apricots in a pan along with enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, until the apricot pieces are plump and tender. Drain thoroughly, then stir in a few drops of orange blossom water, to taste. Spread this over the biscuit base. In a large bowl, stir the caster sugar and cornflour together, then add the ricotta. Beat until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, double cream and one or two teaspoons orange blossom water, to taste. Pour this into the tin, over the amaretti base and the apricots, then bake for 50-60 minutes, or until barely set in the centre, and with just the slightest jelly wobble. As soon as it’s out of the oven, run a knife around the edge of the tin to loosen the sides and minimise the chance of the cheesecake cracking as it cools. Leave to cool completely before chilling for at least two hours. Serve with a few extra amaretti biscuits crumbled on top. Food styling: Emily Kydd.

Gold Coast is a city of 640,000 people that stretches 35 miles (57km) down Australia’s east coast, along golden sandy beaches populated mainly by surfers and holidaymakers. Like the rest of the country, the people here love sport in every shape and form but they have not yet reached feverish levels of excitement about an event increasingly fighting to prove its sporting and cultural relevance. By the same token, there is no obvious public resistance to staging the Games, no large-scale protests as there were before Australia last played host, in Melbourne in 2006. Inevitably once the live action – featuring more than 6,600 athletes and officials in 19 different sports – begins with the women’s triathlon on Thursday morning, a thirst for medals will take over. Particularly as the hometown athlete Ashleigh Gentle, the world number two in triathlon, could claim the first gold of the Games for the host nation. Temporary stages on the city’s promenades and beaches have been showcasing dancing and singing by young local performers throughout the day while volunteers decked in bright yellow and green shirts excitedly point visitors in the right direction. Local businesses are reaping the benefits of a projected influx of more than 600,000 people for the Games. Most of the bars are operating with extended opening hours for the next 12 days, while some hotels and Airbnb hosts have increased their nightly rates by 150%. Even car park owners have been taking their slice of the pie, with overnight rates increased by up to 400% at some locations. A few miles away from the main hub of the Games, the double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee was announced as the flag bearer for Team England. The triathlete, who competes against his brother Jonny, is one of the hot favourites for gold among home nation athletes. Alongside Max Whitlock, Adam Peaty, Dina Asher-Smith and Tom Daley, he is one of several established household names hoping to bring silverware back to Britain. Brownlee attended an unveiling ceremony at a high school on the Gold Coast on Tuesday, where he appeared alongside Mr Larry, teacher of the school’s indigenous art programme. He is the designer of the pattern on England’s opening ceremony outfit. Larry’s involvement in the Games is part of a commitment to acknowledge the contribution played by the Indigenous population and the discrimination they face. Large protests marred the Melbourne Games in 2006 which, wrote Andy Fuller, a fellow at Melbourne University’s Asia Institute, “showed that the city prioritised its branding and image as a sports city rather than a city that had come to terms with its Indigenous history and that was inclusive of a range of dissenting voices”. The approach to the Glasgow Commonwealth Games four years ago was dominated by Usain Bolt making apparently disparaging comments about rainy grey skies, viewed by many as an affront to the hosts. There can be few complaints about the weather here, even if the 27C sunshine is occasionally interrupted by short, sharp downpours. But the buildup has not been controversy-free. The front page of the Courier Mail, the local newspaper for Brisbane, the largest city in Queensland, screamed “Sins and Needles” in reference to syringes found in the athletes’ village close to where the Indian team are staying. The Indian boxing team’s doctor was later “strongly reprimanded” by the Commonwealth Games Federation court for breaching the no-needle policy and injecting an unnamed Indian team boxer with vitamins in the athletes’ village. He had left needles in the room while he went to obtain bins for the disposal of the needles, he says. Confusion surrounded reports in the Mauritius media detailing claims that an athlete from the country had been subjected to “indecent acts” by the chef de mission, Kaysee Teeroovengadum, since arriving in Australia. The report alleged she had been encouraged not to make an official complaint until after the Games. Queensland police promised to investigate. A spokesman for the Commonwealth Games Federation said: “The chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Games Federation has been made aware through media representatives of purported allegations [of an indecent assault involving a Commonwealth Games delegate]; however, there has been no reporting through the established village processes.” The Games will next travel to Birmingham in 2022, where reaction to winning the bid has been mixed. Some local people have suggested it is a vanity project and that it is irresponsible to spend more than £700,000 of public money on a sporting event when the cash-strapped council cannot, for instance, organise regular and reliable bin collections. Others suggest the Commonwealth is an outdated symbol of British imperialism that is no longer taken seriously by individual athletes. David Grevemberg, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, disagrees. “I think people still care about the Commonwealth,” he said. “They have a real admiration for leaders of the Commonwealth, Her Majesty, Mahatma Gandhi, Bob Marley and the common principles of duty, service and sacrifice. They admire and acknowledge the history, heritage and tradition, the good, the bad and the ugly.” After 12 days that have focused minds firmly on the bad and ugly side of Australian sport as a result of the antics of the country’s cricket team, it is to be hoped that the Commonwealth Games can put the emphasis back on the good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/03/delving-deeper-into-the-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T17:25:07Z","webTitle":"Delving deeper into the gender pay gap | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/03/delving-deeper-into-the-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/03/delving-deeper-into-the-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"Delving deeper into the gender pay gap","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Working in the education department of an Irish trade union over 40 years ago, I had no difficulty enabling the (mostly) male shop steward students to get to grips with the idea of men and women doing vastly different jobs being entitled to the same pay (Angry about the pay gap? Here’s what to do, 3 April). I would simply ask: If this “female” job were done by men instead, how much would they be paid? It never failed. Shop stewards would howl with laughter at the idea of paying men so badly. Arguments that work dominated by women was less physically demanding, or less “skilled”, and so justified lower pay, would dissolve, as fine motor skills or adeptness in human relations were suddenly found worthy of the “male” rate. Today the jobs and industries may have changed, but the ideas we need to challenge gender discrimination at work haven’t. Why are women still concentrated in the lower-paid jobs? Clearly women should have equal access to all current areas of higher-paid work. But if men dominated the care industries, or the BBC’s China correspondent had been a man, would employers still be taking it for granted that such “male” work was worth so little? Naomi Wayne London • Your article (Revealed: scale of public sector pay gap, 31 March) gives a misleading impression of pay for NHS consultants, implying that there is an implicit gender gap. For the record, all NHS consultants, whether male or female, are paid on exactly the same salary scale, which is agreed and implemented nationally. Differences in salaries are explained by multiple factors including the amount of additional work a consultant agrees to do for the NHS over and above their basic contract and additional awards for clinical excellence. While it may potentially be the case that a male consultant is more likely to obtain the latter awards than his female colleague, the data needs to be analysed and presented in its entirety before making the simplistic assumption that salary differences are the result of gender bias. Dr Stephen Vallely Consultant radiologist, Belfast • Anne Davey and Kathy Winrow of the Oxford Diocesan School Trust (ODST) claim that their trusts “have a gender pay gap because we offer employment that is part-time and term-time only” (Letters, 29 March). But gender pay gaps are calculated according to hourly rates, not annual pay. So is the ODST paying a lower hourly rate to people who work part time as compared with full time and/or those who work term time only as opposed to all year round, but who otherwise do a very similar job? If that is not the reason for the ODST’s gender pay gap, what is? The results for thousand of schools and other employers are now available at gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk and vary dramatically from one another. Those with greater pay gaps should be asked to provide a convincing explanation. Danny Dorling Oxford • I was recently at the excellent Museum of London and was shocked to see a poster from 1913 with a picture of a female worker who looked desperate and forlorn with the slogan “Waiting for a Living Wage”. The work of ordinary working people and the contribution they make to the wealth of this country is still not properly recognised. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. What possible justification can there be for not paying a real living wage? Clearly there is money around because this government has given tax cuts to the wealthiest and reduced corporation tax. Meanwhile the rest of us are victims of a stealth tax because councils are being forced by this Tory government to raise council tax to meet legal and moral obligations. And the “just about managing” – as May likes to call them – are managing no longer, the increase in food bank use is soaring, and all attempts to provide “a fair deal for everyone” ring hollow. The suffragette slogan “Deeds not Words” rings a sad note. Deeds not words, Mrs May.

Once renowned for its tackiness, the “Goldie” has, ahead of the Commonwealth Games, attained a level of sophistication few expected of the city that birthed gold lamé bikini-clad Meter Maids. A raft of swanky new hotels, including The Darling, opened last month, the ongoing refurbishment of Hota, the city’s premier arts hub, and revamped dining and nightlife scenes are among the highlights of a multibillion-dollar facelift. Despite this flurry of development, the vibe remains relaxed. With few must-sees beyond its dazzling beaches, the Gold Coast is a city best explored through your taste buds – one seaside suburb at a time. Jellurgal Cultural Centre, Burleigh Heads Named after the Aboriginal word for the headland it sits on (also known as Burleigh Hill), Jellurgal offers the city’s most interesting – yet probably least-known – cultural experience. The centre, free to enter, gives an insight into the Gold Coast’s traditional owners, the Yugambeh people, and works by local artists are for sale. It’s well worth booking the Walkabout Tour (A$20, around £11), a 90-minute amble around the headland led by a Yugambeh guide, who will point out traditional sites and share their stories. The Journey Tour, A$39, includes a performance by the Yugambeh Aboriginal Dancers, who will be perform in today’s opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. • Open Mon-Fri 8am-3pm, 1711 Gold Coast Highway, jellurgal.com.au Gold Coast Food and wine tour Until recently, eating out on the Gold Coast was far from a culinary adventure. But now there are so many great places to eat across the city – from high-end Japanese restaurants to Cuban food trucks – that even locals turn to Karen Inglis-Turner, owner of Gold Coast Food &amp; Wine Tours, to help navigate the rapidly evolving scene. Karen runs four-hour walking tours that include tastings at new and under-the-radar spots in Burleigh Heads (such as tucked-away cafe Be Somewhere, which you’d be lucky to find unless you were looking for it), Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise. They are great fun, with plenty of food and drinks included. Karen also offers a hop-on, hop-off food tour along the G:link, the city’s new light rail network. • From A$129pp, Fridays and Saturdays, goldcoastfoodandwinetours.com.au Tallebudgera Creek The Gold Coast has 57km of beaches, and this sparkling blue creek separating Burleigh Heads from Palm Beach is one of the city’s most scenic (and protected) spots for a dip – there’s generally more space on the southern bank. Surf seekers may be happier just around the headland at Burleigh Beach, popular for its point break, great views towards the Surfers Paradise skyline, and cafes, bars and restaurants just steps from the sand. These include two of the Gold Coast’s five Good Food Guide 2018 “hatted” restaurants – pan-Asian powerhouse Rick Shores and fine seafood restaurant the Fish House. Several surf schools (including the Cheyne Horan School of Surf) also operate here. Miami Marketta, Miami The balmy year-round climate lends itself to Asian night market-style dining, which is now embraced here in many forms. This warehouse conversion off the Gold Coast Highway opened as an arts venue in 2011, and has evolved into a thrice-weekly street food fiesta, with up to 30 international food vendors. Try a Japanese gyoza from Monkey Magic, followed by a giant lamington from Reid Street Kitchen (no relation to the writer). There are also several bars, a handful of design boutiques and great live music. Such is the increasing demand for performance spaces on the coast that Marketta’s owners are redeveloping the neighbouring property into a soundproof venue with capacity of 1,300. • Wed 5-9pm, Sat 5-11pm, Sun 4-1pm, 23 Hillcrest Parade, miamimarketta.com The Paddock Bakery, Miami No longer simply a place to pick up a meat pie and a loaf, the humble Australian bakery has gone haute in recent years. Few on the Gold Coast have nailed the trend quite like the Paddock Bakery, and while there are newer players in town now (including sister venue Bam Bam Bakehouse in Mermaid Beach), this bakery-cafe in a beautifully restored house remains a local favourite. Those in a hurry order a flat white and one of its famous croissants (which take three days to make) to go, but Paddock’s sit-down brunch menu and shady outdoor tables are very tempting. • Daily 6.30am-3pm, 20 Hibiscus Haven, Miami, paddockbakery.com Springbrook national park At weekends, many locals escape the city for the rainforests, waterfalls, wineries and lookout points of the hinterland. Part of the Unesco-listed Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, Springbrook national park is arguably its most beautiful corner. The Twin Falls Circuit (4km, allow two hours) is popular, or the after-dark Natural Bridge Circuit (1km, one hour) takes visitors to marvel at glowworms in a cave behind a stunning waterfall. The entrance to the park is about an hour’s drive south-west of Broadbeach. • Free, access currently via Pine Creek Road only, npsr.qld.gov.au Balter Brewing Company, Currumbin It’s co-owned by three-time world champion surfer (and Gold Coast local) Mick Fanning, but this two-year-old craft brewery has earned its own celebrity status. It debuted with a deliciously tropical XPA in 2016, and won awards including 10 prizes at the 2017 Australian International Beer Awards. Balter beers are now on tap all over the country, but there’s nothing like sampling a schooner (three-quarters of a pint, around A$7) at the source. Balter’s huge, exposed-brick HQ doubles as a brew bar at weekends, with live music, food trucks and a casual, family-friendly vibe compensating for its location a five-minute drive inland. • Brew bar Fri 3-9pm, Sat-Sun 1-8pm, 14 Traders Lane, balter.com.au Justin Lane, Burleigh Heads Blink and you’ll miss this lane off the Gold Coast Highway which shares its name with the dingy arcade-turned-hip-dining-complex that marks its entrance. With a pizzeria, pasta joint and rooftop bar, the Justin Lane Establishment is a destination in itself (there’s also a barber, a hair salon and a surf shop inside), but venture further down the alley and you’ll discover three bars: Iku, a stylish yakatori and whisky bar; Lockwood, a suave speakeasy; and grungy pocket bar Nightjar. On the main road, easier-to-find Jimmy Wah’s (named after the watering hole in Good Morning, Vietnam) looks flash, but its wonderfully light modern Vietnamese small plates are very well-priced. Make one of them the A$9 tempura soft shell crab banh mi (baguette). La Costa Motel, Bilinga Big hotels tend to dominate the Gold Coast’s accommodation scene, but an exception is this small, attractively renovated 1950s motel at the southern tip of the city near the New South Wales border. One block back from the sand and a five-minute drive from Cooloongatta’s famous Kirra Beach (be sure to book a meal at smart Kirra Point restaurant Baskk), La Costa is especially convenient for visitors flying in or out of Gold Coast airport, which is just across the highway. Free airport transfers, breakfast and bike rental make it a particularly attractive option. • Doubles from A$126 B&amp;B, 127 Golden Four Drive, lacostamotel.com.au The Island Gold Coast, Surfers Paradise Proving that even Surfers Paradise – perhaps best-known for booze-soaked school leaver parties – is capable of reinventing itself, the coral pink budget hotel formerly known as The Islander reopened last year to considerable fanfare following an extensive renovation. The Island’s 98 guest rooms fuse relaxed coastal living with a playful nod to the city’s 1960s heyday (custom-made retro-style furniture, candy-striped pool umbrellas).

Despite falling well short of the almost $3bn being called for by the meeting in Geneva, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, hailed the donor conference a “remarkable success”. The conference came just a day after an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition on the port city of Hodeidah killed a number of children, in what the UN children’s fund, Unicef, called “one of the deadliest attacks” on minors in the country for years. “The United Nations has verified the killing of several children in an attack … in the coastal city of Hodeidah in western Yemen,” Unicef said in a statement on 2 April. “Many children are reported missing as the injured and killed are still being pulled out from the rubble,” it added, amid reports that seven children had been killed. Guterres told reporters that in addition to the $2bn already committed, multiple countries had promised more donations in the coming months, leaving him “optimistic that we will be able to reach the level that corresponds to the needs”. Asked if he saw a contradiction in the Saudi stance towards Yemen, Guterres said a country’s humanitarian commitments and military actions should be kept separate. “We all know that there is a war. We all know who the parties [are] to the war but the two things need to be seen separately,” the UN chief told reporters. “Independent of the fact that there is a war, there are humanitarian obligations that are assumed by countries,” he said. “The countries that are also party to the conflict were party to these international efforts to support the people of Yemen.” Last year’s Yemen appeal for $2.5bn was 73% funded, but the needs have intensified in a country battered since 2015 by a Saudi-led military offensive aimed at repelling Iran-backed Houthi rebels who control the capital. The UN has said that three-quarters of Yemen’s population – about 22 million people – need some form of aid. Saudi Arabia and its allies have repeatedly been accused of hitting civilians targets, including hospitals and markets, in their three-year campaign against the Houthis. Guterres underscored that the only way to ensure that Yemen donor conferences do not continue year after year is for the sides to negotiate a peace deal. “There was never a humanitarian solution for any humanitarian crisis,” he said. “The solution has always been political.” The UN’s Yemen envoy, Martin Griffiths, has recently visited Riyadh and Sana’a in hopes of revitalising sputtering peace talks. “I believe there is an opportunity and that opportunity must be seized,” Guterres said, explaining that Griffiths was “encouraged” by his trip and sees a window for further talks. According to the UN, 8.4 million people are on the verge of famine in Yemen, where food imports are essential to sustain the population. The Saudi-led coalition shut down the country’s land, sea and air borders last year in response to a missile attack by the Houthis that was intercepted near Riyadh. While the coalition has eased the blockade, restrictions on deliveries persist. “Humanitarians must be able to reach the people who need help the most, without conditions,” Guterres said. “All ports must remain open to humanitarian and commercial cargo, the medicines, food and the fuel needed to deliver them,” he added, emphasising the need for unrestricted access to the country as well as within it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/06/we-know-we-may-be-killed-the-rangers-risking-their-lives-for-virungas-gorillas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T12:00:31Z","webTitle":"'We know we may be killed': the rangers risking their lives for Virunga's gorillas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/06/we-know-we-may-be-killed-the-rangers-risking-their-lives-for-virungas-gorillas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/06/we-know-we-may-be-killed-the-rangers-risking-their-lives-for-virungas-gorillas","fields":{"headline":"'We know we may be killed': the rangers risking their lives for Virunga's gorillas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is dawn on the shores of Lake Edward and the sun is rising over the volcanoes on the eastern skyline.

There are shouts, scattered shots, volleys from automatic weapons. Waves of attackers rush through the brush and trees. Some are close enough to hurl spears and fire arrows.

They take with them the bodies of three of their comrades. At least a dozen of their enemy lie on the ground. “This is not an easy profession. Losing your friends and colleagues is very painful. But we chose to do this, and we know the risks,” said Innocent Mburanumwe, the deputy director of Virunga national park, an enormous stretch of more than 5,000 square miles of woodland, savannah and mountains on the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The clash last August was the bloodiest in the park for many years. There was little elation when the post was retaken four hours after the rangers’ initial retreat. The steady attrition of what Mburanumwe calls “a low intensity war” in the Virunga has claimed the lives of more than 170 rangers over the last 20 years, a toll earning the park a reputation as one of the most dangerous conservation projects in the world. “Every day when the patrols set out, we know that they may come under fire. We know we may lose someone or we may be killed ourselves,” said Mburanumwe. The threats facing the Virunga, home to one of the world’s largest populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas as well as hundreds of other rare species, are multiple. There are armed rebel groups, hardened by years of combat against the Congolese government troops or those of neighbouring countries, local bandits and self-defence militia, and poachers out for ivory or bush meat. Then there is the hugely lucrative charcoal industry, for which the trees of the park are the principal raw material, and illegal fishing too. In recent months the DRC has veered close to a plunge back into the appalling violence of the 1997-2003 civil war, which led to the deaths of 5 million and saw the wildlife in the park, Africa’s oldest, decimated. Observers hope catastrophe will be avoided but aid agencies describe the vast central African country as “on a cliff edge”. Growing violence has displaced more than 4.5 million people, rebellions have claimed thousands of lives, and 2 million children are threatened with starvation. The prospect of elections at the end of the year has intensified fighting over land and resources, such as mines. The new instability threatens the Virunga. Since January, the park has seen clashes between Congolese forces and neighbouring Rwanda’s soldiers and, in its northern parts, an offensive by a brutal Islamist militia responsible for killing 14 UN peacekeepers last year. The rangers are recruited from villages surrounding the park. Most are married with many children. Those in the frontline are often young. David Nezehose, 29, leads the rangers’ dog team. “I grew up and live next door to the park so I know its importance. My grandfather was a guide in the park 40 years ago. I wanted to protect the gorillas who are our neighbours,”he said. There is a small but growing contingent of women among the 700 rangers who currently defend the park. Angèle Kavira Nzalamingi, 25, trains new recruits. She hopes to join the rangers’ elite rapid reaction force – after running the London marathon this month. In the conservative rural communities from which many of the rangers come, Nzalamingi’s career choice was controversial. “My family are proud of me … but there were lots of people in my village who said this was not work for a woman. I wanted to show that we can do anything the men can do,” Nzalamingi said. The Virunga’s fortunes have fluctuated with those of the DRC. Founded in 1925 by Belgian colonial authorities, the park struggled in the immediate aftermath of the country’s independence in 1960 but flourished under President Mobutu Sese Seko, the flamboyant, wasteful and authoritarian ruler who took power in 1965. Augustin Kambale, a senior ranger, remembers thousands of tourists visiting in the 1980s and early 1990s. “It all went wrong in 1994 with the genocide in Rwanda. A million refugees crossed the border and set up camps here. They had weapons with them and soon these spread among the local population. It was really bad,” Kambale, 57, said. By the time relative peace was restored long after Mobutu’s chaotic fall in 1997, the mountain gorilla population had sunk to 300. In 2007 came what Kambale called “a great change”. A partnership was established between a charity funded by private donors, the European Union, the Howard G Buffett foundation, and the Congolese wildlife service. Emmanuel de Merode, a Belgian aristocrat, was appointed director and implemented wide-ranging reforms. The rangers got better equipment and training, and are now paid a monthly salary of $250, a sizeable sum locally. Others initiatives have focused on local communities, with micro loans and hydroelectric power projects to boost the local economy and, it is hoped, thus reduce recruitment to the rebel groups or criminal gangs among the 6 million living within a day’s walk of the park’s borders. The mountain gorilla population now stands at more than 1,000, while the numbers of other animals, such as forest elephants, is also rising, and tourists are returning in significant numbers. Local administrators say the park offers hope to the whole region, one of the poorest in Africa. “Imagine what would happen here if we had 10,000 tourists coming every year,” said Julien Paluku, the governor of North Kivu province. But the local economy is dependent on the security situation. When a rebel group swept into Goma, the provincial capital, in 2012, the park shut down. On the rutted road to the Virunga are military checkpoints. Rusty AK47s over a shoulder, eyes hidden by dark shades, troops from the DRC’s demoralised and poorly equipped army make desultory checks for illicit charcoal or bushmeat. In a detention block at the park headquarters, smugglers and poachers are held pending transfer to local authorities. Outside stood a seized truck loaded with charcoal worth about $7,000, made in the park from felled trees. Its load will be distributed to hospitals. In a cell lay 24-year-old Jean-Paul Gambale, the driver. “I know it’s not a good thing to do but I have four children. They don’t have any dinner at night. I was promised $15 by my boss to drive the truck,” he said. Rangers admit that those running the charcoal networks are rarely caught. On a wall outside the detention block is a poster of a notorious wanted criminal described as a “major bandit and national parliamentary candidate”. Such problems will eventually be overcome, says Kambale, the veteran ranger. “I know the Virunga will go on getting better. One day the armed groups and the bandits and the poachers will all be gone from the park, and the tourists will go everywhere and the animals will live in safety. I know it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/04/killed-in-2018-londons-victims-of-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Killed in 2018: London's victims of violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/killed-in-2018-londons-victims-of-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/killed-in-2018-londons-victims-of-violence","fields":{"headline":"Killed in 2018: London's victims of violence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Steve Frank Narvaez-Jara, 20 He was studying physics and aerospace at the University of Hertfordshire, hoping to become a pilot.

That society was apartheid-era South Africa, which he chronicled with meticulous patience and a certain formal detachment, his acutely observational gaze illuminating the lives of ordinary people living under a system that separated and controlled them according to skin colour. From the early 1960s, when he began photographing the landscape and people of South Africa, Goldblatt shot in black and white, later saying: “During those years, colour seemed too sweet a medium to express the anger, disgust and fear that apartheid inspired.” His detached approach reflected his own sense of being an outsider – his Lithuanian Jewish family had originally settled in South Africa to escape religious persecution – but it also allowed him to present the complexities of life under apartheid in a way that contrasted with the often dramatic images made by visiting photojournalists. This photograph, titled Shop assistant, Orlando West, Soweto, 1972, is a case in point. The young girl is poised, stylish, even languorous, yet with a suggestion of defiance in her straight-to-camera gaze. Around her, the rows of canned goods suggest a society marooned in a postwar era. She is a child of the townships, of oppression, uprisings and struggle. And yet, the image insists, she is also an ordinary young woman whose life is not entirely defined by the system that exerts control over so much of her life – where she lives, works and travels, who she befriends, socialises with and marries. Goldblatt once said: “I would look at Edward Weston’s work and envy the freedom to be lyrical... to photograph a landscape apparently without concern for the implications of its possession.” His work, though, has its own moments of beauty and they are made all the more striking by the context out of which they emerged.

It’s the first apartment I’ve owned – I was tired of living in white boxes.” All the internal walls were knocked down; the kitchen now forms part of an open-plan living space. “I wanted to make the kitchen pretty enough to be part of the living room,” says Hyland, 36. She found an orange cooker, from Rangemaster, to match the cabinets, and offset it all with bright teal-blue walls and black walnut counters. “I looked at a lot of mid-century kitchens online for inspiration,” she says. “Formica is brilliant: it’s hard-wearing, wipeable and comes in a million colours.” All the appliances are hidden away in the kitchen island. The teal walls carry through into the open-plan living area. Fishscale-patterned floor tiles in blue and white (Fired Earth’s Cabaret tiles) sweep from the kitchen into the hallway and the bathroom beyond. “I miscalculated the amount I’d need to cover three rooms, so they ended up costing me more than I’d like to recall, but they’re worth it,” says Hyland. Wood panelling, painted blue, makes the dining area feel more characterful. A concealed door hides a utility area: “I’ve always loved secret doors and did research on Pinterest to get it right.” In the living area, vintage mid-century furniture sits alongside kitsch finds and contemporary lighting, including brass and opaline glass fittings by Michael Anastassiades. “A lot of high-street stuff has a characterful, vintage edge. My furniture needs to have soul.” Having worked in magazines and TV as a stylist and set designer in her native Ireland before moving to London 11 years ago, Hyland is well practised in the art of conjuring dramatic sets. Her home is filled with her own artworks – large-scale, Hopper-esque photographs that have the air of classic film stills. “They are big shoots: I’ll plan them, find the locations, source the props and wardrobe, do the casting and take the pictures.” She took the same approach to revamping the flat, designing the new layout and project-managing the six-month build herself. The result feels rather out of time, like one of Hyland’s photographs. “It’s such a personal project – giving someone else control just didn’t feel right.” The New Creative Home, by Talib Choudhry, with photographs by Ingrid Rasmussen, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, £19.95.

The market leader by a country mile, with more than double the number of subscribers of its nearest rival. The primary reason the recording industry is, after 14 painful years, slowly rolling into the recovery position. A miracle worker. The frothing coverage of Spotify’s direct listing on Tuesday has been almost exclusively about what it means for Spotify, its employees and the assorted investors who have held their nerve despite the company racking up losses that run into the billions. But there was little talk of what it means for the musicians and songwriters increasingly reliant on the service for their income. In short, unless they were prescient enough to invest or get shares several years ago, it will mean nothing, yet. Artists will not be paid any more than they already are, and users will continue to pay what they always paid to subscribe, or be forced to keep navigating the various listening restrictions on the free tier. Yet within this “business as usual – but even more so” storyline is where the problems lie. There are a great many things that Spotify needs to change, row back on or recalibrate – but this direct listing is not about that. So they will not be addressed until they have to be. As it stands, the direct listing will allow those holding shares in Spotify to sell them if they want to. These are primarily employees and investors. Unlike in an initial public offering (IPO), no new shares will be issued and so Spotify will not, for now, find itself drowning in fresh capital that it could share out among labels, publishers and artists. If Spotify does go for a full IPO, there could be a windfall for all three major labels and the independents, via rights body Merlin, who have an equity stake in the company. They have all promised that the artists will share in the upside when the IPO happens. Back in May 2016, for example, Sony Music – in a convoluted piece of legalese – said that “net proceeds realised by Sony Music from the monetisation of equity interests ... will be shared with our artists on a basis consistent with our breakage policy”. What this means is that, yes, artists will get a cut of whatever it makes – but the label stopped short of saying exactly how much. The other majors have made similarly vague promises. But because the immediate focus is on a direct listing, this is all academic anyway. Spotify is instead looking at its growth projections. Presentation documents ahead of this listing stated that it could be closing in on 100m paying subscribers by the end of the year. The direct listing is simply another springboard to get it there, keeping Spotify as the most visible of all the streaming services, and the default name that financial analysts and the media reach for. Like the Amazon model, the focus at Spotify appears to be on accelerating growth at all costs, and worrying about profitability further down the line. The Amazon model was about creating a monopoly in all but name, by becoming so important for producers of everything from books to dental floss that they would have to accept the retailer’s terms and conditions. And the more powerful Amazon becomes, the more power its suppliers cede in setting dealer prices. As it stands, Spotify pays around 70% of its revenues to rights owners – an estimated 55-60% to record labels and the remaining 10-15% to music publishers. It is unlikely to willingly increase what it pays out, so artists are not going to be paid more. If anything, given its moves in the US with regard to the $1.6bn lawsuit it is currently facing from Wixen Music over allegations of unpaid mechanical royalties, it is arguably trying to assert the case that it should be paying out less. The more the music industry centre of gravity is jolted towards Spotify, the more powerful the streaming site becomes in dictating its terms back to the music business and artists. The only way it can theoretically pay more to labels and publishers – who then pay it to creators – is by upping the ad rates on its free tier and increasing the cost of a monthly subscription. The former risks spooking the advertisers that Spotify has always found an uphill struggle to attract, while the latter risks slowing its growth curve – one of the key metrics in determining its market valuation. The moment that growth starts to stall or plateau is the moment Spotify fears the most, so it has to prolong the upward trajectory for as long as it can. In a letter included in the filing ahead of the direct listing, co-founder Daniel Ek said that “the old model favoured certain gatekeepers”, but this was coming to an end in a large part because of Spotify. He elaborated by saying that the way it used to work was that acts had to be signed by a label, get access to a proper studio and be lucky enough to be played on radio to break through; but now “Spotify empowers them to break through”. The reality, though, is not quite as egalitarian as he would have us believe. Spotify is little more than an intricate and interconnected series of gates – those gates being playlists. And the biggest playlists on Spotify are, unsurprisingly, all the ones it owns and controls, pushing own-branded creations such as Who We Be, RapCaviar and Peaceful Piano while being less effusive about the many third-party playlists left to splash around in the shallow end, including those run by major labels like Universal (Digster), Warner (Topsify) and Sony (Filtr). Record labels will talk about how fantastic and supportive Spotify is – but off the record they will bellyache about how it all threatens to become a dictatorship by stealth. If Spotify does not include your music on its own-brand curated playlists, as far as having hits is concerned, you might as well not exist. Playlists are Spotify’s world – the rest of the music industry just lives and dies by them. In his letter to investors, Ek explained that Spotify’s mission was to give “a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art” as well as “billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it”. Noble intentions, no doubt, but the Spotify model is one where the biggest hits and the biggest acts take the biggest share of the pot. The top 1% enjoy the most spoils, the stretched middle can just about keep above water and the great masses at the bottom – those millions of small and niche acts – are left crossing their fingers that they will be anointed by the playlist gods. The odds of this happening are slim, and the more music Spotify adds each week to its sprawling catalogue, the slimmer they will become.

Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), said the poison had been identified as a military-grade novichok nerve agent, which could probably be deployed only by a nation state. Aitkenhead said the government had reached its conclusion that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack by combining the laboratory’s scientific findings with information from other sources. The UK government moved quickly to make it clear that the prime minister, Theresa May, had always been clear the assessment from Porton Down was “only one part of the intelligence picture”. The comments came hours before an extraordinary meeting in The Hague of the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), called by Russia. Speaking to Sky News, Aitkenhead said it was not possible for scientists alone to say precisely where the novichok had been created. He said: “It’s a military-grade nerve agent, which requires extremely sophisticated methods in order to create – something that’s probably only within the capabilities of a state actor.” He denied Russian claims that the substance could have come from Porton Down, which is eight miles from Salisbury, saying: “There’s no way that anything like that would ever have come from us or leave the four walls of our facilities.” Aitkenhead said: “We were able to identify it as novichok, to identify it was a military-grade nerve agent. We have not verified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific information to the government, who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions that they have come to.” He said the location of manufacture could be established through “a number of different input sources which the government has access to”, adding: “Scientific evidence is only one of those sources.” Aitkenhead said Porton Down was continuing to work on the substance to try to provide additional information that might help. He also said there was no known antidote to novichok but said Porton Down had advised Salisbury district hospital on how to treat the Skripals. Seizing on Aitkenhead’s remarks, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Britain will have to apologise to Russia for its “mad accusations” that “have no foundation whatsoever.” The Russian embassy in London said the UK’s claims that Moscow was behind the attack was a “bluff” and added: “This has been confirmed by the head of the secret lab. This only proves that all political declarations on the Russian origin of the crime are nothing but assumptions not stemming from objective facts or the course of the investigation.” A UK government spokesman played down the signficance of Aitkenhead’s remarks. He said: “We have been clear from the very beginning that our world-leading experts at Porton Down identified the substance used in Salisbury as a novichok. “This is only one part of the intelligence picture. As the prime minister has set out in a number of statements to the Commons since 12 March, this includes our knowledge that within the last decade Russia has investigated ways of delivering nerve agents probably for assassination – and as part of this programme has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks; Russia’s record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations; and our assessment that Russia views former intelligence officers as targets. “It is our assessment that Russia was responsible for this brazen and reckless act and, as the international community agrees, there is no other plausible explanation.” However, two weeks ago Boris Johnson was asked by an interviewer on Deutsche Welle, Germany’s public international broadcaster, how the UK had been able to find out the novichok originated from Russia so quickly. He replied: “When I look at the evidence, the people from Porton Down, the laboratory, they were absolutely categorical. I asked the guy myself, I said: ‘Are you sure?’ And he said: ‘There’s no doubt.’ So we have very little alternative but to take the action that we have taken.” Looking ahead to Wednesday’s OPCW meeting, a Foreign Office spokesman said Russia had called it to try to undermine the work of the organisation. The spokesperson said: “This Russian initiative is yet again another diversionary tactic, intended to undermine the work of the OPCW in reaching a conclusion.” The Russian ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov, was the latest to join the criticism from Russia over the UK’s handing of the aftermath of the attack. He said Russia wanted Britain to “provide every possible element of evidence” it had, adding: “We certainly reject any notion or claim of Russian involvement in the Salisbury incident. We will not tolerate this kind of irresponsible and basically indecent behaviour on the part of the British government. They will have to answer for that.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, called the attack a “provocation arranged by Britain” to justify high military spending because “they need a major enemy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/13/cocktail-of-the-week-royal-rhubarb","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Cocktail of the week: royal rhubarb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/13/cocktail-of-the-week-royal-rhubarb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/13/cocktail-of-the-week-royal-rhubarb","fields":{"headline":"Cocktail of the week: royal rhubarb","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The beginning of April is a time to bid farewell to forced rhubarb for another year and to welcome field rhubarb season, and this punchy little number is as good a way as any of marking the transition.

Friends of the Earth Netherlands on Wednesday demanded the Anglo-Dutch company revise plans to invest only 5% in sustainable energy and 95% in greenhouse-gas emitting oil and gas. The environmental group said this business strategy would increase the impact of climate change, especially on the world’s poorest people and those most prone to flooding. It has given Shell eight weeks to shift to a cleaner tack, after which it says it is prepared to invoke international obligations, human rights treaties and laws on hazardous negligence. Heading the group’s legal team is Roger Cox, who led and won a landmark climate case in 2015 that insisted the Dutch government should set more ambitious emissions targets. “This is the first case we know of in the world that seeks preventive action from a company over climate change,” Cox told the Guardian. “We are not asking for damages. We want Shell to steer away from its current course and to get in line with the Paris agreement.” Shell is one of the world’s 10 biggest carbon emitters. In its annual report last year, the company publicly declared support for the Paris climate deal. It has also outlined “decarbonisation pathways” to move away from dependency on fossil fuels, but environmentalists are frustrated at the glacial pace of change and the weak investment in renewables and carbon capture technology. Friends of the Earth says the company should be held to account for the approximately 2% of the historical emissions of carbon dioxide and methane it has added to the atmosphere between 1854 and 2010. It has previously taken the company to court for the damage it caused around oil fields in Nigeria. “Currently Shell and companies like it are acting like big tobacco in decades past by failing to take responsibility for the harm that they cause,” said Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland. “Shell must now move on from its history of Earth-damaging fossil fuel extraction and play a major part in the transition to a sustainable future, to keep temperature rises to near 1.5C.” A spokesperson for Shell said the company strongly supported the Paris agreement, “but we believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.” Given the vast discrepancy in financial resources, any legal battle between Friends of the Earth and Shell would be a challenge of David and Goliath proportions. But Dutch courts have produced surprises. Arguably the biggest victory for climate litigators anywhere in the world was the 2015 ruling that the Dutch government’s plans to cut emissions by just 14-17% compared to 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. The court in The Hague ordered the government to raise targets to at least 25% within five years, although the government is appealing against the decision. If the Friends of the Earth case goes ahead, Cox said it will depend on the legal duty of everyone in the Netherlands to prevent harm to others when it is reasonably preventable. The duty of public care was easier to prove against the government. It will be tougher against a private company, but Cox said the plaintiffs will emphasises that Shell has specific responsibilities because it has contributed to greatly to the problem of climate change. Courts in other countries are increasingly a climate change battleground. According to the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia law school in New York, there are now more than 1,000 cases in the world. Most are claims for damages in the US. In January, New York city announced plans to sue five fossil fuel firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell – for their contribution to climate change, which has caused flooding and erosion in the city. Local governments in California and elsewhere have launched legal actions, alongside private citizens. Last month, a group of 21 young plaintiffs overcame a major hurdle when a judge rejected moves to dismiss their lawsuit, which argues the US government’s failure to curb CO2 emissions violated their generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property. In the most prominent UK case to date, a high court heard the first climate challenge last month against the British government, brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B which has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King. Nasa scientist-turned activist James Hansen has called for a wave of litigation alongside political mobilisation because, he says, judges are less likely than politicians to be in the pocket of oil, coal and gas companies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/10/alan-moore-neil-gaiman-genius-eddie-campbell","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T11:09:38Z","webTitle":"'The man's a genius!': Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman on Eddie Campbell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/10/alan-moore-neil-gaiman-genius-eddie-campbell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/10/alan-moore-neil-gaiman-genius-eddie-campbell","fields":{"headline":"'The man's a genius!': Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman on Eddie Campbell","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eddie Campbell is a genius. But don’t take my word for it, take Alan Moore’s. “Eddie’s is a genuine one-off talent, utterly idiosyncratic and personal,” he says. Or perhaps Neil Gaiman’s: “The man’s a genius, there’s an end to it.” If you don’t know Campbell by name, you’ll know his comics: most famously, he was Moore’s artistic collaborator on the tour-de-force From Hell, eventually adapted into a film starring Johnny Depp. But the Glaswegian artist produced a wealth of work both before and after From Hell. The Glaswegian artist’s oeuvre ranges from the ultimate punk-DIY – photocopying and distributing his autobiographical In the Days of the Ace Rock’n’Roll Club strips from a Southend bedsit in the 1970s – to drawing the likes of Captain America and Batman. But while his Marvel and DC work is proof that Campbell can do pretty much anything, it’s in the more experimental, creatively free projects that he seems to shine, no doubt informed by the punk rock publishing ethos of his early days: Bacchus, a series that plonks ancient Greek gods into the modern age, or The Lovely Horrible Stuff, a treatise on our relationship with money. Moore is as effusive with praise as he was 30 years ago, when he first spotted Campbell’s Ace Rock’n’Roll Club strips and gave them a glowing review in Marvel’s magazine Daredevils. “Eddie’s style, both his loose, impressionistic line and his approach to storytelling, was fresh, exciting and like nothing anyone had ever seen before,” he says. “Luckily he had someone as insightful and perceptive as me to explain that to everybody.” The Ace Rock’n’Roll Club, the series that caught Moore’s eye, were beautifully formed slices-of-life which introduced, as a part of the supporting cast, Alec McGarry. Alec was a cipher for Campbell, a fictional avatar through which Campbell could filter his own life, ranging from his punk years in Scotland to his sojourn on England’s south coast, to his first marriage and life in Australia. “His appreciation for the sensory phenomena of ordinary existence, as rich as Henry Miller’s, made his autobiographical narratives into instant classics, streets ahead of the largely self-absorbed comic-strip memoirs that were to follow,” says Moore. Speaking from his “writing cabin” in New York state, Gaiman points out a shelf opposite his desk that contains only books he considers incredibly important; a collected edition of Campbell’s Alec strips sits on it. “I couldn’t compile a list of the most important graphic novels of the 20th century without including Alec on it. Eddie’s style is … ” He thinks. “Well, he doesn’t really have one single style. He’s an original. He draws from life.” Saying Campbell doesn’t have a style may sound like a slight – it isn’t. The Alec comics are, as Rolling Stone once described, “impressionistic and quotidian; a shockingly hard combination to pull off”. Even his Captain America work is recognisably Marvel, if also feeling curiously retro; the line-drawn panels in his Bacchus stories seem deceptively simple but, on scrutiny, are incredibly detailed; his art on From Hell is scratchy and unnervingly shadowed. From Hell would not have been as interesting if Eddie Campbell had not drawn it, says Gaiman – a position even Moore agrees with. It’s Campbell’s “effortless” ability to depict authentic, everyday life, he says (a useful trait when drawing a comic about Jack the Ripper). “His matter-of-fact approach to the most potentially sensational of subject matter was just what was needed, simultaneously getting rid of all the tawdry manipulation that comes with standard visual horror fare, and replacing it with a sense of the commonplace that made the crimes depicted much more honestly horrific and appalling,” he says. Like Moore, Gaiman championed Campbell’s work long before he met him, reviewing Alec for the adult magazine Knave, for which Gaiman wrote under a pseudonym. Later, they’d work together, on a story featuring Will Eisner’s character The Spirit. Even later, they’d become friends, with Gaiman dedicating a book to Campbell’s daughter, Hayley, and introducing Campbell to Audrey Niffenegger, author of The Time Traveller’s Wife. The pair married in 2016 and live in Chicago. “It couldn’t have happened to a nicer pair of people,” says Gaiman. Campbell’s chameleon style is perhaps most evident in his new joint creation with his wife: Bizarre Romance is a mixture of prose pieces by Niffenegger, adaptations of her stories by Campbell, and original comic strip collaborations by both of them, all varying wildly in tone and form. Is this the book that will finally bring Campbell stardom? Gaiman initially disagrees: “I never understood that view. In my personal pantheon of comic creators from the last 35 years, Eddie Campbell is right up there on Mount Olympus.” Later, he rethinks this: “I never expect the world to catch up with him. Maybe in 200 years from now when people look back at the world today, they’ll say that Eddie Campbell was chronicling it best.” Bizarre Romance by Audrey Niffenegger and Eddie Campbell is published by Jonathan Cape, at £16.99. It is available for £12.55 from the Guardian Bookshop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/03/facebook-apologises-storing-draft-videos-users-thought-deleted-bug-mark-zuckerberg-tim-cook","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T15:03:59Z","webTitle":"Facebook apologises for storing draft videos users thought they had deleted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/03/facebook-apologises-storing-draft-videos-users-thought-deleted-bug-mark-zuckerberg-tim-cook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/03/facebook-apologises-storing-draft-videos-users-thought-deleted-bug-mark-zuckerberg-tim-cook","fields":{"headline":"Facebook apologises for storing draft videos users thought they had deleted","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook continues to deal with the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica files, announcing policy changes and bug fixes aimed at undoing some of the company’s more controversial data collection features. On Monday, Facebook apologised for storing draft videos which users had filmed and then deleted, saying a “bug” resulted in them being indefinitely stored instead. The bug was first reported last week after users discovered videos they had never posted were being stored by the company. The storage was only uncovered when those users attempted to download all the data the company had on them, and were startled to find that Facebook had stored unused draft videos for years. Videos filmed using the company’s desktop web camera tool, popular in the late 00s and early 10s before Facebook fully embraced mobile, were stored even when users thought they had deleted them. The company apologised, telling TechCrunch that was a mistake: “We discovered a bug that prevented draft videos from being deleted. We are deleting them and apologise for the inconvenience.” The company is also changing another feature, part of its ad ecosystem that allows third-parties to upload contact lists to target customers on Facebook, in order to better preserve user privacy. The feature, Custom Audiences, is intended to allow companies who have customer lists offline to advertise to those same customers on Facebook – by, for example, uploading a list of emails and matching them to Facebook profiles. Now, Facebook will be requiring companies to certify that they obtained user consent to use the information in that specific way, according to a leaked email seen by TechCrunch. A new tool will instead require advertisers to actively certify that they have permission. “We’ve always had terms in place to ensure that advertisers have consent for data they use but we’re going to make that much more prominent and educate advertisers on the way they can use the data,” Facebook told the tech news site. Finally, in a wide-ranging interview with the website Vox on Monday, Mark Zuckerberg hit back at Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who had attacked Facebook’s business model for inevitably leading to the sort of data-based scandals the company is now tackling. “I find that argument, that if you’re not paying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth,” Zuckerberg said. “The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/03/donald-trump-scott-pruitt-epa-condo-lobbying-keep-head-up-call","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T17:34:48Z","webTitle":"Trump tells EPA chief Pruitt 'we've got your back' despite ethics controversy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/donald-trump-scott-pruitt-epa-condo-lobbying-keep-head-up-call","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/donald-trump-scott-pruitt-epa-condo-lobbying-keep-head-up-call","fields":{"headline":"Trump tells EPA chief Pruitt 'we've got your back' despite ethics controversy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has offered his support to Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who is at the center of an ethics controversy. Two administration officials said the president called the former Oklahoma attorney general on Monday and told him: “We’ve got your back.” Trump also urged Pruitt to “keep his head up” and said the White House supported him. The officials said the chief of staff, John Kelly, reiterated those sentiments in a call to Pruitt on Tuesday morning. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations. At the White House on Tuesday, where he was meeting Baltic leaders, Trump told reporters who asked about Pruitt: “I hope he’s going to be great.” The Wall Street Journal had reported on Monday that Pruitt was the subject of a White House review, quoting an official who said not many people were coming to his defence. On Sunday, the Alabama Democratic senator Doug Jones said he thought Pruitt was “on his way out” while the independent senator Bernie Sanders said the EPA chief should appear before the Senate environment committee. Former Trump transition chief Chris Christie said Pruitt “should’ve never been there in the first place”. Despite his reality TV fame being based on the catchphrase “you’re fired”, Trump has avoided contact with appointees about to lose their jobs. The secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and veterans affairs secretary, David Shulkin, both ejected in March, were reportedly told of their fate by Kelly before Trump tweeted the news. Pruitt, who was already one of a number of Trump appointees dogged by controversy over the use of public money for travel and other expenses, has come under intense scrutiny for his use of a Capitol Hill condominium linked to a prominent Washington lobbyist whose firm represents fossil fuel companies. ABC News and Bloomberg News reported last week that in his first six months in Washington last year, Pruitt made a deal to pay about $50 a night – less than a third the price of similar properties – to rent a room in a Capitol Hill neighborhood condo building co-owned by energy industry lobbyist Steven Hart and his wife. Hart’s firm represents companies regulated by the EPA, including Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric, shale producer Concho Resources, ExxonMobil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) company Cheniere Energy. Travel records obtained through a public records request showed that Pruitt spent more than $17,000 in taxpayer money for a December trip to Morocco to promote US exports of LNG. Marketing American LNG is not under the jurisdiction of the EPA administrator. An ethics official at the EPA has insisted Pruitt’s lease did not violate federal rules. A memo signed by Kevin Minoli contended that the $50-a-night payments constituted a fair market rate. As a professed climate science skeptic Pruitt has thrived in the Trump administration, slashing environmental regulations often established under Barack Obama. It has been reported that he covets the post of attorney general should Jeff Sessions be fired. Sessions is reportedly out of favour over his recusal from the investigation into Russian election meddling and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow. The interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, and treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have also come under pressure over questions of spending and ethics. Trump’s first health secretary, Tom Price, resigned over his use of public money for private travel. On Tuesday congressman Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican, said Pruitt’s “corruption scandals are an embarrassment to the administration, and his conduct is grossly disrespectful to American taxpayers. It’s time for him to resign or for Potus to dismiss him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/04/cambridge-analytica-used-violent-video-to-try-to-influence-nigerian-election","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T13:40:49Z","webTitle":"Revealed: graphic video used by Cambridge Analytica to influence Nigerian election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/cambridge-analytica-used-violent-video-to-try-to-influence-nigerian-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/cambridge-analytica-used-violent-video-to-try-to-influence-nigerian-election","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: graphic video used by Cambridge Analytica to influence Nigerian election","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cambridge Analytica sought to influence the Nigerian presidential election in 2015 by using graphically violent imagery to portray a candidate as a supporter of sharia law who would brutally suppress dissenters and negotiate with militant Islamists, a video passed to British MPs reveals. The Guardian has obtained the video, which has graphic scenes of violence from Nigeria’s past. In testimony to the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee last week, the whistleblower Christopher Wylie told MPs: “[The video was distributed] in Nigeria with the sole intent of intimidating voters. It included content where people were being dismembered, where people were having their throats cut and bled to death in a ditch. They were being burned alive. There was incredibly anti-Islamic, threatening messages portraying Muslims as violent.” Wylie also said Cambridge Analytica directed AggregateIQ (AIQ), the Canadian digital services firm that worked for Vote Leave during Britain’s EU referendum, to target voters with the video during the Nigerian presidential campaign. Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, has now handed the material to MPs. Giving testimony last week, he said: “Cambridge Analytica sent AggregateIQ the video after they [CA] got banned from several online ad networks because the graphic nature of the content violated the terms of service. AIQ was quite freaked out about it. It’s a very disturbing video. They told Cambridge Analytica that. They called it ‘the murder video’.” In his testimony Wylie said: “AIQ is the firm that’s right at the heart of the official Vote Leave campaign – one-third of all leave spending went through it – and this shows them working closely with Cambridge Analytica to distribute violent, divisive Islamophobic material that should be nowhere near an election campaign.” There is no suggestion that AIQ was involved in the production of the video. Cambridge Analytica was hired by a Nigerian billionaire to run a campaign in support of Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian, and the video was targeted at his Muslim opponent, Muhammadu Buhari, who went on to win the election. There is no suggestion that Jonathan was aware of the campaign. The anti-Buhari video imagines a future in which he is president and sharia law has been imposed. “Coming to Nigeria on February 15th 2015,” the voiceover says in the manner of a trailer for a Hollywood movie. “Dark. Scary. And very uncertain. Sharia for all.” It poses the question: “What would Nigeria look like if sharia were imposed by Buhari?” It suggests he would strike a deal with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram that would be “a pact with the devil”. The video also suggests “Buhari will punish all who speak against the regime” and that “women will be veiled”. It ends by saying: “You can stop this movie becoming real.” Another former Cambridge Analytica employee who worked on the campaign said: “It was voter suppression of the most crude and basic kind. It was targeted at Buhari voters in Buhari regions to basically scare the shit out of them and stop them from voting. People were working on it in Cambridge Analytica’s office. They’d be sitting there eating their lunch and editing this incredibly graphic and disturbing material.”The video will be seen as further evidence of dirty tricks that Cambridge Analytica employed in the campaign. Last month the Guardian revealed that during the Nigerian election campaign Cambridge Analytica was offered material from Israeli hackers who had accessed private email accounts of two politicians there. Former Cambridge Analytica employees described how the hackers passed a thumb drive of hacked material relating to Buhari to them in Cambridge Analytica’s offices and they were directed by Alexander Nix, its chief executive, and Brittany Kaiser, a senior director, to search Buhari’s personal emails for compromising material that could be used to smear him. The material included private medical information that employees say was leaked to the press. The video separately demonstrates the ties between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, the firm that its parent company SCL Elections employed. Last week the DCMS committee published documents that link Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections with AIQ, including a contract, a service agreement and an intellectual property agreement that was first revealed in the Observer a year ago. AggregateIQ is part of a current Electoral Commission investigation into a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave made to a youth outreach group, BeLeave, which was paid directly to the Canadian firm and it is the focus of allegations made by a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni. AggregateIQ did not respond to previous Guardian inquiries about the video, but said: “AIQ provides digital advertising, web and software development services to third parties. It is completely independent of Mr Wylie, CA and SCL.” It added: “AIQ is and has always been 100% Canadian owned and operated … the services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave.” There is no suggestion that AggregateIQ unethically coordinated with Cambridge Analytica on the EU referendum campaign. A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said: “You are referring to Chris Wylie’s comments before a select committee which included speculation and a serious misrepresentation of the facts. We are, however, taking all allegations about possible unethical practices in the past very seriously and will investigate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2018/apr/03/1812-overture-v-the-lark-ascending-which-best-represents-brexit-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T15:00:43Z","webTitle":"1812 Overture v The Lark Ascending – which best represents Brexit Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2018/apr/03/1812-overture-v-the-lark-ascending-which-best-represents-brexit-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2018/apr/03/1812-overture-v-the-lark-ascending-which-best-represents-brexit-britain","fields":{"headline":"1812 Overture v The Lark Ascending – which best represents Brexit Britain?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Classic FM listeners have voted Tchaikovsky’s rousing 1812 Overture as their favourite piece of classical music, pushing Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending off the top spot and into third place (Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No 2 in C Minor came in second).

Lark: Yes and no. It was inspired by George Meredith’s 1881 poem about a skylark – but was composed at the dawn of the first world war, so perhaps not that much simpler or less confusing. Any possible comfort for those who voted remain? 1812: It celebrates success in a battle that was – on paper – a defeat, but the triumphalism of the victors was ignored. After they got tired of wrecking everything, they just went away. Lark: Although it begins with the sound of a single violin, it eventually rises to a volume loud enough to drown out cries of “Get over it – you lost!” Anything in it to particularly gratify Brexiters? 1812: Bombast, and plenty of it. It’s also about a country getting rid of an unwanted European occupier – unfortunately, by starving itself. Lark: It’s written by a British composer, about a British bird. Anything in its popularity to trouble the government? 1812: It’s a little pro-Russian for the present climate. Lark: The British skylark population has declined by a third since the 1980s due to intensive farming; possible rallying cry for conservationists. Trigger warnings needed? 1812: Yes, literally – 16 cannons go off during its performance. Lark: Possibly, if you’re a bit weird about birds. Does it offer any hope for those facing a future beset by uncertainty in a world run by venal incompetents? 1812: No. Lark: No. In that case, is it easy to slag off on social media as a way of infuriating its devotees? 1812: Yes. It was described as “very loud and noisy and without artistic merit” – by Tchaikovsky himself, who loathed it. Lark: Yes. It’s routinely derided as a bland and safe choice, which is perhaps why Classic FM listeners are backing away from it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/07/fit-for-a-king-a-prince-harry-style-makeover","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T10:00:58Z","webTitle":"Fit for a king: a Prince Harry style makeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/07/fit-for-a-king-a-prince-harry-style-makeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/07/fit-for-a-king-a-prince-harry-style-makeover","fields":{"headline":"Fit for a king: a Prince Harry style makeover","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When it comes to memorable outfits, few can match the impact of the Nazi uniform Prince Harry wore to a fancy-dress party in 2005. Not to mention the full-frontal nudity revealed to the world seven years later, after a game of strip billiards in Las Vegas ended up on a gossip site – “A classic case of me being too much army and not enough prince,” he said of the incident. Usually, however, Harry wears classic royal garb. There’s the blue-and-burgundy tie of his regiment, the Blues and Royals; his medals; and his single-breasted suit, chinos and blazer, all of which tend to be blue, like his blood. Then there’s the polo kit (like many royals, Harry looks most at home on a horse) and some undeniably impressive uniforms, such as the Blues and Royals’ tropical dress: in eye-popping Persil white, it confirms that Harry may be the best wearer of medals, a gold sash and thickly-braided epaulettes since Michael Jackson circa Dangerous. Off duty, however, Harry’s flair for style is far less certain. Despite their appearance in various fawning best-dressed lists, neither Harry nor William have that crucial sixth sartorial sense. When they’ve got a day off, they favour baggy shirts and khakis, sometimes accessorised with that modern curse, the gap-year bracelet (he is wearing an unforgivable seven in one shot). Yet that was the BM era – before Meghan. There’s no doubt that Harry has started looking sharper since La Markle came on the scene. His shirts have got crisper, his suits better-fitting, his car coats more luxurious. Even those endless blue garments have started exhibiting a bit of variation: a cobalt Everlane cashmere jumper in Wales, a cornflower coat at Christmas in King’s Lynn, a midnight-blue knitted tie with a paler blue Gieves &amp; Hawkes suit when announcing his engagement. None of this is going to frighten those polo horses – and that’s exactly the way Harry intends it. The royals stand for continuity, tradition and security, not waiting for the latest Vetements drop at Dover Street Market. Gert Jonkers, editor-in-chief of men’s fashion magazine Fantastic Man, is a fan of Harry’s muted style. “Prince Harry is, of course, pretty ridiculously handsome,” he says, “so I’d say everything suits him well, including the perfectly understated clothes he’s always been drawn to. He dresses a bit like a royal press release: considered and nothing to be offended by. Navy blue suits him very well, as do combinations of blue, grey and white, but I guess that’s what you do when you’re in the company of your future spouse and with the assurance that there’ll be a billion photographers awaiting you. One thing I noticed is that on a recent joint appearance, the prince wore a muted-army-green jacket, which isn’t a very lifting colour for redheads. That’s all!” Yet what if Harry had more leave to experiment in his new married life? As we demonstrate here, he could still be an ambassador for Britain in Burberry – in fact, by wearing the rainbow flag-infused check of Christopher Bailey’s final collection, he can wink to his newfound wokeness. He can still wear the classics, but why not a remixed version by Stella McCartney, whose new menswear line has all the green credentials of her womenswear? Rather than shrieking at clingfilm like his dad, he can prove his modernity by embracing the sports tech trend in a Burberry cagoule, a definite upgrade from the rain jacket he wore last October at Brockholes nature reserve in Preston. And while his grandfather sleeps in the nip (according to The Crown), Harry can indulge in some statement sleepwear by Desmond &amp; Dempsey. Finally, away from the paparazzi, Harry can ditch the button-downs and billowing linen shirts, and embrace his inner party animal with a Paul Smith Hawaiian shirt. He doesn’t even need to lose the bracelet – but please, Harry, confine it to just the one. And don’t even think about an armband. • Commenting on this piece?

The protest takes to the street Wednesday as hundreds of teachers will begin a 110-mile march from Tulsa to Oklahoma City stopping at closed down schools along the route to rest. Teachers in Kentucky have gone out on strike too and Arizona may be next. Teachers and students across the United States have been invigorated in recent months by a series of high-profile protests. With student walkouts protesting Trump’s immigration policies and gun violence and teachers calling for the reversal of decades of education cuts and higher wages, it’s a movement that has reignited a debate about the role of activism in the classroom. Oklahoma’s strike began Monday when teachers in over 100 school districts walked out, rejecting a $6,000 pay increase offered by the state and demanding a $10,000 raise as well as increased funding for books, curriculum and staffing. The school system has reached breaking point after decades of neglect, said the teachers. In some schools, teachers don’t assign homework because their budget for books is so small that they can’t afford to risk a student losing a $200 textbook. Teachers have been posting pictures of their crumbling textbooks online. “Honestly, students feel like [education] is not important,” said Kelsey Laster, a fourth-grade teacher a Rollingwood elementary school in Putnam City, Oklahoma. “People don’t look at them like they are important so they don’t look at it like it’s important.” It wasn’t always this way in Oklahoma. Since 2009, Oklahoma has cut more of its state education funding than any other state in the country, cutting more than $192m since 2009 according to a report released by the Oklahoma Policy Institute. The cuts came after the state lost more than a quarter of its operating budget because of a series of cuts to the state’s oil and natural gas production tax and personal income taxes initiated in the mid-2000s. While neighboring Texas has an effective taxation rate of 8% on oil and natural gas, Oklahoma’s tax rate sits at a mere 3.2%. If it were not for the tax cuts on natural gas and oil as well as personal income taxes, the Oklahoma Policy Institute estimates that the state would have an additional $356m to spend on K-12 (primary and high school) education as well as an additional $238m to spend on higher education. Neighboring Texas, with its higher natural and oil gas production tax, has a minimum starting teacher salary of $50,000. While across the border in Oklahoma, the starting salary for teachers is only $32,000, or less than $15 an hour when you factor in the cost of healthcare premiums. Unsurprisingly Oklahoma is currently experiencing a massive brain drain of talent to Texas. “Almost all of our family members tell us that they want us to live here, but they are worried about our wellbeing and tell us to move elsewhere for work,” said aspiring English teacher Maggie Slogan of Enid, Oklahoma, a student at Southwestern Oklahoma State University. Many teachers say that they are often forced to work second or third jobs just to stay in the state where they are born. Cowboy hat-clad Blake Stevens is cheering on the crowd near the DJ stand as teachers stop to dance and blow off steam on the rainy unusually cold early April day. Despite working for 21 years as a school counselor in Locust Grove, Oklahoma, Stevens says that he makes only $39,000 a year after deducting for healthcare. In order to make end meets he also drives the school bus to and from school. Due to budget cuts, his school is open only four days a week. Stevens lives 20 minutes from the Arkansas border and says that he could easily get a job making $20,000 more across state lines. “Everyone with a brain in their head has left the state,” said Oklahoma native Stevens. “The reason I haven’t left is that I am here fighting for what matters for Oklahoma. I’ve been in Locust Grove for 21 years, my life is right there in that community. A lot of these kids, I counseled their parents and now I’m getting their kids.” Teachers say they are prepared to stay out on strike for as long it takes. “You have to be persistent to sustain,” said history teacher Jack Reavis as he circled the Capitol holding a 10ft high picket sign reading “Persist like Clara Luper”, in reference to high school social studies teacher Clara Luper, who stubbornly worked for decades to desegregate Oklahoma City. “Most of these legislators don’t think we will last a week, but I think we will last longer,” said Reavis. “This is important because if we fold, it’s over for everybody.” Karina Moreno contributed reporting on this story.

Ethiopia lodged a formal restitution claim in 2007 for hundreds of important and beautiful manuscripts and artefacts being held by various British institutions, all plundered after the 1868 capture of Maqdala, the mountain capital of Emperor Tewodros II in what was then Abyssinia. That request has been refused. But in the run-up to a Maqdala display opening this week at the V&amp;A, a compromise has been offered by the museum’s director, Tristram Hunt, who said: “The speediest way, if Ethiopia wanted to have these items on display, is a long-term loan … that would be the easiest way to manage it.” The offer is significant given the pledge by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the return of African artefacts would be a “top priority” for his administration. The loan proposal has been welcomed by the Ethiopian state and campaigners, but Hunt said it was a complex debate and it was important not to extrapolate a “blanket policy”. He told the Guardian: “You have to take it item by item and you have to take it history by history. Once you unpick the histories of the collections it becomes a great deal more complicated and challenging.” The Maqdala display, which opens on Thursday, will show 20 items taken after a military expedition to secure the release of British hostages taken by Tewodros. The British victory culminated in the emperor’s suicide and the destruction of his fortress. Hundreds of artefacts were plundered from Maqdala and the emperor’s treasury cleared with 15 elephants and 200 mules needed to transport them. Campaigners have identified about a dozen UK institutions that own them, from the V&amp;A in London to the Royal Library at Windsor Castle to a regimental museum in Halifax. Hunt said there were a number of reasons why a simple return was not possible, including the legal difficulties around deaccessioning and the “philosophical case for cosmopolitanism in museum collections”. The offer of a long-term loan was welcomed by Prof Andreas Eshete, a former president of Addis Ababa University who co-founded Afromet, a campaign group for the return of Maqdala treasures. “This can only be a great improvement on what has happened before,” he said. “There are certain things that are important to Ethiopia that are never on display in the UK so I think a loan, on a long-term basis, would be a great gift to the country.” Eshete hoped by taking this first step it might also educate the British public about the merit of returning objects: “Once they see they are used in a proper way and in a way that is accessible to not only the Ethiopian public but the international public … people may well change their mind about the value of holding on to them for ever.” The museum has worked closely with the Ethiopian embassy before the anniversary display. The ambassador, Hailemichael Aberra Afework, said: “We are delighted with the new partnership between Ethiopia and the V&amp;A and look forward to working together in the future to our mutual benefit. “Future cooperation will be especially beneficial in terms of capacity building and skills transfer in the care and maintenance of cultural heritage, in which the V&amp;A has extensive experience.” The loan may put pressure on other institutions to follow suit. The British Museum has about 80 objects from Maqdala, including a number of tabots – believed by Ethiopian Christians to be the dwelling place of God on earth, a symbol of the Ark of the Covenant. They have never been on public display because of their religious importance and can only be seen, even by a curator, with the agreement of the Ethiopian Orthodox church. Other objects are on display but the British Museum argues the value of them being seen by the public is in a global context. A spokeswoman said the museum would consider any loan request from Ethiopia. Museums have international long-term loans in place but many believe they should go further, with the debate given impetus in November when Macron said in a speech: “African heritage can’t just be in European private collections and museums.” Hunt said politicians often had “geopolitical, if not trade and defence deals in mind” when they made such statements. “You have to approach it in an item by item manner. “I think personally It would not be a bad idea to think about how we use development aid money for greater partnerships for conservation, heritage management and artefact support in countries, like Ethiopia, which have an incredible heritage and the prospect of a growing, global market of visitors.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/21/country-diary-a-dead-newt-marks-the-end-of-the-line","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T04:30:04Z","webTitle":"Country diary: a dead newt marks the end of the line","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/21/country-diary-a-dead-newt-marks-the-end-of-the-line","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/21/country-diary-a-dead-newt-marks-the-end-of-the-line","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: a dead newt marks the end of the line","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s the yellow that catches my eye. Bright egg-yolk splotched with black warts, glistening against wet asphalt. Long, striped toes. A forearm flung out, fingers drooping, thumb hanging down, elegant as a lady offering her hand for a kiss. A great crested newt, Triturus cristatus, squashed. The pattern of pulping suggests a big, ridged tyre, probably a tractor. The driver would never have seen it in the dark, perched up high on his plastic seat, roaring up the lane to feed the heifers, one last job before turning in. Newts are largely nocturnal. They spend the winter semi-dormant, lurking under stones, compost heaps or buried in the mud. In spring they emerge to mate. Some will return to the same places as last year, while others trek a little further in search of new breeding grounds. They prefer a mild, rainy night, preferably moonless. Great crested newts, “askers”, used to be common in the Marshwood Vale. Damp meadows with abundant ponds provided an ideal habitat. Modern farming has more than halved the number of pools and the newt population has dwindled. Habitat loss is the main factor in their decline, despite their protected status. Last spring, a herpetologist surveyed all the remaining Vale ponds. He was looking for newt eggs. Great crested females each lay more than 200 individual eggs. They stick them one at a time on leaves, folding the foliage over for protection. The greeny-white, globular eggs are nearly twice the size of the greige ova of smooth and palmate newts. Females may deposit several eggs in turn on a single long blade, pleating it into an erratic concertina. I watched in hope as the herpetologist checked our pond. More than 10 years ago he found great crested newt eggs here. On his last couple of surveys, he found none. This visit would decide whether the site would be declared abandoned. There were no eggs. The dead newt in the lane near our house was the only great crested I have seen. I could barely make out the silver line running down the centre of the tail – a male. He’d been travelling east, towards our pond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/08/all-women-programmes-female-film-makers-on-demand-streaming","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T07:00:23Z","webTitle":"Women film-makers: the female gaze on demand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/08/all-women-programmes-female-film-makers-on-demand-streaming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/08/all-women-programmes-female-film-makers-on-demand-streaming","fields":{"headline":"Women film-makers: the female gaze on demand","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In a perfect world, programming seasons of films by female directors would seem as randomly unspecific and unnecessary as picking “drama” or “films with outdoor locations” as your theme: it goes without saying that half the world’s population shouldn’t constitute some kind of auteurist niche. But we don’t live in that world. We’re in the one where, over the past 11 years, around 4% of US films have been directed by women; roughly the same stat applies to the UK industry across its entire history. In the streaming universe, where film archiving tends toward the spotty and selective, that representational imbalance is often felt. Which makes curated programmes such as Mubi’s current The Present Is Woman, the Woman Is Present season, however unideal, spirit-lifting. If anything, the broadness of its female-film-makers-only remit serves to underline the pointlessness of pigeonholing an entire gender. On the mainstream side of the spectrum, there’s Elaine May’s once-maligned buddy comedy Ishtar, an absurdly wild and woolly Hollywood bro-farce that has been critically rehabilitated of late. At the distant opposite end is Hungarian Márta Mészáros’s Diary for My Children, an aching, hope-streaked and unjustly little-seen study of mourning and coming of age in post-Stalinist Budapest. Selections in between run the gamut from a sensual, honey-slow double shot of shorts from French-Senegalese actress-film-maker Mati Diop to Kathryn Bigelow’s punk-rave-era sci-fi kaleidoscope Strange Days, a still-electric vision with only Ralph Fiennes’s extravagant locks to tip you off that it’s somehow 23 years old. There’s also Documenteur, a teasing, well-picked deep cut from French New Wave queen Agnès Varda. If you’re looking to further brush up on your Varda ahead of the imminent UK release of her Oscar-nominated documentary Faces Places, however, head to Curzon Home Cinema, which has a pleasing eight-film retrospective of her work on offer, including 1962’s seminal, swinging vérité character study Cleo from 5 to 7; her later, tougher, more fractured feminist masterwork Vagabond; and Jacquot de Nantes, an utterly beguiling early-years portrait of Varda’s late husband Jacques Demy, tenderly made a year after his death from Aids. Curzon’s menu also highlights a modest playlist of films by women, though not one as diversely or inventively selected as that on offer at the BFI Player’s Women With a Movie Camera collection, which includes modern essentials from the likes of Andrea Arnold (Red Road), Céline Sciamma (Tomboy), Lucrecia Martel (The Headless Woman) and Joanna Hogg (Unrelated), but also more esoteric, rarely exposed finds such as Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s theory-riddled 1970s mindwarp Riddles of the Sphinx, Sally Potter’s early experimentalist beauty The Gold Diggers and, of a more recent vintage, Anocha Suwichakornpong’s Kermode-endorsed By the Time It Gets Dark, a woozy meditation on art, activism and tobacco leaves. Finally, to Festival Scope, whose current, unsexily named Festival of French-Speaking Belgian Cinema, streaming until June, may not be gender-themed, but has a gratifyingly high number of strong female-directed selections. These include Amer, Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani’s visceral, bewitching psychosexual homage to Italian giallo horror, and a discovery in Rachel Lang’s short For You I Will Fight, a flinty, moving study of a female army recruit. Best of all, they’re all free to stream. So if you’ve never seen the collection’s most famous title – Chantal Akerman’s trailblazing Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles – a mesmerising study of weathered female psychology revealed through painstaking domestic routine – it’s never been easier for you to tackle it. Also new to streaming &amp; DVD this week Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Disney, 12) The all-slaying juggernaut makes its way to living rooms, and the harshly polarised debate over its merits can continue apace – though this agnostic thought it more idea-driven and visually dynamic than any of the franchise’s last five entries. Gook (Kaleidoscope, 15) You may have blinked and missed it in cinemas, but Justin Chon’s raw, funny, politically fiery Korean-American view on the 1992 Los Angeles riots is worth catching up with at home The Disaster Artist (Warner Bros, 15) Sexual harassment allegations against James Franco halted the mounting buzz for his Tommy Wiseau biopic – but even putting that aside, there’s not much to be gained from this japey stunt that you wouldn’t get simply from watching The Room. Stronger (Lionsgate, 15) Through no fault of his own, Jake Gyllenhaal saw awards hopes dwindle for this straightforwardly affecting biopic of Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jeff Bauman: his piercing performance, and that of Tatiana Maslany as his wife, deserve a second look. The Three Faces of Eve (Signal Hill, PG) A welcome Blu-ray release for this unavoidably dated but still-fascinating 1950s study of dissociative identity disorder in picket-fence suburbia, anchored by Joanne Woodward’s Oscar-winning double-somersault of a tour de force."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/03/author-anita-shreve-dies-aged-71-the-pilots-wife","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T13:52:23Z","webTitle":"Author Anita Shreve dies aged 71","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/03/author-anita-shreve-dies-aged-71-the-pilots-wife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/03/author-anita-shreve-dies-aged-71-the-pilots-wife","fields":{"headline":"Author Anita Shreve dies aged 71","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The bestselling novelist Anita Shreve, author of The Pilot’s Wife, has died at the age of 71, after what her publisher called “a long and very private fight with cancer”. Shreve died on 29 March at her home in New Hampshire in the US. A high-school teacher and journalist before turning to writing fiction full time, Shreve was the author of 18 novels. Her first bestseller came in 1997. The Weight of Water, about a photographer investigating the brutal murder of two Norwegian women on a New Hampshire island more than a century before, was shortlisted for the Orange prize and adapted into a film directed by Kathryn Bigelow in 2000. After overhearing a conversation about an airplane crash at a party, Shreve wrote her 2002 novel The Pilot’s Wife, the story of a woman whose pilot husband dies in a crash, only for her to discover that he might not have been the man she thought she knew. The novel sold more than three million copies after it was selected for Oprah’s book club. Shreve’s most recent novel was The Stars Are Fire, in which a pregnant woman tries to protect her toddlers as fire ravages the coast of Maine in 1947. “In all of her work, Anita deftly explored the intricacies and nuances of relationships between men and women, often hinging on the ripple effects of a single, dramatic moment. She wrote the details of history, from the 19th century to the 1920s to the second world war, as if she had lived them herself,” said her publisher Hachette in a statement. The publisher described Shreve as “a beloved figure for all of us who had the privilege of working with her”, calling her “both elegant and modest, kind, funny, and always observant of every nuance of human interaction”. In an interview with the Guardian in 2008, Shreve described how writing was, for her, “a solitary pursuit”. “It’s something to be kept secret, whether writing poems in my closet as a child, or refusing to tell anyone what I’m writing about until it is finished,” she said. “The well-spring of my writing is, as I have mentioned, very private. In the beginning, it was a secret pastime; later, it became a way to express emotions I had no idea what to do with … finally it morphed into its present incarnation: daydreaming with a lot of craft brought to bear on what makes it to the page.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/05/family-cycling-trails-uk-england-scotland-northern-ireland-readers","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:43:59Z","webTitle":"Family cycling trails in the UK: readers’ tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/05/family-cycling-trails-uk-england-scotland-northern-ireland-readers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/05/family-cycling-trails-uk-england-scotland-northern-ireland-readers","fields":{"headline":"Family cycling trails in the UK: readers’ tips","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Winning tip: Morecambe to Scalestones Point, Lancashire This ride takes you past Happy Mount Park with its great adventure playground and Splashpark (open in summer months); there’s an outdoor sculpture trail on the prom and plenty of refreshment stops.

There are plans afoot to extend the Strawberry Line and combine it with trails such as the Bristol to Bath route (see below) to create a traffic-free, 85-mile Somerset Circle Norm70 Bristol to Bath Beginning at Temple Meads station, it’s a 13-mile traffic-free stretch to Bath, where you’ll have the option to catch the train back. But you may not make it all the way as there is so much of interest en route. Stop at disused Mangotsfield station, which apparently gave (Dad’s Army star) Arnold Ridley the inspiration to write his well-known play The Ghost Train. There are numerous artworks, historic and industrial archaeological sites to investigate along the trail, if these float your boat. Pick a day when the Avon Valley railway is operating and you can watch steam engines. You can hire bikes at Bitton station (Webb’s of Warmley). There are plenty of cafes close to the cycle path. • Route at sustrans.org.uk, bike hire from £16 at webbsofwarmley.com Janis Fletcher Belfast to Lisburn The Lagan Towpath is an 11-mile long traffic-free canal route connecting Belfast and Lisburn. It starts at Shaw’s Bridge, built in 1709, and ends at the Lisburn Civic Centre, a stone’s throw from the town centre. Along the way you can explore a restored canal barge for free, or grab a well-earned bite to eat in what used to be the lock-keeper’s cottage. Best of all, the cycling charity Sustrans arranges regular family cycles along the towpath, and provides the bikes free of charge. A great family day out. • Bike hire with mountainbikeni.com half a mile from Shaw’s Bridge; route at sustrans.org.uk and walkni.com BelfastSchoolgirl Sutton Park, Birmingham Access is great, being completely surrounded by the suburbs of Birmingham. The park is on two National Cycle routes but is a fun day on its own (you can cycle along canals and in Plantsbrook nature park from Brum city centre). The park was used and given to the locals by Henry VIII – not sure he cycled much! The routes take you through open grassland, ancient forests, along Roman roads, past pools and bronze age mounds, splashing through a ford (Wyndley Gate) and over a lovely set of 20-plus narrow bridges around Bracebridge Pool. If you prefer tarmac there is the road that climbs to Four Oaks Gate along the park’s eastern perimeter. Nice snacks and drinks are available on the patio of the Renato Lounge in Mere Green and also in the park at Town Gate cafe and Blackroot Bistro. • birmingham.gov.uk catchytitled Loch Katrine, Stirlingshire This picturesque loch-side cycle can be combined with a cruise on the historic steamship Sir Walter Scott for a great family day out in the heart of the Loch Lomond &amp; The Trossachs national park. Begin the day at the Trossachs pier and visitor centre at Loch Katrine, where ample metered parking is available. A wide range of bikes can be hired on site, with prices for a four-hour rental period starting at £8 for children and £15 for adults (katrinewheelz.co.uk). Board the steamship with your bikes in tow on a one-way ticket to Stronachlachar at the loch’s opposite end. The journey time is around one hour, and sailings depart daily at 10.30am in the summer months. Advanced booking is recommended, which can be done online (adult £17, child £9). On disembarking, it is a 13-mile cycle back to the visitor centre, including a small number of short but moderately steep climbs near the start. The largely traffic-free route is on a tarmac track and has beautiful views over the water and surrounding hills. There is a tearoom at the pier car-park. FGlasgow Aviemore, Cairngorms This is a 20-plus mile route from Inverdruie near Aviemore for the more adventurous and experienced. Start by following the tracks to Loch an Eilein. Skirt the loch edge in the Caledonian forest before breaking into the open and heading towards the stunning Lairig Ghru pass via the iron bridge. From here, well-laid tracks lead on to Loch Morlich where there are plenty of picnic spots and loch-side cafes for a lunch stop. Extend your trip by visiting the magical and aptly named Green Lochan in the Ryvoan Pass. Rest awhile in the beautiful scenery and watch out for the elusive red squirrels. Back on the main route, it’s an exciting downhill ride on tracks alongside the ski road to return your bikes. You’ll be a little saddle-sore but it’s a great day’s cycling that the family will always remember. • Day’s bike hire from £21 day at In Your Element bridgetking Wadebridge to Padstow, Cornwall Without a doubt my favourite family cycle ride is one that encompasses flat, safe paths, amazing costal scenery and a decent reward at the end – in this case, stunning views and a hearty pasty. Start at Wadebridge where you can rent bikes from Bridge Bike Hire (adult bike from £13 a day) and cycle along the pathway right next to the Camel estuary. After reaching Padstow (5.5 miles) and enjoying a pasty and beautiful harbour views, hop back on your bikes for the ride back to Wadebridge and enjoy a drink in one of the many pubs. If you’ve still got plenty of energy you can carry on to Bodmin (5 miles) and Wenfordbridge (6 miles). • Route details at cornwall.gov.uk becki212 Bishop’s Stortford to Braintree, Essex The relatively flat Flitch Way follows the route of a railway abandoned in the 1970s. You can cycle, walk or ride a horse along the 15-mile traffic-free path, skirting the Tudor hunting enclave of Hatfield Forest, passing fields of retired shire horses, free range turkeys gobbling in the woods, dragonflies hovering over wetlands, and several old stations and halts complete with original platforms, enamel signs and picket fences. There are two cafes en-route, one indoor at Rayne serving cakes and pastries, the other outdoor at Little Canfield offering pumpkin soup and bacon sandwiches. Be nice and slow down for pedestrians, though. • Map at visitparks.co.uk Rose Marwood"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global/2018/apr/10/good-to-meet-you-margaret-eley","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T10:58:24Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

Later, when we left west Somerset, our ways parted as we pursued our chosen career paths, at times revisiting the Weekly almost as if it were a friendly uncle. About 25 years ago, when we were living in Toronto as a second-time-around couple, my son gave us a Christmas present of a subscription to the Weekly. We were hooked and became committed readers. It has been fascinating to see how the paper has evolved into its being a week in the life of the world. We value the research and knowledge needed for many of the feature articles. Comment &amp; Debate is a must, while Eyewitnessed has superb pictures. I take a first quick look at What I’m really thinking as I collect the paper from our post office box. Admittedly, there have been times when we miss Nancy Banks-Smith and the obituaries. Bob quickly read the sections that interested him most, coming back later for his much-loved crossword puzzles. I tend to take a more cover-to-cover approach, so it is not surprising that I am still involved with last week’s copy when the new one arrives. Sadly, we have recently had to say that long goodbye, so I am now on my own, but with the Weekly as a constant companion.

And then, more quickly: “Don’t worry, they all gave permission.” After this, she sets to fiddling, a little frustratedly, with the machine’s mouse. O’Sullivan, a neurologist whose particular area of expertise is epilepsy, may know an awful lot about what Emily Dickinson called the depths of the brain (“The Brain is deeper than the sea…”), but she isn’t, it has to be said, much of a hand with the wifi. Finally, the videos start to play. In the first, a young woman is lying on her side in her bed in the telemetry ward (patients who are suffering from severe seizures can spend days in this unit, during which, wires attached to their heads, they are watched by highly trained neurophysiology technicians 24 hours a day). She is quite calm and still, but one of her hands is raised, the fingers moving, I now realise, in such a manner as to suggest she is working the valves of an invisible trumpet. “This is a fidgeting seizure,” says O’Sullivan, all of her attention on the screen. “But you wouldn’t really know it was a seizure at all if I hadn’t told you. It’s fairly subtle.” This is true. The ghostly fluttering lasts 20 seconds at most, and then it is over: so fleeting, I might have imagined it. The second video is more dramatic. This time, it is a young man who lies in bed. He is asleep, deeply so – and then, suddenly, he is not. Up he jumps, skittering across the room, his arms and legs jerking wildly as if he is performing some kind of crazy dance. This goes on for 10 seconds, after which, just as quickly, the movements cease. Returning to consciousness, he becomes aware that he is tangled in the wires that are recording his brain waves; a nurse helps him to free himself. “That was a hypermotor seizure,” says O’Sullivan. “The fidget seizure comes from the temporal lobe, which is an emotional part of the brain. That’s why that kind of seizure is often accompanied by déjà vu, fear, panic. But this kind comes from the frontal lobe, which produces motor symptoms, so you can’t miss it. This happens to him three times a night.” In the final video, a man is lying on his back in bed, a vision of peacefulness until the left side of his face begins to jerk rhythmically, as if someone were pulling on an invisible string threaded through his upper lip: a sight that might be comical if you didn’t know that this was something over which he has no control. When it stops – again, a nurse is already by his side – he looks dazed, as if he is not quite sure where he is, or why. “That’s a very specific seizure,” says O’Sullivan. “The kind that might make it hard for people to understand why it is so disabling. But imagine if that happened to you at work every day.” For a few moments, she continues to look at him, and then she turns to me, almost embarrassed. “Oh, I could show you seizures for an hour!” she says, with a grin. “They don’t look like seizures on the telly, do they? People know about the big, dramatic kind, but they don’t know about the tiny ones. What they fail to remember is that our brains do everything: when your hair stands on end, when you wink, everything. So if you’ve got a disease of the brain, like epilepsy, that means almost anything can be a symptom of a seizure.” O’Sullivan, a consultant who divides her time between the National Hospital for Neurology and the Sir William Gowers Centre in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire (an NHS unit that is part of the Epilepsy Society), became something of a public figure in 2016, when her surprising and powerful book about psychosomatic illness, It’s All In Your Head, won the £30,000 Wellcome prize (“Oh, it was the best thing ever. I was like the Queen of Sheba”). Now she has written a second, more challenging volume, Brainstorm: Detective Stories from the World of Neurology, in which she attempts to describe the complex, elusive experiences of some of her patients, and her various struggles to diagnose and treat their sometimes highly unusual symptoms. Along the way, she instructs us in the bottomless mysteries of the brain, telling us some of what scientists know about it (relatively little), but also what they don’t (there is so much yet to be discovered; we are not even close to 50% of the way there). “I hope the book will teach people about the brain,” she says. “How it’s organised, how it might work. But much more important to me are the people in it. These patients have disabilities that are unique to them, and which are very hard to explain to other people. I want to communicate their stories, to reveal what it’s like to live with an often invisible disability, with a condition that it is still very hard for doctors to treat.” How often, these days, does she find herself totally baffled by a patient’s symptoms? (O’Sullivan, the warmest, most approachable kind of doctor you could meet, has been a consultant since 2004.) “That happens about two times out of every 100,” she says. “But if I have a clinic with 10 people in it, there might be one or two where I might not feel entirely confident. You see, you’re basing so much on their ability, or that of their mother or partner, to describe something that may be very odd.” Luckily, she loves nothing more than to listen. “The story is everything, and that helped with the writing of the book. Each one has an inbuilt drama, a feeling of ‘What is going to happen next?’” By the time patients get to see O’Sullivan – they are referred from all over the country – they’re usually desperate. Earlier, she took me to meet a young woman who is staying in the video telemetry unit (let us call her Emily): “Emily was breezy, wasn’t she? And she looked so healthy, so bonny. But she is here to see if surgery is likely to offer a cure for her seizures. To get to that point – it means the drugs have failed – you have to be quite desperate.” The patients in Brainstorm are of many different ages and backgrounds; all that they have in common is that their symptoms are frequently bizarre. Donal is a school caretaker whose seizures involve a hallucination in which he sees what looks like the seven dwarves. August is a clever, rebellious young woman whose seizures cause her suddenly to run at speed, putting her in great danger (she is oblivious to fences and walls). Sharon, having been treated for epilepsy, turns out not to have the condition at all: her seizures are dissociative, her brain switching off for a moment, perhaps as a way of avoiding remembering something she doesn’t want to. (I was amazed by this, but it is not uncommon: at least one-fifth of people attending an epilepsy clinic with seizures do not have epilepsy.) “That’s a very delicate conversation,” says O’Sullivan. “You have to make sure the patient understands that you’re not accusing them of doing it on purpose, that you know they’re just as disabling – just as real and uncontrollable – as an epileptic seizure. Those suffering dissociative seizures are more likely to be admitted to intensive care – and they’re much harder to treat because psychiatric therapies are harder than taking a tablet.” O’Sullivan, who grew up in Dublin, the city where she trained as a doctor, always knew neurology was the speciality for her. “The nervous system is beautiful,” she writes in her book. Epilepsy was noted as a brain disease by Hippocrates in 400BC, but it was a long time – millennia – before doctors recognised the condition, which affects about 1% of the population, as a vital investigative tool for the brain. Only in the 19th century did a neurologist called John Hughlings Jackson determine that the condition’s cause was a sudden electrical discharge spreading through the brain, at which point epilepsy became a symptom rather than a disease, the features of each seizure being representative of the part of the brain that was engulfed in the offending electrical discharge. This led neurologists to follow seizures to their source and to extrapolate the function of the brain from it; thus, they put together rudimentary maps of the brain. The development of anaesthetic, allowing surgeons, if they were lucky, to find the source of the problem – a tumour, a lesion – moved things along. So, too, much later, did Cat scans and MRI scans. But we still don’t know what causes most brain diseases, nor do we know how to reverse them. O’Sullivan still does what the pioneers did a century ago. She interprets stories, extrapolating from a patient’s account of their symptoms, a diagnosis. At which point, she may be able to help – or not. In the book, Maya, a woman in her 60s who has suffered from debilitating epilepsy since she was 10 – her seizures involve screaming, chewing and the loss of speech and movement in one hand – has surgery to remove an abnormal area of her left temporal lobe, and a miracle happens (except, of course, it is not a miracle, but the result of huge and hard-won expertise): she is cured. For the first time, she can move freely, alone. But another, much younger patient, Mike, having been offered smaller odds of success for a similar operation, opts not to have surgery, fearing the risk; his epilepsy is milder, and he can live with it. “Surgeries have really increased in the last 20 years,” says O’Sullivan. “But sometimes funny things happen. Patients have set up their whole lives around their epilepsy, and they slightly miss it; they must re-adapt. Also, when you remove the tissue, you’re inevitably removing healthy as well as unhealthy tissue, and that brings a risk. I am hoping the technology will arrive soon that will enable Mike to have the operation without opening up his brain, burning just a tiny bit out.” What about the drugs? Haven’t they improved? “They’re nicer to take. They have fewer side effects. But still, they only work for about 70% of patients.” How quickly will things change? “We’re in the infancy of figuring out how to heal damage once it happens,” she says. “If you have a scar on your brain, we can’t do anything about it. But there are glimmers on the horizon. One is our ability to heal genetic diseases. Another is our increasing understanding of neuroplasticity. We used to think the brain was fixed, that it didn’t change after you were an infant. However, we know now that it is possible to create new connections, for functions to move around. If we could figure out how to promote that… But we’re a million miles away at the moment, so protect your brain!” She would never cycle without a helmet. “I am more careful than other people, yes. I don’t do high-risk things, though I am terribly bad about crossing the road without looking properly. But the flipside is that I worry less about brain function. You do get less good at learning things as you get older, but I know I’m not alone in that. It’s not a sign of anything degenerative.” And perhaps there are some things that it is better not to know. “Of course, I want to understand how to cure diseases. But there is something worrying about the idea of reducing every part of your personality to a biological mechanism. If you do, what are you? If you could manipulate happiness and sadness, what would that mean? I am quite happy to be romantic in that way.” Is love a kind of brain disease? She smiles. “Well, the minute you apply biology to your attraction to another person, it becomes unattractive. I don’t need to know these things. But you needn’t worry. We’re a long way from understanding such feelings.” Before I leave, we talk about the NHS: every technician and specialised nurse I have met today has come to Britain from another country. “My world is quite rarified,” she tells me. “We have no A&amp;E here, for instance. But I don’t think there is any doubting that the NHS is in crisis. There are already a phenomenal number of empty doctor and technician posts, and our potential inability to recruit from abroad in the future is not going to help that.” All this said, though, you would never take O’Sullivan for a pessimist. Doom is not her mode. It’s impossible to imagine her whingeing without turning it into a joke. Something pulls her along, and you can almost feel it: her fascination with her work, her deep and abiding interest in those who come to her for help. “The life so short, the craft so long to learn,” said Hippocrates. Patience is everything in her realm. But equally, there is no time to waste.

The prime minister this week lost 30 consecutive Newspolls, a metric he invoked as justification for a move against Tony Abbott in 2015. The milestone prompted two government conservatives, Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison, to articulate their future leadership ambitions while fronting the cameras to express loyalty to Turnbull. Dutton told Guardian Australia over the weekend he had ambitions to lead the Liberal party one day – a message he repeated on Monday – while Morrison used an interview on the ABC on Monday night to signal he was interested in the event the party leadership fell vacant. Bishop was pressed on her own ambitions by the ABC on Tuesday morning, and said she was “focused on the roles I have. I have been elected by my colleagues to be the deputy leader of the Liberal party, I’m Australia’s foreign minister, so my priority is to focus on the jobs and responsibilities I have now”. She said Turnbull would lead the government to the next federal election, so future leadership questions were at this point “hypothetical”. However she did not rule out the idea of a tilt in the event the top job became available. “Presumably my colleagues were speaking about their future ambitions, they have all said that Malcolm Turnbull will lead us to the next election so I think we need to look at their comments in that context,” Bishop said. Bishop rejected a call from the former Nationals leader Joyce for Turnbull to consider a transition in the event he failed to turn around the government’s political fortunes by Christmas. “I don’t agree with Barnaby Joyce – the prime minister will lead us to the next election,” she said. Appearing on the ABC on Monday night, the multicultural affairs minister, Alan Tudge, also rejected Joyce’s commentary. “I don’t think it was a particularly useful contribution from Barnaby this afternoon. “Listen, we’re not into setting artificial deadlines, and I am very confident as we get closer to the election, the Australian people will start to focus very much on the alternative.” Joyce, now a Nationals backbencher, will have no say over who next leads the Liberal party, so the provocative intervention is seen as payback for the pressure Turnbull subjected him to at the height of the imbroglio over his personal life. Within the government, Bishop and Dutton are seen as the likely contenders in the event Turnbull’s position becomes terminal. Bishop will be resisted fiercely by rightwingers, and Dutton is seen as a polarising figure. As well as notching up 30 Newspoll losses, the Coalition also lost its 80th consecutive Guardian Essential poll this fortnight. Turnbull remains the pick of voters as preferred Liberal leader in that survey, with 24% (up 3% since December) nominating him. Bishop is seven points behind that on 17% (down 2%) and Dutton rates only 3%. Tony Abbott – who has intensified his troublemaking this week – is favoured by 11% of the sample of all voters (up 1%) but, underscoring general voter disaffection, 27% do not know who they want to lead, and 14% say they want “someone else”. Liberal backbencher Linda Reynolds told Sky News on Tuesday she saw no circumstances in which Abbott could return to the leadership, and she said Turnbull would lead the party to the next election. She said senior colleagues articulating their leadership ambitions publicly over the past few days were merely supplying truthful answers to questions put to them by journalists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/10/fake-black-lives-matter-facebook-page-run-by-australian-union-official-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T01:52:32Z","webTitle":"Fake Black Lives Matter Facebook page run by Australian union official – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/fake-black-lives-matter-facebook-page-run-by-australian-union-official-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/10/fake-black-lives-matter-facebook-page-run-by-australian-union-official-report","fields":{"headline":"Fake Black Lives Matter Facebook page run by Australian union official – report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A high-ranking Australian union official has been suspended amid reports he ran a fake Black Lives Matter Facebook page that solicited donations from the movement’s supporters. CNN reports that Ian MacKay – an official with the National Union of Workers – helped set up and run a Facebook page called Black Lives Matter as well as other domain names linked to black rights. The page, which was removed by Facebook after CNN’s queries, had almost 700,000 followers – more than double the official Black Lives Matter page. MacKay – who is white – did not respond to calls or emails but denied running the page when contacted by CNN. A statement given to the Guardian by the NUW’s national secretary, Tim Kennedy, said the union had launched an investigation into the claims made in the CNN report. He said the union had suspended “the relevant officials pending the outcome of an investigation”. “The NUW is not involved in and has not authorised any activities with reference to claims made in CNN’s story,” he said. The Guardian understands MacKay and one other NUW official has been suspended. In 2015 Mackay was appointed vice president of the NUW’s general branch and the union’s public office records state that he still holds the position. The investigation quoted sources who said the page may have garnered upwards of $100,000 in donations, at least some of which was directed to bank accounts registered in Australia. It was tied to online donations that supposedly went to Black Lives Matter causes in the US. At least some of the money, however, was transferred to Australian bank accounts, CNN has reported. Fundraising campaigns associated with the Facebook page were suspended by PayPal, Donorbox and Patreon after they were contacted for comment. MacKay also registered other websites with links to black rights, such as blacklivesnews.com, blackkillingsmatter.com and backfists.com, among more than 100 site names in total. Domain records show that in 2015 he registered a site known as blackpowerfist.com, which operated as a Reddit-like discussion forum that encouraged donations. Historical domain registration details show Mackay used his union email address to register the site. Archived records on the site describe the site as being “created” by Black Lives Matter to “share the news that mainstream media play down or hide”. The historical site records state it is “not funded by any other BLM group, George Soros, Ford foundation or Celebrity”. “We also help people who can’t get support otherwise that are victims of hate crimes or have been affected by racism that come to us, we can’t often help them financially but try our best to get them free legal advice or some place to stay with one of our network,” an archived donations link to the site reads. The CNN investigation traced an anonymous Facebook profile under the name “BP Parker” who shared a link to the blackpowerfist website the day after it was registered. The same profile was an administrator of the “Black Lives Matter” Facebook page until the page was suspended. Black Lives Matter was contacted for comment. It comes as Facebook faces increased scrutiny on the content it hosts on the social media site. The company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is due to appear before the US Congress this week when lawmakers will quiz him about the privacy scandal involving political consultant Cambridge Analytica and Russian use of the platform ahead of the 2016 US election. A spokesman for Facebook said: “We investigated this situation as soon as it was brought to our attention, and disabled the page admin for maintaining multiple profiles on the platform”. “We continue to look into the situation and will take the necessary action in line with our policies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/09/david-willey-ipl-yorkshire-late-signing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T20:56:01Z","webTitle":"David Willey’s late IPL departure delivers another blow to Yorkshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/09/david-willey-ipl-yorkshire-late-signing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/09/david-willey-ipl-yorkshire-late-signing","fields":{"headline":"David Willey’s late IPL departure delivers another blow to Yorkshire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Yorkshire have bemoaned “an impossible situation” and demanded the introduction of a cut-off point for Indian Premier League deals after losing David Willey to the tournament just days before the start of the county season. Willey is the 12th Englishman to sign for an IPL team this year and will join his international team-mates Mark Wood and Sam Billings after agreeing a £225,000 deal at Chennai Super Kings as a late injury replacement. The 28-year-old all-rounder, who joined Yorkshire from Northamptonshire in 2016 citing a desire to further his Test ambitions, pulled out of a pre-season friendly at Leicestershire on Monday in anticipation of the deal. It is another blow for the White Rose before the season opener on Friday at home against the defending champions Essex, having let Liam Plunkett join Delhi Daredevils over the weekend and seen Adil Rashid sign a white-ball-only deal for 2018. Martyn Moxon, Yorkshire’s director of cricket, said: “We find ourselves in an impossible situation with these late replacement requests. At the moment we are potentially looking at a situation where, if we deny a player an opportunity, we will be left with someone who is not completely focused on playing for Yorkshire. This would be counter-productive. “There are now 12 English players in this year’s IPL, so the issue goes further than just here at Headingley.” The news is timely in one sense, with Moxon due to chair a meeting of representatives from 15 of the 18 first-class counties at Edgbaston on Tuesday to discuss the current cricketing landscape. As well as a debate over the future structure of the County Championship – Yorkshire favour of a conference-style system to replace two divisions – the meeting will explore ideas that give clubs greater protection in the Twenty20 era. Moxon said: “With the number of T20 contracts available worldwide, it is important that we future-proof the County Championship. I will be calling for the introduction of a cut-off date, after which players will not be allowed to go to the IPL. Hopefully this can gain national approval and be supported by the ECB.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/09/michael-cohen-raid-trump-lawyer-fbi-mueller-documents","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T11:18:00Z","webTitle":"Trump decries 'attack on our country' after FBI raids his lawyer's office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/michael-cohen-raid-trump-lawyer-fbi-mueller-documents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/michael-cohen-raid-trump-lawyer-fbi-mueller-documents","fields":{"headline":"Trump decries 'attack on our country' after FBI raids his lawyer's office","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump declared an “attack on our country in a true sense” was under way after FBI agents conducted a raid on the office of his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on Monday. The raid was carried out after a referral from the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to New York-based federal prosecutors, a lawyer for Cohen said. It was not clear that the raid related to Mueller’s investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Yet in an extraordinary scene inside the White House late on Monday, Trump connected those dots and more, saying the raid represented part of an ongoing attack on him engineered, he said, by “the most biased group of people” with “the biggest conflicts of interest I’ve ever seen”. He called it “an attack on our country in a true sense. It’s an attack on what we all stand for.” Unusually affronted by the move against a member of his inner circle, it seemed, Trump described the raid as an extension of a conspiracy against him that had “started right after I won the nomination”. “It’s a disgraceful situation, it’s a total witch-hunt, I’ve been saying it for a long time,” Trump said. Mueller’s investigation so far has produced 19 indictments or guilty pleas. Monday’s raid led to the seizure of records including communications between Cohen and Trump, Cohen’s lawyer said in a statement. Also seized were documents relating to a $130,000 payment Cohen has admitted making to the porn actor Stormy Daniels, according to the New York Times, which first reported the raid. Daniels is in a protracted legal battle with Trump to tell the story of their alleged relationship. Agents also raided a home and hotel room used by Cohen, the Wall Street Journal reported. Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, released a statement that said: “Today the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients.” He did not name Trump. A message left on Monday afternoon at Ryan’s firm was not returned. Trump said the raid on Cohen “really is now in a whole new level of unfairness”, but he did not respond directly to questions of whether he would seek to have Mueller dismissed. “I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on,” Trump said. “We’ll see what happens … Many people have said you should fire him.” Mueller’s referral may indicate his team’s inquiry uncovered evidence of potential crimes falling outside the focus of their investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Or the referral may have been made simply because the New York prosecutors were better positioned to carry out the raid, explained Neal Katyal, a supreme court lawyer who wrote the special counsel regulations, on Twitter. The recommendation for prosecutors in Manhattan to handle the raid – as opposed to Mueller – was made by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation, Bloomberg reported. Rosenstein has occasionally attracted Trump’s ire for his handling of the investigation. The president was following news coverage of the raid closely, CNN reported. Cohen is closer to Trump’s inner circle than anyone previously to have such a sharp brush with prosecutors, although Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been interviewed by Mueller’s team, and Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, has been interviewed by congressional investigators. Cohen said the payment to Daniels was “facilitated” by him personally and was not made on behalf of the Trump campaign. A watchdog group has brought a lawsuit alleging that the payment to Daniels was in fact an illegal campaign contribution. “The decision by the US attorney’s office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary,” said Ryan in his statement. He said Cohen had cooperated fully with government prosecutors. Prosecutors connected with Mueller have previously obtained email correspondence and other documents tied to Cohen, who has worked closely with Trump for more than a decade on particularly sensitive matters. Those matters included Trump’s alleged relationship with Daniels, in which a large payment was made on the eve of the 2016 election as she was preparing to go public with her story of an affair with Trump; and efforts to build a Trump tower in Moscow. Cohen was interviewed privately in October 2017 by members of the House intelligence committee, which has since shuttered its investigation of the Russia affair. The FBI conducted a pre-dawn raid of the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s Virginia home in July 2017. Manafort has been charged with multiple crimes including money laundering and bank fraud, to which he has pleaded not guilty. On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted two short messages: “Attorney–client privilege is dead!” and “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/09/two-dead-after-pony-and-trap-accident-in-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T20:34:51Z","webTitle":"Two dead after pony and trap accident in Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/two-dead-after-pony-and-trap-accident-in-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/09/two-dead-after-pony-and-trap-accident-in-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Two dead after pony and trap accident in Ireland","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two tourists believed to be from the US were killed on Monday in a freak accident involving a pony and trap at an Irish beauty spot.

It is not enough simply to blame under-achievement on injuries or match officials or the weather. If, after seven months of league rugby, a high-profile, well-backed club is wallowing in lower-table mediocrity the only remaining place to look is the bathroom mirror. Perhaps the defining aspect of this year’s Premiership season has been the unusual number of big sides conducting major inquests with three weekends of the campaign left to play. The bottom three clubs – London Irish, Worcester and Northampton – had already parted company with their directors of rugby this season and the announcement that John Kingston is to leave ninth-placed Harlequins at the end of the season has maintained the sorry sequence. Partly it is a sign of the times, the inevitable flip side of a league which grows more competitive – if not necessarily of a higher quality – each year. Not everyone can make the play-offs and European Champions’ Cup qualification can never be guaranteed. That said, the decline in fortunes of Quins, Northampton and Bath is striking: the last time any of them made the last four was in 2015 and their supporters’ patience is wearing thin. The mood around the Stoop, in particular, had darkened to such an extent in the wake of their 35-5 home defeat to the bottom side London Irish on Saturday that Kingston’s departure was no surprise. Even before it was announced, the club’s ex-England captain Will Carling was among those who felt something had to give. “Painfully obvious that some tough decisions have to be taken before key players start to leave,” Carling wrote on Twitter. “Once down that road attracting great players becomes almost impossible.” Given the contract extensions awarded to the coaching trio of Kingston, Mark Mapletoft and Graham Rowntree only in January, these are uncomfortable times for the club’s board. A team containing experienced England internationals such as Chris Robshaw, Mike Brown and Danny Care, two British &amp; Irish Lions props and an assortment of talented youngsters should not, in normal circumstances, be disappearing without trace at home against an Exiles side who had a bonus point wrapped up after an hour. While injuries may have disrupted Quins’ season, six defeats in seven league games this year cannot be wholly explained away by last summer’s retirement of their high-class fly-half Nick Evans – now the attack coach – or a lack of consistent forward turbo-thrust. You would have to go a long way in rugby, however, to meet three more genuine rugby men than Kingston, Mapletoft and Rowntree. Where, too, is the surefire alternative saviour on his – or her – white charger? Coach sackings are becoming as much of an occupational hazard in professional rugby as football but, equally, there are examples of shrewd recruitment and a couple of dressing-room departures achieving more than flipping over the entire Monopoly board. As Northampton, champions as recently as 2014, are discovering, change can be equally painful. They also had a reasonable side out on paper at the weekend but ended up conceding nine tries to Saracens at Franklin’s Gardens, including 48 unanswered points in the second half. In four games against Sarries this season, two of them in Europe, the Saints conceded 237 points and scored just 64; it has not much mattered whether Jim Mallinder, Alan Gaffney or Alan Dickens has been in charge. If the transitional Saints are banking on their incoming Kiwi director of rugby Chris Boyd to ensure an automatic turnaround, they should study Todd Blackadder’s stint at Bath. The former All Black captain is another man of integrity who knows the secrets of winning consistently from his time at the Crusaders. Like many before him, however, he is finding success elusive at Bath, now in eighth place and looking unlikely to make the top six never mind the top four. Again, as at Quins and Saints, there is a sense of a club adding up to less than the sum of its parts. Talk to some within the Bath dressing-room and they even wonder aloud about their palatial training headquarters at Farleigh House, designed to be the envy of every other club in the world. The long winter has left the training pitch out in front of the stately home heavy and its unprotected rural position leaves it particularly exposed whenever the wind blows. Injuries, either way, have been Bath’s constant companion and unless they manage to conjure a win at Saracens on Sunday their chances of making even the top six will be all but extinguished. The ever-reliable Matt Banahan is off to Gloucester, new midfield recruit Jamie Roberts has a serious amount of rugby miles on the clock and up the road will be promoted Bristol, potentially a much stronger proposition this time around. The current top four of Exeter, Saracens, Wasps and Leicester will be tough to shift, Newcastle and Sale are growing stronger year on year and Gloucester under Johan Ackermann are also heading in the right direction. For Quins and the other fallen giants of English rugby, recapturing former glories could take a while. Owens puts Folau in his place At some stage, hopefully, the Wallaby full-back Israel Folau will have his attention drawn to a heartfelt column in the Western Mail written by the Welsh referee Nigel Owens. The latter, as a gay man in rugby, was dispirited to read of Folau’s views that homosexuals were destined for “hell” unless they repented of their sins, a stance that has also angered the Wallabies’ sponsor Qantas. “If you really are a Christian then surely you should respect people who are different to who you are,” Owens wrote. “It’s not your sexuality that should define you as a person but the content of your character in being the person that you truly are.” As so often Owens is spot-on, particularly in a season when two other high-profile players, Mathieu Bastareaud and Denny Solomona, have also been found guilty of homophobic slurs. Homophobia has absolutely no place in rugby or society, regardless of hemisphere or religious persuasion. One to watch The Commonwealth Games Sevens. Even by Fiji’s remarkable standards something special is potentially brewing: could the Fijian men become the first nation to hold the Olympic, Commonwealth, World Series and Hong Kong sevens titles at the same time? After sweeping Kenya aside in Sunday’s final in Hong Kong under the command of their Welsh coach Gareth Baber, the Pacific island kings are now seeking a double on the Gold Coast having not featured at the past two Commonwealth Games. “Yeah we are being a little bit greedy but there’s a desire to win both,” says Baber. Competition will be tough, with other nations having rested most of their best players for the Games, but the flying Fijians usually find a way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/09/champions-league-manchester-city-liverpool-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T21:30:09Z","webTitle":"Manchester City have ‘wow’ factor but they need Houdini-style escape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/09/champions-league-manchester-city-liverpool-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/09/champions-league-manchester-city-liverpool-preview","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City have ‘wow’ factor but they need Houdini-style escape","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"They tell a story at Manchester City, going back to the days when European Cup quarter‑finals were for other clubs, about a time when Liverpool, in their pomp, turned up at Maine Road with all their trophies and continental experience and pushed their luck a bit too far. Those were the years when the Kop at Anfield was in its heyday. City, on the other hand, had a woman named Helen behind one goal whose gimmick was that she would ring a bell – and Ray Clemence found it so off-putting he called them up to complain that it should not be allowed. The Liverpool goalkeeper wanted Helen’s bell confiscated, not perhaps realising she was part of what the club was all about. Helen used to give the home keeper, Joe Corrigan, a sprig of lucky heather before each match and go into the players’ lounge afterwards to collect money for an old people’s home. Word of Clemence’s complaint seeped out and the next time Liverpool visited Maine Road there were more bell-ringers in the old North Stand than on an average Sunday at Manchester Cathedral. It is a lovely story, especially if you remember the days in football when it felt as if Liverpool had all the power, the biggest trophy cabinet, the noisiest crowd and the best team. City? Let us just say it was very different from the scene Jürgen Klopp, the current Liverpool manager, encountered when he arrived in Manchester for Champions League press-conference duties. In one of the quieter moments the German could be found in an upstairs room of City’s training ground, gazing out of the window with row after row of pristine football pitches as far as the eye could see. “Is this all City’s?” he wanted to know, and it was unmistakable envy in his voice. The answer was yes. “Wow! Very big, very good.” Melwood, Liverpool’s practice ground, must feel almost Lilliputian in comparison. None of which will greatly matter, of course, if Liverpool can reach the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Pep Guardiola’s team and, with a 3-0 lead from the first leg, it would be remarkable if the opportunity was passed up. In the entire history of the Champions League, there have been 126 other occasions when the odds have been stacked this way. Of those, only seven teams have saved themselves in the return leg. Or to put it another way, City have a 5.6% chance, applying the lesson of history. One goal from Liverpool, remember, means the Premier League champions-elect will need five. Barring a remarkable feat of escapology, that will leave City reflecting on a solitary semi-final appearance since the Abu Dhabi royal family started changing the landscape of English football in 2008. The 10th anniversary is coming up in September and the bad news for all City’s rivals is that Sheikh Mansour could feasibly still be in charge in another decade. Everybody knew what Guardiola meant when he said “sooner or later” City would win this competition. Yet it would still count as a failure of sorts given the expenditure and ambitions of the owners. Chelsea’s first decade under Roman Abramovich resulted in two finals – one victory, the other a penalty shootout defeat – and four other semi-finals. First things first, however, and Guardiola certainly did not sound as if he thought “the perfect game” was beyond the team chasing a minimum of three goals. “We have 90 minutes, plus extra time, and what we have shown this year is that we can create a lot of chances even in a few minutes. We know that and our opponents know that, too.” His message, he said, was “don’t give up, don’t give up, it’s more than 90 minutes – we will create many chances, then we have to be clinical and, OK, if we are not clinical, the next one, the next one, the next one”. Klopp was not referring to the Manchester weather when he said Liverpool could expect a “thunderstorm” and he made the point that City could conceivably have scored five or six in the first half alone against Manchester United on Saturday. Instead City then conceded three. “They have had a fantastic season, an outstanding season, but they are human beings, thank God,” he said. “They have had two results no one expected but we had to play at our best and United, for sure, had a bit of luck and used it.” Klopp’s cautionary tone was understandable when even a flicker of complacency, at this level, can be a killer. Take the case of Milan, for example, when a team featuring Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko, Cafu and Paolo Maldini won 4-1 against Deportivo La Coruña in 2004. “We were already thinking about the semis,” Andrea Pirlo later wrote in his autobiography. Deportivo won the return leg 4-0 and the holders were eliminated. “We forgot to play,” Pirlo added. “They were laughing at us that night.” Liverpool, chasing their first semi-final place in a decade, surely will not be so presumptuous when they are 17 points behind City in the Premier League. Klopp’s team also made full use of the away-goal rule to eliminate United in the Europa League two years ago, and should be optimistic of scoring again if Mohamed Salah is indeed fit enough to explore the theory that, when players run at Nicolás Otamendi, the centre-half can become a bran-tub of errors. Salah has had the beating of him every time they have met this season and, if that happens again, it could be decisive for a Liverpool team that has already scored 37 times in their previous 11 Champions League assignments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/09/tammy-duckworth-baby-birth-first-senator","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T18:52:55Z","webTitle":"Tammy Duckworth becomes first senator to give birth in office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/tammy-duckworth-baby-birth-first-senator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/tammy-duckworth-baby-birth-first-senator","fields":{"headline":"Tammy Duckworth becomes first senator to give birth in office","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tammy Duckworth of Illinois has become the first US senator to give birth in office. The Democrat announced that she had given birth to her second daughter, Maile Pearl Bowlsbey, on Monday. Her office said the senator and her family were doing well. The family “couldn’t be happier to welcome little Maile Pearl as the newest addition to our family”, said Duckworth, 49, who is a veteran of the Iraq war. After sharing the news she was pregnant, Duckworth prompted a conversation about the way women balance high-powered careers and motherhood. Some welcomed her pregnancy as a sign of progress for female politicians. Others saw it as a reminder of the slow pace of change – and of the gender gap that persists in Congress. “I feel like the Senate is actually in the 19th century as opposed to the 21st somehow and that’s really unfortunate,” Duckworth told the Guardian in an interview last month. Asked how she felt about being the first woman to give birth while serving in the Senate, she told the Chicago Tribune: “Well, it’s about damn time. I can’t believe it took until 2018. It says something about the inequality of representation that exists in our country.” In her statement on Monday, Duckworth said: “We’re deeply honored that our good friend Senator Akaka was able to bless her name for us – his help in naming both of our daughters means he will always be with us.” Daniel Akaka was the first native Hawaiian to represent the state in the Senate. He died on Friday, aged 93. Duckworth said her new baby’s name had a link to her husband Bryan Bowlsbey’s family. “Pearl Bowlsbey Johnson was Bryan’s great aunt, an army officer and a nurse who served during the second world war. He spent many summer months with her while growing up. We feel her presence still and are grateful for her service to our nation during the most challenging of times.” She went on: “We’re also so grateful for the love and support of our friends and family, as well as our wonderful medical teams for everything they’ve done to help us in our decades-long journey to complete our family.” The senator has spent a career in public service. Among the first women to fly combat missions in Iraq, she lost both legs when her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2004. In 2012, she became the first disabled woman elected to Congress, the first member of Congress born in Thailand and the first Asian American woman elected to Congress in Illinois. She had her first daughter, Abigail, in 2014, while serving in the House. That made her one of only 10 lawmakers to give birth while serving in Congress."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/09/humboldt-broncos-crash-victims-hockey-stick-tribute-canada-us-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T19:45:57Z","webTitle":"Humboldt Broncos: fans pay tribute to crash victims with moving hockey stick gesture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/humboldt-broncos-crash-victims-hockey-stick-tribute-canada-us-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/09/humboldt-broncos-crash-victims-hockey-stick-tribute-canada-us-photos","fields":{"headline":"Humboldt Broncos: fans pay tribute to crash victims with moving hockey stick gesture","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a poignant online tribute to those who died in the Humboldt Broncos coach crash on Friday, hundreds of people have shared photographs of hockey sticks left outside overnight. Fifteen people died and more than a dozen were injured when a bus carrying the Humboldt junior team collided with a semi-trailer 124 miles north-east of Saskatoon. Police said 29 people were on the bus. Ten players, the driver, two coaches, a volunteer statistician and a play-by-play announcer were killed. Canada was plunged into shock and mourning. On Sunday Brian Munz, a sports announcer who once covered the Broncos in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, tweeted a picture of a lone hockey stick, explaining that a high school friend had sent him the photo with the caption: “Leaving it out on the porch tonight. The boys might need it … wherever they are.” Munz invited others to do likewise and hundreds heeded his call. Across North America, from Kelowna to Florida, hockey sticks were left on porches and next to backyard rinks. The attendant hashtag, #PutYourSticksOut, echoed a 2014 tribute to the Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes, who died after being hit on the head by a ball. “Kids are leaving their sticks out for the angels to use tonight,” wrote one person on Twitter on Sunday, alongside several photos of sticks left outside. Another added on Instagram: “Tonight we leave a candle burning for the 15 lives lost, a porch light on for those families who keep waiting for their boys, a hockey stick just in case a Bronco needs to teach angels how to play!” In Saskatchewan, Teena Monteleone said she put out a stick in memory of Adam Herold, “an amazing hockey player and young man we had the honor of billeting”. Herold, who had only played with the Broncos for two weeks, was a week shy of his 17th birthday. Along with condolences, donations have poured in from across Canada and nearly 60 countries, for players and families affected. More than C$5.4m has been raised. In Humboldt, a close-knit farming community, thousands packed the Broncos’ arena on Sunday to mourn those killed in the crash. With players that hail from across western Canada and who range in age from 16 to 21, the team was well-known in the hockey-loving town. “It’s just gut-wrenching,” Gordon Lees, a Humboldt resident who has been a fan of the team since it formed in 1970, told Reuters. “It tears your heart out to think that these are fine young guys, that their futures have been wiped out.” Officials released the names of those killed. Among them were Mark Cross, 27, the assistant coach who was remembered as kind-hearted and caring. Evan Thomas, 18, was described by his father as an excellent player who loved his team-mates. Logan Hunter, 18, was remembered as a kind soul, while Glen Doerksen, the driver of the bus, was described as a family man with a passion for hockey. Player Logan Boulet – who signed an organ donor card after turning 21 a few weeks earlier – was taken off life support on Sunday. “All counted, six people will receive the gift of life from Logan,” his godfather wrote on Facebook. “These actions alone give voice to the selfless and benevolent nature Logan possessed in life for others.” On Monday Saskatchewan’s office of the chief coroner said it had misidentified one fatality. Families were notified on Sunday night that Xavier Labelle, 18, was not killed in the crash but had in fact been injured. He had been mistaken for Parker Tobin, an 18-year-old goalie with the team, said a spokesperson for the office. “A lot of these boys looked alike,” said a spokesperson, noting players had dyed their hair blond during the playoffs and had similar athletic builds. He apologised to the Labelle family, acknowledging that it would be “incredibly traumatic” for them not to have been at their injured son’s side. “Our condolences go out to the family of Parker Tobin,” the office added in a statement. “Unfortunately, Parker is one of the 15 that have lost their lives in this terrible tragedy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/09/syria-john-bolton-assad-chemical-attack-test","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T00:16:46Z","webTitle":"Syria provides John Bolton with first test as Trump's national security adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/syria-john-bolton-assad-chemical-attack-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/syria-john-bolton-assad-chemical-attack-test","fields":{"headline":"Syria provides John Bolton with first test as Trump's national security adviser","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As Donald Trump warned on Monday of an imminent US military response to chemical weapons use in Syria, the new head of his national security team was sitting directly behind him, his bristling white moustache a reminder of earlier American wars. John Bolton was one of a handful of hawks who led the Bush administration’s charge into Afghanistan and Iraq, conflicts that are still going on as Bolton returns to centre stage, after a decade in the political wilderness. His first day at work as Trump’s national security adviser focused on a new front, and the question of how to punish the Syrian regime and its backers for the alleged use of poison gas against a rebel-held enclave in the eastern Damascus suburbs. On Monday evening, Bolton accompanied the president to a meeting of US generals to discuss a US response to the Syrian poison gas attack. “He picked today as his first day. So, generals, I think he picked the right day,” Trump said, before turning to Bolton, adding: “But certainly, you’re going to find it very exciting.” Bolton has been a consistent advocate of the use of US military might throughout his career as lawyer turned foreign policy activist, and his presence at Trump’s side is widely expected to echo Trump’s instincts, demonstrated in April last year, to respond with airstrikes to a mass-casualty use of chemical weapons. “Bolton certainly doesn’t shy away from the use of military force,” said Julianne Smith, a senior member of the Obama national security council and now director of the transatlantic security programme at the Centre for a New American Security. “The question is how much does he want to push the president down a path where you are going to get into an escalatory tit-for-tat with Syria, Russia and Iran. “He is going to have to balance his own instincts with a president who wants to show there will be a response to the use of chemical weapons but doesn’t want a 10-year commitment in Syria. And neither he nor Trump have a political plan on what to do about Syria.” Beyond the immediate decision on Syria, there is even greater uncertainty and apprehension about Bolton’s influence on policy towards North Korea and Iran, where Bolton has been a staunch opponent of diplomatic compromise. He has called for the US to walk out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, something Trump is threatening to do next month anyway. And he has insisted that the president should demand North Korea’s immediate and complete dismantling of its nuclear programme when Trump meets the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, at a summit due to take place in May but which the US president said on Monday could be pushed back to early June. On North Korea, Bolton’s instincts have been more hawkish than Trump, who has intermittently signaled he would be ready for some form of compromise. James Carafano, a vice-president at the Heritage Foundation, said Bolton would not make the mistake of his predecessor, HR McMaster, in diverging from the president’s approach. “There is a difference between John Bolton the TV pundit and John Bolton in government,” Carafano said, before referring to the character of a mafia enforcer in The Godfather. “When he is in government, he is Luca Brasi, executing the administration’s policies.” The national security adviser has historically acted as a moderator of conflicting views and interests within an administration. But Thomas Countryman, a former senior state department official, said Bolton’s record in the Bush administration raised questions of how well suited he was temperamentally to that role. “He is known as someone who doesn’t tolerate dissenting views well,” said Countryman, now chairman of the Arms Control Association, adding that Bolton’s time at the state department left behind a trail of poor morale. “He retaliated against analysts who didn’t agree with him on Cuba and Iran, and was known as an abusive manager.” The national security council (NSC) spokesman, Michael Anton, resigned on the eve of Bolton’s arrival. Another senior national security council member, Nadia Schadlow, principal author of the administration’s national security strategy, is also planning to leave. According to attendees at an evening event last week that was attended by much of Washington’s foreign policy elite, McMaster approached several people asking if they could provide jobs for some of his top staffers, who were apprehensive about serving under Bolton. Bolton has also been reported to be considering a purge of NSC staff, but Loren DeJonge Schulman, a former adviser to Bolton’s predecessor, Susan Rice, said such a move would backfire. “Bolton is welcome to create the national security staff he desires, but if he does so by ‘purging’ those hired before, he will have almost no staff. And nor will any future NSA,” DeJonge Schulman said. “There’s always a crisis. The whole point of the staff is to help you understand it and leverage all elements of government. Get rid of the staff and you’re just a guy with a West Wing office and a moustache.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/15/mary-beard-on-my-radar-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"On my radar: Mary Beard’s cultural highlights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/15/mary-beard-on-my-radar-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/15/mary-beard-on-my-radar-interview","fields":{"headline":"On my radar: Mary Beard’s cultural highlights","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Born in Shropshire, classicist Mary Beard received her PhD from Cambridge University in 1982. She joined Newnham College as a fellow soon after, then the classics faculty’s only female lecturer. She has published 18 books, including The Parthenon (2002), The Roman Triumph (2007) and Women and Power (2017), and since 1992 has been classics editor of the Times Literary Supplement. She recently presented Civilisations on BBC2; a companion programme, Civilisations on Your Doorstep, airs on 4 May. Mary Beard is also currently presenting Front Row Late on BBC2 at 11.05pm on Friday nights until 11 May. 1. Restaurant Moro, London EC1 I’m old enough to remember and, I confess, to slightly miss the era of “long lunches”. But when I get a chance to choose a place for a “semi-long” lunch, it would always be Moro, which does the best, most comforting Spanish/north African food I know. I am a slightly picky carnivore, but this restaurant can wood-roast anything to perfection (with some great Spanish wines to match). We nostalgic types also take a wry pleasure sitting in the window and looking out at the now rather gentrified and foodie scene, and remembering what it was like all those years ago when Exmouth Market was a “real street”. 2. Gallery Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge Not far from where I live is Kettle’s Yard, the University of Cambridge’s wonderfully personal collection of modern art. Its nucleus was formed by the collector Jim Ede, and it’s still displayed in his house, where 50 years ago he’d entertain students keen to learn about contemporary art (not high on Cambridge’s academic syllabus at the time). It’s always been a great place for a lazy Sunday afternoon visit, and we’ve missed it over the last two years while it’s been closed for renovations. It’s just reopened with a new education wing, and new space, adjacent to Ede’s house, for temporary exhibitions – launching now with a great two-part show, featuring Cornelia Parker, Edmund de Waal, Caroline Walker and more. Worth the wait. 3. Radio The Reunion, BBC Radio 4 This is one of those brilliant radio ideas that is set for as long a life expectancy as Desert Island Discs. Getting people back together years after they’d been involved in a major event, trauma, celebration or argument, and having them reminisce with a few prompts from Sue MacGregor, works almost every time. You can never tell whether they’re still going to be fighting the old battles, or will have mellowed into friendship, whatever they once felt. Greenham Common was a particularly good one (with tinges of warmth between old enemies) – and a whole new series is under way which will have me hooked. 4. Place Manchester Manchester hasn’t been much on my radar until recently (coming from Shropshire, I always gravitated to Birmingham, before moving much further east). But over the last few weeks, I’ve been making an additional episode for the BBC Civilisations series, Civilisations on Your Doorstep, about the art you can see in the UK. We’ve seen some amazing things in regional museums, but if there’s been one standout city for sheer civic grandeur, it’s Manchester. The great Victorian town hall (currently being given a major makeover) has a sense of intelligent self-confidence to match most of what you’d find in Florence or Venice (including a clever series of paintings by Ford Madox Brown – celebrating, and partly inventing, the city’s history from the Romans to the Bridgewater Canal). 5. Book Damien Hirst: Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable I’m a complete sucker for exhibition catalogues, whether as a memory of those exhibitions I have seen, or as a substitute for those I haven’t. We have shelves of them at home, carefully if slightly nerdishly arranged in chronological order. But I usually have one in residence on my desk for a while, to offer a bit of pleasure between paragraphs of writing. The current occupant is the catalogue of Damien Hirst’s show in Venice last year, which I didn’t see – but even in book form it’s not just beautiful, it’s also a brilliantly clever riff on the whole idea of art objects dragged up from the sea bed (like so many of the most spectacular recent classical finds actually have been!). 6. Gig David Gilmour live at Pompeii It’s probably no surprise that I don’t get to as many gigs as I once did. But a couple of years back, I did go to David Gilmour’s concert in the amphitheatre of Pompeii. It was close to heaven for a classicist who grew up as a Pink Floyd fan: to listen to Comfortably Numb on the seats where the posh people of Pompeii (yes, I was near the front) used to watch the gladiators and wild beasts was a combination of slightly unsettling and unbelievably thrilling. Happily, there’s a DVD for those who weren’t there – or for me, when I feel like recapturing the experience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/apr/10/the-story-behind-william-kennedy-ironweed-pulitzer","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:20:47Z","webTitle":"From a fortune cookie to a Pulitzer: the story behind William Kennedy's Ironweed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/10/the-story-behind-william-kennedy-ironweed-pulitzer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/apr/10/the-story-behind-william-kennedy-ironweed-pulitzer","fields":{"headline":"From a fortune cookie to a Pulitzer: the story behind William Kennedy's Ironweed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the Paris Review interviewed William Kennedy in July 1984, he had just installed a new swimming pool outside his house. Six months earlier, he’d opened a fortune cookie that said he was going to have a lucky week. He’d assumed it was because “I was getting reviewed in about five different major places” – but that wasn’t the half of it. A man (called, pleasingly, Dr Hope) called Kennedy and told him he’d won a MacArthur Fellowship – then $264,000 (these days it is a hefty $625,000). That same year, Kennedy would win the Pulitzer prize for Ironweed, sold the film rights (as well as truck-loads of copies) and received almost universally glowing reviews around the world. Things were suddenly going well for Kennedy, but overnight success had been a long time coming. When Ironweed was published, Kennedy was deep into his 50s. His first two novels had gone out of print. Ironweed, meanwhile, had been rejected by 13 publishers. For years, Kennedy said, he had felt like Joe Btfsplk, a character in a popular 1970s cartoon “who went around with a cloud over his head”. But by the 1980s, Kennedy was well inured to literary hardship; before his first novel was published, he’d had 30-odd short stories rejected by magazines all over America. He later explained that he’d only kept going because a rejection slip from The Atlantic had praised his style. His work ethic was praiseworthy too; he wrote solidly for 12 years, honing his craft with a creative writing teacher in Puerto Rico until, in 1962, his teacher told him he had finally produced something “publishable”. Kennedy’s teacher was Saul Bellow, who later read Ironweed, and, upon hearing that Viking had turned it down, took it upon itself to shame them. (Bellow frightened them so much they also rereleased Kennedy’s first two novels.) Glowing reviews, prizes and the pool followed. Superficially, you could forgive publishers for passing, on the grounds that Ironweed sounds like a hard sell. Kennedy himself suggested as much to the Paris Review: “People had decided it was a depressing book, set in the Depression, about a bum, a loser, a very downbeat subject. Who wants to read a book about bums?” But Kennedy, an admirer of John Steinbeck, knew just how popular “bums” could be, and that his book was about so much more, as he told the Paris Review: “It’s a book about family, about redemption and perseverance, it’s a book about love, faded violence, and any number of things. It’s about the Irish, it’s about the church...” It’s also about us. We aren’t so different from Francis Phelan, give or take a few bad breaks and unlucky decisions. Ironweed shows vividly what it means to live on the fringes. Francis is a haunted man, forced to commune with the ghosts of the victims of his violence and clumsiness; one of these his own baby, dead at 13 days old after Francis dropped him. Add some filth, sexual disgust and bodily collapse and you could almost forgive those publishers for finding Ironweed depressing – if they weren’t so absolutely wrong. Ironweed is almost euphoric from the get go. There is joy and consolation among the horror and tragedy, starting on the very first page when Francis rides through a cemetery on the back of a “rattling old truck” towards his parents’ graves: Francis’ mother twitched nervously in her grave as the truck carried him nearer to her; and Francis’s father lit his pipe, smiled at his wife’s discomfort, and looked out from his own bit of sod to catch a glimpse of how much his son had changed since the train accident. Kennedy gives us light amid the darkness. I’d be tempted to go into extravagant raptures about this golden alchemy, but fortunately a critic called Donald Newlove felt the same way back in the 1980s and described the glow of Ironweed so beautifully I don’t need to: I, for one, enter the heaven of a writer absolutely on top of his material from the first sound of his voice. His load is light, every page. Pure light. And surely he changes our lives, enriches our understanding of the madness of one drunk in a fellowship of rock-bottom boozers during the Great Depression. It’s not just historical understanding he gives us. We become Francis Phelan, a deep-witted walking grave, lighted up with family ghosts like fireflies in twilight. He’s right. It’s wonderful. Kennedy deserved that swimming pool, just as he deserves to be read and admired today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/09/james-de-gale-george-groves-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T16:02:39Z","webTitle":"James DeGale eyes one last crack at George Groves and a chunky pay day| Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/09/james-de-gale-george-groves-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/09/james-de-gale-george-groves-boxing","fields":{"headline":"James DeGale eyes one last crack at George Groves and a chunky pay day","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"James DeGale is one of boxing’s nice guys, endlessly polite and as open as a children’s Christmas book – and he always gives whatever his creaking body can offer in the ring. On Saturday night in Las Vegas, fit-again Chunky became a world champion for the second time, winning an ugly 12-rounder against the 34-year-old American Caleb Truax that extended his career but did little for his box‑office appeal. In nine years as a pro, DeGale has had three British promoters – Frank Warren, Mick Hennessy and Eddie Hearn – and they all made decent if not spectacular money together. Nevertheless, he considered walking away from boxing a couple of years ago because he wasn’t getting the same shine or bucks as some of his rivals, notably George Groves, whom he has never much liked, and Chris Eubank Jr, about whom he cares little. On Saturday night on the undercard of a show that attracted 2,579 fans to the Hard Rock Hotel – normally a venue for fighters who can’t fill the bigger casinos on the Strip – DeGale earned $300,000 (£213,000) for reclaiming his IBF super-middleweight title from a 34-year-old grafter from Minnesota whose best days are way behind him. When Groves fought Eubank in front of 20,000 fans in the Manchester Arena two months ago, in the semi-finals of the World Boxing Super Series, he took home close to £2m. Groves, who edged DeGale in a terrific fight in 2011, was always going to be Chunky’s end-of-career banker. As their careers diverged – Groves fighting Carl Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium, DeGale boxing in considerably more modest surroundings – the possibility of a rematch ebbed and flowed. Now, though, there is no certainty that Groves, still nursing an injured shoulder after beating Eubank, will box again. Groves, who has irritated DeGale to distraction since the days when they shared space at the Dale Youth Club, in the basement of the now fire-gutted Grenfell Tower, has had surgery but the shoulder has responded slowly and he might yet quit the business even before the scheduled WBSS final against the unbeaten Liverpool fighter Callum Smith this summer. DeGale said beforehand he would retire if he lost against Truax, who had taken his title off him in December when the champion was struggling with injury. But on Saturday night he turned in a typically stubborn performance, surviving a bad early cut, a late points deduction that seemed unwarranted and scoring that did him no favours. He was nonetheless upbeat after two judges had him in front 114-113, with the third seeing it 117-110. “Two-and-a-half years I had that belt,” he said of his earlier reign, “and he embarrassed me [in their first fight]. Now I’m ready to go again. Team Chunky, we’re back. I want to be busy. I have a couple years left in this sport.” Steve Bunce, in his inimitable style on the BoxNation couch, described it as “a fight of several halves”. I saw it 115-114. But it was all very low-key. Even the seasoned and reliable Showtime ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr described DeGale as “once again the IBF super-bantamweight champion of the world”. The last time DeGale made 8st 10lb he more than likely was arguing with Groves over sparring slots at the Dale Youth Club. So if Groves were to retire now it would be the ultimate blow for DeGale, who has spent much of his career chasing shadows – many of them cast by his former clubmate. These should be the cash-in years for DeGale, whose slick southpaw boxing has not always been to the liking of boxing’s bloodthirsty tendency. In fact, the fans booed him on his pro debut in Birmingham. They wanted spectacular knockouts. DeGale brought technical excellence. This was his sixth points win in a row. Truax was rugged, slow and crude. DeGale – like his image – was tough to fathom but deep down there was quality. He shares with Billy Joe Saunders a dipping, crab‑like cleverness behind a raking right lead that bamboozles opponents but sometimes doesn’t set the cheap seats on fire. His challenge at the tail-end of his career is to stay fresh, quick and motivated. Truax wants a rematch. That won’t happen. You’d have to be a masochist to watch that again. Perhaps Jamie Cox, who lost his unbeaten record to Groves and fights John Ryder in May after a quick stoppage against Harry Matthews on George’s Manchester undercard, is an option. But the one opponent DeGale wants more than any other, for revenge as much as money, remains tantalisingly out of reach.

Yet young people continue to be drawn into conflicts that end in bloodshed. There is the well-known adage that “insanity is trying the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”, however the visceral nature of violent crime seems to bring about a collective insanity that leads our society to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. I don’t think it’s contested that many of the 50 people killed in attacks in London this year are likely to be linked to gang-related feuds and activity. It is also evident that both victims and perpetrators are often under the age of 18 – still children and understood to be relatively early in terms of human development. The fact that these are young people caught up in gang activity should be key to developing a response that will have a lasting effect. We need to understand them not as violent criminals, or – as so often in the past – feral and intrinsically antisocial beings, but as victims of child criminal exploitation who are subject to levels of coercion and control. Having worked with good and decent young people who have been drawn into a twisted perception of reality by their gang elders – a world of enemies, honour and artificial territorialism that seems utterly alien to those outside the sphere of control – I’ve seen how lost they can become to reason. However hard their parents try to talk sense into them (and I’ve seen them try incredibly hard), gang elders exert far stronger control. Children tell me what they get out of gang life: friendship, support and a way to achieve independence. All reasonable desires that most of us hold. When I ask how people might achieve those things without selling drugs or feuding, it’s really hard for them to find meaningful answers. How do you achieve independence when you’re permanently excluded from school, or stopped by police waiting for you as you return home to your mum’s house in the early hours of the morning (so you’ve taken to sleeping more and more often in the “trap houses” you work in)? What can you do when the gang elders you look up to expect more time and commitment of you than any boss or educator? How can you escape when the things you may have seen or done at such a young age are more than likely to have left you attempting to manage the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder while still being at constant risk of experiencing further trauma? Increasing police presence on our streets doesn’t work. The police have an interest in public protection at almost any cost, and more often than not that comes at the expense of the children doing the bidding of gang elders. I have been in many multi-agency meetings with police, youth‑offending officers and educators in my capacity as a social worker, and have been utterly dismayed at the lack of empathy and understanding of child exploitation exhibited by police officers. This results in officers being eager to punish children rather than protect them from coercion and control. Many of the families of children drawn into gangs have been so scarred by their experience with the police that they no longer trust them. And I don’t think the police have the capacity or the will to engage with this type of crime as a child protection issue. So what could help? A return to community social work is needed. Small pockets of multi-disciplinary social work teams should be located across cities, linked closely to the communities in which they work. Social workers with an understanding of human development, power, coercion and control, who are given the time and space to work closely with communities to provide the support and advocacy they need. The government’s £40m serious violence strategy must increase funding for community projects that are led by the people affected by the issues those projects are seeking to address. Until we understand that knife violence is a child protection issue and not an issue of criminal justice, our children will continue to hurt one another and we will continue to demand the implementation of more punitive measures that don’t work. • Anonymous is a student social worker in a child safeguarding and protection team for a London borough • Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/09/ronda-rousey-wrestlemania-grateful-ufc-defeats","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T16:15:45Z","webTitle":"Ronda Rousey 'grateful' for humbling UFC losses after Wrestlemania debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/09/ronda-rousey-wrestlemania-grateful-ufc-defeats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/09/ronda-rousey-wrestlemania-grateful-ufc-defeats","fields":{"headline":"Ronda Rousey 'grateful' for humbling UFC losses after Wrestlemania debut","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ronda Rousey, the women’s sports trailblazer who became a mainstream phenomenon during a memorable eight-fight run in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, spoke at length about the spectacular end of her mixed martial arts career for the first time on Sunday after claiming victory in a stunning WWE debut at Wrestlemania 34. The 31-year-old became the UFC’s first female champion in 2012 and made six defenses of the women’s bantamweight belt, each inside the distance and all but one inside the first round. But the former Olympic bronze judo medallist suffered a spectacular knockout loss to Holly Holm in 2015, then after a year-long layoff was dominated in her comeback fight against Amanda Nunes. She announced in January she was leaving behind UFC to join World Wrestling Entertainment full-time after more than a year in professional limbo and made her debut with the promotion on Sunday night in New Orleans, where she teamed up to defeat Stephanie McMahon and her partner Triple H in an encounter that thoroughly entertained the 78,133-strong crowd. Afterward, Rousey told ESPN she was happy with her move to WWE and had no regrets about the losses to Holm and Nunes. “It was me versus the world in an individual sport,” Rousey told the network. “I thought I would never say this, but I’m so happy I lost those fights [to Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes] because it led me here. This is so worth it. “Everything really does happen for a reason. I’m just so grateful. I thought I never would be [grateful] for [the losses], but time is a great teacher. I’m just really, really glad I gave it time instead of giving up and feeling it was the end of the world. There’s so many people who encounter tragedies who feel like the world and time won’t heal it. “But all I can say to those people is: Just give it time, even if you think time can’t heal it. You never know what will happen and where it will lead you. Every missed opportunity is a blessing in disguise. I really believe it now.” Fellow former UFC fighter Brock Lesnar rounded off the evening at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome by defeating challenger Roman Reigns to retain his position as universal champion. However, the match was met with jeers from the crowd, as many hoped or expected 40-year-old Lesnar, the longest-reigning universal champion, to lose his title. Lesnar’s victory comes amid speculation that he will be leaving WWE to return to mixed martial arts in the UFC. UFC president Dana White told FOX that Lesnar would be returning to the sport last week. Elsewhere 40-year-old star John Cena was defeated by WWE legend the Undertaker, 53, as the latter came out of retirement to win in less than three minutes. Nia Jax won the Raw women’s title from Alexa Bliss, while AJ Styles claimed the WWE championship from Shinsuke Nakamura. The event set a new record at the stadium in Louisiana, as its highest grossing entertainment event ever, bringing in $14.1m (£10m)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/10/cannes-film-festival-2018-netflix-feud","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:10:36Z","webTitle":"Netflix v Cannes: what the film festival feud means for the future of cinema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/10/cannes-film-festival-2018-netflix-feud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/10/cannes-film-festival-2018-netflix-feud","fields":{"headline":"Netflix v Cannes: what the film festival feud means for the future of cinema","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Cannes film festival boasts some of the noisiest audiences in the world – and if they don’t like your movie, you’ll soon know about it. A few years ago, before they were reupholstered, the seats in the 2,300-capacity Grand Theatre Lumière would automatically flip up, making a booming sound to mark the early exit of disgruntled critics. Booing and jeering are common when the end credits roll. But last year’s festival marked a first: at several screenings, audiences took to hissing and whistling before the movie had even started. The focus of their wrath was the Netflix logo that preceded Bong Joon-ho’s Okja and Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories. It was the first time the streaming platform had been accepted into the main competition and the pushback was immediate. Film purists were already upset by the festival’s embrace of TV series, with Jane Campion’s Top of the Lake and David Lynch’s return to Twin Peaks both given special screenings. But Netflix proved a bridge too far. In France, a film can’t appear on streaming platforms until 36 months after its release in cinemas, but Netflix’s films didn’t get even a token cinema release. There is a rumour that the Cannes protests were orchestrated via a text message sent by French exhibitors. Festival director Thierry Frémaux responded quickly to the fuss, imposing a ban on streaming films in competition from 2018 – a move that prompted Netflix boss Ted Sarandos to comment simply, and darkly, that the company, which is set to invest $8bn in content this year, now found Cannes a “less attractive” prospect. Nearly a year on, Sarandos and the festival seemed to have buried the hatchet, and the reports in the trades are that five Netflix films had actually been accepted by the festival. But Frémaux reopened the wound in March, in a controversial interview with Le Film Francais. As well as revealing his plans to dispense with early morning press screenings and ban selfies on the red carpet, Frémaux slightly rephrased the previous year’s embargo: streaming films, he said, would be welcome in Out of Competition slots. Now it seems likely that Netflix was playing a longer game. This week, in the run-up to the announcement of the festival’s official selection, came news that Netflix was about to withdraw its five titles – a piece of brinksmanship designed to ruffle festival programmers, who famously go to the wire, with Frémaux sometimes making vital decisions in the early hours of the night before the press conference. Netflix has so far not commented on the impasse, or even acknowledged it, but, if true, the withdrawals could blast a big hole in the Cannes lineup. It would mean that Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón will miss out on his Cannes feature debut, for his Mexico-set drama Roma; Paul Greengrass, who has been only once, with his 9/11 film United 93, will not be bringing his new project Norway, the story of white-supremacist killer Anders Breivik; and Cannes regular Jeremy Saulnier will be denied a step up from Directors Fortnight with his new film Hold the Dark, a dark, Alaskan-set thriller starring Alexander Skarsgård. But likely to strike even closer to Frémaux’s heart would be the retraction of Morgan Neville’s Orson Welles documentary They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead, and a restored version of Welles’s unfinished final film The Other Side of the Wind, a once mythical work that Frémaux surely eyed as a highlight of his always impressive Cannes Classics sidebar. With three days to go, anything is still possible, but the tensions between the festival and streaming services will probably not be going away any time soon, especially if Apple moves on its promise to commit $1bn to TV and film production this year. Traditionally, any high-profile film denied a place at Cannes will find a warm welcome at Venice or Toronto. But the suspicion remains that films financed by streaming services are, to use Frémaux’s term, “hybrids”. It’s not unthinkable to suggest that, in time, these digital platforms might yet team up to found their own festival (indeed, France currently has five TV events, from the long-running Monte Carlo television festival to this year’s inaugural Canneseries) and establish the streaming movie as a genre of its own. While Netflix and Cannes are engaged in a cold war, the fight for the future of cinema is warming up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/13/sports-quiz-week-champions-league-grand-national-football-tyson-fury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:50:43Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: Champions League, Tyson Fury and F1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/13/sports-quiz-week-champions-league-grand-national-football-tyson-fury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/13/sports-quiz-week-champions-league-grand-national-football-tyson-fury","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: Champions League, Tyson Fury and F1","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/05/supersonic-flight-concorde-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Supersonic flight: will it ever rise out of the ashes of Concorde?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/05/supersonic-flight-concorde-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/05/supersonic-flight-concorde-crash","fields":{"headline":"Supersonic flight: will it ever rise out of the ashes of Concorde?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"You could tell without looking up that Concorde was on its final approach to Heathrow: its Rolls Royce Olympus turbojets made the same roar on landing as others did taking off. It was a treat just to watch it in flight, and many of us assumed one day that supersonic flight would be the norm, not a novelty. Concorde’s crash just outside Paris on 25 July, 2000 was actually just the symbolic end for the world’s only supersonic airliner. It may have been ahead of its time, but paradoxically it was already out of date and out of touch. Weighed down with political and economic baggage, Concorde was grounded in 2003, which seemed to signify the end of commercial supersonic travel (SST). Maybe Concorde had made us complacent. Just as the Apollo generation assumed we’d have moon bases by now, having SST since the 1960s meant we thought everything could only get sleeker and quicker. Instead, we got bigger and cheaper. Instead of ramjets, we got Ryanair. With a cruising altitude of 19,812 metres (65,000 feet) – nearly twice the height of other airliners – and a speed of 1345.6mph (more than twice the speed of sound) Concorde flew 100 souls higher and faster than modern fighter jets, making the journey from London to New York in just three and a half hours. That this herculean Anglo-French collaboration – between the French state-owned aerospace manufacturer Aerospatiale and its British counterpart BACB – got airborne amid such stern competition from the US and Russia in a cold-war-driven age of one-upmanship is a marvel. The short lived Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 launched in December 1968, stealing Concorde’s thunder by just two months. It was so similar the Anglo-French team suspected espionage. But the sleek exterior concealed a flight deck stuffed with archaic levers and instrumentation. Clearly an exercise in propaganda, the Tu-144 had no practical use: the communist USSR did not tolerate Concorde’s jetset customer base and it had nowhere to fly to. So it became a supersonic workhorse, ferrying mail across the USSR. A fatal crash at the 1973 Paris Air Show ended Russia’s supersonic passenger effort. Boeing’s 2707 was the USA’s attempt, a supersonic behemoth designed to fly some 300 people at mach 3 (over 2,300mph). By flying faster it could make more trips, its designers reckoned, and it would pay off. But, like a later 1990 NASA-led project, the High Speed Civil Transport, it never left the drawing board. Huge technological, environmental and economic hurdles meant that no one – Boeing especially – wanted to build it and, crucially, no one wanted to buy it. Those hurdles are partly why we aren’t blasting supersonically to Sydney and back in time for tea today. Peculiar things happen when you hit the speed of sound. Sound waves and air compress at the nose, creating an aerodynamic barrier that increases wave drag fourfold, and needs a lot of power (and fuel) just to penetrate. And when it does, the shockwave begets the infamous sonic boom. Scientists had known about this since at least 1964, with the notorious Operation Bongo II experiments, in which the US air force conducted a series of supersonic test flights 65,000ft over Oklahoma City, to determine whether the sonic boom would still be audible at ground level. Following 10,000 complaints of broken windows and shattered plaster, nearly every state banned supersonic flights in their airspace, scuppering dreams of an east-west supersonic shuttle. To this day, supersonic flight is banned over land in the US and Europe, and it was years before the US supreme court would even allow Concorde to come in over the Atlantic. There are other flies in the supersonic ointment. Flying this fast superheats the aircraft, so it must be made of special – and expensive – composites such as titanium alloys, or carbide ceramic materials that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C. The faster you go, lift and drag increases, requiring aerodynamic wings, a thinner fuselage, and a much higher cruising height where the air is thin. But the higher you fly the bigger the engines needed to cram in enough air. This means you need a lot of fuel, which ultimately, results in poor range. Even Concorde was only just capable of the transatlantic trip, and it showed SSTs weren’t worth flying on routes shorter than three hours, which cut out a lot of routes. So how did Concorde have the freedom of the skies for 27 years? It helped that British Airways put up with it as a flagship loss-leader until 1980, when two of its pilots took over Concorde and hiked the price to about £8,000 a ticket – to any normal customer base this might have been a suicidal move, but to a luxury market not exactly counting the pennies, the rise didn’t seem to matter. Suddenly, Concorde was “reassuringly expensive’’. Over its lifetime, it made BA profits of about £750m. But the French did not follow suit and was going bust. Eventually they grounded their Concorde, and when legacy firm Airbus announced it was to stop making and servicing the parts, it was the beginning of the end for the British plane too. Air travel had already moved on. The concept of “luxury” travel now meant reclining seats, space and comfort, and suddenly Concorde’s narrow fuselage looked cramped. Recliners and TVs? Forget it. Concorde was an outdated notion of prestige that left sheer speed the only luxury of supersonic travel. Air travel was becoming democratised, something Boeing spotted as early as the 1960s. The future was bigger, not faster, resulting in the Boeing 747. Fifty years later a jumbo can still carry more than three times as many passengers, with the same fuel, as Concorde, and at a fraction of the price. In the tortoise and hare air travel race, the tortoise is winning. But the race isn’t over. New technology has opened up exciting possibilities. Lockheed Martin and Aerion have developed a concept aircraft that can fly at Mach 1.2 with no sonic boom – technology they’ve tested on an F15 fighter jet. The drawback: it can only work on small aircraft, which means Aerion will be a business jet. Not to be discouraged, last year NASA unveiled its new quiet supersonic prototype, called QueSST, which it says is 1,000 times quieter than Concorde (opening up routes over land) and it may be ready to test-fly in 2019. But perhaps the most exciting development is the 55-seater airliner being developed by Virgin and Denver outfit Boom. Its XB-1 two-seater prototype will be tested in late 2018 and should be capable of Mach 2.2, with the eventual airliner forecast to be able to fly customers for the same price as any other business-class seat. It is a tribute to Concorde that it looks similar to the old bird. But new materials and tech allow it to fly faster, further, quieter (and more cheaply) than Concorde. Japan Airlines has already pre-ordered 20 of the aircraft. Which means supersonic aircraft may once again soon be a reality – at least for a select few of us. Now, where have we heard that before?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/10/michael-rosen-chocolate-cake-review-polka-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T09:13:16Z","webTitle":"Michael Rosen's Chocolate Cake review – half-baked sweet treat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/10/michael-rosen-chocolate-cake-review-polka-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/10/michael-rosen-chocolate-cake-review-polka-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Michael Rosen's Chocolate Cake review – half-baked sweet treat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"All kids loves cake but Wilfred, aged four, is mad for it. With a rather serious expression on his face, he tells me that cake is his friend. So he is the ideal person to take to this musical adaptation of Michael Rosen’s classic poem and some scenes in this production – basically, all the ones involving a huge gleaming cake – delight Wilfred. At one point he even drools. But this is a sweet treat and little more: glossy, tempting but ultimately pretty unsatisfying. Sometimes a purely silly piece of theatre can turn out to be really good fun, but it’s hard not to expect more from a show inspired by Rosen’s writing. Rosen shows children every shade of life – dark and gloomy or bright and dazzling. But this lighthearted and lightweight adaptation – co-created by experienced hands Peter Glanville and Barb Jungr – asks too little of its audience. Rosen’s epic children’s poem is essentially about a kid who wakes up in the middle of the night and gobbles down his brother’s chocolate cake. Glanville and Jungr have woven in a few of Rosen’s poems about hot food, fried eggs and baked potatoes, but a cluster of food poems does not add up to a theatrical feast. I hear Wilfred lick his lips during one scene, but he’s watching this play with his belly, not his brain or his heart. Mark Houston, as young Michael, is the perkiest chocolate eater you might hope to encounter, and Aminita Francis is warm and engaging as Mum. The cast sing Jungr’s peppy songs with relish, but how much impact can you make belting out a song about being “full as an egg”? The only character with any real edge is moody older brother Joe, and Todd Heppenstall makes the most of some witty one-liners, particularly when it comes to his doomed, cake-free birthday (“This was meant to be the best day of my life!”). Verity Quinn’s vibrant set is made up of a series of neon frames, which are easily manipulated to create bright new spaces. It fizzes with dramatic potential and comes to life during the night-time scene, as Michael creeps about his home. While it’s fun to see constant images of chocolate throb and spin on a huge screen thanks to animations by Will and Joe, it feels more like watching an iPad than a fully live production. Wilfred is usually inquisitive at the theatre, but he stops asking questions as he sits in his seat, mesmerised but muted. Michael Rosen’s Chocolate Cake is at Polka theatre, London, until 13 May.

Nelson has responded to his advancing years by being ever more prolific, spraying out albums by favourite composers, albums of archive material (Willie’s Stash), and albums of new songs, plus countless guest appearances. This 73rd studio album stands out from the somewhat erratic output, a winning mixture of confessionals, nostalgia and humour, co-written with producer Buddy Cannon. You can rely on Willie to come up with defiant, wisdom-of-age pieces such as Something You Get Through and Bad Breath (“is better than no breath at all”), but there’s also sly wit in the New Orleans shuffle of the title track (“I don’t want to be the last man standing/ Oh wait a minute, maybe I do…”) and Don’t Tell Noah, where Nelson admits he’s “been crazy all the time”. Nelson and Cannon mix up the musical styles, with a brace of cuts that hark back to the ballroom Western Swing of Nelson’s youth.

A recent Guardian investigation found a rise in the numbers being disposed of at birth – 95,000 a year according to the most recent figures – due to the lack of viable markets for bull calves and public apathy towards consuming young beef and British rosé veal. The dairy industry body AHDB said it was working with the National Farmers Union (NFU) to convene a group of stakeholders including retailers and NGOs to work on the issue, but that dairy farmers must not be left to carry the blame. “The bottom line is that we need a market outlet for these calves: if it’s not economic to rear them, farmers won’t. So, as a supply chain, let’s work on solutions rather than playing the blame game. Ultimately the answer lies with consumers in the purchasing decisions they make,” NFU dairy advisor Siân Davies told the Grocer magazine. AHDB said that finding markets for bull calves was a key aim of the industry-led Dairy Cow Welfare Strategy, which started in 2010, but that there was no quick fix. “We will have to wait and see what this stakeholder group can achieve because it is trying to create and influence the market. This is not something that can be done overnight,” an AHDB spokesperson said. The NGO Compassion in World Farming said it was also planning on reconvening a stakeholder group it co-chaired with the RSPCA – and which was disbanded in 2013 – to try to establish what is happening and what needs to be done to help. One issue that it plans to look at is the spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), which limits the markets available for dairy farmers to sell their bull calves. Calves born on farms that have had an incidence of bTB face restrictions about where they can be moved or sold to. One report has estimated 30,000 male calves were being held on TB-restricted farms. The government could help tackle the problem, say producers, by approving more farms able to take calves from those farms that have suffered an incidence of bTB. Sussex-based Rob Drysdale, who runs StraightLine Beef, a business finding markets for male dairy calves, says the biggest issue remains changing public attitudes to buying veal and dairy beef. He works with seven dairy farms across the south-east and south-west of England, and Wales and expects to grow more than 4,000 calves into dairy beef and rosé veal this year. His customers include the Co-op, Sainsbury’s and local restaurants and export markets. “The main barrier is the industry realising we can utilise a range of bull calves and these do have a value, as well as convincing the public to change their habits and buy high-welfare British rosé veal and dairy beef,” he said. The RSPCA has been among those calling for the food industry to be allowed to rename veal as rosé beef to end consumer perception of it as a white meat produced from calves kept in crates and fed milk – a system banned in the UK in the early 1990s. The UK, and indeed the dairy industry itself, is far from alone in having to tackle the problem of what to do with the male offspring of some farming systems, with other sectors under the spotlight including goats’ milk. Both continental Europe and the US currently have a higher consumer demand for veal, but in New Zealand an estimated 40% of male dairy calves are currently disposed of after birth.

The foreign secretary tweeted congratulations to Orbán, who will now serve a third consecutive term as prime minister, having campaigned with his Fidesz party almost exclusively on an anti-migration platform. “Congratulations to Fidesz and Viktor Orbán on winning the elections in Hungary,” Johnson tweeted. “We look forward to working with our Hungarian friends to further develop our close partnership.” Within hours of Johnson’s tweet, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticised the conduct seen during the Hungarian election campaign, saying there was “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing”. The body’s preliminary report found the electoral process was “characterised by a pervasive overlap between state and ruling party resources, undermining contestants’ ability to compete on an equal basis”. It also found “excessive” spending by the Hungarian government on adverts which mirrored much of Orban’s campaign platform had “significantly compromised” a fair contest. Fabian Hamilton, the shadow foreign minister, said the OSCE report was “damning” and Johnson’s congratulations were inappropriate. “It is disgraceful that he has said nothing about the Fidesz government’s shameful record on political freedom, women’s equality and LGBT rights, or Orban’s Islamophobic rhetoric, antisemitic attacks on George Soros, and blatantly racist remarks about the diverse nature of other European countries,” Hamilton said. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Jo Swinson, the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, said Johnson had “embarrassed the government by congratulating Viktor Orbán on his controversial election victory the same day that the OSCE criticised the fairness of the election”. “We would expect the foreign secretary to take these allegations more seriously and work with colleagues across Europe to investigate whether the election in Hungary was fair,” she said. Several anti-Brexit politicians also criticised Johnson’s swiftness to praise Orbán’s victory. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary who now fronts the pro-remain Best for Britain campaign, said it was a “deeply inappropriate statement”. “Viktor Orbán is a dangerous man, whose antisemitism and Putin worship is a threat to democracies all over Europe,” he said. “The best message he could send is to say we’re staying in the EU and, alongside out European friends, will stand up to Orbán’s authoritarianism.” The Labour MP Peter Kyle, a supporter of the pro-single market Open Britain campaign, said: “It seems there’s not a single authoritarian leader Boris Johnson won’t pander to in pursuit of his hard Brexit fantasy. Viktor Orbán in Hungary is just the latest. “This is all eerily reminiscent of the Boris Johnson’s shameless sucking up to Donald Trump. It demeans our country and it’s not worthy of his position as foreign secretary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/09/russian-firms-and-rouble-hit-heavily-by-trump-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T16:19:48Z","webTitle":"Russian firms and rouble hit heavily by Trump sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/russian-firms-and-rouble-hit-heavily-by-trump-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/09/russian-firms-and-rouble-hit-heavily-by-trump-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"Russian firms and rouble hit heavily by Trump sanctions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Trump administration’s new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and top government officials began to bite on Monday as the rouble suffered its biggest daily fall in more than three years, the main Russian stock index slumped and investors dumped shares in businesses controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Russia’s currency briefly dipped more than 4% before recovering slightly to trade at 60.42 to the dollar on Monday evening, down 3.8%, its biggest daily percentage fall since January 2015. The value of Deripaska’s aluminium producer Rusal halved in Hong Kong and more than 40% was wiped off the value of his London-listed EN+ as investors took fright at the potential impact. Shares in Rusal and EN+ had already fallen sharply on Friday in response to the sanctions, which were announced towards the end of trading in London. The Russian stock market also fell heavily. The main RTS index dropped 11%, affecting companies not caught by the sanctions. The price of aluminium jumped as traders worried Rusal would be excluded from supplying the market. The firm, which produces almost 6% of the world’s aluminium, said the sanctions could cause technical defaults on bank loans and some credit obligations. Both Rusal and EN+, Deripaska’s holding company, said the sanctions could be “materially adverse to the business and prospects” of the companies. Rusal and seven other companies linked to Deripaska were the main targets when the US imposed sanctions designed to punish Vladimir Putin’s inner circle for “malign activity”, including support for Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria and interfering with the US election in 2016. Rusal sells more than 10% of its aluminium to the US. The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in US jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. By making it virtually impossible for Deripaska’s businesses to trade in US dollars, the measures threaten the empire of one of Putin’s closest allies. The sanctions could also threaten a tentative revival in Russia’s economy, which had only just started to recover from those imposed in response to its annexation of Crimea in 2014. The latest sanctions affected companies such as Sberbank, whose shares fell 17% in Moscow. The state-controlled bank is seen as a barometer for the wider Russian economy. Evraz, the steel company controlled by the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, dropping almost 15%. Polymetal, a Russian miner listed in London, was the biggest FTSE 250 faller, down 18%. Concerns also spread to Glencore, the FTSE 100-listed mining and energy giant. Glencore is one of Rusal’s biggest investors and buyers of its aluminium, and its chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, sits on the Rusal board. Glencore shares fell 3.4% to a four-month low. EN+ said its annual report might be delayed and that its independent director, Dominique Fraisse, had quit on Friday after less than four months in the job. The company floated its shares in London in November, raising $1bn (£710m), despite concerns that it could face sanctions related to Deripaska’s ties to Putin. Deripaska, whose wealth Forbes magazine estimates at $6.7bn, meets Putin regularly and has said his own interests cannot be separated from those of the Russian state. He features in Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the US election because of his ties to Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman. Russia’s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, told his government to draw up possible retaliatory steps. He said the new US sanctions were unacceptable and illegitimate, and that the government would come up with plans to support the companies affected. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was watching events on the markets closely but that an assessment of the impact of the sanctions would take time. “The situation is pretty egregious from the point of view of legality, it tramples on all kinds of norms, and so a thorough analysis is necessary,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/09/police-cuts-violent-crime-amber-rudd","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T17:20:49Z","webTitle":"Police cuts lead to violent crime.

So why won’t Amber Rudd admit it?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We’re entering the pity stage of government: you hear a minister, called to account for a crisis 10 years in the making, trotting out lines devised by David Cameron in the earliest days of austerity, before throwing some last-minute shade on Jeremy Corbyn for his voting record. You reach for something familiar, like outrage, and come back with nothing but shuffling commiseration. Who’d be Amber Rudd at a time like this? The streets of London and Manchester gather flower-shrines to dead teenagers, carnations becoming the symbol of brutal futility as the poppy is of remembrance. The Home Office’s own report finds that “resources dedicated to serious violence have come under pressure and charge rates have dropped”; and that while this is not the “main driver”, it has “likely contributed”. The home secretary has not seen the report, despite having commissioned it. “You cannot arrest your way out of it,” she told Martha Kearney on the Today programme, as if arresting criminals and charging them were a tired old response that those in the know had long given up on. Of the country’s 44 police forces, 38 have reported a rise in knife crime. Victor Olisa, the head of policing in Tottenham, told this paper that “it appears … as though the police have lost control of public spaces and the streets”. But “forces with the biggest cuts have not seen the biggest rise in crime”, Rudd rejoined, as though in the absence of absolute correlation we should give up looking for links between police and crime altogether. The interview was particularly weak, underpinned as it was by an inconvenient report and a soup of obfuscation and babbling. “There are many different views that people have, which is why I commissioned this report,” Rudd said, because as we all know, when many people have a lot of views, those must simply be put in one place and ignored. Yet her arguments were broadly familiar. This situation is very “new and complex”; old ways of comprehending the world – where you consider a new circumstance in the light of other things, such as government policy, that may have changed around it – are no longer reliable. Worse, you “do families a disservice” when you make those connections, since you ignore the real causes that nobody can possibly know, and you bring in politics, which is the last thing a decent, bereaved family would want to think about. Whether it’s Theresa May dismissing the nurse who has to use a food bank for “many complex reasons” or Liz Truss rejecting calls to reduce the prison population in the wake of suicides as a “quick fix”, this is all part of a necessary fiction in a world of fiscal contraction. Either you admit that spending less money has tragic consequences, or you reject the idea of cause and effect altogether, creating in its place a society so murky and fast-moving that nobody can truly say what’s going on. Where an obvious excuse can be called upon – social media, legal highs – you point to that. There is no shortage of people in government who ascribe the rise in violence to WhatsApp or the dark web. Where no such novelty exists, they fall back on modernity itself as inherently incomprehensible. The pathetic fearfulness of our current political discourse, in which everything was better the way it was, and any change is fraught with danger, is an unintended consequence of the frame the Conservatives created to shift the glare away from their own policy making. Violent death is not a new phenomenon. Google and YouTube did not create gang culture, or toxic masculinity. For every large, amorphous influence that may be blamed but is too unwieldy to counter, there is another, more proximal driver that is eminently possible to count. According to the emergency services watchdog, the police will have £700m less by 2020, by which time officer numbers will have fallen to 120,217. Spending on youth services fell by 50% between 2010 and 2017. Child and adolescent mental health services are also in crisis, “almost entirely a symptom of under-resourcing”, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Schools are seeing a surge in mental health problems among pupils, and haven’t the resources to cope. Every violent event has its own complexity of course: how can anyone guess at which intervention, youth centre, community police officer, teacher or opportunity would have made the difference between a person carrying or using a knife and not? Yet we know these services are valuable, because we can see what the streets look like without them. Complexity is always more interesting than simplicity. To hear a criminologist who has looked at challenges in granular detail and has thought creatively about how to meet them is fascinating, in a way that graphs of police numbers are not. At a conference celebrating 50 years of the Parole Board last year, Jackie Craissati, a forensic psychologist described how, since so many homicides resulted from bungled burglaries, significant gains could be made by teaching burglars how to avoid confrontation. The idea had vivacity, counter-intuitiveness and that thrill of invention, that maybe, with a new perspective, everything could be different. Policing changes, the nature of crime changes, approaches change, situations arise for which traditional solutions are insufficient, and all of that is more diverting than to talk incessantly about the immutable, tedious truths of human society: that when people are neglected by the institutions around them, alienation and lawlessness result. Yet the talk is a diversion, and some simplicity must be restored to the analysis if it’s to be meaningful. Sympathetic, responsive policing cannot be done on the cheap. Young people cannot indefinitely go on paying for the financial crisis with their support services and, ultimately, their lives. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/15/laura-veirs-the-lookout-album-review-phil-mongredien","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"Laura Veirs: The Lookout review – deeply moving and satisfying","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/laura-veirs-the-lookout-album-review-phil-mongredien","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/15/laura-veirs-the-lookout-album-review-phil-mongredien","fields":{"headline":"Laura Veirs: The Lookout review – deeply moving and satisfying","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It may have been five years since her last album, 2013’s Warp and Weft, but Oregon-based singer-songwriter Laura Veirs has not been idle.

The workforce analytics company Visier said American women earned 79 cents for every $1 a man earned in 2017, compared with 81 cents in 2015. “Employers are not making collective progress towards achieving gender pay equity,” the Visier said, in a report published on Equal Pay Day. Visier used anonymized company data for the last three years to examine pay and performance for more than 1.5 million American workers across 60 companies. Visier said the companies represent a wide array of industries. At the same time that the gender wage gap increased, Visier found women were more likely to outperform their male colleagues in performance ratings. In 2017, women were 21% more likely to be rated as a top performer, compared with 12% more likely in 2015. Visier said one of the most likely causes of the gender pay disparity is the number of women in management. In 2017, 18% of men held management positions, compared with 12% of women. “Given managers on average earn two times the salaries of non-managers, this gap contributes significantly to the overall gender wage gap,” the report said. The report recommended companies examines their female headcount, hiring practices, performance ratings and promotion practices to help close the gap. Since the 1960s, the pay gap has narrowed in the US, but progress in the last couple of decades has slowed. All UK companies with more than 250 employees had to report details of the gap between the median hourly rate paid to male and female staff by midnight on Wednesday last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/11/the-palaeontology-of-rocks-clocks-and-zombie-lineages","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T07:30:04Z","webTitle":"Rocks, clocks, and zombie lineages | Elsa Panciroli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/11/the-palaeontology-of-rocks-clocks-and-zombie-lineages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/11/the-palaeontology-of-rocks-clocks-and-zombie-lineages","fields":{"headline":"The palaeontology of rocks, clocks and zombie lineages","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We can now extract DNA from pretty much anything. If US crime series are anything to go by (they are not), sequencing it only takes an afternoon at a desktop computer, and an expression of determination. DNA can not only help identify murderers, but tell us how animal groups are related to one another. In the last 50 years it has transformed scientific understanding of family trees and the evolution of life on earth. With such technology at our fingertips, you may be left wondering: when it comes to understanding evolution, do we still need palaeontology? If I want to know if a hedgehog is more closely related to a shrew or a mole, I can just DNA test them, can’t I? It’s a natural assumption that genetics beats comparative anatomy in the game of science top trumps. The image of palaeontology as dominated by foosty old white men rummaging in museum cupboards – or monumentally bearded ones wielding rock-hammers in the Badlands – may still be pervasive, but is far from an accurate reflection of modern palaeontological practice. Thankfully, you are now as likely to have a background in computer programming or developmental biology, as in anatomy. Some of the greatest advances are being made by those who integrate the tools and techniques of multiple strands of science, engineering and computing into their research. Before the science of genetics, animal relationships were worked out based solely on the intricacies of their anatomy. Natural scientists observed that you could identify and classify living things using even the smallest anatomical details, allowing great minds such as Sir Richard Owen to identify animals from only single teeth. In the last sixty years, our understanding of genes and molecules and their role in heredity, has added a new set of tools for scientists to trace animal lineages – using the ‘molecular clock’. Professor Philip Donoghue, a molecular palaeobiologist from the University of Bristol, explained: “genetic differences arise as a consequence of copy errors, and they accrue over time. The number of differences in the same gene from different species is a factor of how much time has elapsed since those species last shared a common ancestor.” While a fossils tells us when an animal lived by the age of the rocks it is found in, it’s hard to know exactly when animal groups emerged from fossil evidence alone. “The molecular clock helps to narrow this range of uncertainty by estimating the rate at which genetic differences arise.” The resulting trees combining molecules and fossils are called phylogenetic trees. Molecular biology undeniably transformed our understanding of evolution, but in the early days it led to a split among palaeontologists and biologists over how to reconstruct the tree of life. Should they still rely on the rocks, or switch to the clocks? A recent paper reminds us that it shouldn’t be either/or – the best science combines the best of both worlds. Most of us are familiar with hedgehogs. These little mammals are found across Europe, Asia and Africa, and are readily distinguishable by their body covering of spines. They are related to the equally familiar shrews and moles in a family called Eulipotyphla. But far fewer people are familiar with the other member of this group: the solenodon. Solenodons are found on the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. Once thought extinct, they were rediscovered a decade ago, and still teeter on the red list. Their name may sound like a prehistoric reptile, but they are actually small nocturnal mammals – and as mammals go, they are some of the weirdest. Solenodons superficially resemble big shrews, around 30 cm in length. The nose of the Hispaniolan solenodon is not only long and pointed, but has a unique ball and socket joint at its base, giving it elephant-like flexibility. A groove in their bottom incisor teeth gives these feisty little animals a venomous bite – one of only a handful of mammals with this adaptation. They hunt by hearing and smell, eating insects, small reptiles, amphibians, and carrion. Solenodons are unique among modern mammals, but the fossil record suggests they would have fitted right into the Mesozoic world, over 66mya. While all mammals have ancestors reaching to the Triassic and beyond, most mammal groups have changed a great deal since the non-avian dinosaurs and marine and flying reptiles bit the asteroid dust at the end of the Cretaceous. Solenodons on the other hand, have held on to the winning body plan and venomous bite of their ancestors. This gives us a unique peek at what early mammals may have looked like. The lineage of this singular animal confused scientists for decades. Multiple studies of solenodon genes in the last 15 years have helped figure things out: solenodons are the sister group of all of the other eulipotyphlans. Estimates suggest they split from the rest of the family in the Late Cretaceous, between 69 and 78 million years ago. This left scientists with a likely explanation for how the first solenodon ancestors reached their island homes: in the Cretaceous the land was connected to North America, making it possible for them to have lived there before tectonic movements carried them away from the mainland. But a paper in 2016 found an altogether different pattern in the eulipotyphlan tree. Sato and colleagues performed an analysis that found solenodons had only diverged from their common ancestor with hedgehogs, shrews and moles after the Cretaceous, just 58mya. This meant solenodons would have had to cross the Caribbean Sea to reach the Antilles. But more puzzling still, rather than a clear split from the rest of their relatives, Sato and colleagues’ research suggested all the major families in Eulipotyphla had split at the same time, leaving no clear pattern to their family relationships. This situation is called a polytomy by scientists. It is considered highly unlikely to reflect real evolutionary relationships, instead usually resulting from problems with analysis or a lack of data. So how did this team of scientists get such radically different results from everyone else? A recent paper led by Professor Mark Springer at the University of California, took this 2016 study and re-ran it to find out. The answer was zombies. Springer explained that the first team’s results were “in direct conflict with the fossil record. For example, the oldest ‘hedgehog’ fossils at around 62 million years are several million years older than Sato et al’s estimate for the common ancestor of hedgehogs, moles, shrews, and solenodons. We refer to these discrepancies, where estimated ages are younger than minimum ages implied by the fossil record, as zombie lineages.” In Sato’s study, the 58myo date for the split of Eulipotyphla was younger than the oldest fossil of the hedgehog ancestor, Litolestes ignotus. “We observed several more zombie lineages,” Springer continued, “such as an estimated date for rodents to treeshrews of only around 36 million years, even though the fossil record mandates a minimum age of at least 61 million years.” Springer’s team set about re-analysing the data. By adding the dates for the earliest fossils for hedgehogs, shrews, carnivorans and rodents, they were able to calibrate the previous analysis, rooting it in the fossil record. Doing this brought Sato’s analysis into agreement with previous studies of these groups, and placed the solenodon split back in the Late Cretaceous, where it seems likely to belong. “This Cretaceous date is compatible with a plate tectonic origin for the presence of solenodons in the Greater Antilles,” says Springer. Although he cautions that it doesn’t rule out the possibility that solenodons crossed the sea at some point. The combination of the data provided by molecules, and the solid evidence of fossils, not only gives us the most reliable results for our understanding of evolutionary relationships, but shows how palaeontology remains a vital discipline. While the separation between palaeontology and other sciences like molecular biology is maintained in common stereotype, it is seldom the reality. “The molecular phylogenetic revolution has had a massive impact on our understanding of animal evolution,” says Professor Donoghue “however, it never fails to surprise me how much of our understanding of animal phylogeny, based on the hierarchical similarities in the comparative anatomy of living and fossil beasties, has simply been confirmed by molecular data.” Theodosius Dobzhansky, one of the 20th century’s greatest evolutionary biologists, once said that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. Professor Springer added: “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees provide a foundation for diverse areas of research in biology including genomics, ecology, and conservation genetics.” So what questions remain unanswered in the study of animal evolution? I asked Professor Donogue – “many of the old unresolved controversies are no less controversial now, even with whole genome data,” he replied. “Like how are bats related to other mammals? And who has the faintest idea about the high-level relationships among teleost fish – even though we eat them regularly with chips?” References Donoghue PC and Benton MJ. 2007.

Top stories Land clearing in Queensland is 15 times more destructive to the state’s koala populations than urban sprawl, analysis by WWF has found. The loss of koala habitat for housing and infrastructure was considered a key reason the koala was added to the “vulnerable” species list in 2012. But the analysis by the conservation scientist Martin Taylor has challenged the idea that the state’s koala populations are most at threat by the growth of Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. Taylor concludes that of more than 5,000 estimated koala deaths owk g to loss of habitat in Queensland from 2012 to 2016, almost 94% occurred outside the heavily developed south-east. Queensland is in the middle of heated debate about new tree-clearing laws. The Palaszczuk government has tabled a bill to restore many of the restrictions that were removed by the Newman government in 2013. Taylor said once-thriving populations of koalas in the south-east corridor had “collapsed” over several decades. But he said the scale of that threat to koalas was now dwarfed by the clearing of agricultural land. The multicultural affairs minister, Alan Tudge, has criticised Barnaby Joyce’s foray into the Coalition’s simmering leadership debate as the government recorded its 80th consecutive loss in the Guardian Essential poll. Speaking on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program, Tudge was critical of Joyce’s comment earlier on Monday that Turnbull would need to consider a leadership transition if his performance did not improve by Christmas. “I don’t think it was a particularly useful contribution from Barnaby this afternoon,” Tudge said. The conservatives Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton both used Monday’s negative Newspoll milestone as a trigger to express interest in the top job. Donald Trump has condemned the “heinous” chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, and said he would decide within 24 to 48 hours whether to launch military reprisals against Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. “We cannot allow atrocities like that,” the US president said. He had “not much doubt” about who was behind the poison gas attack in Douma that killed more than 48 people and affected hundreds more. The UN security council was due to meet on Monday afternoon in New York, where the US and its allies were expected to accuse Moscow of covertly endorsing the Syrian government’s repeated use of chemical weapons against civilians. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg will defend the social platform as a “positive force in the world” when he addresses Congress on Tuesday, while admitting he made a “big mistake” in not doing enough to protect users’ privacy. “Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company,” Zuckerberg’s statement reads. “But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.” In two days of hearings, Zuckerberg will be grilled over the company’s privacy policies in the wake of revelations that Cambridge Analytica had access to data on 87 million of its users. Bill Cosby faced a topless protester on the first day of his sexual assault retrial, after the first trial collapsed in June last year when the jury failed to reach a verdict. The TV comic faces three charges of aggravated indecent assault in a Pennsylvania court, where he was seemed startled by protesters who brandished placards saying “Take rape seriously” and “Justice for survivors”. Cosby’s case is likely to be remembered as the first major celebrity trial of the #MeToo era.

Cricket Australia is preparing for its most decisive week in years as it scrambles to get bidders to the table for the next six-year television rights package.

The Barkandji are “the people of the river” and it has sustained them for thousands of years, but the river is now in crisis, they say.

Six months ago Timothy Disken lay in a coma in Canada, with doctors unsure whether he would survive emergency brain surgery.

While the jobs boom has slowed slightly from its peak this year, there are a lot of figures to cheer about. Employment and hours worked are up, vacancies in the private sector are growing and the vacancy rate is higher even than in the mining boom years. But this is a changing economy, writes Greg Jericho. While growth in jobs for professionals continues apace, the news if you’re a labourer, salesperson or community and personal service worker is not so good. What’s he done now?

A sixth ranger was injured in the attack on Monday that took place in the central section of the vast reserve, known globally for its population of rare mountain gorillas. The loss of life was the worst in the history of the national park, where more than 170 rangers have died protecting animals over the last 20 years. The rising toll has earned the park a reputation as one of the most dangerous conservation projects in the world. Last August, five rangers were killed when local militia attacked their post in the northern part of the park on the shores of Lake Edward. A statement from Virunga described “deep sadness” following the ambush. “We are profoundly saddened by the loss of our colleagues. Virunga has lost some extraordinarily brave rangers who were deeply committed to working in service of their communities. It is unacceptable that Virunga’s rangers continue to pay the highest price in defence of our common heritage,” said Emmanuel de Merode, the chief warden. Virunga national park is located in DRC’s unstable North Kivu province. It covers 7,800 square kilometres (3,011 miles)Multiple threats face Virunga, home to one of the world’s largest populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas as well as hundreds of other rare species. There are armed rebel groups, local bandits and self-defence “Mai Mai” militia, and poachers. There is also a hugely lucrative charcoal industry, for which the trees of the park are the principal raw material. Officials at the park say they believe the attack was by Mai Mai. In recent months DRC has veered close to a plunge back into the appalling violence of the 1997-2003 civil war, which led to the deaths of 5 million and a significant loss of wildlife in the national park, Africa’s oldest. Observers hope catastrophe will be avoided but aid agencies describe DRC as “on a cliff edge”. The rangers are recruited from villages surrounding the park. Most are married with many children. All those who died on Monday were aged between 22 and 30.Virunga, founded in 1925 by Belgian colonial authorities, struggled in the immediate aftermath of the country’s independence in 1960 but flourished under president Mobutu Sese Seko, the flamboyant, wasteful and authoritarian ruler who took power in 1965. The park suffered during the civil war which followed Mobutu’s chaotic fall in 1997 after ruling the country for 31 years. Virunga’s mountain gorilla population sank to 300. In 2007 a partnership was established between a charity funded by private donors, the European Union, the Howard G Buffett foundation and the Congolese wildlife service. De Merode, a Belgian aristocrat, took charge and implemented wide-ranging reforms. The rangers are now paid a monthly salary of $250, a sizeable sum locally. Initiatives have focused on local communities, with micro loans and hydroelectric power projects to boost the local economy. The mountain gorilla population now stands at more than 1,000, while the numbers of other animals, such as forest elephants, is also rising, and tourists are returning in significant numbers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/09/mays-frictionless-eu-trade-plan-after-brexit-dealt-blow-by-key-ally","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T18:37:41Z","webTitle":"May's post-Brexit trade plan with EU dealt blow by key ally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/09/mays-frictionless-eu-trade-plan-after-brexit-dealt-blow-by-key-ally","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/09/mays-frictionless-eu-trade-plan-after-brexit-dealt-blow-by-key-ally","fields":{"headline":"May's post-Brexit trade plan with EU dealt blow by key ally","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May’s plans for a Brexit deal that delivers frictionless trade with the EU have been dealt a blow by a key European ally who has said there will be more bureaucracy after leaving the bloc. The Danish prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said after talks with his UK counterpart in Copenhagen that there would be an inevitable price to pay for Britain leaving the single market. Following a bilateral meeting with May, he told reporters at a joint press conference: “We should avoid too many changes in our relations and I am totally in favour of an enhanced trade agreement between the EU and UK. “I hope if there’s willingness … we will close a deal which will be as close to what we know now as possible. But we have to be realistic and we have to realise that there will be changes. Leaving the single market comes with a price tag and unfortunately the price tag is also a Danish price tag. “That is the reality of life. There will be more bureaucracy in future, unfortunately.” The European council president, Donald Tusk, has already told the UK that it should not expect frictionless trade outside the single market. “Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit,” he said in March. Rasmussen, whose country is generally regarded as sympathetic toward the UK having also joined the EU in 1973, insisted Brussels was simply aiming to be “realistic and fair” in the negotiations. May also signalled that the government’s goal of cutting net annual immigration to below 100,000 would remain in place after Brexit. She said: “We recognise the concern that people in the UK have about this issue of net migration into the UK, which is why we set ourselves the target … and want to continue to work to ensure that we address that particular target.” Her position was in stark contrast to that of her home secretary, Amber Rudd, who repeatedly refused to confirm to the Commons home affairs committee last month that she was aiming to meet the target by the next election. The two leaders also discussed fishing rights, and May promised that Denmark, whose boats regularly fish in British waters, would get “fair and reciprocal access” after Brexit. Britain is braced for tough negotiations with Brussels after delaying the decision over who will control and have access to its territorial waters. The government is also facing calls at home from an increasingly belligerent fishing industry to restrict the number of foreign boats. May, who backed remaining in the EU, again refused to say whether she had changed her mind about Brexit when challenged by a Danish journalist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-open-university-issues-not-just-personalities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T17:39:35Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Open University: issues, not just personalities | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-open-university-issues-not-just-personalities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-open-university-issues-not-just-personalities","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Open University: issues, not just personalities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Open University, one of the great successes of modern Britain, is facing a crisis. On the surface, this centres on the embattled vice-chancellor, Peter Horrocks, whom the staff want to resign. The UCU branch at the university has passed a motion of no confidence in him, and says he no longer commands the respect of staff. The immediate cause was a remark for which he has been forced to apologise, to the effect that some academics had been allowed “to get away with not teaching for decades”, but this came in a context of brutal budget cuts he has proposed. The Open University runs on idealism and voluntary effort more than most institutions do. If the leader cannot harness those qualities, he has failed and should go. More profoundly, the crisis exposes a huge disagreement about what actually constitutes teaching, and why it is a worthwhile activity. Is it a way to produce exam results and certificates of employability, or is the purpose to share whatever makes a subject worth studying for itself, and to inculcate the skills that will enable students to glimpse and pursue that vision? But the deeper crisis reaches far beyond the vice-chancellor’s inadequacies. It will not be solved if he goes only to be replaced by another figure spouting “management Horrocks”. Some of the challenges facing the university are simply a result of the huge changes in society and technology since it was founded in 1969. In the early days, staff agonised over whether to include colour in their television programmes, since many viewers might still own black and white sets. In those days, too, there was a very large pool of middle-aged people who had been denied tertiary education, and for whom this really was the university of the second chance. But the pool of second chancers has now largely gone the way of black and white televisions. Those are difficulties that would face the university under any administration. So would the widespread competition in the field of distance learning. But with all that said, it is central government that is largely responsible for the difficulties of the OU. The government’s conception of higher education as a marketplace where students can shop for qualifications is profoundly destructive to all universities, and the OU is only the most exposed and vulnerable. The introduction, and then the tripling, of tuition fees has wrecked its financial model, so that student numbers have dropped by a third since 2010. The only thing to fall as fast has been the university’s rating for student satisfaction, from 1st to 47th. So much for the conception of universities as selling to “customers”, rather than teaching students. The university is an institution that enriches the lives of those who attend it. It is on that basis that the government should still recognise, and support, the ideal that everyone deserves access to the benefits of a real university, whatever their past, and whenever they decide they need it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/09/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-testimony-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T17:05:02Z","webTitle":"Zuckerberg's testimony: CEO will defend Facebook as 'positive force'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-testimony-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/09/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-testimony-congress","fields":{"headline":"Zuckerberg's testimony: CEO will defend Facebook as 'positive force'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg will defend the social platform as a “positive force in the world” when he addresses Congress on Tuesday while admitting he made “a big mistake” by not taking seriously the social network’s responsibility to its two billion users. Zuckerberg, facing a firestorm of criticism over Facebook’s cavalier attitude to its users data, released his prepared written remarks on Monday, ahead of two appearances before Congress this week when lawmakers will quiz him about a range of failings including the privacy scandal involving political consultant Cambridge Analytica and Russian use of the platform ahead of the US election. “Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company,” his statement reads. “But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy. We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.” In two days of hearings, Zuckerberg will be grilled over the company’s privacy policies in the wake of revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm associated with Donald Trump’s election campaign, had access to data on 87 million of its users. Zuckerberg and Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the Cambridge Analytica story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper in the UK, and have already made many of the points addressed in his speech. The news has led to calls for greater regulation on both sides of the Atlantic and for users to delete their accounts. Zuckerberg’s prepared remarks mix a defence of his view of Facebook’s positive role in the wider body politic with a pledge to take more action to defend users’ privacy. “As Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool to stay connected to the people they love, make their voices heard, and build communities and businesses. Just recently, we’ve seen the #MeToo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, at least in part, on Facebook. After Hurricane Harvey, people raised more than $20m for relief. And more than 70m small businesses now use Facebook to grow and create jobs,” the statement reads. “But it’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.” Cambridge Analytica was able to siphon off huge amounts of personal data from Facebook users by using a quiz that allowed it to gain access to the data of friends of people who took the quiz despite the fact that they had no knowledge that their information was being accessed. On Sunday, Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, told NBC’s Meet the Press that Steve Bannon, co-founder and former Trump adviser, “absolutely wanted to use [the data] for Republican candidates ... [and] alt-right candidates in the United States.” Zuckerberg will outline his plan to prevent similar occurrences in the future, including: Preventing other companies from accessing Facebook users’ data without their knowledge. Removing developers’ access to data if the user has not used that app in three months. And reducing the data given to an app to the user’s name, profile photo and email address. Zuckerberg will also concede that the company was “too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we’re working hard to get better. Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly,” he writes before admitting that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) – a Russian agency that attempted to manipulate people in the US, Europe and Russia ahead of elections. Facebook now has about 15,000 people working on security and content review and will have more than 20,000 by the end of this year.

It was 1947. The Second World War had only recently ended. Nuytten’s dad had scored a job at Boeing, and the firm’s office in Vancouver Harbour was just a short walk away from the family home. Every now and then Nuytten would waltz down to the harbour unaccompanied, sneak out to the end of the docks, peer through the cracks and fall hopelessly in love with what he saw: fish, anemones, a teeming underworld. “I used to think: ‘Gosh, wouldn’t it be wonderful to go down there?’” he says. “To go down to that particular place?” Nuytten and I are sitting in his office, a wood-clad two-storey workshop on an industrial section of the North Vancouver shoreline not far from where he grew up. He is in his 70s now, scrupulously groomed and graciously quick-witted, with an old-time mariner’s flair for storytelling. He is also believed to be one of the world’s leading deep-ocean explorers. During a six-decade career he has pioneered diving techniques that are now industry standard, designed underwater machinery that has become a staple of several navies, and recorded world-first dives. He has studied oil fields, surveyed dams, toured submarine construction sites and explored sunken wrecks. His firm, Nuytco Research, boasts a client list that includes the BBC, Greenpeace and film director James Cameron – Nuytten provided ideas and apparatus for The Abyss and Titanic and the pair remain friends. Nuytten also develops equipment for Nasa and, because the seabed is in some ways analogous to the surface of Mars, trains astronauts. Nuytten never went to college. He is almost entirely self-taught, yet the impact he’s had on ocean exploration has been vast. Now Nuytten is about to embark on a project likely to become his showpiece: a vast underwater colony, decades in development, that will provide humanity with an escape hatch should things go to pot above ground. Work will begin on a prototype later this year. A larger colony will follow soon after. So long as everything goes to plan, hundreds and then thousands of people will begin to migrate to the sea floor, to play out their lives at the bottom of the ocean in much the same way they would have done above ground. Before long, many more will follow. Whether or not everything will go to plan is difficult to judge. “It’s a harsh environment,” James McFarlane of International Submarine Engineering tells me. “You’ve got salt water, corrosion… And when you get into the water things start to get expensive fairly rapidly.” Still, Nuytten is determined. He has given his entire life to developing methods that allow humans to spend inhuman amounts of time underwater, often at unimaginable depths. Now he’s in the final throes of a mission to move us all down there – and once we’re there, he doesn’t think we’ll ever want to come back up. “I have this wonderful picture in my mind,” he says. “A little kid is sitting on his dad’s knee, just as I used to do, and he points to the ceiling of this habitat and says: ‘Dad, is it true people used to live up there?’” The idea the human race might one day live at the bottom of the ocean is not new – underwater habitats have been popping up in shallow waters since the early 1960s. In 1962 a French duo, Albert Falco and Claude Wesly, spent a week inside a minuscule habitat designed in part by the French explorer Jacques Cousteau. It sat 33ft below the surface on the sea floor close to Marseille and looked like a watery space station. The following year Cousteau convinced a five-person team to live for a month beneath the Red Sea, off the coast of Sudan. Two years later he developed a third base, Conshelf III, which he anchored more than 300ft below the surface off the coast near Nice. A six-person team lived there for three weeks. Every day they left the base to work on a mock-up oil rig. It was hoped inhabitants would perform similar work in the future, by which point the rig would be real. Before long, additional habitats materialised off the coasts of Bermuda, California and Germany. Bases were funded by governments, wealthy patrons or the petrochemical industry, and there was huge academic optimism. Here was an opportunity for scientists better to study the ocean’s inky depths, aquanauts to study human anatomy, energy companies to discover alternate resource streams and divers to launch record-breaking descents. “In the 60s everybody in the ocean business firmly believed there would be cities under the sea in fairly short order,” Nuytten says. “Never happened.” By the end of the decade the race to colonise the bottom of the ocean slowed to a trot, then all but petered out. The habitats were expensive to build and even more expensive to run. The lack of natural light could send tenants loopy. And, because the bases were built at ambient pressure, decompression periods were long and risky. Teams would spend weeks at a base, conduct tests, learn more about the limits of human endurance, slowly resurface to land and, in many cases, never return. One by one the habitats were abandoned. Research institutions diverted funds elsewhere. Government agencies shifted their attention skyward. Space replaced the Earth’s oceans as our final frontier. At the time Nuytten was still a rookie in the ocean industry. He had begun to work on the concepts for which he would later be lauded, but Cousteau’s experiments, which to many seemed more like science fiction than reality, never strayed far from his mind. The subject became a kind of obsession. What if he could create a habitat that was cheaper to build and cheaper to run? What if he could find a way to reproduce the natural light man needs to exist comfortably? What if he could overcome problems caused by the deep ocean’s almighty pressure? And what if he could do what Cousteau and his contemporaries could not: convince society it would be a good idea to live 3,000ft under the sea? In his office, Nuytten tells me he works best when big questions like these loom overhead. “I run around looking for needs so I can fill them in. I like to have about 10 things on the go at once.” Nuytten is a perennial tinkerer, most effective when there are problems to solve, and the barriers to successful underwater living posed interesting problems. By the end of the 60s he had begun work on his own colony, which he began to refer to as Vent Base Alpha. Every now and then he’d scribble ideas on paper scraps and file them away, gradually accumulating hypotheses. Whenever he developed a new piece of technology, usually for a client, he’d experiment with how it might be incorporated within plans for the base. Sometimes a sketch would lead to a breakthrough, and he’d be able to understand what went wrong the first time someone tried to live under-water. What followed was half a century of successes and setbacks. Now a working vision has emerged. Here’s how Nuytten plans to build the colony. First, he’ll forage for equipment in what he calls “the boneyard”, a huge lot in which he stores discarded apparatus. (“I never throw anything away. I am a hoarder.”) He’ll locate a stack of abandoned saturation tanks and convert them into living quarters, laboratories, a series of floodable airlocks and a hangar for submersibles, each tank impeccably welded to the next. Later, he’ll equip the structure with a Stirling engine capable of producing the electricity required to create artificial sunlight, allow inhabitants to grow crops and, crucially, enable them to “crack water into hydrogen and oxygen”. Nuytten relays this last piece of information urgently. “There’s your life support,” he says. The colony will be transported to open water, most likely the Juan de Fuca Strait, a 154km-long outlet to the Pacific Ocean south of Vancouver Island. It will be submerged and hauled to the sea bed a few thousand feet below, and then it will be installed next to a hydrothermal vent – a kind of underwater geyser. The vent will give the colony its name, its hot emissions will power the Sterling engine and its mineral-rich deposits will be mined. Inhabitants will trade the bounty – laboratory-pure cobalt, in the case of the Juan de Fuca Strait – with buyers above the surface. Nuytten will make no financial gain from the project. Funding will come from government agencies, though Nuytten will forgo requesting official permission over whether or not a huge heap of metal can be attached to the ocean floor, preferring instead to “beg for forgiveness” after the installation – his customary strategy. (The prototype, in contrast, will be sanctioned by an offshoot of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, a government body, and anchored in the Burrard Inlet, not far from Nuytten’s office.) When the colony is complete, Nuytten will be among the first to take the plunge. His wife Mary, to whom he has been married for more than 60 years, will follow. As will his daughter, Virginia, if only for a visit. “I’m a mad-keen gardener,” she tells me over the phone. “If I couldn’t have my plants with me, I wouldn’t want to be there.” Soon enough, the family will be joined by other members of the ocean community: scientists, engineers, oceanographers, as well as James Cameron, who has already reserved a berth. Within a few weeks the base’s early tenants – a dozen or so people – will have settled into a routine. At least in the beginning, inhabitants will live underwater for months at a time, though they will be able to come and go. The atmosphere within the colony will tally with that on the surface, eradicating the requirement for decompression and making travel between the two worlds “like taking an elevator down to the parking garage”, explains Nuytten. But, soon enough, we will live at 3,000ft below as though it were normal. The colony will expand. More and more people will slip below the surface to begin second lives, and new colonies will appear around the world. Our routines won’t change, just the environments in which we perform them. We will do the things we normally do: commute to work, gossip with friends, spend inordinate amounts of time on social media. There will be underwater hospitals, banks, galleries, offices, parks, gyms, cinemas, farms, maybe even a forest or two. Children will be born in the colony. Eventually they will die there, too. But all of that will come down the line. First, Nuytten says: “We’ll have to figure out what we want to do down there.” He stops, then adds: “None of this has been done.” During our conversation Nuytten shows me an artist’s impression of the base. It’s an image of a structure that looks much like an underwater power station – a great mass of welded metal, similar to that of a rig. To the right of the picture a hydrothermal vent spouts sooty emissions and divers mine the ocean floor for minerals. Inside, inhabitants resembling Star Trek characters tend to operations. The surrounding environment looks dark and eery, a permanent night. You’d have a hard time working out what time of day the image depicts. I ask Nuytten why we would ever need to live underwater. “We need a second place to go,” he says. “There’s less and less space on Earth, and fewer and fewer resources. And here’s a whole ocean filled with them.” Nuytten is a fierce conservationist. “The oceans are the lungs of this planet. If they go, the planet goes.” In his grand vision, the colony is a kind of salvage operation. It will enable humanity to alleviate the burden it has placed on land. “We’ve demonstrated there will come a time when the planet as we know it will not be able to support the population. The population keeps growing and growing, and with climate change and natural disasters on land getting to be excessive… As far as we know, those same things aren’t happening under the sea. That’s one of the things we want to study: what are the effects of climate change on the deep ocean? We know what the effect is on the shallow regions, the coral reefs, but what about 3,000ft down? What’s happening there?” But how easy will it be to convince other people to take the plunge? “They’d batter the doors down,” he said. “Literally. I’ve given a lot of talks on this, and I’ve had all kinds of people, from wackos to really serious people, saying: ‘If you do this, we want to go.’” This seems like a hopeful response. Nuytten has spent much of his life below the surface. To him, the ocean is home. But what about the rest of us? What about the isolation? What about not being able to go anywhere any time we wanted? Won’t we miss the sun? Nuytten tells the story of an advertisement he’d heard had once been placed in a local UK newspaper. It read, “Wanted: people to go to Antarctica. Poor pay. No guarantee of success. Doing things no one has done before.” “They were inundated with applications,” Nuytten recalls. “I expect that to be the case with this. There are so many people, particularly young people, who are desperately trying to figure out what to do, what they can do that nobody else has done, things that are difficult, things that will protect our oceans.” The first inhabitants will be pioneers, Nuytten believes. “Once you have the first group down there, staying a few months, the next batch will show up.” Nuytten is in no doubt the colony will succeed. “There were an awful lot of people who said we’d never fly in the air,” he tells me. “And even more who said we’d never go to the moon.” But his comment is underpinned by a more urgent message, one that moved the conversation away from personal success and into the realms of societal requirement. “What are we going to do if something catastrophic happens to where we live?” he says, resignedly. “We have to have some place to go.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/2018/apr/09/alan-baker-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T17:07:51Z","webTitle":"Alan Baker obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/09/alan-baker-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/09/alan-baker-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Alan Baker obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1966 the start of a new era in number theory was marked by Alan Baker, who has died aged 78, joining the department of pure mathematics at Cambridge University. With a cascade of papers, he had published solutions to a series of problems from a line of inquiry that went back to the third-century mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria. On the basis of this exceptional work, in 1970 Alan was awarded the Fields medal, one of the discipline’s highest distinctions. The interest of Diophantus’s approach to equations lies in whether they can be solved in ways that produce only whole numbers, or integers. From school, we know Pythagoras’s theorem for right-angled triangles: if the sides are 3, 4 and 5 units long, then 32 + 42 = 52, (9 + 16 = 25), and there are other whole-number solutions, or Pythagorean triples, that can be found with squared numbers (5,12,13; 7, 24, 25; and infinitely many more). But can the equivalent be done with cubed numbers, or numbers at higher powers? The underlying diophantine equation is xn + yn = zn. This has been a subject of particular fascination since 1637, when the Frenchman Pierre de Fermat noted in the margin of his translation of Diophantus that whole-number solutions for it could not be found beyond squaring, and that he had “discovered a truly marvellous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain”. Alan’s way into this question lay in one of the most difficult areas of mathematics, transcendental number theory. It searches for and investigates the properties of non-algebraic numbers, a classification that includes π, 3.1415... , the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, and Euler’s number, e, 2.7182..., important in the study of logarithms. During a golden period in the 1930s and 40s, the Russian mathematician AO Gelfond and the German PhD student Theodor Schneider had given a solution (1934), to the seventh of the 23 unsolved problems described in 1900 by the German mathematician David Hilbert, and showed it to be transcendental. Hilbert regarded this seventh problem as much more difficult to prove than the Riemann hypothesis, also on his list, which is now one of the seven millennium problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute; the reward offered for a solution to any of these is $1m, as they would play a tremendous role in the future development of mathematics. Gelfond and Schneider pushed forward the techniques they had developed into different directions but essentially it seemed that the limits of their method had been reached. So it was a cause of much surprise that Alan got into this very difficult part of number theory from around 1964 onwards, and worked on it in Cambridge on his own. Alan was born in London. His father, Barney, had also been a brilliant mathematician in his youth, but had had to earn a living rather than pursue his studies. Barney married Betty Sohn and they set up home in Forest Gate, east London. From a very early age, their son showed signs of mathematical brilliance, which they encouraged. From Stratford grammar school, Alan gained a scholarship to study at University College London. He graduated with a first and went to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study for an MA and PhD (1965) with Harold Davenport, one of the leading number theorists at the time, with many international connections. Alan was awarded the Fields medal for research into what are known as linear forms in logarithms. It had been recognised for a long time that the solution to a number of outstanding problems in number theory would depend on this work, including Carl Friedrich Gauss’s class number problem, published in his textbook Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1798). The Gelfond-Schneider method could not be applied to deal with the general linear forms in logarithms that were needed for these applications; Alan managed to find a spectacular new approach. Using his theory of logarithmic forms he was able to settle the Gauss conjecture, and also to find all solutions in integers of the diophantine equations of the type y2 = x3 + k, known as Mordell equations, after the 20th-century British mathematician Louis Mordell. Alan’s work deduced that there are only a finite number of integer solutions of the equation with z a fixed given integer and which can be computed. This fundamental insight has been developed spectacularly by others. Gerd Faltings, another Fields medallist, showed in 1983 that diophantine equations of this type including the Fermat equation have only finitely many solutions, a result conjectured by Mordell. However, the solutions cannot be computed explicitly. Andrew Wiles finally published a proof (1995) that for integer solutions with no common factor the Fermat equation has only the trivial solutions 0, 1 and -1 for powers higher than squaring, as stated by Fermat. Alan’s insights have also found applications in many fields of mathematics quite remote from number theory. From 1974 until 2006 he was professor of pure mathematics at Cambridge University, then made emeritus. He was a modest and frugal person who had continued to live at Trinity College from his days as a graduate student. From the mid-90s he was proud of occupying the college’s best flat, next to the Master’s Lodge, which even had a separate, almost secret staircase down to the fellows’ garden, which he could overlook from his living room. There he loved to play bowls with friends. During an international conference in Zurich organised by the mathematical research institute FIM in 1999 on the occasion of a his 60th birthday, he gave a speech in which he expressed regret at never having married. Travelling around the world, in particular to Hong Kong, was his pleasure, as well as photography and theatre. He often visited the US, in particular the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Among the many honours he received were the Adams prize, election to the Royal Society and the Academia Europaea, and to honorary fellowship of UCL. • Alan Baker, mathematician, born 19 August 1939; died 4 February 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T19:00:08Z","webTitle":"The free-love cult that terrorised America – and became Netflix’s latest must-watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country","fields":{"headline":"The free-love cult that terrorised America – and became Netflix’s latest must-watch","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Anyone who has ever dipped a toe in the pool of new-age mysticism is likely to have come across Osho. The bearded Indian mystic has had his books translated into more than 60 languages, published by more than 200 publishing houses – you’re likely to find his works next to the crystals and yoga mats in your local hippy shop. Yet if you go on the Osho website, or are one of the 200,000 people that visit the Osho International Centre in Pune, India each year – you’ll hear nothing about the most eventful section of his life, before he was rebranded as “Osho”, and known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a popular spiritual leader in India, attracting thousands of followers – called sannyasins or “orange people” – to practise free love and take part in his unusual style of meditation: lots of primal screaming followed by dancing as if Fatboy Slim had just come on to Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage. By the 1980s he was at odds with the government in India and so decided to buy a ranch in Oregon. The land was largely uninhabitable but he sent his followers ahead to create a utopia. They built a giant dam, an airport, an electricity station and a meditation centre that could hold 10,000 people. They called it Rajneeshpuram, and when it was ready, Rajneesh and his followers relocated to the US. The cult that formed was as paranoid as scientology, as bizarre as Jonestown, and as controlled as the Manson family. Yet until the release of Wild Wild Country, Netflix’s latest hit documentary series directed by brothers Mclain and Chapman Way, it had not entered the cultural conversation in the same way as those movements. Now it seems people can talk about little else. The six-part documentary, available to view now, scored 100% on the review site Rotten Tomatoes, and received even more glowing endorsements from other filmmakers, including Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning director of Moonlight, who tweeted: “I’m on my second watch of Wild Wild Country. I’ll probably make it through a third.” The film has spurred hundreds of articles revisiting the events as other journalists attempt to get in touch with former members or relive their sannyasins experiences. The tenor of the excitement around the show isn’t just about the intimate footage the directors have unearthed, or the fact they secured in-depth interviews with nearly all the cult’s living leaders. Viewers also seem to be shocked that they didn’t already know this story. Jenn McAllister, a YouTuber with more than three million subscribers, had a typical reaction of those not yet born during the period: “I can’t believe that happened in the US and I never knew until now.” Perhaps this is because pop culture has been keen to retread the same couple of cult stories. In the past few years Emma Cline’s novel The Girls, a fictional reimagining of life in the Manson family, became a bestseller. Quentin Tarantino’s next film Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, starring Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, is also based on Manson. The most recent series of the Emmy-winning American Horror Story takes influences from both the Jim Jones and Manson movements, and Louis Theroux’s My Scientology Movie was the latest major documentary on that movement. The hunger for these stories shows no sign of abating. Like most of the cults, the sannyasin movement began with members dreaming of a better future. What’s exceptional about Wild Wild Country is its episodic treatment manages to make the cult attractive: a sense of purpose, self-realisation, free love. The show sucks you in to Rajneesh’s teachings and the charisma of his personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela. Yet by episode four the commune has engaged in the sedation of thousands of homeless people, immigration fraud, failed assassination plots, and the largest bio-terrorist attack in US history. The cult infected 751 people with salmonella by contaminating restaurant salad bars. The 1984 attack, planned to incapacitate voters and allow it to win seats in a local election, led to a 20-year jail sentence for Sheela. ‘I remember all of this quite vividly,” says Rick Ross, from the Cult Education Institute, when I ask why commune members weren’t more suspicious of the leaders. “I was contacted by family members of people living in Oregon. They contacted me because they were concerned for their loved ones’ safety, the potential for the group to become violent or criminal, and the fact that they were giving very large amounts of money to Rajneesh.” The documentary leaves lots of unanswered questions about whether the sannyasins were a genuine spiritual movement or a scam, not least because most of the former members still speak about Rajneesh with affection. But Ross believes there is no question that the intent was malicious. “They were very methodical, deliberate. Rajneesh was intelligent – he was educated, he had a PhD. He was a master at manipulation and influence techniques. It’s common with these kinds of groups. They don’t play fair or transparently with the people they target. People are tricked and then they are trapped.” Ross reels off cults that have emerged since Rajneesh: the Aum Shinrikyo movement that in 1995 let off sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo underground, killing 12 people; the American white-supremacist FLDS Church which, like Rajneesh, has political control of two cities, its own police forces and a leader who is in prison for child abuse and rape; the Order of the Solar Temple which is associated with the mass suicides of dozens of members in France and Switzerland. His very long list highlights that awareness of previous cults does nothing to stop the next. “The problem is that no one signs up to be in a cult, no one is a self-confessed cult member. Often these groups have a lot of legitimate criticism about society – there is a lot of inequality, a rat race which stifles individuality,” says Suzanne Newcome a research fellow at Inform, the new religious movements network at LSE. The problem, she says, is it has always been to difficult to work out whether a group offering things like therapy, meditation, life advice, yoga and retreats is a going to have a positive or negative impact. Once people might become aware they’ve joined a cult they’re often too invested and it’s hard to get out. The Osho movement today, 28 years after its founder’s death, is a more tempered version than in Oregon, and focuses on selling books and meditation retreats. Yet it is still unwilling to accept the findings of the documentary. The Osho Times, its official organ, says the documentary fails to show “this was a US government conspiracy, from the White House on down, aimed at thwarting Osho’s vision of a community based on conscious living”. Even in death, Rajneesh continues to manipulate his followers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/08/three-cheers-for-a-brilliant-new-wave-of-working-class-tv-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Three cheers for a wave of ‘working-class’ TV dramas that wear their class lightly | Rachel Cooke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/three-cheers-for-a-brilliant-new-wave-of-working-class-tv-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/three-cheers-for-a-brilliant-new-wave-of-working-class-tv-drama","fields":{"headline":"Three cheers for a wave of ‘working-class’ TV dramas that wear their class lightly","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When it comes to art, I’ve never subscribed to the idea that people need always to be able to see, whether on screen or on the page, someone just like themselves, living a life exactly like their own. If a novel or a film reaches us, it’s because we recognise the emotional terrain, not because we’re thinking: wow, that guy’s accent is just like mine – and didn’t we used to have that hall carpet, too, before we swapped it for tiles? At 16, when I was about the most adept truant you could ever have hoped to meet, I spent most of my free time – and what a lot of that I had – reading and rereading Brideshead Revisited, a book with which I was then slightly obsessed. Evelyn Waugh’s world, it probably goes without saying, overlapped not one bit with mine (Sheffield, 1985). But it pulled at my heart all the same. The rippling melancholy; Sebastian’s ever more determined boozing; a family that did not quite know how to talk to one another: it was these things that spoke to me, not the bottles of sauternes and the bear with the ridiculous name. This is not to say that we don’t need a multiplicity of voices; that art shouldn’t take us to more places than it does already. When, some years ago, various commentators began worrying about the demise of (so-called) working-class television, I didn’t regard their anxiety as misplaced, for all that it seemed to be born as much of their bafflement as of their desire for a certain kind of equality. (The debate may be traced back to 2011, when Brendan O’Carroll’s sitcom, Mrs Brown’s Boys, began on the BBC; the critics loathed it almost without exception, but it was also a big hit and that required an explanation.) I remembered the programmes I used to watch as a child when I was staying with my granny on Wearside – for fairly obvious reasons, a particular favourite of hers was When the Boat Comes In, a BBC drama starring James Bolam about a working-class community in the north-east of England – and wondered what we might watch together now were she still alive. All I could come up with was Call the Midwife and, though she would have found it ungenteel, ITV’s long-running package holiday comedy drama, Benidorm. But perhaps, at last, this is changing. When the Bafta TV nominations were announced last week, Peter Morgan’s Netflix epic The Crown stole many of the headlines – and why not? Princess Margaret’s misery is still misery, after all; we know it when we see it, even if the tears being shed do belong to a spoilt young woman who genuinely cares about whether or not her new husband takes a courtesy title. Pain is pain, no matter who feels it. Look down the nominations, though, and you’ll see all the other, rather less posh shows that have risen to the top. There’s Broken, in which Sean Bean stars as a Roman Catholic priest struggling to tend his flock in a deprived part of a nameless northern city; Three Girls, an unimpeachably superb drama inspired by the stories of the victims of child sex abuse in Rochdale; This Country, Daisy May and Charlie Cooper’s funny and knowing mockumentary about socially isolated young people in the Cotswolds; Peter Kay’s Car Share, in which the Bolton-born comedian plays, with such delicious low-key warmth, an assistant supermarket manager called John who is slowly falling in love with Kayleigh, the adorable promotions rep he drives to work every day. Who knows why, precisely, this should be happening now. I don’t think it has much to do with what we might call our present situation; we are not the US and this isn’t the new season of Roseanne, for whose spectacular ratings President Trump has already loudly claimed the credit. (It’s “about us” he told a rally in Ohio.) Only to a degree, moreover, do you sense the ghostly hands of commissioning editors keen to be seen to be doing the right thing. There’s nothing particularly earnest about these shows. You don’t feel, necessarily, that boxes have been ticked. They wear questions of class lightly – Jimmy McGovern’s Broken may be an exception – in the same way that, say, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? used to wear such matters lightly, revealing first a world and then the state of the nation to you, even as you howled with laughter. What I mean is that while these shows’ writers are undoubtedly keen to look at the way class still keeps people down (this is one of the chief stories told by Three Girls), they’re also able to prod at it, to hoot at it and even, sometimes, to relish it. Above all, they patronise neither their characters nor their audience. But even if we can’t explain such a blossoming, we can at least celebrate it. It’s not only that these are fantastically good, singular and widely loved programmes, ones that people will remember and return to for years to come. (Peter Kay’s Car Share is the most popular box set ever to have been released on BBC iPlayer.) What most cheers me is that those making them are so delicately noticing; that they have the capacity to understand that no one is “ordinary”; that every life comes with its share of idiosyncrasies and fantastical moments, of bottomless grief and dizzying happiness. In this sense, they stand stubbornly at an angle to our ghastly political culture, where ordinary people are all the same – and all out of sight. I love them for this even more fervently than I hope that John and Kayleigh will end up together. • Rachel Cooke is an Observer writer and critic"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/07/entebbe-film-annoy-left-and-right-thank-heavens","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T17:15:06Z","webTitle":"Entebbe reminds us that we now live in a world without heroes | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/07/entebbe-film-annoy-left-and-right-thank-heavens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/07/entebbe-film-annoy-left-and-right-thank-heavens","fields":{"headline":"Entebbe reminds us that we now live in a world without heroes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When Entebbe is released next month, most cinema audiences will enjoy an exceptional drama documentary. With luck, it should also annoy all the right people for all the right reasons. Supporters of the Israeli government will protest at how a great act of daring – the 1976 Entebbe airport rescue by Israeli special forces of Jewish passengers held by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Baader-Meinhof gang – ends with an appeal for Israel to negotiate with its enemies. That the film-makers show a compassionate German terrorist disobeying orders to kill Jewish hostages in the seconds before the Israelis soldiers reach them will not please the right either, I imagine. The pseudo-left will denounce the film because, when all its politics play out, it is still a story of Israeli heroism and still presents Israel as a lifeboat state for the victims of European and Arab antisemitism as well as an oppressor of Palestinians. Fewer will comment on the shift in the world and the shift in our sensibility since the 20th century. I cannot imagine anyone making a morally complex drama today about the battle between Hamas and Israel, the Syrian bloodbath or any modern conflict with the possible exceptions of the struggles of the Kurds and Ukrainians. You can map how far we have moved by looking at the polemics of the past. In 1950, Bertrand Russell mocked the “fallacy of the superior virtue of the oppressed”. Generally, it was an excuse offered by oppressors. Victorian society denied women property rights and the vote, but justified itself by saying the dainty wife had an angelic nature which sexual equality would ruin. Naturally, it never entertained the notion that men would undergo spiritual improvement if they were stripped of their rights, too. The fallacy could also be found in the minds of opponents of the status quo. The old socialists romanticised the working class as nobler and kinder than the greedy bourgeoisie. Yet if they truly believed poverty and slums eradicated selfish individualism, they would have campaigned for everyone to enjoy the benefits of a poor education, bad food and overwork. “Obvious as this argument is,” said Russell, “many Socialist and Communist intellectuals consider it de rigueur to pretend to find the proletariat more amiable than other people, while professing a desire to abolish the conditions which, according to them, alone produce good human beings.” Until recently, it was commonplace to imagine oppression overseas also ennobled its victims. It was not enough, for instance, to say apartheid was wrong. If you looked at how members of the anti-apartheid movement were honoured, the writers who endorsed its struggle garlanded with Nobel prizes and Nelson Mandela turned from politician to saint, you might have concluded that the more oppression there, was the better humanity would become. Or, to take an example closer to home, leftists have produced whole books denouncing conservative gays as traitors. It never occurred to the authors that once the right stopped supporting the judicial persecution of homosexuality, a conservatively inclined gay man was as likely to support a rightwing party as a conservatively inclined straight man. In the 21st century, Russell’s fallacy has all but vanished. A realistic understanding that freedom means the freedom of women, the working class, subject peoples, ethnic minorities and gay and lesbian people to be as good or bad, left or right, interesting or dull, crooked or honest, radical or conformist as the white, male middle class has not replaced it. Instead, we have a blindness that does not romanticise the oppressed but refuses to look at them. To understand the phenomenon, imagine a screenwriter trying write a drama about Israeli troops shooting dead Hamas demonstrators on the Gaza border at the end of last month. The writer could not paint Benjamin Netanyahu as a compromised but sympathetic politician in the mould of his predecessor as Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. At the time of the Entebbe raid, Rabin was impressing on his colleagues the need to negotiate with enemies. He paid with his life for that in 1995 when a rightwing fanatic assassinated him for supporting the Oslo peace process. By contrast, Netanyahu, whose brother died saving the Entebbe hostages, not only failed to negotiate, but his policy of colonising the West Bank makes it impossible for a successor to negotiate. If the Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine had taken power in the 1970s, it would have produced another murderous dictatorship. But in theory at least its solution of a one-state Arab nation with Jews as a minority was not inhumane. Outsiders could look at it without shuddering. Radical Islamists, who not only want to drive Jews into the sea, but establish a sexist, homophobic, inquisitorial theocracy, as Hamas has done in Gaza, long ago surpassed the old Marxists. As a result, I doubt one western protester in a thousand against Israel’s crimes could name the leaders of Hamas or describe their world vision. It’s not just that they don’t know, they cannot know. They must blank out the reality of religious dictatorship. In the 20th century, interested outsiders wanted to learn about a Mandela or a Havel. If they fell into Russell’s trap of romanticising them, you could explain the foolishness as natural in people who had reason to believe their values of liberalism and economic justice were on the march. In the 21st century, the ascendant values are illiberal: ethnic nationalism in the west, China and Russia; religious sectarianism in the Middle East and India. Refusing to look too hard – or at all – is a reaction to a world where there is too much to fight against and too little to fight for. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/08/dolce-and-gabbana-bow-out-in-style","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T04:59:21Z","webTitle":"Dolce and Gabbana offer a masterclass in bowing out in style | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/dolce-and-gabbana-bow-out-in-style","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/dolce-and-gabbana-bow-out-in-style","fields":{"headline":"Dolce and Gabbana offer a masterclass in bowing out in style","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana say that their brand will die with them: “Once we’re dead, we’re dead,” said Gabbana. “I don’t want a Japanese designer to start designing Dolce &amp; Gabbana.” Which was somewhat oddly expressed (why reach for the spectre of a “Japanese designer” in particular?). But the core point is interesting. Fashion is odd in the way that design houses just carry on, long after the original creators are dead. Which doesn’t happen so much in other forms of creativity – say, music, literature or art. People didn’t just take over from the Beatles, Pablo Picasso or Charles Dickens. While there have been literary sequels, for instance, PD James’s Jane Austen-take Death Comes to Pemberley, these are relatively rare. In the main, brand continuum in the arts has rested on tributes and heritage. In this way, Dolce and Gabbana come across as, at once, ultra-controlling (“You can’t use our names!”), but also radical and punk. They’re basically ensuring that not only their industry, but also their art and their potential, perish along with them.

Such was the emotional baggage of that defeat, Cate Campbell took a sabbatical from the sport last year. But, just three days into the Commonwealth Games, Campbell is leaving behind those demons in the most emphatic fashion possible, on Saturday breaking her own Commonwealth Games record with a time of 23.78 to take gold in the women’s 50m freestyle. To Cate’s delight, sister Bronte came in equal-second with a time of 24.26, in a dead heat finish with Canada’s Taylor Ruck. Campbell shed tears during the medal ceremony and national anthem, seemingly as much in relief as joy. Speaking after the race, she admitted a “love-hate relationship” with the pressure of finals. “That’s what we thrive on, and the thing I’ll probably miss the most when we retire. As much as you hate it, you love it at the same time,” she said. Having won gold with her sister in the 4x100 medley event on Thursday, meanwhile, Bronte said she was proud of Cate’s decisive comeback. “Maybe we could switch the order around every now and again,” she laughed. “It never gets old, I could keep doing that for a long time ... I’m so happy.” Two races later, Emily Seebohm looked set to deliver another fairytale finish for Australia in the pool, turning at the 50m mark of the 100m backstroke 0.13 under world record time, before missing out on gold by a fingernail to the holder of that record in Kylie Masse. Masse would not best her own world record time, but did surpass her Games record, at 58.63. The result continued a budding rivalry: Seebohm was looking for her third consecutive Games gold medal in the event, but Masse is the current world champion since arriving on the scene as a bronze medallist at Rio. Taking bronze, Canada’s Taylor Ruck continued an excellent night in the pool, backing up a silver just several races earlier in the women’s 50m freestyle. Despite the disappointment of finishing second, Seebohm said the rivalry with Masse continued to push her swimming to new heights. “To actually finish so close together is pretty incredible in itself. It’s just another battle and she makes me a better backstroker,” she said. But it was the final race of the night that had the home crowd in raptures, as Australia finished with a thrilling 4x200m women’s freestyle relay gold with 17-year-old Ariarne Titmus just holding off an indefatigable Ruck of Canada to ensure a new Games record of 7:48:04. Emma McKeon got Australia off to an excellent start, turning under world record time at both the 50 and 100m splits. England’s Siobhan O’Connor made up significant ground for England in the third leg against Brianna Throssell, but all four Australian swimmers fought off fierce opposition to emerge triumphant. It was Australia’s seventh of eight gold medals in the event since 1986. Earlier in the night, Southport local David Morgan thrilled the home crowd in the men’s 200m final, taking out silver, but was ultimately no match for South African Chad le Clos, who broke his own Commonwealth games record with a time of 1:54:00. Le Clos became only the second male swimmer in history to win the same event at three consecutive Commonwealth events. The men’s SB8 100m breastroke final delivered Australia’s first trifecta for the night in the pool, with Timothy Disken doubling up after he took gold in the men’s S9 100m freestyle the night before. He took gold from Timothy Hodge, with Blake Cochrane finishing third. No such luck in the women’s SM10 200m individual medley, where New Zealand took their first gold medal in the pool, world record holder Sophie Pascoe blasting the field. Australia’s Katherine Downie just missed out on the silver, finishing .02 seconds behind Canada’s Aurelie Rivard. Over at the Anna Meares Velodrome, there was more joy for Australia with Kaarle McCullouch taking gold in the women’s 500m time trial, holding off compatriot Steph Morton, who took silver to go with her two gold at the Games to date. McCulloch and Morton had on Friday teamed up to win gold for Australia in the women’s team sprint. It was teammates working together in the men’s 15km scratch race however as Australia’s riders Campbell Stewart and Cameron Meyer combined to deliver Sam Welsford gold in one of the epic all-time finals. Strangely, Jessica Gallagher finished second in the women’s para (B&amp;VI) 1000m time trial, but finished without a silver medal due to a lack of competitors in the women’s event. “It’s heartbreaking,” said Gallagher of the technicality. “We competed in the world championships a few weeks ago and won two silvers. And to come to this Commonwealth Games and not get a medal – that was a choice they [the organisers] made. “But we proved at the world champs we’re the second best team in the world. And we proved that again here. It’s not about trinkets, it’s about doing the best for your country.” Australia’s Brad Henderson picked up bronze by defeating Muhammad Afiq Afify Rizan in the men’s B&amp;VI sprint. Earlier in the day, all did not go to plan for world champion Matt Glaetzer, favourite for gold in the men’s sprint. Glaetzer had broken the Commonwealth Games record in his initial heat with a time of 9.583 seconds, but failed to qualify for the men’s final after a shock loss to Malaysia’s Muhammad Sahrom – who had qualified last of 16 riders. The 25-year-old said the defeat was “embarrassing” and blamed a tactical error. “I was just coming into the bell too slow. I needed to be accelerating not just controlling. I tried to get through with minimum effort.” “It was a nightmare unfolding with three quarters of a lap to go. I knew I had stuffed it and had to give it all to fight but the race was gone by then. It’s devastating because just a small improvement on flow and I could have been out quicker. It was such an elementary mistake.” It was better news for compatriot Jacob Schmid, who went some way to avenging the shock loss, beating Glaetzer’s victor in the bronze medal sprint. Elsewhere, Australia’s triathlon team, consisting of Gillian Backhouse, Matthew Hauser, Ashleigh Gentle and Jacob Birtwhistle won gold at the mixed relay event, with a time of 1:17.36 ahead of rivals Britain. Gentle was instrumental in the win, at first giving up a 15 second lead in the swim before her brilliance on the bike ensured Birtwhistle a 39 second lead in the final leg. Against Alistair Brownlee – who has already experienced disappointment at the Games – he was able to stretch the final margin to 52 seconds. Georgia Godwin delivered Australia silver in the women’s individual all-around gymnastics final and Francois Etoundi snatched bronze in the men’s 77kg weightlifting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/06/rory-mcilroy-second-round-masters-jordan-spieth","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T23:45:30Z","webTitle":"Patrick Reed takes Masters initiative as McIlroy stays in the mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/06/rory-mcilroy-second-round-masters-jordan-spieth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/06/rory-mcilroy-second-round-masters-jordan-spieth","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Reed takes Masters initiative with second round 66 as McIlroy stays in the mix","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rory McIlroy did not have to search for a Friday reminder of Augusta National’s recurring capacity to inflict psychological torture on world class golfers. Jon Rahm, playing in the company of McIlroy and Adam Scott, did not take kindly to a bunker shot which flew over the back of a green. In specific order; Rahm smashed his wedge into the sand, threw said club away, booted his bag, retrieved the club and, having holed out for a bogey four, tossed his ball into a hedge. The Spaniard had played only four holes. That McIlroy has encountered so many trying times in the first major of the year added to the sense of what he accomplished on day two. Augusta National is probably the most passively aggressive venue in the world, as endorsed by menacing pin positions which, combined with wind, leave competitors grasping desperately for air. Standing still represented progress. Patience was rewarded. Enter McIlroy, who produced a 71 which, in terms of context if not bare statistics, represented one of his finest rounds here. McIlroy has been unflappable during a tough opening 36 holes and he felt that this 18-hole stretch should have yielded more points to the legitimate ambition of a four-time major champion. McIlroy’s round had got off to the kind of start which suggested a long day’s work. In previous years it would have been. He three-putted the 1st for a bogey and found sand from the 2nd tee. The response owed so much to mental fortitude; the 28-year-old converted from 30ft for a surprise birdie and collected a further shot at the 3rd. He had dropped back to an aggregate of two under at the 12th before producing birdies at the 13th and 14th; a 27ft putt sealed the latter. From there the Northern Irishman displayed calmness to ease home with a series of pars. His halfway total is four under. “I’m pretty happy,” said McIlroy. “I feel I could have shot in the 60’s but overall 71 out there was a pretty good score. I’m in a nice position going into the weekend. I’ve always felt comfortable around the lead, it’s a place I’m thankfully familiar with.” McIlroy was undecided as to whether he would have taken this scenario before a competitive ball was struck. “I’m happy with how I have felt and handled certain things, how my thought process has been. That’s been pleasing.” For now, McIlroy and co must hunt down the inspired Patrick Reed. The Texan hadn’t broken 70 in 12 Augusta rounds before this week. How that has altered; Reed backed up Thursday’s 69 with a stunning 66. At nine under, he leads Marc Leishman by two. Henrik Stenson’s afternoon charge propelled him to five under. In providing a blue-chip complexion to the leaderboard which grew stronger as Friday progressed - slowly - Jordan Spieth recovered from slipping to three over par after two holes to card a 74. He shares McIlroy’s aggregate. Spieth recounted a key chat with his caddie, Michael Greller, on the 3rd tee. “I’ve taken a lot of punches on this golf course, and in tournaments in general,” Spieth said. “I told Michael, ‘Look, when this course plays tough, I’m good for a double here or some bogeys there. Let’s make these the only ones.’ He was really good at saying, ‘Man, you always take punches out here and come back stronger.’” Dustin Johnson is a shot adrift of McIlroy and Spieth with the world No1’s second round of 68 notable as a five-stroke improvement from Thursday. Justin Thomas matched Johnson’s minus three. Rickie Fowler is at two under as he continues pursuit of a first major success as overdue. Justin Rose, defeated in a Masters play-off 12 months ago, and Bubba Watson sit alongside Rickie Fowler on a board now dominated by major winners. If forecasts are to be believed, heavy rain and thunder storms will hit this corner of Georgia on Saturday. That being the case, the tournament dynamic will shift once more. Tiger Woods will form a part of it. Having flirted with the five over cut line, the 14-time major winner played his closing 13 holes in level when piecing together a 75 and total of plus four. Woods won’t win, but his unforeseen comeback continues. Phil Mickelson had been just one from the lead when standing on the 9th tee. What followed entered the realms of circus. The left-hander cracked the centre of a tree from pine straw when playing his second shot, found his ball in a bed of azaleas and wracked up a seven. A birdie at the 10th was cancelled out - and some - by a bogey at the 11th and the double bogeying of the 12th. He later signed for a 79. “It was a rough day,” said Mickelson. Rahm, incidentally, shot 68; perhaps green jackets and red mist do mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/07/universal-credit-backlash-millions-lose-out","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T13:40:19Z","webTitle":"Ministers told to expect backlash as millions lose out from universal credit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/07/universal-credit-backlash-millions-lose-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/07/universal-credit-backlash-millions-lose-out","fields":{"headline":"Ministers told to expect backlash as millions lose out from universal credit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ministers will face a backlash against reform to the benefits system when millions of claimants moving on to universal credit realise their income will be cut, the government’s most senior welfare adviser has warned. Paul Gray, chairman of the independent social security advisory committee, said that the decision to take a “substantial chunk” of funding out of the budget for universal credit risked undermining the good intentions of the reform. In 2015 his committee forced the then chancellor George Osborne to rethink and eventually ditch £4bn-worth of cuts to the tax credits system but the cuts to the universal credit budget remained. Speaking to the Observer, Gray said the aim of universal credit – to simplify the system and encourage people back into work – was right, but he warned that building in significant budget cuts would become an issue once claimants realised they would be losing out. “As part of the austerity programme, the last government decided it was going to take a substantial chunk out of the welfare budget,” he said. “But this will now be seen as a problem with universal credit, not a more generic issue about reducing the cost of the welfare system. That poses a significant challenge once those receiving tax credits start to migrate in serious numbers over to universal credit. Although there will be transitional protection, once a claimant’s circumstances change, a lot of people are going to realise that, because the system was modified by the austerity measures, it is now going to be financially disadvantageous to them. That is a really big challenge to come, which maybe there is not huge awareness about. “It is a problem that a major change in the system is being introduced which will mean there are substantially more losers than gainers. Any government has got to say, if they want to offset that, where are we going to find £3bn or £4bn from? Are we going to spend less in other areas, are we going to raise taxes, or are we going to borrow more? That is a high-level political position that I don’t think a detailed scrutiny committee like mine should take a view on, or get into a campaigning position on. But it is our job to point out the consequences.” According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the universal credit system will result in gains for 2.2 million working families, with an average increase in income of £41 a week. However, 3.2 million working families are expected to be worse off, with an average loss of £48 a week. About 600,000 of those who lose out, mainly couples with children, will no longer be entitled to help at all. Gray also said there was an unfairness in the treatment of the self-employed after concerns that universal credit would lead to some ending up thousands of pounds worse off compared to an employee with the same annual earnings. The problem has emerged because of the way self-employed earnings are recorded under universal credit. A “minimum income floor” is used to calculate universal credit payments each month. Because self-employed workers’ earnings fluctuate from month to month, they sometimes fail to meet the minimum figure and lose out. “There is a problem,” Gray said. “For the first time, we are getting serious numbers of self-employed people into the benefits system. Let’s not overlook the fact this is very difficult. “The government has got to build in some kind of protection that means the social security system isn’t getting ripped off. My concern is that the way the parameters have been drawn at the moment means that the risk is the balance has tipped too far the other way … There is a risk that will be a disincentive to the whole entrepreneurial culture that this government and most governments are going to want to encourage.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said it was “simplistic to compare universal credit to the complex legacy benefit system”. “Universal credit clearly shows that people are better off in work, and we know this is the best route out of poverty,” she said. “It has always been the case that when there is a change in an individual’s circumstances, their benefit entitlement may change. We are sensitive to these changes and that is why HMRC and DWP are working closely to design the best possible journey for people moving to the new system.” In response to concern about the self-employed, she said it would not be right for the system to prop up businesses that are not viable. “That’s why, after the initial year, gainfully self-employed people are treated as if they are earning as much as working on the minimum wage,” she said. “If they are not, and they want to maintain the same level of income, they will be expected to increase their earnings rather than relying on their UC payment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/08/wolves-scotland-reintroduction-lister-alladale","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"One man’s plan to let wolves roam free in the Highlands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/08/wolves-scotland-reintroduction-lister-alladale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/08/wolves-scotland-reintroduction-lister-alladale","fields":{"headline":"One man’s plan to let wolves roam free in the Highlands","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The echoes of Scotland’s predator prince faded into silence three centuries ago. The wolf was once lord of these Sutherland slopes and the forest floors beneath and now a voice in the wilderness is calling him home. Paul Lister acquired the Alladale estate, 50 miles north of Inverness, in 2003 and immediately set about creating a wilderness reserve according to his perception of what these wild and beautiful places ought to look like. He can’t imagine them without the packs of wolves that once roamed free here. But his views are considered eccentric by ramblers and conservationists, who view them as a rich man’s caprice, centring their objections on his plans to fence off the vast reserve. Lister’s plans for the controlled release of a pack of Swedish wolves have been known for years but last week he seemed to issue an ultimatum to the Highland and Islands council, using a local newspaper interview to tell them: “I want to do this, but we would really need to have the details nailed down by the end of 2018.” Yet, when you speak to this man, driven as he is by a vision of how these places should be managed, you form an unshakeable impression that he will strive to fulfil it for as long as it takes. There are few spaces in the UK more achingly beautiful than Glen Mor and Glen Alladale, the ancient glacial valleys that form this wilderness. The last of the winter snow still coats the top of jagged ridges high above a river that cleaves the land below. At the top of one of these peaks is the only point in Scotland where you can observe the Atlantic on one side and the North Sea on the other. These rocks and this water are as old as Scotland itself and showcase this country in its most majestic raiment. These places were once rich in a diversity of trees, flowers and wild animals, which rubbed alongside small human settlements eking a sparse existence. The people disappeared in their thousands during the clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries, forced to flee their homes in the face of the most ruthless, forced mass eviction of British citizens ever, clearing the way for the introduction of sheep as landowners eyed quicker and easier profits. Later they would be joined by thousands of red deer to exploit the whims of aristocratic shooting parties. These creatures denuded the great forests of their biodiversity, and something more barren emerged. Lister’s form of land management is a rebuke to the way that much of Scotland has been artificially manipulated by fewer than 500 rich individuals to satisfy the demands of affluent hunting parties. “There will be no hunting, fishing or shooting here,” he said. “My connection to the Scottish Highlands goes back to the 1980s when my family invested in commercial forestry. I shot my first deer then. But over time I began to realise that human predation and selfishness had wrecked these places so that the soil became weaker and only a thin remnant of the ancient forests remained. “You need to keep numbers of deer artificially high to satisfy the demands of the shooters who have paid a lot of money not to return empty-handed. Thus, an imbalance occurs. I want to restore balance and harmony to this place in accordance with the way it was created and the way it was meant to be. The controlled release of a pack of wolves would help achieve that harmony by changing the behaviours of the deer and keeping their numbers down to proportionate levels.” Lister’s inspiration is North America’s Yellowstone national park where the introduction of a single pack of wolves in 1995 led to one of the most remarkable ecological turnarounds of the modern world. This is known as a trophic cascade and is the process by which the activity of an apex predator at the top of the food chain eventually stimulates the growth of several other animal species and enriches bio-diversity. It was in response to the way that huge numbers of elk and deer had grazed large parts of the natural landscape of Yellowstone into barren waste. “I don’t see myself as the owner of the Alladale wilderness,” says Lister. “How can any human, no matter how rich or powerful he thinks he is, assume ownership of a mountain or a river? These were here long before we came along and will remain long after we’re gone. I’m merely a custodian of this place with a responsibility to leave it in a better state than when I acquired it so that future generations can derive some pleasure or solace from its natural beauty. “My plans for the controlled release of wolves have been misrepresented. This will not mean packs of them roaming all over the Scottish Highlands. We’re talking about a fenced-in area of 50,000 acres; this wilderness is 23,000 so I am hoping to persuade one or two of my neighbours to buy into this.” Lister’s plans to surround the wilderness with a 9ft fence has been met with howls of outrage by the rambling community, who insist that it represents an unconscionable restriction on the right to roam that is now secured in Scots law following a long struggle. Cameron McNeish, the author and broadcaster and one of the UK’s foremost authorities on outdoor pursuits, has welcomed much of what Lister is doing at Alladale in terms of wilderness management but feels that his plan to erect a fence around such a wide area is a non-starter. He has also stated that what he believes Lister is proposing is tantamount to a zoo (albeit a large one) for high-paying customers. “I believe the job of re-introducing large creatures like wolves and bears should be performed by Scottish Natural Heritage,” says McNeish. “Such reintroductions are of national importance and shouldn’t be down to the whims and ambitions of individual landowners who may, or may not, have a financial interest at heart. Lister’s proposals fall within the remit of zoo legislation, and Europe’s habitats directive. “Having predators like wolves or bears and prey in the same enclosure would introduce animal welfare issues,” he added. “This would need careful consideration as re-introduced grey wolves would have no natural predator in Scotland.” Lister’s reserve manager Innes Macneill said: “There aren’t any Munros in these glens and we only get around 1,000 ramblers per year. If these plans come to fruition we would expect more than ten times that amount.” Macneill’s family has worked these lands for generations. He is responsible for planting 800,000 saplings in the hope of restoring a forest of Scots pine. He also wants to see a growth in birch, rowan, ash, alder and willow, among others. “Trees make other trees,” he said. A personal view? Although the wolf would be installed officially as Scotland’s top predator, in reality it would never attain that status; not while humans are around. No species is more predatory than we who have specialised over centuries in making other species extinct or driven them to the brink of it. It is ironic that we now cavil at the gentle reintroduction of a magnificent beast that we hunted down remorselessly. If some sacrifices have to be made by the walking community, some of whom invade our most beautiful places and treat them as items to be ticked off on a middle-class bucket list, then so be it. • This article was amended on 11 April 2018 to correct 50,000 square miles to 50,000 acres."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Can it Happen Here? review: urgent studies in rise of authoritarian America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/07/can-it-happen-here-review-trump-republicans-authoritarian-america-fascism","fields":{"headline":"Can it Happen Here? review: urgent studies in rise of authoritarian America","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The 17 thinkers who have contributed to this new collection of essays come down firmly on all sides of its central question: is the United States destined to become an authoritarian state? Multiple points of view are expressed by the book’s editor, Cass Sunstein, alone. In his introduction, Sunstein writes: “My own summary of this book: Absolutely. It has happened before. It will happen again. To many Americans something like it is happening now.” And yet 56 pages later, speaking only for himself, he says the opposite: “In my view, it really can’t.” In another collection, such a contradiction might be a problem. Here, it isn’t. The medley of viewpoints expressed suggests something much closer to intellectual honesty than scholarly sloppiness. The truth is, no one can be certain. But whether you are an optimist, a pessimist or an idealist without illusions (John F Kennedy’s self-reverential description), this book bombards you with all the reasons that anyone who treasures democracy needs to be terrified by the current state of our republic. It is, of course, the presence of Donald Trump in the White House that gives so many a sense of emergency. But like many other recent books, this one argues that the Trump catastrophe is really just the culmination of 50 years of constitutional decay, rather than some sudden, unpredictable event. The Yale law professor Jack Balkin calls Trump a demagogue out of central casting, “unruly, uncouth, mendacious, dishonest and cunning”, his presidency a “symptom of constitutional rot and … dysfunction”. Balkin argues that the rise of American oligarchy is central to the steady decline of democracy. He attributes the growth of oligarchy to changes in how political campaigns are financed (allowing gigantic amounts of dark money), basic changes in the structure of mass media which have “encouraged political distrust”, and the merger of “politics with entertainment”. “The central goal of the Republican agenda,” Balkin writes, “… is to deliver benefits to the donor class”. Republicans have “no scruples about acting in an entirely shameless manner, as long as the interests of its masters are well served”. Trump’s populism is just a shameless “Potemkin village”. Whether or not fascism is coming to America, it is undeniable that the internet has put more in place to make it possible than there has ever been before. Its infrastructure has enabled an almost complete (and barely protested) disappearance of privacy, and the near-disappearance of the very concept of truth. In a particularly well-focused essay about how Russia is contributing to the rise of fascism, the former ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power – Sunstein’s wife – says the current “media environment” gives “propaganda and falsehoods” unprecedented power. Power provides extremely useful history on Russian efforts to interfere with US elections, which go back at least to 1984, when the KGB secretly campaigned against Ronald Reagan’s re-election. Just as they did during the 2016 election, the Russians spread all kinds of false stories, including the idea the CIA was plotting to give nuclear weapons to apartheid South Africa. Then Power pinpoints why the Russians were so much less effective back then: “During the Cold War the vast majority of Americans received their news … via mediated platforms.” This meant that what they read or saw on television “had to get by professional gatekeepers”. As far as the dissemination of news is concerned, that is the crucial difference between the pre- and post-internet worlds: the gatekeepers have disappeared. Add to that the fact that bots accounted for 3.8m tweets in the final weeks of the 2016 election and that 38m false stories were shared on Facebook in the last three months of the campaign, and you get some idea of the damage the internet has inflicted on American democracy. Fox News routinely “amplified falsehoods” that discredited Hillary Clinton. All in all it’s no surprise, as Power points out, that “large numbers of Americans now view as opinion what were once seen as verifiable facts” – everything from global warming to the utility of vaccinating children. Several contributors focus on the potentially catastrophic reaction Trump could orchestrate in the wake of a large-scale terrorist attack. The Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman argues that the prospect of a “draconian response” by Trump “should jolt serious Democrats and Republicans” into passing a new statutory framework that would explicitly reject the claim made by Jay Bybee and John Yoo for the Bush administration “that the commander in chief has the unilateral power to make never-ending war on the home front”. Unfortunately, with spineless Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, there is zero chance of such an initiative now. In the category of “it has happened here” already, the Harvard law school dean Martha Minow recalls the internment of 120,000 Japanese, including 70,000 American citizens, during the second world war. Despite intense “contemporaneous dissents” and “scholarly criticism”, the supreme court has never overturned the decision that made that horrendous episode possible. A Trump spokesperson even cited it as a worthy precedent for his proposed registry of immigrants from Muslim countries. The University of Chicago law professor David Strauss highlights another instance when “it did happen in the US”. For roughly 80 years beginning at the end of the 19th century, “parts of the United States were ruled by an undemocratic, illiberal, racist regime” and “African Americans were denied the right to vote and were violently repressed … with the tacit approval of the government”. Right now there are really only two things that can restore our faith in the rule of law and beat back lethal tendencies toward fascism. The first is a successful conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the alleged misdeeds of Trump and his dubious minions. The other is a new wave of energy from the progressive majority in the November elections, which could replace Trump’s Republican supplicants with Democrats who would actually impose serious limits on this White House. As the New York University law professor Stephen Holmes puts it towards the end of the book, even if our system doesn’t “guarantee good governance”, a change in the team in power can still produce “a sense of buoyant expectancy” and “social energy throughout the community”. The main reason for optimism about such new energy did not exist when this book was printed: the teenaged Americans now fighting to bring sanity to the nation’s gun laws. These magnificent young people must become the vanguard of a mass movement to rescue America from the Republican donor class – and to return it, finally, to its senses.

For decades, events surrounding the revolutionary tribunal that resulted in the execution of Rudolf Slánský, general secretary of the Czechoslovak party, and 10 other defendants was shrouded in mythology – with most visual and verbal evidence apparently lost to posterity. But an event that has fascinated historians could soon be seen in graphic detail after footage and audio recording of the 1952 trial was found. Hours of film and voice recordings, much of it mould-damaged, believed to cover most of the eight-day procedure were found stashed in metal and wooden boxes – along with millions of classified Czechoslovak Communist party documents – in the basement of a bankrupt former metal research business in Panenské Břežany, near Prague. The discovery came after Czech historians and archivists lost trace of recordings known to have been made on the orders of the communist authorities in preparation for a propaganda film that was never produced.The material was found by an insolvency specialist, who alerted historians after seeing labels on the boxes that clearly advertised their content. By strange coincidence, the bankrupt plant occupied the same grounds as a castle which, during the occupation of Czechoslovakia, was used as a residence by the Nazi governor of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, until his assassination in 1942. The items are believed to have been removed from the Communist party’s headquarters and hidden after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended its 41-year rule in what was then Czechoslovakia. Historians are unsure whether they were spirited away to ensure their safekeeping with a view to selling them for profit or to conceal evidence about the trial, which is widely considered one of the darkest stains on the party’s record. The material – consisting of six hours of 35mm black-and-white film and 80 hours of audio – is now with the Czech National Film Archive, which is asking the government for an estimated 12m koruna (£410,000) to fund delicate restoration work that would make it fit for public viewing. Michal Bragant, the archive’s chief executive, called the discovery “a great opportunity” because it would allow Czech archivists to compile a rare video depiction of Stalin-era show trials, very few of which have available long-form footage. “The priority is to make the footage safe,” Bragant said. “But it will be even safer once it’s publicly available, because we also need to make the knowledge safe. We still have not learned enough from the 20th century. The more people learn about it and the horror of the show trials, the safer we will be. “One day, when we can make it available for the public, you will be able to see the facial expressions, people’s movements, the body language and the staged performances. Because this was nothing to do with due process. It was all rehearsed.” Slánský, who spent much of the second world war exiled in Moscow, was put on trial along with 13 other high-ranking communists in November 1952, accused of “Titoism” and Zionism. The charges were fuelled by Stalin’s wish to purge eastern European communist parties after the Soviet Union’s break with the Yugoslav regime of Josip Broz Tito and his anger that Israel, born four years earlier, had not become a communist state. The trial had antisemitic overtones, with Slánský and 10 of the other defendants being Jewish. Slánský is believed to have been tortured into a convoluted, rehearsed confession, which he made in court before requesting to be punished with the death penalty. He was hanged in Prague’s Pankrac prison on 3 December 1952, but was exonerated during the liberalising Prague spring of 1968. Plans to turn the trial footage into a propaganda film were shelved after Stalin died in March 1953. Martin Vadas, a veteran Czech film-maker, who helped to authenticate the trial materials, said they could fill in large historical gaps. “There is a widespread misconception with the Slánský trial that we already know everything or almost everything,” he said. “The serious problem is that there is no judicial record. The official court file has disappeared. Now [with the film] we can expect to look evil in the eye.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/cambodian-town-breeds-resistance-malaria-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"The town that breeds resistance to Malaria drugs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/cambodian-town-breeds-resistance-malaria-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/cambodian-town-breeds-resistance-malaria-drugs","fields":{"headline":"The town that breeds resistance to Malaria drugs","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Pailin is a small settlement nestling in tropical rainforest near Cambodia’s border with Thailand. It is an unassuming town that lies at the centre of one of the country’s main logging areas. Pailin harbours secrets, however. It was in this town, in the late 1970s, that the Khmer Rouge set up one of its main strongholds and ruled Cambodia with a ferocity that caused at least two million deaths. It is a grim legacy, by any standards. But Pailin has another unwanted claim to fame, one that is also associated with widespread death. The town, it transpires, lies at the heart of a region that has seen successive waves of resistance to malaria drugs arise in local people and then spread across the globe. The resulting death tolls can be measured in millions of lives, say scientists. Just why malarial drug resistance has arisen here is not clear. Nevertheless scientists are emphatic: the region has seen the creation of several mutations in malaria parasites that have allowed them to shrug off medicines that once protected humans. Even worse, they have discovered that a new wave of malarial drug resistance has recently appeared in this tiny area and has already spread into Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, and begun to move into Myanmar and travel towards India and Bangladesh. The prospect has so alarmed scientists and politicians that the issue is to be raised as an emergency topic to be debated at the heads of Commonwealth meeting in London next week (16-20 April). There are 19 Commonwealth member states in Africa, the continent that is the most vulnerable to malaria. According to World Health Organisation statistics, about 90% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa. Hence the concern of many Commonwealth heads of state who believe their homelands are most at risk of a spreading malarial resistance. “The problem is that we are pussyfooting around,” said Professor Sir Nicholas White, of the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit. “The World Health Organisation has not provided the necessary leadership. We need very firm direct action and at present we are not getting that.” Resistance to major malaria drugs first appeared in the late 1950s when chloroquine – then a highly effective successful treatment for the disease – began to lose its efficacy. Crucially, this resistance first appeared in Pailin on the Cambodian-Thai border and then spread to Africa by the early 1980s. Several million deaths were added to the already grim toll of lives lost to the disease as a result. A new set of drugs, known as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamines, was then developed and used to treat malaria. But once more resistance to the drugs appeared and again it first manifested itself around Pailin before spreading westwards. Again the disease’s death toll soared. Then, at beginning of this century, a new set of malarial medicines was developed. Known as artemisinins, they were discovered in 1972 by Tu Youyou, a Chinese scientist who was awarded the 2015 Nobel prize in medicine for her work. Administered with a slower-acting second drug, artemisinins have become the medicine of choice for dealing with malaria across the globe, leading to improvements in malarial statistics with deaths and case numbers declining globally. But now scientists have recently discovered once more that resistance to key malarial drugs has evolved – and in exactly the same place as before: the farms and village that surround around Pailin. “That resistance has emerged in exactly the same place that resistance to chloroquine and then pyrimethamines emerged. The same very place. Around Pailin,” said White. Just why this tiny region of south-east Asia has proved to be such a fertile zone for the emergence of deadly resistance to malarial medicine is not clear, a point stressed by Dominic Kwiatkowski, director of the centre for genomics and global health at Oxford University. “We would love to know the answer, but it is not obvious,” Kwiatkowski told the Observer. “One idea is that resistance keeps arising here for historical reasons. Maybe it has something to do with the way that malarial medicines are administered here. But how exactly?” In fact, the This theory is just one of a great many other suggestions that have been put forward to explain why this resistance is appearing here first. The local strain of malaria parasites may have some special properties, or the ecology of the region may have features that boost the rise of resistance. “The crucial point is that we need to do something about it and once we have, we need to monitor the situation very, very carefully,” said Kwiatkowski. One factor that has recently become clear is that malarial drug resistance appeared very quickly in the region. Writing in Lancet Infectious Diseases in February, researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institut and collaborators reported that resistance to combination therapies that included artemisinins arose almost as soon as the treatment was introduced as a first-line malarial drug. However, that this loss of efficacy was not spotted, for a variety of reasons, until several years had passed. The implications of this failure were stressed by Ben Rolfe, head of the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance. “On our watch, drug resistant strains have spread almost unnoticed,” he told the BMJ recently (pdf). “As a result, we now risk a global resurgence of the disease.” The question facing scientists – and heads of state and health leaders – is straightforward: what can be done? White is emphatic. “We have a window of opportunity but it is closing rapidly,” he told the Observer. What is needed is a campaign, run with military efficiency, to use current drugs – while they still have some efficacy – not only on people who already have malaria but on those individuals who have been infected but who have not succumbed or shown symptoms of the disease. “These individuals carry small numbers of parasites and although they don’t get ill they are sources of new infections,” said White. “Mosquitos bite them, take their blood and spread it to others. They are the source of new infections.” The plan, proposed by White and other scientists, is that everyone in a village in a malaria hotspot should be treated with anti-malarial drugs – regardless of their symptoms. “It is called mass drug administration. It is very controversial but it works – if it is done as part of a concerted strategy. If you do it badly you will only make the problem of resistance worse. So this has to be done right. But if we don’t do it we won’t be able to eliminate malaria quickly enough, and if resistance worsens it may become untreatable,” says White. In addition, it is proposed that a third anti-malarial drug be added to the combination therapy currently used to treat those who have actually succumbed to malaria: a triple whammy instead of a double. Next week, Britain’s Department for International Development is expected to announce support for trials using triple combination drugs. For its part, WHO officials say that the dangers posed by the new malaria superbug are exaggerated and that better prevention efforts, monitoring and treatments will limit its spread from the Mekong region. Others are not so sure, however. The Malaria summit – organised by the Ready to Beat Malaria campaign is to be held in London on 18 April at next week’s Commonwealth summit and will be attended by scientists and business leaders, including Bill and Melinda Gates. They are pressing for urgent commitments from all world leaders to battle the disease. “We are currently on a cliff edge,” said a spokesman for Ready to Beat Malaria. “We can continue to battle the disease or risk an acute and deadly resurgence.” This view is backed by White. “We are running out of time and unless we act rapidly, people will suffer and the people who will suffer most will be the children of Africa.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/07/peter-kay-hailed-as-comedy-genius-over-car-share-finale","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T07:54:20Z","webTitle":"Peter Kay surprises fans with appearance at Car Share screening","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/07/peter-kay-hailed-as-comedy-genius-over-car-share-finale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/07/peter-kay-hailed-as-comedy-genius-over-car-share-finale","fields":{"headline":"Peter Kay surprises fans with appearance at Car Share screening","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Kay has made a rare public appearance at a charity screening of his comedy series Car Share. The comedian, who cancelled his live tour due to “unforeseen family circumstances” in December, took to the stage at the Blackpool Opera House on Saturday evening. Kay recently announced there would be three charity screenings of his BBC show at the Opera House, each one airing a special finale to the series, as well as an entirely improvised episode. The second series of the Bafta-winning programme ended on an emotional cliffhanger last year as Kay’s character, John, failed to reciprocate the advances of his car share colleague, Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. Viewers were dismayed when he said there were no plans to pen a further series. The event was held to raise money for the Lily Foundation, which Kay previously described as “an inspiring charity” that helps to improve the lives of children with mitochondrial disease. In footage of his brief appearance posted on Twitter, Kay, 44, told the audience: “Thank you very much for supporting the Lily Foundation raising money for mitochondrial disease. Very kind of you. I appreciate it. “Enjoy the last ever episode of Car Share. Don’t tell anyone the end. Or tell anyone about any hedgehogs.” Bowing as he left the stage, he added: “So thank you. Lots of love, enjoy, take care, bye-bye.” The audience had gathered in Blackpool to see a sneak preview of the final ever episode of Car Share. Car Share viewers were disappointed when Kay said he wanted to “quit while you’re ahead” last year. More than 100,000 fans signed an online petition demanding a conclusion to the series. The comedian later announced the special finale to reveal what happens next for John and Kayleigh, along with the improvised episode, Car Share: Unscripted. He had said at the time: “We were completely overwhelmed by the response and even though we’ve no plans to write a third series we knew we couldn’t end the story there.” Alison Moore, 45, said Kay appeared on stage after the interval between the episodes to a rapturous welcome. “People were shouting out that they loved him, some stood up to clap,” she told the Press Association. “He just said a few words for a couple of minutes, it was really good to see him.“He seemed really fine, relaxed and genuinely touched by the reaction he got. He’s held in such high regard up this way. It was just really good to see him.” A stream of fans took to Twitter to share their glee at the hit comic’s surprise appearance and praise the final episodes. One said the Car Share unscripted episode was “pure genius” and added that it was “a joy to see Peter on stage tonight”. Another said Kay’s appearance was “emotional” and “blew us away”. The screenings were initially announced on 29 March in what was the 44-year-old comedian’s first Twitter post since cancelling his live tour in December. He said in a statement the cancellation was due to “unforeseen family circumstances”. He added: “This decision has not been taken lightly and I’m sure you’ll understand my family must always come first.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/07/the-masters-2018-third-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T23:33:27Z","webTitle":"The Masters 2018: third round – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/07/the-masters-2018-third-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/07/the-masters-2018-third-round-live","fields":{"headline":"The Masters 2018: third round – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What a third round! Some amazing performances: 65s for Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler and Jon Rahm, a 66 for Tommy Fleetwood. But it’s all about Patrick Reed’s 67, and those two eagles, because he’s the one with the three-shot lead going into Masters Sunday. He’s the form horse, having made 18 birdies and two eagles in 54 holes of golf so far this week. But nothing’s certain. Rory had a four-shot lead going into Sunday in 2011, you’ll remember. Greg had six on the field in 1996. So anything can happen. It promises to be a classic ... or a procession. Either way, you’ll not want to miss a shot. See you tomorrow, when the 2018 Masters begins in earnest around Amen Corner! -14: Reed -11: McIlroy -9: Fowler -8: Rahm -7: Stenson -6: Fleetwood, Watson, Leishman -5: Thomas, Spieth -4: D Johnson -3: Smith, Rose, Oosthuizen Reed’s putt slips to the right of the cup. But no matter. That’s par, a 67 to go with his 69 and 66, and he’s three in the lead going into Sunday. Par for Leishman. Reed is calmness personified. This has been one hell of a performance ... and he serves up more brilliance by caressing his second into the green, using the banking on the right to send his ball curling in towards the flag. He’ll have a ten-foot look at birdie, a second 66 in a row, and a four-shot lead going into Masters Sunday! Wow! Reed’s playing partner Leishman has hoicked his drive deep into the trees down the left. He’s a long way back too. He appears to be contemplating a miracle smash through the smallest of gaps between two trunks. Yep, he’s going for it. And he hits a pearler, running his ball up to the front edge of the green ... well, nearly. But that was something else from where he was. I suppose in his position, eight off Reed’s lead, there’s no point being meek and mild. Fortune certainly favoured the brave there. Reed, his spirit buoyed by that magnificent par save on 17, crashes a huge drive down the last. He looks solid as a rock right now. He’s had opportunities to wobble, but every time he’s come back stronger. Whether that’ll survive a night tossing and turning, thinking about winning his first major championship, is another matter of course. But there’s plenty of time for those considerations; for now let us consider only Saturday matters. If he can eke out a birdie here, he really will have one arm in the green jacket! Reed will have heard the roar, and worked out exactly what was going on. You could forgive him for shaking at the prospect of missing his par putt and his lead shrinking to two ... but he’s nerveless, and strokes it into the middle of the cup! What a wonderful up and down from a very tight spot at the back. Meanwhile a 70 for Henrik Stenson, and he ends the third round at -7. -14: Reed (17) -11: McIlroy (F) -9: Fowler (F) -8: Rahm (F) -7: Stenson (F) -6: Fleetwood (F), Watson (F), Leishman (17) From the bank at the back of 17, Reed lifts a gentle chip to ten feet. Delicate brilliance, especially under the circumstances. Then up on 18, Rory trundles in his putt! Full advantage taken, after that big break from his wild drive! He signs for a 65, and will be in the final pairing tomorrow with Reed. He’s -11. Yes, Patrick Reed is fine. He’s on pine straw, but he’s not quite made it to the line of trees, and therefore has a clear route to the green. He overcooks his iron in, and the ball tumbles down the back. That’ll be a testing up and down, but we’ve said that before, and he’s holed out! Meanwhile on 18, Rory also has a full view of the green. He hits a big fade and lands it pin high, 20 feet to the right of the cup. What he’d give for a birdie finish. A huge break for McIlroy on 18. He slices his drive into the trees down the right, but gets a big kick back out onto the fairway. Whether he’s got a route into the green or not remains to be seen, but he can thank the golfing gods either way. Back on 17, Reed’s a bit wayward off the tee too, sending his drive into the pines down the right. He might not be in too deep, but again, we’ll have to see. Meanwhile up on 18, Jordan Spieth signs for a 71, having come back impressively with those birdies at 13 and 15. But at -5, the chances of a second green jacket look pretty slim, given how Patrick Reed is carrying on. Reed’s putt across 16 isn’t the best he’s hit today. He leaves himself four feet short ... and pushes his par effort to the right. His second bogey at a par-three on this back nine. His lead is now only four. Only four! But McIlroy’s up and down on 17 now looks even more valuable. -14: Reed (16) -10: McIlroy (17) Reed’s shot into 16 spins off to the bottom left of the green; the pin’s top left. A 45-footer for birdie. The way things have been going for this amazing young American today, he’ll probably make it. On 17, McIlroy can only take his medicine and chip out from the pine straw. But he wedges his third to 18 inches, and that’s a great par from the position he found himself off the tee. Up on 18, birdie for Justin Thomas, who signs for a 70. He’s -5. McIlroy pushes his drive at 17 into the trees down the right. And he may be snookered behind a trunk. The footage was on delay, and as he contemplated the trouble he’s likely to face, the cheer generated by Reed’s chip-in for eagle crackled across the course. You could see the realisation of what had most likely occurred flash across McIlroy’s face. Reed is finding it easy all right: he’s just eagled another par five! He’s lobbed his wedge into the cup at 15 from the front right of the green! A high lob, a couple of bounces, and an unerring trundle into the cup! In his first 14 rounds at Augusta National, he’d made one eagle. He’s just made two today in three holes! And he’s now five clear of McIlroy in second place. This is quite sensational! The 2018 Masters is beginning to look like his to lose ... though there’s many a slip between cup and green jacket at Augusta, as well we know. -15: Reed (15) -10: McIlroy (16) -9: Fowler (F) -8: Rahm (F) -7: Stenson (16) Rory knocks his chip four feet past the hole. Enough to furrow the brow. But he makes the putt coming back, and that’s another salvaged par. He’s battling to stay on the leader’s shoulder; Reed by comparison is finding the game so much easier today. A par for Stenson as well. The rain is coming down again. Nothing too dramatic yet, not like earlier, but it’s wet enough. Reed takes on the water at 15, and his 3-wood only just gets over the creek. His ball ends to the right of the green ... but it’s dry. His playing partner Leishman lets his grip go in the rain, and his ball sails miles right. He stays out of the creek too, but he’s got a testing chip to the green from way out there. Meanwhile on 16, Rory pushes his 9-iron just off the right of the green. He’s close to the flag, but it’ll be a testing chip nonetheless. Rickie Fowler’s second into 18 is nothing more than average. He’s left with a 30-foot uphill birdie putt with a gentle left-to-right break. And he would have made it, too, with a couple more joules of energy. That’s a sensational seven-under-par 65, matching Jon Rahm’s best-of-week effort from earlier. It’s his first bogey-free round here in 29 attempts. He ends the third round at -9. Could the immensely likeable Californian break his major duck this week? -13: Reed (14) -10: McIlroy (15) -9: Fowler (F) -8: Rahm (F) -7: Stenson (15) A huge birdie for Rory McIlroy at 15! Having taken his medicine from the trees, he wedges to the back of the green, then holes in a 15-foot left-to-right curler. He moves into second spot on his own at -10, three off Reed’s lead. Birdie for Henrik Stenson too: he’s been steady today, if not spectacular, and isn’t out of this by any stretch of the imagination. He’s -7. Bubba Watson pars the last, and signs for a 68. At -6 going into Sunday, the two-time champion will be a hovering presence felt by the leader, whoever he may be. Almost certainly Patrick Reed, let’s face it: he negotiates two ridges across the 14th green from 100 feet to five. What a wonderfully weighted putt, and he’s making no mistake in tidying up for par. Here, Jordan Spieth isn’t quite out of this yet. He’s birdied the two par-fives on the back nine, 13 and 15, and suddenly he’s -5 again. He’ll probably require Reed to have some sort of meltdown, but these things happen round Augusta, as Spieth himself knows all too well. See also: McIlroy, who lifts a wedge over the trees down the left of 15 and onto the fairway. Medicine taken. Rickie Fowler had birdied 15, and he follows that with another at 17. This one was the result of a gorgeous short iron which very nearly slam-dunked into the cup. The popular Californian, who had two top-five finishes in the majors last year, in the US Open and PGA, jumps into a share of second place! -13: Reed (13) -9: Fowler (17), McIlroy (14) -8: Rahm (F) McIlroy’s tee shot at 15 bounds into the trees down the left. He’ll not be able to make the green in two from there, surely. He’s not managed to build on the momentum of that eagle on 8 at all. Patrick Reed on the other hand, has grown and grown since birdie on the same hole. He’s got a route to the green from the pine needles down the side of 14, and bashes his second onto the right-hand edge of the putting surface. The flag’s over the other side, but that’s not half bad from where he was. He’s playing calmly and with confidence. He’ll take some beating, unless the pressure of closing out his first major begins to do its awful thing. The field needs a little help from Reed, and he might have given them it by hooking his drive at 14 into trees. We’ll see. Up on the green, Stenson and McIlroy have both sent their second shots 12 feet past the flag, setting up birdie chances. Neither can convert. We’re not at the stage yet where these chances simply can’t be missed ... there’s too much narrative to unfold yet ... but spurning them doesn’t help, and McIlroy’s chest heaves a sigh accordingly. Jon Rahm finds the front of the 18th with his second. He’s faced with a putt that’s the best part of 100 feet uphill. He rolls it up the ridge to three feet, a simply wonderful effort from there. Par, and he signs his name to a best-of-week 65! He’s the new clubhouse leader at -8. Meanwhile the actual leader Reed, in the no-nonsense fashion, curls his left-to-right breaker into the cup at 13 for eagle! He moves four clear at the top, and in this mood will take some catching. -13: Reed (13) -9: McIlroy (13) -8: Rahm (F), Fowler (16) And McIlroy can’t afford a mistake, because coming behind him, Patrick Reed is playing like a dream. He’s split the 13th fairway too, but he’s not making a mistake with his approach like Rory. A long iron arrowed straight at the flag, one of the shots of the week, and he’ll have a 12-foot look at eagle! Rory chips wonderfully to four feet. And rolls in the par saver! On the one hand, that’s not ideal, having blasted a lovely drive down the middle of the hole. On the other, serious disaster loomed when, for a terrible moment, he feared his ball was lost. That’s a stunning scramble in the circumstances, having got himself into terrible trouble. He blows his cheeks out hard, knowing he’s got away with one there. McIlroy’s found his ball! He’s standing waist-deep in the flowers, with a grim look on his grid. Can he get a swing to this? It looks as though he’s going to give it a whack. This could be costly. But he manages to punch it out onto the fringe! That at least gives him a chance to get up and down to scramble his par. What drama! That brief tempest nearly knocked McIlroy seriously off course. Even a bogey might be a reasonable result after that off-kilter, slippery second shot. The rain brings instant pain for Rory, whose grip slips as he hits his second into 13. That sends his ball high into the bank of azaleas to the left of the green. He might have lost that. He’s looking for it with great concern on his face. Ah, the rain has eased off, which is the only bit of good news. Reed’s tee shot to 12 is a little strong, over the back left. The pin’s in the immediate environs, just on the green, but Reed is overly aggressive with his chip and sends his ball sailing 12 feet past. He can’t knock in the return, and slips back to -11. Ever the good metaphor, the rain suddenly comes down very heavily. Wow. Seems like the forecasters knew what they were taking about after all. -11: Reed (12) -9: McIlroy (12) -8: Rahm (17) -7: Fowler (14) -6: Fleetwood (F), Watson (15), Stenson (12), Leishman (12) Cameron Smith is making a move! The 24-year-old Aussie birdied 2, 13 and 15, and now he’s nearly holed in one at 16. He’ll kick in to move to -5. Back-to-back birdies for Bubba, at 14 and 15, and he’s right up there at -6. Justin Rose creams an iron into 15 to set up a ten-footer for eagle, but he doesn’t hit his putt and has to settle for birdie. He’s -3. Rahm eases his second at 17 to ten feet, then registers his second birdie on the bounce: he’s -8. Patrick Reed has made three birdies in a row on three separate occasions this week. Can he register his first run of four? Not quite. But it’s a beautifully weighted putt on 11, and he’s tapping in for his par. Still -12. And it’s yet another close shave for Leishman, who is inches from birdie. He stays at -6, and looks super-frustrated. He’s not playing badly, but his putter is stone cold. Over on the 12th green, Rory splashes out of sand and somehow gets an abnormal amount of check spin, which means he’s got a longer par putt than he’d have liked. A testing seven footer. And in it goes! He fist-pumps the air. He knows how important that could be come tomorrow afternoon. He stays three behind Reed at -9. McIlroy’s tee shot at 12 hits the lip of the bunker at the front and topples back into the sand. Back up the hill, Reed is firing into 11. He aims straight at the flag, but he’s a little bit shy. His ball creeps onto the green. Should be an easy two-putt; it’s an outside chance for birdie. Or a good chance for birdie, the way Reed’s been putting today. Meantime up on 16, Rahm whips a gorgeous tee shot to ten feet, and rolls in the birdie effort. He’s -7. McIlroy sets his putt at 11 away on the right line ... but doesn’t give it quite enough. His ball dies at the last turn, and he’s forced to tap in for a par. He mouths the EFF word in frustration. So close to closing the gap at the top. Meanwhile up on 18, Tommy Fleetwood can’t make his par from distance, but a round of 66 is pretty fine work nonetheless. He goes into the final round at -6, well placed for a run at the title ... providing Patrick Reed doesn’t keep making birdies, that is. Rickie Fowler salvages his par on 13. He wedges from the drop zone to five feet, and knocks what’s left into the centre of the cup. He stays at -7, and after getting wet, that’ll be a small boost. (Speaking of getting wet, the forecast rain’s stayed away. Woo hoo!) On 11, McIlroy sends his second straight at the flag and leaves himself a 15-footer for birdie. And on 14, birdie for Bubba, the reward for screeching a wedge to a couple of feet. He’s -5. Rahm’s second into 15 goes over the back of the green. He knocks a fine wedge to six feet, but doesn’t hit the birdie putt, and remains at -5. Up on 18, Fleetwood’s second finds the heart of the green, but it’s teetering on the ridge that runs across the middle, and loses the battle of gravity. The ball comes rolling back, which means he’ll have a long two putts for his par and a round of 65. Disaster for Rickie Fowler on 13, as he loses his second shot, a fairway wood, to the right. And that means his ball doesn’t make it over the creek. Ker-plunk. Back on 10, Marc Leishman watches another birdie putt narrowly fail to drop. But Patrick Reed’s flat stick is hot now, and he curls in his short birdie chance to tear three clear at the top! Three birdies in a row! That lucky bounce from the trees on 8 has really kick-started something! -12: Reed (10) -9: McIlroy (10) McIlroy tickles his putt towards the cup at 10 from the thicker grass at the back of the green. It’s nicely judged and he cleans up for his par. Coming behind, Reed slams a monster drive down the track- then sends in a gentle draw to eight feet! What a response this is to McIlroy’s eagle. Meanwhile up on 17, Fleetwood gives himself the chance of a sixth birdie in a row, sending his second to ten feet. But nobody’s perfect, and he has to settle for a par, his putt sliding by low on the right. Nothing lasts forever. Patrick Reed crashes his drive down the middle of 9, then finds the centre of the green with his second. He’ll have an uphill look at birdie from 20 feet. His partner Marc Leishman wedges pin high. Reed to putt first - and he judges it perfectly, the slight left-to-right mover stopping for a nanosecond on the left lip before dropping! He’s restored his two-stroke lead! Leishman can’t make his from half the distance. Meanwhile up on 10, McIlroy’s drive finds the first cut down the right. Which means he can’t hold the green with his second. But his ball only just topples off the back, so he should be fine for a two-putt par from the fringe. Though this is Augusta, so let’s assume nothing. -11: Reed (9) -9: McIlroy (9) -7: Fleetwood (16), Fowler (12) -6: Rahm (13), Stenson (9), Leishman (9) -5: Thomas (11), D Johnson (10) -4: Watson (12) -3: Smith (13), Oosthuizen (12), Spieth (10) This Saturday at Augusta continues to astonish. Tommy Fleetwood knocks his tee shot at 16 to five feet. And in goes the putt! That’s five birdies in a row! 2-4-3-4-2. It should be six, really, but he didn’t hit that putt on 11. Hey, maybe that’s what kickstarted this. Anyway, Europe’s number one is three off Reed’s lead at -7. Leishman can’t get going today. He sets up a 12-foot birdie chance on 8, but his putt dies off to the right. He stays at -6. But Reed makes no mistake from similar distance, and he reclaims the lead at -10! Meanwhile Rahm’s hitting four from the dropzone at 13 ... and he hits the flagstick with his wedge in. He’ll escape there with par! On 11, Fowler rolls in a 20-foot par saver to keep hold of his momentum. Jordan Spieth bogeys 9 to drop to -3. Fleetwood takes two putts on 15 to make his birdie and move to -6. And Bubba continues to bubble: having dropped a shot at 11, he reclaims it immediately at 12. This is one heck of a Moving Day (Marc Leishman and Jordan Spieth excepted). -10: Reed (8) -9: McIlroy (9) -7: Fowler (11) -6: Fleetwood (15), Rahm (13), Stenson (9), Leishman (8) After The Lord Mayor’s Show admin dept. Rahm makes his first big mistake of the day, slam-dunking his second at 13 into Rae’s Creek. Rose misses a four-footer for birdie on 11 after sending a heatseeker of an iron towards the pin. Fleetwood crashes his second at 15 over the water and onto the green. Reed sends his drive at 8 into trees but gets a break back out and is able to eventually set up a 12-foot birdie chance. Hey, if Rory deserves some luck on that hole, so does Reed. Sensational from Rory McIlroy! (And slightly fortunate, if we’re being honest with ourselves.) He bumps his chip up onto the 8th green, over a couple of small hillocks. It’s rolling on the dancefloor. Still dead on line, but really moving. This could go a fair way past the flag unless it hits the stick ... which it does, flush, and drops into the cup! A preposterous eagle, and the grand-slam-seeking young genius from Northern Ireland is suddenly joint leader of the 2018 Masters! Back-to-back birdies for his partner Stenson, by the way, who moves to -6. But y’know. -9: McIlroy (8), Reed (7) -7: Fowler (10) -6: Rahm (12), Stenson (8), Leishman (7) -5: Fleetwood (14), Thomas (9), D Johnson (8) Fleetwood is purring at the moment. He eases his second into 14 to 18 inches. He’ll knock that in to move to -5. Dustin birdies the second par-five of the day: he’s -5 overall through 8. Fowler watches in disbelief as his ten-foot birdie putt on 10 stops a turn short. And Rory sends his second at 8, a full-blooded fairway wood, near the 9th tee box. He’ll have a pitch onto the green, so par shouldn’t be an issue, but he’ll have been wanting to pick up a shot at this par-five, like Big Dustin before him. Rahm’s tee shot at the 12th gets caught in the swirling wind, and his ball flies left and over the back. That’ll be a testing chip and putt for par. But he wedges to six feet and calmly rolls in the saver. He stays at -6. Meanwhile Leishman misses a three-footer for par on 7. He was looking to break his run of pars today, but not like that. He drops to -6. Another birdie for Tommy Fleetwood! This one comes at the par-five 13th, having safely found the putting surface in two. He’s not let that silly miss at 11 affect him at all. He’s -4 for his round and the Tournament. Meanwhile a huge cheer on 10, as Bubba - who had bogeyed 8 and missed a par tiddler on 9 - rakes in a huge one for a bounceback birdie. He’s -4. Jon Rahm fires one of the shots of the day straight at the flag at 11, whip-cracking an iron from the top of the hill. But he misses the four-footer for birdie. That’s a shame, he stays at -6. Bubba three-putts the 9th to drop back to -3. His playing partner Justin Rose reaches the turn in 35: he’s -3 too. Henrik Stenson hasn’t got going ever since taking that drop from the azaleas on 2. He sends his tee shot at 7 into the trees down the right. He can only find the sand guarding the front of the green with his second. So what happens next? You already know what happens next. He splashes out and into the cup! He’s back to -5. His partner McIlroy finds the back of the green, but can’t curl in from 20 feet. Par. Meanwhile Thomas hits a hideous eagle putt on 8, short and right, but he makes the four-foot birdie chance he leaves himself and moves to -5 alongside Stenson. Justin Thomas has been quiet since birdie at 2: a run of five pars since. But he’s just clattered a gorgeous fairway wood into 8, using the bank to the left of the green to guide his ball towards the flag. He’ll have a 25-foot look at birdie. Meanwhile birdie for Jordan Spieth at 7, to finally get his round going. He’s back to -4. Or will it?! Because Reed rolls in a 20-footer on 5 to card his first birdie of the day! Elsewhere Jon Rahm lands his second at the course’s hardest hole, the 10th, pin high, and rattles in the 12-footer he’s left with. And Rickie Fowler strokes in an uphill 20-footer on 8 to join a brand new second-placed group! Look out, there’s a Moving Day going on here, ladies and gentlemen. -9: Reed (5) -7: Fowler (8), McIlroy (6), Leishman (5) -6: Rahm (10) Sensational stuff from Rory McIlroy, who appears to be in the mood to move today! He whips his tee shot at 6 straight over the flag. It lands 18 inches past the cup, bounces and bites. It’s surely got to spin straight back into the cup. But it stops still. He’ll kick that in for a birdie that’ll bring him to within one stroke of Patrick Reed’s lead! Louis Oosthuizen, so often the bridesmaid at the majors, is threatening in yet another one. The 2010 Open champion and 2012 Masters runner-up started with a bogey today, but birdies at 3, 6 and now 7 have sent him up the leaderboard to -4. Meanwhile Tommy Fleetwood continues to play some lovely golf: he eases his tee shot over the stick at 12 and rolls in the right-to-left 18-foot slider he leaves himself. He’s -3! Fleetwood doesn’t hit his par putt on 11. Such a shame, because that was a gorgeous shot into the green, and he had the putt going on the correct line. But par will suffice. He taps in to stay at -2. Meanwhile McIlroy gives his birdie putt a good rap on 4, but it dies off to the right by the width of half a dimple. He bends over in exasperation, and it’s a terrible shame, though birdie there would have been a karmic outrage! On 5, Spieth sends his second into the bunker at the back. He splashes out to seven feet. But he can’t rescue his par. His first bogey of the day, and he drops to -3. Then coming behind, an absurd stroke of luck for Rory McIlroy. His tee shot ends in the deep trap to the left of the fairway. He smashes his second into the face of the bunker ... but it bounds forward towards the green anyway, running straight towards the cup and ending up 15 feet past the hole! That could have gone anywhere. He laughs heartily, making no attempt whatsoever to hide his outrageous good fortune. And why not. If he escapes with par after two dismal shots, that’ll be fine ... but what a smash and grab it’d be if he makes the birdie putt. The bad weather continues to stay away. Keep those fingers crossed. Especially as it’s all going well for Tommy Fleetwood, who is quietly moving up the leaderboard in his trademark unassuming style. Birdies at 2 and 9, moving him to -2, and now he’s sent a lovely draw into 11 to set up a seven-foot birdie attempt. A little trouble for the leader Patrick Reed on 3. His second span back off the green and down the big slope at the front, so he’s got a blind chip up, and not much surface between him and the flag. But he flops up beautifully to six feet. That was very brave. But he can’t knock in the par saver, which horseshoes out. A bogey that drops him back to -8, having hit wedge into the green. Three pars to start for Marc Leishman, who is now just one off. -8: Reed (3) -7: Leishman (3) -6: Fowler (6), McIlroy (4) Birdie for Bubba at 7. And another for McIlroy, who curls one in from the back of 4. It was never missing from the moment it left the face. Probably wise to update this leaderboard already, because everyone’s moving today all right. -9: Reed (2) -7: Leishman (2) -6: Fowler (6), McIlroy (4) -5: Rahm (8), Watson (7) Another birdie for Fowler, who sends his tee shot at 6 to ten feet and slides in the left-to-right putt! He’s -6, alone in third spot. The task of sharing a leaderboard berth with Rory McIlroy at -5 is now fielded by Jon Rahm, who sends his second at the par-five 8th to the edge of the green, then bounces his wedge home along a very aesthetically pleasing arc. An eagle, and like Fowler, he’s four under for his round already. Meanwhile a couple more pars in the final group for Patrick Reed and Marc Leishman, this time at 2. The expected rain has stayed away, which is good news. Hopefully that means the thunder and lightning won’t arrive either, but let’s not get greedy and tempt fate. A bit of rain we can all deal with. Rickie Fowler certainly won’t want a break in play, because he’s come flying out of the blocks today: a birdie at 5 now to go with his eagle at 2! He’s suddenly in third spot ... alongside Rory, who sends a high lob wedge into 3, then curls a 12-footer in for birdie! -9: Reed (1) -7: Leishman (1) -5: Fowler (5), McIlroy (3) -4: Watson (6), Thomas (4), Spieth (3), D Johnson (3), Stenson (2) Spieth’s putter goes cold again, this time on 3, a birdie chance from nine feet spurned. He’s opened with three pars: not ideal, but a vast improvement on yesterday, when he dropped three strokes in the first two holes. Pars at Tea Olive for the leading duo Patrick Reed and Marc Leishman. That’ll settle the nerves as the pair, both bidding for their maiden major, embark on the most important weekend of their sporting lives. Up on the 2nd green, Rory leaves his chip up onto the green 15 feet short, and doesn’t quite hit his dribbly birdie effort. Par. Stenson takes two putts as well to get down, and that’s a disappointing bogey. But if you will send your drive miles off target ... Rory has a route to the green. He’s hampered on his follow-through by the trunk of a tree, but goes for it anyway. He lashes a long iron to the left of the green, circumventing the bunker. He’ll have a straight look at the flag from where he ends up, but there’s a small bank and not much green on the other side. Stenson meanwhile has to drop out of the flowers, and smashes his third greenside. He chips up to 15 feet. Elsewhere, up on 18, it’s a 74 for Ian Poulter: he’s 74. And a 72 for Tiger Woods, who remains at +4. Meanwhile the reigning Players champion, the brilliant 22-year-old South Korean Si Woo Kim, is making some serious waves. Birdies at 7, 9, 13 and now 15 have zipped him up the leaderboard to level par for the Tournament. Trouble for Henrik and Rory off the 2nd tee. Stenson’s drive hits a loblolly down the left and bounds into the azaleas. McIlroy flashes one into the trees down the right. That’s pretty wild. Down on the green, Dustin joins the group at -4 after finding the putting surface in two and lagging his eagle putt up to tap-in range. Par for Spieth, who lets a fairly easy uphill birdie putt slip by from 12 feet. A fine up and down by Rory, who pitches up to three feet and scrambles his par. Stenson leaves his birdie putt well short, and settles for par too. Meanwhile playing partners Justin Thomas and Tony Finau both birdie 2. Already this leaderboard is sending shivers down the spine, and we’re only a few holes into Moving Day! -9: Reed -7: Leishman -5: Stenson (1) -4: Watson (4), Fowler (3), Thomas (2), Spieth (1), McIlroy (1) Another birdie for two-time winner Gerry Lester Watson Jr.! This one at 3, and he joins fellow Golf Boy Rickie Fowler at -4. Any old excuse to go Bubba-da-Bubba-da-button-up, eh? A huge stroke of luck for Spieth at 2. He slices his tee shot towards the woods. It’s heading into deep horrors, but his ball clanks off the ankle of some poor patron, and while that’s still wide, it’s not going to be in terrible trouble. A lucky break for Rory McIlroy, too, whose opening drive is heading for bother down the right; a favourable bounce back into the first cut saves him some heartache. But he doesn’t take advantage, sending his second down a swale to the right of the green. He’ll have a testing up and down if he wants to save par. His partner Henrik Stenson finds the heart of the green in regulation. Rickie Fowler scrapped hard for his 72 yesterday, a round that positioned him nicely for the weekend. And he’s taking advantage. He crashes his second at 2 to 20 feet from 230 yards, and rolls in the eagle putt! A flying start, and he’s -4. Spieth and DJ meanwhile both par the opening hole, neither man having found the dancefloor with their approaches. Tiger Woods was always chasing par down 15, having flayed his drive left. A bogey, but he’s bounced back in typical style by arrowing his tee shot at 16 straight at the flag. One more bounce and that could well have been a hole-in-one, but he’ll settle for a birdie that brings him back to +4. The much-fancied, always-dangerous Jordan Spieth is out and about! A safe drive down the middle of Tea Olive. His partner Dustin Johnson follows him down there. An eventful start to the round for Charley Hoffman: bogey, birdie, birdie. He’s -3. And birdie for Bubba at 2, who joins the group at -3. Meanwhile Tyrrell Hatton signs for a one-over 73: he’s +6. His playing partner Phil Mickelson bogeys the last and that’s a 74 for the three-time champ, who could never quite haul back that opening-hole triple bogey. He’s +7. Matt Fitzpatrick is in the clubhouse with a fine five-under 67. He’s level par for the Tournament now. Paul Casey is also back home, having shot a very acceptable 69. He’s +2 overall. And a brisk start by the local lad Russell Henley, who finished just outside the top ten here last year: birdies at 2 and 3, and he’s -1 for the Tournament. Thanks to Rob ... and you have to think Jon Rahm will already be ruing that opening-day 75. That awful tee shot at 16 on Thursday could end up being very costly. We’re getting ahead of ourselves of course, because he’s six off Patrick Reed’s lead, but look at it this way: after those birdies at 1 and 2, he’s on a run of six birdies in his last ten holes. He’s really turned this around. Easy to forget he’s only 23, and he’s only played here once before. A top-30 finish, since you ask. Anyway, it’s an opportunity for us to put up our first refreshed leaderboard of the third round... -9: Reed -7: Leishman -5: Stenson -4: McIlroy, Spieth -3: Rahm (2), D Johnson, Thomas -2: Hoffman (2), Smith (2), Watson (1), Fowler (1), Finau That’s your lot from me, so I’ll hand back to Scott to guide you through the rest of the day. Thanks for reading. Jon Rahm is another who will fancy his chances of putting himself in contention today, especially now he has birdied the first two holes. At -3 he is right in the mix. Could Spain have another Masters champion? A long way to go yet but this guy has all the tools. Jason Day’s form has been steadily improving this week and three birdies in the first seven holes today suggest he’s getting hotter. He’s -1 and now only eight shots off the leader Patrick Reed, who’ll start his round in 45 minutes. It’s a big gap, but Day in this mood could at least put himself back in contention. Tiger can only par the par-five 13th and Mickelson is similarly frustrated at 15. Poulter snaffles a birdie at 13 though. It’s moving day at the Masters and Matt Fitzpatrick’s charge is gathering pace. He has followed up his birdie spree with an eagle at 15. The Englishman is now –5 for the day and back to even par. Mickelson knocks one in from off the green for a birdie on 14. Can he repeat the Fitzpatrick magic at the next? Tiger has his arms aloft and laps up the acclaim of the crowd with a wry smile after missing the drink from the tee on 12 for the first time this week. The birdie putt dives off to the left though. Poulter scrambles another par by sinking a missable putt for the second hole in a row to stay at +7. Thanks Scott. And welcome, wherever you may be. The conditions are quite calm in Augusta right now but that doesn’t stop Mickelson landing his second in the Rae’s Creek tributary at the par-five 13th. After a drop he gives himself a chance of saving par with a nice chip but leaves the putt short to drop back to +7. Hatton follows suit with a bogey to return to +5. Webb Simpson has birdied 10. That means he’s three under for his round today, and the hottest player out there on the sodden course. The 2012 US Open champ is +2. Also going well: Paul Casey, whose birdie at 13 takes him to two under for the day, and +3 for the Tournament, and his compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick, who has birdied 7, 8 and 12, a fine response to bogey at 5, moving to +3 overall as well. And with that, I’m off for a big plate of Hamburger Helper, the only food-flavored food product to be marketed by a singing golf glove. Rob Bleaney will be your guide for the next hour. I should be back in plenty time for the leaders, severe weather delays, etc. The entertainingly hot-headed Tyrrell Hatton bogeys 11. Upon failing to make his par putt, he spins his putter into the air, fails to catch it as it falls, and watches - still seething - as it bounces off towards the water. He’s spared the indignity of fishing it out by one bounce. He picks it up sheepishly, taps in for the bogey, then slams the flat stick into his bag with all the force he can muster. I mean, yes, yes, won’t someone think of the kids, all that ... but it is amusing to watch golfers slip into hot funks, rolling boils, impotent rages, etc. Anyone who’s ever tried to play the game can surely sympathise. And to be fair to Hatton, he knows how to use this stuff as fuel: his next act is to clip a business-like tee shot at 12 to seven feet! In goes the birdie putt, and he’s +4 again. I enjoy watching Tyrrell Hatton. He’s great. Tiger gives his uphill putt a good rap. It’s always going to reach, but it’s always going to stay out on the right. A par, and he turns in 36, still at +4. But that second shot deserved so much more. Meanwhile on 11, a break for Phil, who has a route through the trees straight to the green! He punches out low, sending his ball scampering towards the green below. Amazingly, he leaves himself a 20-foot birdie putt. He very nearly makes it, too, a right-to-left slider missing by inches to the left, but he’d have taken par when he was watching his tee shot sail towards green nonsense. He remains at +6. “Fore right!” Yes, folks, Phil’s on the tee. Another wayward drive, this time down 11. He’s in the pines again. He wasn’t too far away from draining a long birdie putt on 10, too; how quickly momentum can shift in a round of golf. See also: Tiger, who lands his second at 9 pin high. He’s left with a six footer across the green for birdie ... but hold on, the backspin suddenly bites, and sends his ball rolling back down the green. He’s still got a birdie putt, but it’s from 30 feet now. A chance for a third birdie in four holes suddenly doesn’t look so good. Tiger makes it two birdies in three holes, getting up and down from the front of the large 8th green without too much fuss. He’s back to +4, where he started the day. But it’s back-to-back bogeys for his partner Ian Poulter, who drops to +7. With DeChambeau making birdie at 7 and rising to +6, Poults is now rock bottom in 53rd place. A round with Jeff Knox tomorrow would be something to look forward to, though, right? Kevin Kisner, who has come close in recent years to winning the Players and the PGA, is usually a presence at the majors these days. The South Carolinian has started well today, with birdies at 2 and 3. He’s +1. Along with Webb Simpson, who is two under for his round through 8, at +3, Kisner has the best round going right now. Mickelson bundles his second at 9 to the back of the green. He’s not far from the flag, which is tucked away in the far corner. And in goes the birdie putt from the fringe! Not a bad way to follow up that sensational eagle. He reaches the turn in 37, which is pretty good going when you consider he opened his round with a whiff, a triple bogey and a bogey. But that’s sort of Phil in microcosm; it’s integral to his charm. How good would it be if he won the US Open this year? There wouldn’t be a dry eye in New York State. Anyway, he’s +6. Bryson DeChambeau was the low amateur here a couple of years ago. This is his first appearance as a professional, and he’s been steady without being spectacular so far: a couple of two-over 74s to make the cut easily enough. But the eccentric and entertaining young Californian is struggling a bit today: bogeys at 2, 4 and 5, and suddenly he’s assisting Mickelson in propping up the rest of the field, in a tie for 52nd at +7. DeChambeau won’t be following Mickelson, Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Crenshaw, Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia in becoming Masters champion as a former Silver Cup winner. Not this year anyway. But at 24, he’s got plenty of time left. This might not be Tiger or Phil’s week. But you can’t keep good men down. Tiger gently swishes a gorgeous tee shot at 6 to seven feet, and makes no mistake with the putt. It’s only his sixth birdie of the week. He’s +5. Meanwhile from the centre of the 8th fairway, Mickelson thrills ‘em again by taking driver off the deck and creaming it from 271 yards to nine feet! The whoops and hollers as the ball serenely progressed up the big green towards the hole warmed the heart. What swashbuckling brilliance! Please make the eagle putt. Please. And in it goes! That was simply sensational! His fourth eagle in competitive action at 8! Some more Masters crystal in the bag. He’s +7. Paul Casey birdies 9. He reaches the turn in 35 strokes, having also birdied 6 but dropped a shot at 7. He’s +4. He was first out today, and as 53 players survived the cut, is playing with a marker. That marker being the legendary Jeff Knox. Any old excuse to dig out this wonderful profile of Augusta’s most famous member since Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mickelson tugs another drive into trees down the right, this time at 7. His ball plays bagatelle with the branches, before dropping into bother. He’s spent a ridiculous amount of time wandering around, wide-eyed and dazed, in the woods this week. His swing obstructed again, he can only smack a low one back out onto the fairway. A chip up to ten feet represents a good chance to save par ... and he takes it! Five straight pars, and that one’s a real bonus. But he can’t keep flaying drives off line like this. Tyrrell Hatton has been playing well this morning. Several birdie chances already, though he’s been passing them up, much to his trademark heart-on-sleeve irritation. But finally the young Englishman takes one, hitting his tee shot pin high to 15 feet at 6 and rolling in the putt. He’s +4. His playing partner Phil Mickelson has made four consecutive pars since that nightmare triple-bogey/bogey start. He remains at +9. The young Texan Doug Ghim - who as the only remaining amateur in the field is guaranteed to win the Silver Cup, providing he completes the 72 holes - joins Webb Simpson in red figures for his round today. A birdie at 2, thanks to a delightful wedge to ten feet, and he’s +3. Tiger clips a fine tee shot at the par-three 4th to 12 feet, but there’s a big right-to-left curl on the putt he’s left with, and it’s never going in. Another par, though, and at least the ship is steadied. And the sun comes out! Though not in Ian Poulter’s heart, who came up short off the tee and couldn’t get up and down from the wrong side of the bunker at the front. He’s back to +6. The rain continues to tip down. It’s going to oscillate between Spring Shower and Manchester all day, with a good chance of some thunder rolling in mid-afternoon. Hopefully we’ll swerve the latter, and there will be no stoppages. But the last few groups might not be out long before they’re heading back to the clubhouse. Fingers crossed that’s an overly pessimistic reading of the forecast. Anyway, there’s some better news for Tiger, who splashes out of the deep bunker at the front of 3 to a couple of feet, and tidies up for his first par of the day. Woods is struggling here. He sends a big slice into the trees down the right of 3. Patrons wielding green-and-white umbrellas scatter. He can only punch out, sending his ball scampering up to the bunker at the side of the green. He’ll need a good up-and-down to avoid the ignominy of three straight bogeys to start. Meanwhile birdie for Paul Casey at 6, the reward for a fine tee shot at the troublesome par-three, landed ten feet from a pin tucked front-left behind sand. Having parred his way up until then, he’s +4. Tiger continues to faff about with his irons. Having driven into the big fairway bunker down the right of 2, and taken his medicine by chipping out, he sends his wedge into the sand guarding the front left of the green. Another mistake from the centre of the fairway. He splashes out to ten feet, but his par putt drifts wide left, and there goes another stroke. He’s +6. That’s his first bogey on a par-five this week. He wears the look of a man trying to keep the lid on a fume. His playing partner and old pal Ian Poulter makes a birdie that repairs the damage of bogey at 1: the new Houston Open champ is +5. The rain falls in Georgia. But it’s a bright start today for the 2012 US Open champ Webb Simpson. Birdies at 1 and 2 and he’s +3 for the Tournament. Kiradech Aphibarnrat birdies 4; the big Thai likes this course, having tied for 15th on his only other appearance in 2016, and he’s +4. Simpson and Aphibarnrat are the only folk making positive moves so far, though it’s early doors of course. The romantics had been dreaming of a duel between the old foes Phil and Tiger. In retrospect, that was probably wishful thinking. Ah well. At least both survived the cut. Though both players will right now be wondering whether it was worth it. Woods has once again bogeyed the opening hole from the middle of the fairway; he slips to +5. Mickelson, a couple of groups ahead, fared even worse down Tea Olive, lashing his opening drive into deep nonsense down the right, taking an air shot while attempting to extricate himself from the situation, a branch impeding his backswing, and subsequently running up a triple-bogey seven. He’s followed that up with bogey at 2, and he’s just had to get up and down from the back of 3 to save his par. He’s +9 and propping up the field. Oh Lefty! Here we go, then! It’s Moving Day at the Masters. The forecast is for rain, very possibly thunder, and almost definitely hot golf. Look at this leaderboard, packed with stars and all manner of narrative possibility ... -9: Reed -7: Leishman -5: Stenson -4: McIlroy, Spieth -3: D Johnson, Thomas -2: Finau, Fowler, Oosthuizen, Rose, Watson, Hoffman -1: Smith, Kuchar, Rahm, Wiesberger E: Walker, Matsuyama, Z Johnson, Fleetwood, Hadwin +1: Li, Henley, Cabrera Bello, Singh, Kodaira +2: Couples, Moore, Vegas, Molinari, Stanley, Grace, Day +3: Reavie, Kisner, Harman, Berger, Kaymer +4: Ghim (a), Langer, Scott, DeChambeau, Woods +5: Poulter, Simpson, Schauffele, Hatton, Mickelson, Fitzpatrick, Aphibarnrat, Casey ... though sadly the weekend will be missing some big names who have missed the cut, a roll call of greats which includes the former champions Sandy Lyle, Charl Schwartzel, Jose-Maria Olazabal, Danny Willett, Trevor Immelman, Ian Woosnam, Larry Mize, Angel Cabrera, Mark O’Meara ... and the reigning champ Sergio Garcia. No need to further riff on Sergio’s pain, we all know what happened on Thursday. Suffice to say, as his 15-over-par title defence came to an end in the gloaming yesterday evening, he exited the stage having made a glorious birdie at 18. Of course he did. Oh Sergio!

We’re a self-funded club. So we know where we are, we know our expectations,” Stuart Webber says. “Norwich is pretty unique; we’re the only club in the county, we’ve got a massive supporter base, we’ve got a massive catchment area. We do things because it’s right for our football club and we felt that it was right to revamp the academy and invest in it.” Webber is giving a tour of Norwich City’s training centre. An intense 34-year-old recruited from Huddersfield last year to become the club’s first sporting director, he has a plan to make this compact site, hidden on a country lane off the city’s southern bypass, a cutting-edge facility. There will be new schoolrooms, changing rooms and pitches. The upgrade will help maintain the academy’s category A status but also – if Webber is successful – form the heart of the club’s footballing philosophy. He intends for the academy to produce one homegrown youngster capable of starting for the first team each year. For Delia Smith, the club’s majority shareholder, the new direction is something she has been waiting for. “This change of strategy has been the best experience I’ve had since I’ve been a board director,” she says. “I think the structure of the all-singing, all-dancing chief executive, you could see in the end that can’t really work. You can’t have a one-man show. My big dream has always been that we work together and in the past that hasn’t always happened. “On the academy side I feel very passionate. Not many people listen to me much but when I first became a board director [in 1996] I went to visit a football club called Auxerre and their manager, Guy Roux. The first thing he said to me, and he didn’t speak much English, was: ‘I never buy footballers.’ The academy had their own little stadium, they had houses built on site. Roux knew all the youngsters by name. And the record is there, isn’t it? They played in Europe, they never went out of Ligue 1. And Auxerre is the size of Thetford. Wow. That’s the kind of club I want Norwich to be. I want it to feel like it is part of the community.” Smith’s passion is shared by Webber, who has worked in youth roles at Wrexham and Liverpool, though he sees an opportunity to take advantage of modern developments. “There’s loads of academies doing unbelievable work right now,” he says. “We’ve got world-class coaching staff in our country, world-class sports scientists, physicians, recruitment officers; 100%, we’re leaders at that. If you look at the ideas and philosophy Dan Ashworth has brought in since he went into the FA, it’s filtered through. There are thought-provoking people coming into the game, people who want to challenge, rather than it being an ex-player asking: ‘What shall I do now?’” Last month Norwich opened and, in short order, completed a bond issue designed to fund the academy redevelopment. Run in association with Tifosy, Gianluca Vialli’s football crowd-funding company, it raised its maximum target of £5m before it even opened to the public. The bond offered investors a 5% annual return on their unsecured investment, but it seemed also a vindication of the Webber strategy, one implemented alongside the managing director, Steve Stone. Stone has subsequently suggested such a model of raising money could be used again, perhaps to fund a safe standing section at Carrow Road. But as Webber points out, the academy project is not a luxury. It has to work. A self-funded club has obvious limitations. Since his arrival Webber has set about reducing Norwich’s wage bill in anticipation of a first season in the Championship without parachute payments. Most of the players he has recruited have come from the lower leagues in Germany, as has the club’s first foreign head coach, Daniel Farke. For some the new club structure and emphasis on the academy is simple cost-cutting. Norwich are off the pace in the Championship and were beaten 4-1 at QPR on Monday. As investors continue to pour into English football, some Norwich fans feel left behind. “‘Release the purse strings’, that’s the actual phrase,” says Smith. “Why don’t the board release the purse strings? Well, I certainly feel that my experience of the Premier League was that we never had any money. Even if we got promoted this year, we still wouldn’t have had any money, the way the wages are. I think the first time a supporter came up and gave me a rollicking face to face I was bit shocked. But you do get used to it over time. And I do understand their passion. I know. If you are a football supporter you understand. But I think perhaps the younger ones now don’t understand how it was before the money started corrupting it.” It was Smith’s decision to pursue a self-funding model for Norwich but she insists she would be open to outside investment: “We’re not going to stand in the way.” She also says she would be willing to consider putting the club into fan ownership. But any agreement would have to be one she felt was right for the club. As Stone points out, “The club is already under supporter ownership.” Three very different characters, Smith, Stone and Webber clearly share a vision for the club, one that attempts to build a local identity. But convincing supporters to share it is not a guarantee. “I think what we’ve achieved here with Stuart and Steve is a wonderful sense of unity, solidarity with each other,” Smith says. “We’ve got some work to do I think in getting our supporters really to buy into that with us. But it would be wonderful if we could go through everything and stick together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/07/bath-leicester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T15:35:42Z","webTitle":"Sione Kalamafoni shows his class as Leicester launch comeback at Bath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/07/bath-leicester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/07/bath-leicester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Sione Kalamafoni shows his class as Leicester launch comeback at Bath","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It was more bash than clash as Leicester, picking up the scent of the play-offs as they tend to do at this time of the year, powered their way to a bonus-point victory to move into the top four and leave Bath, who have lost seven of their last 10 Premiership matches, facing the European Challenge Cup next season. Bath had the opportunity to record a hat-trick of Premiership victories over Leicester for the first time, but even though the lead changed hands five times before the Tigers pulled away in the final eight minutes, it was a largely one-sided contest in which the scrum for once held a decisive sway. A crowd of more than 60,000, slightly down on last season, was hushed for long periods as a match that revealed why the English clubs have struggled in Europe this season – largely one-paced and scarred with penalties as both sides infringed wilfully – swivelled on a series of scrums near the Bath line that took up eight minutes of the first half. Leicester’s England loose-head prop Ellis Genge was making his first Premiership start since the beginning of December and set out to pack four months into an hour. He was up against Shaun Knight in the scrum, Bath’s fifth-choice tight-head and a prop known more for his size and shape than technique. Bath were leading by two Rhys Priestland penalties to one from George Ford, captaining Leicester against the club he left last summer without waving a fond farewell, when the sequence of scrums started. Jonathan Joseph’s tackle had foiled Jonny May and Beno Obano had driven back Graham Kitchener, but when Kahn Fotuali’i was sent to the sin-bin for handling in a ruck, Leicester turned the penalty into a scrum. Knight buckled under pressure from Genge three times before being sent to the sin-bin. Bath had to sacrifice a second row for a replacement tight-head, Victor Delmas, but he was threatened with a yellow card by the referee, Wayne Barnes, after another scrum ended on the floor. And so it went on until Leicester produced the element of surprise by moving the ball against a side that was two players short and Adam Thompstone crossed unopposed in the corner. Knight was still in the sin-bin when Bath regained the lead, ironically from a scrum free-kick taken quickly by Taulupe Faletau and finished by Tom Dunn. The hosts were a few centimetres from a second try with the last play of the first half but Matt Banahan’s dexterity at scooping up Joseph’s chip and remaining in play was not complemented by his grounding, losing control of the ball as he went to press it down. It was as good as it would get from Bath. Priestland’s boot rewarded stray attacks in the second half with two penalties, but their strength was sapped by having to defend for prolonged periods. They did so resolutely but buckled when Sione Kalamafoni first scented space in the middle of a ruck near the line for a try and quickly followed up by stepping away from his opposite number, Faletau. Bath could not get a regular supply of ball, securing only 30% of possession. After one move that lasted 23 phases ended, Leicester started another that went through 19 before the flanker Luke Hamilton forced his way over from close range to secure the bonus point. The Tigers were by then down to 14 men, Thompstone having seen yellow for not taking due care of the airborne Bath full-back James Wilson, and they made the scoreline more reflective of the game when Telusa Veainu scored their fifth try three minutes from time. It was the second time Bath had taken the fixture against Leicester here. They came from behind to win last season having recorded six consecutive Premiership victories over the Tigers at the Recreation Ground and the sacrifice of home advantage made little difference. They were overpowered up front with Genge, who cost his side three points in the first half when a kickable penalty was reversed following his attempt to escalate a dispute with Dunn. “I think he is more bark than bite,” said the Leicester director of rugby, Matt O’Connor, who rated his side’s second-half display as their best of the season. It probably was, but it was one fit for the Premiership in its splendid isolation rather than a wider constituency, highlighting again where its game is breaking down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/07/facebookgot-into-mess-cant-get-out-of-it-mark-zuckerberg-surveillance-capitalism","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T21:00:11Z","webTitle":"How Facebook got into a mess – and why it can’t get out of it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/07/facebookgot-into-mess-cant-get-out-of-it-mark-zuckerberg-surveillance-capitalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/07/facebookgot-into-mess-cant-get-out-of-it-mark-zuckerberg-surveillance-capitalism","fields":{"headline":"How Facebook got into a mess – and why it can’t get out of it","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ponder this … and weep. The United States, theoretically a mature democracy of 327 million souls, is ruled by a 71-year-old unstable narcissist with a serious social media habit. And the lawmakers of this republic have hauled up before them a 34-year-old white male, one Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, the sole and impregnable ruler of a virtual country of about 2.2 billion people who stands accused of unwittingly facilitating the election of said narcissist by allowing Russian agents and other bad actors to exploit the surveillance apparatus of his – Zuckerberg’s – virtual state. How did we get into this preposterous mess? Answering this question requires an understanding of (among other things) the peculiar nature of digital technology, the ideology of Silicon Valley, the astonishing political naivety of Zuckerberg, the ethical tunnel vision of software engineers and – most important – the business model that has come to be known as “surveillance capitalism”. A key factor was the astonishing capacity of network effects to facilitate monopolistic outcomes. Facebook is a closed private platform that was constructed on a public platform – the world wide web – which in turn was built on the open internet, a public facility created by taxpayers’ money. It was created by Zuckerberg as a software application that enabled people to hook up with one another and share personal information. Because the underlying architecture – the web – already existed, and because the service it provided was free, it spread like wildfire. And although it was not the first social networking application, it was more astutely designed and robust than incumbents such as MySpace and it eventually wiped them out. As it grew, the network effect kicked in – to the point where if a teenager wanted to get laid s/he simply had to be on Facebook. So in the social-networking market it became the winner that took all. In the beginning, Facebook didn’t really have a business model. But because providing free services costs money, it urgently needed one. This necessity became the mother of invention: although in the beginning Zuckerberg (like the two Google co-founders, incidentally) despised advertising, in the end – like them – he faced up to sordid reality and Facebook became an advertising company. Given that its users were generously providing all kinds of information about themselves (what they liked, what schools they attended, what they did for a living, etc) it was easy to assemble a detailed profile of each one. And this information could be used to enable paying customers (called advertisers) to aim commercial messages at them. In this way, Facebook became a surveillance capitalist – deriving revenues from surveilling its users. And the more they “engaged” with it – the more time they spent on the site – the more “monetisable” data they generated. This turned out to be a licence to print money and it made Facebook the sixth most valuable company in the world at one time. Zuckerberg’s programmers built a remarkable automated system to assist advertisers in choosing particular audiences and refining their messages – and in the process boosted their boss’s net worth to $62bn. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of all this is that Zuckerberg and his colleagues apparently didn’t twig that their automated system could also be used by politically motivated customers to direct political or ideological messages at Facebook users. How else can we account for Zuckerberg’s air of outraged innocence when evidence began to appear in 2017 that this was precisely what had happened during the presidential election, and his slow and grudging acceptance of the awful truth which culminated in admissions of the extent to which Cambridge Analytica’s activities had undermined the privacy of up to 87 million Facebook users? “We didn’t focus enough on preventing abuse and thinking through how people could use these tools to do harm as well,” he finally conceded last week. “That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, hate speech, in addition to developers and data privacy. We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake.” Before we get carried away by this latest contrition fest, it’s worth remembering that this is par for the Zuckerberg course. There have been – by one count – at least 11 previous scandals involving Facebook, and in many of them the boy-wonder CEO has been trotted out to do his shtick. It’s got to the point where one can write the script. It goes: sure we screwed up; we’re determined to do better in future; but, hey, “life is about learning from the mistakes and figuring out what you need to do to move forward”. As the Guardian’s Nils Pratley put it the other day, “This breezy I-promise-to-do-better mantra would be understandable if offered by a schoolchild who had fluffed an exam. But Zuckerberg is running the world’s eighth largest company and $50bn has just been removed from its stock market value in a scandal that, aside from raising deep questions about personal privacy and social media’s influence on democracy, may provoke a regulatory backlash.” Kenneth Tynan memorably defined a neurosis as “a secret you don’t know you’re keeping”. The problem with Zuckerberg’s apologetic cant is that it serves to conceal the secret that he must know he’s keeping – namely that the root of the company’s problems, and the reason it can’t fix itself, is its abusive business model. Facebook extracts the personal information and data trails of its users to paint virtual targets on their backs. And it has to keep increasing user “engagement” to justify its stock-market valuation (and maintain Zuckerberg’s net worth). As a senior company executive, Andrew Bosworth, once put it in a leaked internal memo: “The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned ... That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.” Yep: all of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/06/st-helens-hull-fc-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T20:59:53Z","webTitle":"Zeb Taia and Mark Percival inspire St Helens to win against Hull FC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/06/st-helens-hull-fc-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/06/st-helens-hull-fc-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Zeb Taia and Mark Percival inspire St Helens to win against Hull FC","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the end, this was a satisfactory enough night’s work for the Super League leaders. Nothing too extraordinary can be expected from any side playing their third game in a bruising eight-day period. The chance of any kind of positive result this weekend was to be taken with both hands. The performance, therefore, faded into the background for once – but this outcome will have been extra pleasing for St Helens as, not only did they register a ninth win in 10 games this season here, but they did so without the man who has defined large parts of their campaign. Questions have been posed about how the Saints would cope without Ben Barba – and while the answer was not exactly emphatic here, there were at least assurances that the league leaders are capable of winning games without the mercurial Australian, whose odds for the Man of Steel award are shortening by the week. Without Barba, who fell ill in the hours approaching kick-off, the hosts reshuffled their attacking line-up and improved as the game wore on, scoring four second-half tries to eventually emerge comfortable victors against an out-of-sorts Hull side. “I thought we played really well,” their coach, Justin Holbrook, said. “When you play your third game in eight days, you need everyone to play well. It’s six points from six over Easter and nine days off now – that’ll feel like six months.” The only blemish on the Saints’ performance was an injury to their captain, James Roby, which will rule him out of next week’s visit to Wakefield at the very least. Roby’s withdrawal midway through the second half handed an opportunity to Matty Smith, the former England scrum-half who had made just one appearance this season. Speculation has linked Smith with a move away in pursuit of regular first-team rugby, but he made a strong claim for a place in the league leaders’ side. They are now six points clear at the top. “I thought he was great,” Holbrook said of the 30-year-old. Hull’s cause certainly was not helped by late injury withdrawals and the loss of Fetuli Talanoa and Brad Fash throughout the game, but their coach, Lee Radford, unashamedly admitted they were beaten by the worthy winners here. “Both teams have had three games in seven days but I thought they were a lot better than us,” he said. “I was very envious watching that performance from them tonight.” It is hard to argue with his assessment. Both sides toiled in the first half, with Zeb Taia’s try from an expert Theo Fages kick the only points scored in the opening 40 minutes. However, as the inevitable post-Easter fatigue set in, it was the hosts who responded the better as they pulled away from Hull in the moments after half-time. Within two minutes they had doubled their lead courtesy of Mark Percival, before Danny Richardson added a penalty to open up a three-score lead. Regan Grace could, and perhaps should, have laid Hull to rest soon after – but his knock-on paved the way for a somewhat comical moment to keep Hull’s hopes alive. It came when an outrageously forward pass from Jack Logan found Albert Kelly and, inexplicably, the officials did not see it. Thankfully, it was not a crucial play though, as two late tries – one to Taia, and another to Luke Thompson, which Smith had a hand in – ensured the league leaders went marching on at the top. With Barba likely to return next week, it is looking an increasingly difficult prospect to work out how to halt them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/08/real-rot-in-uk-classrooms-problems-go-deeper-than-money","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T05:05:20Z","webTitle":"I know the real source of our classroom rot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/08/real-rot-in-uk-classrooms-problems-go-deeper-than-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/08/real-rot-in-uk-classrooms-problems-go-deeper-than-money","fields":{"headline":"I know the real source of our classroom rot","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Schools have been chronically underfunded under Conservative-led governments, which dole out starvation rations to all public sector institutions. And it’s quite right for the National Education Union, my union, to campaign for higher funding as an election issue. But both Conservative and Labour governments have endlessly meddled with education policy, to disastrous effect. I loved teaching, believed it was my vocation, and taught English to secondary school pupils for 30 years. I saw it as my mission to foster in students a love of literature which would stay with them all their lives. Staff appraisals labelled me “inspirational”, “outstanding”, “excellent”. One year ago, my health finally shot, I left teaching for good. Why did I leave? Because of the permanent revolution of change: in school structure, in the curriculum, in the ethos of education – an unending storm which prevents teachers from serving children by giving them the education they deserve. Has this perpetual revolution improved education? No. Schools have succumbed to a clamorous individualism which demands that students succeed without making an effort. When I started teaching, children accepted that their success or failure was due, at least in part, to how much effort they put in. The teacher’s job was to inspire you , but you had to make an effort. Now, many students and parents believe that it is the teacher’s job to get a child good grades, whether or not they make an effort. If they do badly, or misbehave, that is your fault for making your lessons boring. Can we raise our voices to get quiet in a classroom? No: that’s verbal abuse. This transference of responsibility – from the student to the teacher – is actually a transfer of power from the adult to the child, and anyone who’s read The Crucible knows what a great idea that is. It has ended with pupils deliberately taunting and humiliating their teachers: take the matter to your managers and you may not be not supported. I remember a parents’ evening when a mother and father screamed in my face because their son, a lazy sixth former who played truant, hadn’t got the A-grade that was his “right”. Management told me that I had to take it, because that was the job. I struggled on, but was succumbing to depression. In a dispute between parents and teachers, managers often back the parents because it creates less work than investigating what happened. This is especially significant in private schools, where bums on seats means cash. Blame the nasty teacher, discipline him, keep the kid, balance the books. At all costs, avoid bad publicity. And the curriculum? The party of the “small state” dictated that with the 1988 Education Act, which introduced the national curriculum and gave the government 500 new powers. Before the national curriculum, I spent my working day teaching, marking, preparing, coaching sports teams and directing plays. These worthless frivolities were junked in favour of assessment objectives, strands, schemes of work, grids, tests and levels. An obsession with league tables has encouraged schools to play safe. Fancy teaching The History Boys to your GCSE students? Sorry, it’s An Inspector Calls for the 15th year running. Because it’s a great play? No. Because it’s easy, so kids get good marks and boost our league table position. And the changes! As head of English, I introduced new GCSE and A-level syllabuses every third year. Then there was the endless river of snake oil flowing from educational consultants – mountebanks who promise they can solve all your educational ills if you follow their five-minute fad. And while you’re at it teachers, solve the problems of society! Teach kids to avoid drugs, underage sex and radicalisation. So how should things be? Let teachers get on with the job; stop politicians interfering in education; allow good teachers the freedom to inspire their pupils. This is not going to happen. No wonder the average length of service for a teacher in the UK is five years. No wonder I left after 30."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/06/england-women-wales-women-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T20:39:34Z","webTitle":"England rue missed chances as Wales’ Laura O’Sullivan puts in superb display","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/england-women-wales-women-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/06/england-women-wales-women-world-cup-qualifier-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England rue missed chances as Wales’ Laura O’Sullivan puts in superb display","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With Wales topping 2019 World Cup qualifying Group 1 and England a point behind having played a game fewer, this match offered Phil Neville’s side a strong competitive test for his first home outing, against a team with strong qualification ambitions of their own. The Lionesses’ 4-0, 6-0 and 5-0 demolitions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia and Kazakhstan respectively, and runner-up spot at the SheBelieves Cup, may have filled them with confidence but this draw will have measured that and left them ruing not making more of such a possession-heavy display. England began on the front foot, dominating possession, and spent much of the first half camped in the Wales half but it was Jayne Ludlow’s side who will have gone in at half-time feeling hard done by. With Wales defending deep, often dropping to five at the back, England were held to long-range efforts and set pieces, unable to break through such a well-rehearsed back line. The deep defending left Kayleigh Green (converted from a defender to a forward by Ludlow) isolated up front but Wales were not without chances of their own and they should have taken the lead in the eighth minute from a rare Wales corner delivered by Angharad James. The ball rolled teasingly through the box, taking a number of deflections and falling at the feet of Natasha Harding whose shot crossed the line before being booted clear. But the referee waved away Welsh appeals for the goal. At the other end England pushed and pushed at the Welsh back line but were crowded out in the centre. Toni Duggan, forced to go long, had a shot pushed on to the post by Laura O’Sullivan and the overworked keeper held the Lionesses at bay again as she tipped a Jordan Nobbs 30-yard screamer on to the bar. With the approach to the stadium filled with families, in particular young girls, and only two corners of St Mary’s kept empty while the rest of the stadium was filled with a crowd ofmore than 25,000 , the atmosphere was electric. Neville’s confidence of a Wembley outing in the next year looked increasingly likely as the Lionesses’ showed they can fill a Premier League ground. England started the second half much like the first but Duggan, Nikita Parris, Fran Kirby and Jodie Taylor were unable to keep the ball down in the box and string any passes between them. However, the introduction of Ellen White for Taylor and Melissa Lawley for Parris injected pace. Manchester City’s Lawley caused all kinds of trouble for Rhiannon Roberts with pacy runs and swift crosses from the left. Birmingham’s White stuck herself between the centre-backs Hayley Ladd and Loren Dykes, pulling them away from the dangerous Lawley. Seattle Reign’s Jess Fishlock looked to be Wales’s most threatening outlet on the counter, first racing from her own area but unable to find Green with her desperate through-ball. Later another Nobbs corner slid to the edge of the box and was picked off by Fishlock who broke free, with Harding at her side, only for Keira Walsh to make a brilliant tackle as the last player. With nine minutes left Neville amused the crowd and angered the fourth official when he stepped on to the pitch to help Green after she had gone down with cramp in front of him. In the closing stages England continued to seek a winner, Nobbs again testing the superb O’Sullivan, who tipped the ball into the path of Walsh, but she could only steer her shot into the side netting. Kirby’s strike in the 90th minute from the edge of the area brought O’Sullivan to full stretch. At the full-time whistle the Wales players and staff leapt into the air as if celebrating a win and danced in the centre circle while the England players walked the perimeter to applaud the fans. But having had their backs to the wall for the majority of the 90 minutes Wales deserved to soak up the single point gained from their defensive labour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/08/stanley-spencer-patrons-paintings-exhibition-cookham","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T07:00:28Z","webTitle":"Sex and spirituality: Stanley Spencer’s ‘visions’ return to Cookham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/08/stanley-spencer-patrons-paintings-exhibition-cookham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/08/stanley-spencer-patrons-paintings-exhibition-cookham","fields":{"headline":"Sex and spirituality: Stanley Spencer’s ‘visions’ return to Cookham","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"He was one of the most inspirational artists of the 20th century, a visionary who painted real village folk in grandiose biblical scenes, and the creator of the most important artistic first world war memorial in the UK. But there were periods when Stanley Spencer was close to penury as the result of his unconventional personal life and the apparent avarice of his second wife. The acclaimed artist relied on patrons, who supported him by buying his paintings and commissioning works, but also by housing and feeding him, and offering him emotional and intellectual sustenance. Now an exhibition entitled Patron Saints brings together many of the works Spencer’s benefactors bought, in the Stanley Spencer Gallery in the artist’s home village of Cookham, Berkshire. Spencer had an almost spiritual attachment to Cookham, which inspired many of his paintings. The 21 works in the new exhibition include Love on the Moor, a subversive celebration of free love which took 18 years to complete. It was first bought by Spencer’s lawyer, Wilfrid Evill, and has been loaned to the gallery by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. At the centre of the vibrant scene, set on Cookham Moor, the artist’s first wife Hilda Carline – also an artist – is depicted as Venus with an adoring Spencer wrapped around her legs in worship. A distant figure dressed in fur and stilettos in the top left corner of the vast painting is thought to be Patricia Preece, whom Spencer married a week after divorcing Hilda. The Last Supper, painted as a scene in Cookham malt house, was initially bought by Sir Henry Slesser, a judge and socialist. Spencer lived with Slesser and his wife Margaret for over a year, and included the patron in one of his most famous works, The Resurrection, Cookham. With the naked feet and bony toes of Christ’s disciples prominent, The Last Supper first hung in Slesser’s private chapel. Later, it was displayed in Holy Trinity church in Cookham before being replaced by a copy, with the valuable original moved to the nearby gallery. “It is the real gem of our collection, and has been shown all over the world,” said archivist Ann Danks. The largest work in the exhibition is an unfinished masterpiece, Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta, which Spencer worked on in the years before his death from cancer in 1959. Christ is depicted preaching from a wicker chair on an old horseferry barge. The patron for this work – which is more than five metres wide – was William, 3rd Viscount Astor, whose family seat, Cliveden, is over the Thames from Cookham. He helped buy Spencer’s beloved childhood home, Fernlea, so the artist could move back there in his final years, and paid Spencer £1,000 a year to allow him to work on the painting. Though unfinished, it’s a remarkable demonstration of Spencer’s methods. The exhibition also includes The Angel, Cookham Churchyard, commissioned by Gwen Raverat, who met Spencer when they were both students at the Slade art school in 1908. She became an important source of emotional and intellectual support, as well as commissioning and buying his works. One painting in the exhibition has not been on public display for 50 years. Snowdrops, painted in 1955, was bought by Catherine Martineau, who lived near Cookham, and has been privately owned since. “There was only one small clump but they are fearfully pleased with themselves,” Spencer wrote of hte snowdrops. According to Danks, Catherine and Jack Martineau, along with the Astors, were the “crux of [Spencer’s] existence” in his final years. A striking self-portrait of the artist at the age of 23 was bought by Sir Edward Marsh, Spencer’s most important early patron, and loaned to the exhibition by the Tate. Marsh described the painting as “glowing with genius”. Amanda Bradley, who curated the exhibition, said: “Spencer is seen as an idiosyncratic, individual genius – and that was the case – but a lot of people were drawn to that genius, and Each of his patrons gave something to Spencer. They weren’t wildly rich, but they were powerful, cultivated, intellectual and artistic. They are fascinating characters in their own right. Most fostered long-lived relationships with the artist, influencing his life and work more than has been realised.” The gallery, which opened three years after the artist’s death, is in the former Methodist chapel Spencer attended as a boy with his mother. As a child, he was home-schooled, but later studied at the Slade under Henry Tonks. He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps in WW1, an experience on which he drew heavily for his extraordinary war paintings, including the colossal Sandham Memorial Chapel in Burghclere. The 19 enormous paintings were made possible by the patronage of the Behrend family. The Resurrection, Cookham, his masterpiece, finished in 1927 and set in the Holy Trinity churchyard, depicts Spencer, Hilda, other members of his family and people from the village emerging from graves, watched by Christ. The art critic of the Times said it was “the most important painted by any English artist in the present century … It is as if a Pre-Raphaelite had shaken hands with a Cubist”. Spencer married Hilda in 1925, and they had two daughters, but by 1935, he had developed an obsession with his next-door neighbour, artist Patricia Preece, who lived there with her lover Dorothy Hepworth, also an artist. He left Hilda and married Preece a week after the divorce went through, although the union was never consummated. Spencer signed over the deeds of his Cookham house to Preece, who forced him to leave, rented out the property and lived on the proceeds. After Spencer was knighted in 1959, his by then estranged wife insisted on being addressed as Lady Spencer. In a TV documentary broadcast earlier this year, Spencer’s daughter Shirin told how she had never forgiven Preece. “When I was young, I just thought this is how things were. But as I got older, and realised what Patricia had done, she became the one person I really hated.” In his last years, Spencer was seen around Cookham, often wearing pyjamas under his suit and pushing his easel, canvas and paints in an old pram. The gallery, which is run entirely by volunteers, attracts visitors from all over the world. “In some ways, this is a place of pilgrimage for Spencer enthusiasts, of which there are many,” said Danks.

That remarkable row, which continued long afterwards as Warnock branded Nuno a “disgrace” and accused the former Porto manager of a “lack of class”, overshadowed not only a fascinating match between the Championship’s top two teams but also the significance of this result. Wolves, who have been enjoying the view from the top of the Championship since October, are now nine points ahead of Cardiff and within touching distance of a return to the Premier League. They need a maximum of five points from their remaining five fixtures and could be promoted as early as Tuesday, depending on results elsewhere. Cardiff, in contrast, still have a bit to do and the big question is how much the manner of this defeat – their first in the league since New Year’s Day – will take out of Warnock’s players. After all, Cardiff were thrown a lifeline on two occasions here, first when Mike Dean penalised Conor Coady for a push on Anthony Pilkington in the 93rd minute, only for John Ruddy to superbly save Gary Madine’s penalty. The Cardiff fans were still coming to terms with that missed opportunity when Dean awarded another spot-kick, two minutes later, after Ivan Cavaleiro brought down Aron Gunnarsson. This time Junior Hoilett stepped forward, yet the winger also missed, hitting the crossbar with what proved to be the last kick of the game and prompting Nuno to run on to the field to join his euphoric team rather than acknowledge Warnock. The Cardiff manager was in no mood to accept Nuno’s attempts to shake hands on the pitch a little while later – he was captured on camera swearing repeatedly in the Portuguese’s direction – and also made it clear in his post-match press conference that he was not interested in having any sort of conversation in his office. “I don’t give a toss what he says. I won’t accept his apology,” Warnock said. “He’s totally out of order. In British football, you shake the manager’s hand afterwards. I just thought it showed a lack of class if I’m honest. So he can please himself. I went to shake his hand and he ran off – that’s what he did. If that’s how they’re taught in Portugal, fair enough. But not in Britain.” Told that Nuno had said in an interview that he wanted to personally apologise, Warnock replied: “Why would I speak to him? I don’t want to. He can say anything after the game. I’m talking about when the whistle goes, what he should do, the etiquette, the manners, the class. They’ve won the game, for God’s sake. He should shake your hand and say ‘unlucky’. You don’t have to run off like that and rub your nose in it. A disgrace.” Nuno insisted that he regretted his actions. “I am sorry. I hope Neil understands, I tried to tell him, but it’s very difficult to control your emotions when you get two penalties in the final minutes, the only person I had in my mind was John Ruddy, to give him a big hug because today he gave us the victory. But nobody can ever say that I am not a respectful person.” In other news, Neves curled a wonderful 25-yard free-kick into the top corner midway through the second half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/apr/09/competitive-eater-taken-to-hospital-after-eating-worlds-hottest-chilli-pepper","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T12:44:57Z","webTitle":"Man eats world's hottest chilli pepper – and ends up in hospital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/09/competitive-eater-taken-to-hospital-after-eating-worlds-hottest-chilli-pepper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/apr/09/competitive-eater-taken-to-hospital-after-eating-worlds-hottest-chilli-pepper","fields":{"headline":"Man eats world's hottest chilli pepper – and ends up in hospital","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man who took part in a chilli pepper eating contest ended up with more than he bargained for when he took on the hottest pepper in the world. After eating a Carolina Reaper pepper, the 34-year-old started dry heaving before developing a pain in his neck that turned into a series of thunderclap headaches: sudden and severe episodes of excruciating pain that peak within a minute. The Carolina Reaper, which can top 2.2m on the Scoville heat scale, was the world’s hottest pepper at the time of the incident in 2016 – although new breeds called Pepper X and Dragon’s Breath have since reportedly surpassed it. The details, published in the journal BMJ Case Reports, reveal the pain was so terrible the man went to the emergency room at Bassett Medical Center in Cooperstown, a village in New York State. “[A thunderclap headache] lasts for a few minutes and it might be associated with dry-heaving, nausea, vomiting – and then it gets better on its own. But it keeps coming back,” said Dr Kulothungan Gunasekaran of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, a co-author of the report, adding that thunderclap headaches can be caused by a number of problems including bleeding inside the brain or blood clots. CT and MRI scans of the man’s brain were taken but showed nothing out of the ordinary. What’s more, the man did not report having any speech or vision problems. But when the medical team tried another type of CT scan designed to look at the blood vessels in the brain, they had a surprise. A number of arteries in the brain had narrowed, and as a result the team decided it was a condition known as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), which probably caused the thunderclap headache. The diagnosis was backed up by a scan five weeks later showing the arteries had returned to normal. In rare cases, said Gunasekaran, RCVS can cause a stroke. While such narrowing of the blood vessels can be triggered by certain medications or drugs, the team found nothing of the sort when they screened the man’s urine. Instead, they say, it is likely the Carolina Reaper was to blame. It’s not the first time chilli peppers have triggered serious repercussions. “Actually, when we were looking at the literature we found a couple of cases similar to our case,” said Gunasekaran. Weight-loss pills made from another type of chilli pepper are believed to have caused a heart attack in a 25-year-old man by triggering a sudden narrowing of the coronary artery, and a 33-year-old man died from a heart attack after eating a super-hot sauce he had cooked up from homegrown chillies. In 2016 a 47-year-old man had a brush with death after he tore his oesophagus by retching and straining after eating pureed ghost pepper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/07/brighton-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T16:12:50Z","webTitle":"Steve Mounié capitalises on Brighton howler to rescue point for Huddersfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/07/brighton-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/07/brighton-huddersfield-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Steve Mounié capitalises on Brighton howler to rescue point for Huddersfield","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Crackling with nervous energy throughout, Brighton and Huddersfield fought each other to a standstill here in their attempts to avoid relegation. Two goals, both in part the result of an individual error, were characteristic of a match riddled with tension. First Huddersfield’s Jonas Lössl’s soft save rebounded into the net off the goalkeeper himself, then Shane Duffy handed Steve Mounié an equaliser on a platter. Both sides gave their all but neither can relax as the Premier League enters its final straight. “I’m disappointed and frustrated,” said the Brighton manager, Chris Hughton. His team stand on 35 points but now face Crystal Palace in another six-pointer before taking on the current top four in their final five matches. “We had a really good opportunity. Particularly with the start we had. We were up against a team that struggles to score and the goal gave them the lift they needed.” Hughton was right about the start. Davy Pröpper should have scored his first goal for the club within the first 30 seconds. Chasing a looped pass from Ezequiel Schelotto, he controlled the ball, advanced on goal and missed the target. The Dutch international was under pressure from Jonathan Hogg but had a clear sight of goal. It was the first example of the nerves that would define Brighton’s performance. The home side’s first properly fluent move resulted in a goal, however. Pröpper started it, releasing José Izquierdo on the counter with the outside of his boot. The Colombian smuggled the ball to Solly March, who hit a low shot that was precise but lacking real power. Lössl got down to it but his connection was weak, pushing the ball on to the post, then back on to himself and into the net. If that was a warning that calamity can be round the corner at any moment, Brighton did not heed it. Within three minutes the visitors were level and it was all Shane Duffy’s work, the centre-half playing a blind pass across his box while under pressure from Alex Pritchard. Mounié intercepted, rounded Mat Ryan and tucked home. “In general I am happy,” said the Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, afterwards. His Terriers are four points clear of Southampton in 18th, having played two games more. “I’m pleased with the performance and very pleased with the players’ response after the start Brighton made and having conceded a lucky goal. If this means you get a point at the end we have to accept it.” Pröpper put the cap on a highly strung performance when he was sent off with 15 minutes remaining for a sliding challenge on Hogg. Brighton might still have won the game with 10 men but Izquierdo failed to round Lössl when sent through by Leonardo Ulloa and Duffy had two headed chances to make amends only to see one cleared and the other go over. “There’s still six games to go, that means so many points still to play for,” Hughton said. “Somebody’s going to pull out a surprise; they always do. Which team that will be I do not know.

With 60 seconds of normal time remaining, Palace thought they had earned the most priceless of victories, thanks to two stunning goals – by Luka Milivojevic and Wilfried Zaha – but they twice crumbled, with Joshua King striking the decisive blow when he stabbed home at the back post. Bournemouth simply do not know when they are beaten, having now won 18 points from losing positions this season, the most of any Premier League team. With five games to play, this was a damning blow to Palace’s hopes of survival but this late drama showed why Eddie Howe’s side are surely set for a fourth successive season in the top tier. For Palace, who continue to teeter immediately above the drop zone, one win in 10 matches reads as relegation form. Before King’s late goal here they had made huge strides, seemingly heading five points clear of the bottom three when Zaha fired home 15 minutes from time after dancing around on the edge of the box, twirling away from Ryan Fraser before sending Asmir Begovic’s net rippling. But Fraser, who had gone to ground trying to challenge Zaha, had a hand in Bournemouth’s 89th-minute equaliser. It was his inviting corner that was flicked on by Steve Cook into the path of King, the second-half substitute, who turned home unmarked. It was Bournemouth’s second leveller of the afternoon, with Lys Mousset, another player to excel off the bench, having scored within three minutes of coming on. His goal cancelled out Milivojevic’s glorious free-kick, scored by the Palace captain on his 27th birthday. Hodgson was left deflated having witnessed his side squander victory in the cruellest manner possible. Before Zaha’s wondrous strike, Patrick van Aanholt had shot straight at Begovic when clean through. “We couldn’t hold on to the lead on two occasions and we certainly created enough chances to put the game to bed,” Hodgson said. “If we continue to play like that over the next five games, we have to believe we can take enough points. I have confidence in the team and I think the team has shown confidence but it’s going to be a dogfight.” Hodgson was forced into a rethink up front with Christian Benteke absent because of a groin injury, and Alexander Sorloth and Connor Wickham also missing. Zaha spearheaded the Palace attack, supported by Andros Townsend who was always in close proximity, but for much of this match he was frustrated and flummoxed, typified by a first-half contretemps with Lewis Cook. Jonathan Moss kept his cards in his pocket but moments later Hodgson pulled the forward aside, urging calm. Bournemouth had every right to be agitated themselves, with Callum Wilson guilty of spurning two golden chances. Bournemouth had failed to seize the initiative and Palace did exactly that after the interval. Presented with a free-kick 25 yards from goal after Yohan Cabaye was fouled, Milivojevic arrowed a right-foot effort beyond Begovic and into the top corner. Palace were buoyed, Van Aanholt denied by Begovic before an advancing Zaha took centre-stage, wringing Charlie Daniels inside out only for his effort to be palmed away by Begovic. Howe responded by throwing on two strikers – King and Mousset – and both made ample impact. The latter rifled home with his first touch, a first-time effort from distance, three minutes after coming on. Enter Zaha. After twisting and turning away from three Bournemouth shirts, the Palace forward piled all of his pent-up frustration into a bullet-like effort from the edge of the box. The pocket of Palace supporters celebrated deliriously – they thought Zaha had snatched victory – but it was King who stepped off the bench to have the final say. “There’s never a dull moment with us,” Howe said. “It’s not good for my health and was really edge-of-your-seat stuff. The comeback says lots about the attitude of our players and team. The players want to go the extra mile, I don’t think we’ve ever lost that, and I think it’s shone again today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/08/thanks-to-bob-dylan-tunes-they-are-a-changin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"Thanks to Bob Dylan, tunes they are a changin’ | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/thanks-to-bob-dylan-tunes-they-are-a-changin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/thanks-to-bob-dylan-tunes-they-are-a-changin","fields":{"headline":"Thanks to Bob Dylan, tunes they are a changin’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I’ve always found a love of Bob Dylan to be elusive. I get it, but I don’t get it, sort of like deep-pan pizza or electric bicycles. Still, I very much enjoyed Bob’s contribution to a new EP called Universal Love, which sees various artists singing classic love songs with a same-sex pronoun twist. Kesha has covered Janis Joplin’s I Need a Man to Love, turning that man into a woman, while Kele Okereke has done The Temptations’ My Girl, as My Guy. It’s indicative of the music industry’s ever-tightening belt that it has been funded by the hotel company MGM Resorts International, which says same-sex unions account for 20 to 30% of wedding ceremonies at its Vegas hotels and hopes Universal Love will provide a soundtrack. Dylan has taken on the 1929 classic She’s Funny That Way, crooning his love to a male suitor instead. It’s only mildly unusual to hear him sing to a man and only if you’re listening closely, which seems like a great leap forward from the many decades of pop songs that were only ever directed to the opposite sex or, if the artist was being more coy, to “you”. Queer artists explicitly singing to a person of the same gender is a relatively recent development. Even Sam Smith, who hung around the closet door before exploding out of it in a cloud of rainbow dust, directs his ballads to “you”, not “he”. Every gay person has been in a situation where less specific pronouns are useful, perhaps even a safety measure, so you can’t blame him for being vague, but if he keeps it up, I’ll be very surprised. I remember watching Frank Ocean perform a few years ago, just after he had come out on Tumblr. At the time, he was affiliated with Odd Future and attracted many of the rap crew’s fans to his show. The crowd was mostly rowdy fellas, chanting Odd Future slogans and chugging cans. When he sang Forrest Gump to them, the lines: “You’re so buff and so strong… you run my mind, boy” seemed like the start of a new world order. Since then, “you” has fallen out of favour and pop seems joyfully full of new young artists not only being candid about who their songs are lusting after, but celebrating that point of difference, too. Hayley Kiyoko sings about being a better option than her crush’s boyfriend. Troye Sivan disappears into a bedroom with more-than-just-a-man-friend in the video for Youth. Even Cardi B’s album contains a lyrical request for a threesome with Rihanna.

Plumpton, which raced on Sunday, joined the list after a second inspection. Midnightly (1.30) and Kyllachy Dragon (2.00) both have solid chances on the Flat card, but the attention of most punters will now focus squarely on Ireland, where the private battle between Gordon Elliott and Willie Mullins for the Irish trainers’ title could shift decisively as a result of the Irish Grand National at 5pm. Elliott has a healthy lead of around €450,000 over Mullins after the first day of the Easter Festival at Fairyhouse, when Mullins’s Al Boum Photo edged out his rival’s Shattered Love by a length in the Ryanair Gold Cup. He is also due to saddle a record 13 runners in the National on Monday, while Mullins must content himself with just four contenders for a first prize of €270,000. Jack Kennedy is the effective No 1 jockey at the Elliott stable and his mount Monbeg Notorious has been the one for money in recent days, from 14-1 down to a top price of 9-1 on Monday morning. The Thyestes Chase winner is chasing a four-timer, will love the heavy ground and has a very obvious chance, while Pairofbrowneyes (9-1) and Bellshill (11-1), Mullins’s main hopes, are two of the next three names in the betting. Neither trainer has won this race before, which adds an interesting twist to the narrative, while the forecast for as much as 20mm of rain on heavy ground before post time in early evening also needs to be factored into considerations. The conditions could be desperate by the time the race gets under way, and Pat Kelly’s Mall Dini (5.30), who had the stamina and class to win the Pertemps Final at the Cheltenham Festival over hurdles, could be the horse to frustrate Irish jumping’s two powerhouse stables once again. Mall Dini came up half a length short of his second Festival win in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase at Cheltenham last month off Monday’s mark of 143, having travelled like a well-handicapped horse throughout, and has a hold-up running style which could allow Mark Walsh to save his mount for the closing stages while some of the principals fight their private battles up front. At around 9-1, he is a fair bet to give both trainer and jockey their first wins in Ireland’s most valuable and prestigious handicap chase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/02/serie-a-title-battle-may-have-turned-on-clerical-error-over-matteo-politano-napoli-sassuolo-juventus","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T10:34:42Z","webTitle":"Serie A title battle may have turned on a clerical error over Matteo Politano | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/02/serie-a-title-battle-may-have-turned-on-clerical-error-over-matteo-politano-napoli-sassuolo-juventus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/02/serie-a-title-battle-may-have-turned-on-clerical-error-over-matteo-politano-napoli-sassuolo-juventus","fields":{"headline":"Serie A title battle may have turned on a clerical error over Matteo Politano","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Did the title race turn on a clerical error? Matteo Politano looked set to join Napoli from Sassuolo this January, with terms reportedly agreed on a transfer worth €28m. The player was keen, yet, as the final seconds ticked away on deadline day, the paperwork never came through. Two months later, Politano scored a goal that stopped Napoli from going back to the top of Serie A. The Partenopei travelled to Sassuolo on Saturday knowing a win would vault them into first – heaping pressure on to Juventus before their evening kick-off against a Milan who were yet to suffer domestic defeat in 2018. A 46-point gulf separated Napoli from Sassuolo in the standings. Sure, the Neroverdi had beaten Udinese before the international pause – but that was their first win since Christmas. They had been thrashed 7-0 by Juventus as well as losing 3-0 to Atalanta and Lazio. However, a 22nd-minute strike from Politano put Napoli on the back foot. The composure he showed to volley home the rebound from Federico Peluso’s header was conspicuously missing from the visitors’ attack. When Napoli did equalise, the last touch appeared to come off a Sassuolo defender, Rogério. The game ended 1-1, leaving Napoli supporters to ponder how things might have gone differently if Politano were playing on their side. It is not only a question of his direct impact. If Napoli’s attack has lost sharpness at the tail end of this campaign, that might be because the front three of Dries Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne and José Callejón are spent. This team has been unfortunate to lose Arkadiusz Milik to torn knee ligaments for large parts of the past two seasons. His impact off the bench on Saturday was notable. Having flashed a header just over at 1-0, he then struck the woodwork. Yet even when Milik is available, there has always been a need for another option up front, a versatile all-rounder who could slot in on either flank. Politano was not Napoli’s first choice for that role but they turned to him after Bologna’s Simone Verdi rejected a move this January. Perhaps Sassuolo were the wrong team to do business with. They have traded several players with Juventus in recent years, developing warm relations. Some have taken to describing the clubs as transfer market ‘allies’. So when Beppe Marotta responded to the Politano speculation by saying the Sassuolo owner, Giorgio Squinzi, “has a solid club, he does not need to sell anyone”, there was a temptation to read between the lines. Was Juve’s CEO seeking to influence another club’s transfer policy? The Sassuolo general manager, Giovanni Carnevali, has claimed his club never intended to sell Politano in January in any case. Yet Napoli’s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, tells things differently. By his account, a deal was reached on deadline day for a two-year loan – after which the move would become permanent. Napoli would send Adam Ounas in the opposite direction. “At 10.48pm, or maybe 10.51, we sent a contract to Carnevali,” De Laurentiis said. “He told me that the lines were busy and nothing was coming through but then a contract arrived on my end for Ounas, missing the official stamp and signature. So I don’t understand: can we say this whole thing is a little mysterious?” Not that De Laurentiis was too upset at the time. He argued Politano was neither as talented nor versatile as Verdi. “In my opinion,” he said, “I was throwing money out of the window.” Those words have come back to haunt him. Instead of putting the pressure back on Juventus, Napoli could only sit and watch as the Bianconeri extended their lead atop Serie A. They were not brilliant against Milan, although they did have the perfect start. Paulo Dybala opened the scoring after eight minutes with one of those nonchalantly superlative outside-the-box efforts that are becoming his trademark. Juventus were closing in on a club record for their longest run without conceding in Serie A. Fittingly, it was a man who helped them to set the previous mark who stopped them 15 minutes short. Leonardo Bonucci, back on his old stomping ground, muscled in to head home a first-half equaliser. He had been uncertain before the game about whether he would celebrate. Bonucci can hardly switch off the connection that he feels to the club with whom he won six consecutive league titles. It is only four Easters ago that he joined Juve fans on the Curva during a home game against Bologna. Yet after hearing supporters sing abusive chants at him through the warm-ups and into the game, his mind was made up. He wheeled away performing his signature ‘wash your mouth out’ gesture. For a long time, it appeared as though his would be the final word. Milan grew into the game and early in the second half looked most likely to win it. Hakan Calhanoglu hit the crossbar with a thunderous effort. Gigi Buffon had to react sharply to deny Suso. Then Juventus found a way – as they usually do. Juan Cuadrado, making his first appearance in more than three months following hernia treatment, came on to head them in front in the 79th minute. Sami Khedira, a player many fans would happily have relegated to the bench after recent poor performances, provided the assist, before scoring himself to seal a flattering 3-1 score. Three months on from transfer deadline day, Napoli’s title hopes hang by a thread. The reasons for their failure to sign Politano are murky. But the scale of the challenge they face in overhauling this relentless Juventus team remains as clear as day. Talking points • There was little solace to be found in an honourable defeat for Gennaro Gattuso. “It burns,” he said. “I can’t come down here smiling like a simpleton and say that I’m happy with the performance.” There is a recognition too that Milan’s Champions League hopes have been dealt a major blow. They are eight points behind fourth-placed Inter, so nothing less than a win will do in Wednesday’s rescheduled derby. • Inter are looking sharp again, although they got some help in their 3-0 win over Verona. Ivan Perisic could have taken the credit for a quick throw-in that set up Mauro Icardi for a first-minute opener but he insisted it should go to the ballgirl whose rapid reactions put him in position to act. • Roma’s draw with Bologna, coupled with Lazio’s 6-2 thrashing of Benevento, means the gap from third to fifth is back to three points. The Biancocelesti have scored 73 in 30 games. • Raise a glass, or better yet a chair, to the memory of Emiliano Mondonico, who died last week aged 71. The former Torino coach is best remembered for lifting his seat above his head in protest at the referee during his team’s 1992 Uefa Cup final defeat by Ajax, but he was an irrepressible character at any time. Early in his playing career, he deliberately got sent off so he would be free for a Rolling Stones concert the following weekend.

It has been a throwback Test. The spectators reclining on grassy banks have politely applauded the exploits of both sides. The two teams have competed with great determination yet no animosity, no mindless sledging has been visible or audible. After each day they keep acknowledging the fine play of their opponents. True, there has been music played during breaks in play but very little of it was composed in the 21st century. The kids have been encouraged to play on the outfield at lunchtime; the players keep jumping over the advertising hoards between balls to sign autographs. And still we have had a captivating Test that has ebbed and flowed deliciously. But there has been the odd frustration as well. On Monday afternoon a fine Test match hit a familiar obstacle at Hagley Oval. Unexpectedly heavy cloud formed a blanket over the ground. The umpires took the players off even though the spinners, Jack Leach and Joe Root, were bowling. It was dark and maybe that decision was justified but the subsequent announcement that the extra eight overs allowed for the final day would be tacked on at the end of the day rather than at the start, was incomprehensible. We know that it gets dark around 5.45pm in Christchurch at this time of year, just 15 minutes after the scheduled close; the explanation was that there might be some dew around at 10am, half an hour before the scheduled start. Yet in effect that was the starting time on the first two days and there did not seem to be a problem then (the clocks went back at the weekendhere). So the loss of 24 overs on Monday because of bad light, none of which are likely to be recovered, meant the chances of this Test being drawn were greatly enhanced. At the end of the fourth day New Zealand, who required 382 for victory after Joe Root’s declaration, were 42-0 having survived a testing opening spell from Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad under thickening cloud. Without the loss of those overs all four results were possible. The England innings, which resumed on 202-3, did not proceed quite as they would have wanted. The first hour went fine with 49 runs and no wickets and New Zealand were reluctant to take the new ball, partly because Tim Southee was feeling ill. But then the two overnight batsmen, Root and Dawid Malan, fell on the same score – 262. Malan clipped a drive off Colin de Grandhomme straight to midwicket after completing his seventh Test half-century – at last a fifth bowler in this match had claimed a wicket. Not since 1902 had this taken so long. Two balls later Root drove at a wide ball from Neil Wagner and was caught behind for his seventh half-century of the winter. So, just as in the first innings Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow were united at the crease with both on nought. This pair added 20, whereupon England might have lost two wickets on 282. Stokes clipped to midwicket off De Grandhomme. In the next over Bairstow, on two, pushed forward to Boult and there was a great appeal for caught behind. Umpire Erasmus was unmoved and the Black Caps had used up their two reviews. TV replays revealed via the snickometer that Bairstow’s bat had indeed touched the ball. Some modern cricketers walk but very few do when the opposition has run out of reviews. Broad and Mark Wood flickered and fell in swift succession, whereupon England were grateful for Jack Leach’s composure as a batsman for the second time. He batted intelligently while 40 runs were added and when a Bairstow pull shot off a Neil Wagner bouncer was caught on the square-leg boundary, Root decided that it was not worth sending out Anderson with a lead of 381. New Zealand’s openers needed luck and skill to survive against the new ball. Both were beaten frequently but their resolve never faltered. Tom Latham, on 23, gave a chance to James Vince at third slip off Anderson. It was a tough catch but the likelihood of Vince clinging on to the ball as he dived to his left was reduced as he had risen too soon. In his three overs Leach found some rough outside the left-hander’s off-stump, which proved troublesome, but Latham and Jeet Raval hung on. Afterwards Bairstow said England “could have had two or three wickets” in that session and he was in a good position to assess the improvement in Broad’s bowling. “The way he’s tweaked his action and recognised that he needed to do that is impressive,” he said. The final day, with 10 New Zealand wickets required by England to square the series, represents a considerable challenge for Bairstow’s captain and friend. “He’s learnt a lot‚” he said. “It’s been a tough winter for Joe. Unexpected things have cropped up and it’s very different being the captain, having tough conversations when leaving out people and having the confidence to stand up to people. He’s done very well. We’re in a decent mind space as a group leading into the summer.” A Test victory would help."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/02/jewish-corbyn-ally-frustrated-with-pace-of-antisemitism-response","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T08:51:23Z","webTitle":"Jewish Corbyn ally 'frustrated' with pace of antisemitism response","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/jewish-corbyn-ally-frustrated-with-pace-of-antisemitism-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/02/jewish-corbyn-ally-frustrated-with-pace-of-antisemitism-response","fields":{"headline":"Jewish Corbyn ally 'frustrated' with pace of antisemitism response","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Jewish member of Labour’s governing body and prominent backer of Jeremy Corbyn has said she is frustrated with how slowly allegations of antisemitism are being dealt with in the party. However, Rhea Wolfson said she expected the process to speed up with the arrival of the new general secretary, Jennie Formby, who has been told by the party leader to make the issue her top priority. “Action has been taken. I am frustrated by the pace of action, as I know a lot of people are – there is a heck of a lot more that needs to be done – but things have happened,” said Wolfson, who represents constituency Labour parties on the ruling national executive committee. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was clear that some people in the party were not clear about the dividing line between criticising Israel and straying into “antisemitic tropes”. She said: “There is very clearly a real issue, a huge piece of work that needs to be done in the Labour party, around modern antisemitism and giving people the tools to recognise when legitimate criticism of Israel crosses the line into antisemitism,” she said. Wolfson, who has been an organiser of the leftwing grassroots group Momentum and was selected by Scottish Labour to be its parliamentary candidate for the Livingston seat, said she expected the process to enter a “new stage” as Formby takes the reins of the NEC on Tuesday. Her comments came the morning after the veteran Labour MP Stephen Pound suggested allegations were being used by Corbyn’s opponents to attack his leadership. “I think the Labour party without a doubt has a problem, but on the other hand there are some people who are riding that horse to attack Jeremy Corbyn anyway,” the shadow Northern Ireland minister told Radio 4’s Westminster Hour. Pound, who represents Ealing North, said Labour should “deal with this our way”, rather than comply immediately with “people screaming from the outside saying, ‘Sling this person out, chuck that person out’”. He said: “We will take care of this. We will clean up this mess because we are the Labour party, we are not an antisemitic party, we’re not a racist party. We’re a party for everyone.” Michael Martin, the former Commons Speaker, became the latest senior figure to speak out against antisemitism in Labour on Sunday when he called for a special one-day conference to address the problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/02/australians-ignorant-about-social-media-data-accc-chief-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T02:36:05Z","webTitle":"Australians ignorant about social media data, ACCC chief warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/02/australians-ignorant-about-social-media-data-accc-chief-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/02/australians-ignorant-about-social-media-data-accc-chief-warns","fields":{"headline":"Australians ignorant about social media data, ACCC chief warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Cambridge Analytica revelations have exposed how little Australians know about the extent of personal data held by Facebook and Google, according to competition chief Rod Sims. The chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is in the early stages of an inquiry into digital platforms, said the public’s shock at the scandal confirmed what he already knew – that consumers are largely ignorant about the potential of social media giants and search engines to access and harvest their information. The ACCC inquiry is investigating the impact of Google, content aggregators such as Apple News and social media platforms such as Facebook on the state of competition in media and advertising. Last month the Guardian revealed a third-party application on Facebook scraped profile information from users and their friends, which data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica then used to target voters for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The story sparked calls for users to delete Facebook and examine how much of their data it held. “I’ve been in a presentation where an informed person said, ‘people know what Google and Facebook have on them and they don’t mind’. I’m not sure I would have said that,” Sims told Guardian Australia. “I think the reaction to Cambridge Analytica [revelations] indicated a lot of people don’t understand the data that’s held on them and potentially what it can be used for. I thought it was very interesting from that point of view and very relevant to our inquiry.” The ACCC has published an issues paper on the inquiry, for which submissions close on Tuesday. Sims will then decide what type of public hearings to hold. But he said he had no plans to invite the Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to address the inquiry, despite Zuckerberg’s agreement to testify before the US Congress, because the ACCC inquiry is a different beast. “Look, we’re not sure about [holding public hearings],” Sims said. “We need time to find out what we need to find out. Ours is very much an analytical exercise to try to understand what is going to help from a competition and consumer point of view. “We will engage with people and we certainly will hold public forums. But we are really trying to hear perspectives.” The inquiry will not specifically investigate the role of Cambridge Analytica in harvesting data in Australia, but will consider more broadly how the public understands the collection of their data on social networks. “It was a very useful development in the sense that it brought out how data potentially could be used and I was interested that people reacted as if perhaps they didn’t know what data people had on them,” Sims said. “Prior to Cambridge Analytica we were certainly posing the question, ‘What do consumers understand about what data Google has on them?’ And a couple of weeks later we had this example, which illustrated that point nicely,” he said. Sims said at the heart of the inquiry will be the impact of the platforms on the level of choice in news content and its quality. “We’ll be looking at a range of competition, consumer and level-playing-field type issues,” he said. “But then we’ll be looking at what the impact of this is on the media, understanding very much the role that media and journalism play in society.” Sims sees journalists as the gatekeepers of information, reporting and interpreting what they see for the public. “I have this example where journalists go along to a results presentation and report, so people find out about it that way. Or do people find out about it because the company uploads its results on Facebook?” he said. “I suspect there is a very big difference between the two and that is very much at the front of our minds as we go about doing our work.” A preliminary report is due in early December, with a final report in early June 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/03/australia-blind-to-russian-power-in-asia-pacific-expert-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Australia blind to Russian power in Asia Pacific, expert warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/03/australia-blind-to-russian-power-in-asia-pacific-expert-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/03/australia-blind-to-russian-power-in-asia-pacific-expert-warns","fields":{"headline":"Australia blind to Russian power in Asia Pacific, expert warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s recent excoriation of Russia shows it still views the relationship as expendable and “severely underestimates” the Kremlin’s increasing projection of power into the Asia-Pacific region, a close observer of Russian foreign policy has warned. Curtin University’s Alexey Muraviev said Australia’s “China-centric” view of the region was obscuring Russia’s growing influence and importance. He said recent warnings for Australians to rethink travel to Russia, including for the football World Cup in June, were completely unfounded, because most Russians had little to no knowledge or interest in Australia, its politics or the views of Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. “First of all, the majority of Russians don’t think about Australia apart from kangaroos ... They would be thinking Sydney, they would be thinking wonderful beaches,” Muraviev said. “If you read Russian media, you would struggle to find an article on Australia, let alone about the foreign minister or prime minister’s references. Russians wouldn’t even know who is our prime minister, who is the foreign minister. “I think what the [Australian] government is doing is applying indirect, not pressure, but effectively trying to scare people away from going to the World Cup.” Relations between Russia and Australia have been strained over the Sergei Skripal affair in Britain. The foreign affairs department updated its travel advice over the weekend, advising travellers to Russia to brace for “anti-western sentiment or harassment”. On Sunday night two Russian diplomats, whom Australia alleges of being spies, boarded a flight out of Canberra. They were expelled from the country as part of a unified action with other western nations designed to punish Russia over the nerve agent attack on Skripal. Muraviev said the expulsions were a “massive embarrassment” for Moscow’s ambassador to Australia, Grigory Logvinov. He was tasked with improving bilateral relations after tension with the Abbott government over Russia’s involvement in the war in Ukraine and the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Muraviev said Australia’s handling of the Skripal affair showed it still viewed its relationship with Russia as of little importance. That approach was reflected across the Commonwealth, including defence and intelligence agencies, which often simply recycled American assessments of Russia and lacked basic language expertise, he said. But Russia was increasingly projecting its power into the Asia-Pacific region, Muraviev said. Vladimir Putin’s government has been developing closer relationships with Vietnam, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Philippines, and Russia’s navy is calling into ports in the region more frequently. Late last year Russia flew bombers from an airfield in Indonesia over neutral waters close to Australia, prompting an Australian air force base to be put on alert. Muraviev said Australia had become “China-centric” in its view of the region. He questioned whether Australia would have taken a similar approach to Chinese diplomats had their country been implicated in a nerve agent attack on British soil. “We consider our relations with Russia expendable, because there is not much to lose – this is what we think,” he said. “We severely underestimate Russia as a power and certainly as a military power. We still live on the established stereotypes that we have created for ourselves, thinking that the Soviet Union has gone, Russia withdrew its presence from south-east Asia and the Indian Ocean and thus we can disregard them.” Russia last week announced it was retaliating against Australia and other western nations for the expulsion of its diplomats. At a rambling press conference last week, Logvinov accused Australia of blindly following its allies and attempting to smear Russia without proper evidence of its involvement in the attack on Skripal and his daughter. Muraviev said the episode would have been highly embarrassing for Logvinov. Russia had viewed Turnbull as a more moderate figure than Tony Abbott and welcomed his election. The Russian government had been hoping to rebuild the relationship with Australia, Muraviev said. “Now everything that was rebuilt, all of the positive signs that were rebuilt over the last two years, will now be effectively washed down the drain,” he said. “The Russians don’t consider Australia to be their priority when it comes to Indo-Pacific affairs. They’re not going to make any concessions, they’re prepared to sacrifice relations. “But obviously, for the ambassador, whose key performance indicator says to see the relations improve, it’s a major setback.” Muraviev, an associate professor of national security and strategic studies, is one of the few Australian-based academics with expertise in Russia. He was the inaugural scholar-in-residence for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and recently published a report for the institute on Russia’s projection in the Asia-Pacific region. He is a non-residential fellow at the Australian navy’s Sea Power Centre, a member of the Russia-Nato experts group and was four times nominated by the Australian Research Council’s college of experts as an “expert of international standing”. He has advised members of state and federal governments on foreign policy and national security."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/01/ian-poulter-houston-open-masters-beau-hossler","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T23:19:23Z","webTitle":"Ian Poulter clinches Masters place with dramatic play-off win at Houston Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/01/ian-poulter-houston-open-masters-beau-hossler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/01/ian-poulter-houston-open-masters-beau-hossler","fields":{"headline":"Ian Poulter clinches Masters place with dramatic play-off win at Houston Open","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There must now be a clear and present danger of the Masters proving anticlimactic. Ian Poulter, a player utterly dejected when sharing 123rd place after the opening round of the Houston Open, a player wrongly informed he had qualified for the Masters before falling to a heavy defeat at the WGC Match Play and a player who needed to convert a birdie putt from 19ft to prolong that Augusta dream, is a winner once again. The circumstances of Poulter’s triumph belied sceptical theories about golf’s lack of appeal. Poulter strode to victory in Houston, at the first play-off hole against the earlier inspired Beau Hossler, in a manner that summed up his ferociously competitive attitude. This marked his maiden strokeplay success on the PGA Tour. The additional prize is so crucial: Poulter will be afforded the 87th and final Masters spot. “It is amazing, to get this done today to get me to Augusta is amazing,” Poulter said. “My first strokeplay win in the States, and to do it with the Masters on the line, is unbelievable. Last week [at the Match Play] was painful and to come here this week I was tired and frustrated. “It’s going to take a little while to sink in. I’m super excited. It’s been a rollercoaster the last couple of years, to be honest. To be down where I was has been tough.” Indeed, the 42-year-old had slipped outside the world’s top 200. Poulter had been one over par after 18 Houston holes and prepared to return home before taking to Augusta National in a broadcasting capacity. His leaderboard recovery from Friday was statistically the best on the PGA Tour in 35 years. He will likely now move into the world’s top 30, with a Ryder Cup appearance in France later this year suddenly highly likely. On what became a remarkable Texas afternoon Poulter at one stage held a four-shot lead. His bogey at the 9th did not appear hugely significant but Hossler, chasing a first ever PGA Tour win, birdied four holes in a row from the 12th to edge a stroke in front. Poulter, in providing a moment so in tune with his iconic Ryder Cup outings, holed out for a closing birdie to force extra holes. He needed only one as Hossler found a greenside bunker and then water. “I got the best of Ian Poulter today and he got the best of me,” said Hossler. “Unfortunately he came out on top this time but I feel good about my chances moving forward and I feel good that I can contend when it’s important. “I said yesterday I wanted to beat these guys at their best and I think I saw Ian’s best today. It’s a bummer right now but I’m proud of the way I played.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/02/alison-saunders-quit-director-of-public-prosecutions-cps","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T07:59:41Z","webTitle":"Alison Saunders to quit as director of public prosecutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/02/alison-saunders-quit-director-of-public-prosecutions-cps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/02/alison-saunders-quit-director-of-public-prosecutions-cps","fields":{"headline":"Alison Saunders to quit as director of public prosecutions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, is quitting when her five-year contract finishes at the end of this year. Saunders, who has faced repeated criticism during her time as head of the Crown Prosecution Service, did not seek an extension of her contract and will leave to take up a post with a private law firm. Her departure was confirmed by the attorney general’s office on Sunday. In a statement to the Daily Telegraph, which claimed ministers were happy to see Saunders go, a spokesman for the attorney general, Jeremy Wright, said Saunders was “appointed for a five-year term which ends in October 2018” and she did not ask for an extension to her contract. She rejected suggestions she was leaving the post because the government refused to renew her contract. “They haven’t said that to me at all. I told them that I wouldn’t be asking for an extension, I was leaving at the end of my five years, so it has not been an issue for discussion,” Saunders told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. She said she had already decided to move on to a private law firm in October before informing the government of her decision. “It was my decision to leave,” she said. “DPPs serve a term of five years. I was clear that five years was a good term to serve and I have already decided what I will be doing when I leave in October.” Since the 1980s it has been normal for DPPs to servea single five-year term, but there were times when it looked as if Saunders might not stay the course because she was facing pressure to resign. One of her worst moments came when her decision not to charge the Labour peer Lord Janner with alleged child sex crimes was overturned after the complainants demanded a review of the CPS’s assessment. She faced strong criticism after most of the journalists charged as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into allegations involving reporters bribing police officers and other public officials, were acquitted. And recently, after the collapse of several rape trials following the failure of the prosecution to disclose evidence led to the CPS announcing a review of all current rape cases, she again found herself in the firing line. Saunders, who was a career CPS lawyer and only the second woman to become DPP, will take up a job as a partner with Linklaters when she leaves in the autumn. A CPS spokesman said: “The criminal justice landscape is changing rapidly, as crime trends shift and courts become digital. Under Alison Saunders’ leadership, the CPS has adapted to that changing environment, maintaining performance without compromising our core principles of independence and fairness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/01/northern-irish-boy-10-dies-after-tenerife-hit-and-run-carter-carson","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T17:47:10Z","webTitle":"Northern Irish boy, 10, dies after Tenerife hit-and-run","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/01/northern-irish-boy-10-dies-after-tenerife-hit-and-run-carter-carson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/01/northern-irish-boy-10-dies-after-tenerife-hit-and-run-carter-carson","fields":{"headline":"Northern Irish boy, 10, dies after Tenerife hit-and-run","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A 10-year-old boy from Northern Ireland has died in hospital in Tenerife after being knocked down in a hit-and-run while leaving a shopping centre. Carter Carson, from Newtownabbey in County Antrim, was on an Easter holiday with his family. He was hit by a car on Thursday night in Adeje, a resort in the south of the island. He was treated initially in a local hospital and was then moved to the university hospital in the capital, Santa Cruz, where he died on Friday. A family friend, Charlene Dinnen, who launched a crowdfunding appeal on the JustGiving site seeking to raise £3,000 to help with funeral expenses, had more than doubled that sum by Sunday night. She described Carter as “a happy-go-lucky wee boy who just loved his footy, taken after his daddy and his granda. I can’t even put into words how heartbreaking this is.” A red Alfa Romeo believed to have been involved in the incident was later found abandoned. Spanish police tweeted an appeal for witnesses to the collision. Two men have been arrested and are expected to appear in court early this week. Carter was a pupil at Abbots Cross primary school in Newtownabbey, where the principal, Joanne Griffith, said the building would be opened specially later this week during the school holidays so that pupils and parents could come in to sign a book of memories. “Carter was a quiet, hardworking boy with lovely manners and a gentle, caring nature. He loved a game of football and was an enthusiastic member of our school running club and our football club,” Griffith said. “He was recently our star pupil of the month and no one had a bigger smile than Carter when he received his star pupil award.” A tribute “with deepest condolences and heavy hearts” was posted by Newtownabbey youth football club, where Carter had played since he was five."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/01/transgender-equality-women-only-carriages-caledonian-sleeper","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T16:25:26Z","webTitle":"Trans equality will come, but it won’t be an easy journey | Matthew d’Ancona","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/transgender-equality-women-only-carriages-caledonian-sleeper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/transgender-equality-women-only-carriages-caledonian-sleeper","fields":{"headline":"Trans equality will come, but it won’t be an easy journey","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rupert Soames is routinely described in the press as Winston Churchill’s grandson, but it is too little reported that he is an outstanding DJ. He has a remarkable knowledge of contemporary pop music that exceeds that of many a woke teenager. This is relevant information as we consider the case of Serco – the corporation of which Soames is chief executive – and women-only carriages on the Caledonian Sleeper, the London-to-Scotland overnight rail service. In response to an inquiry from a Mumsnet user, Serco declared: “Guests travel with the Caledonian Sleeper in shared accommodation for men-only or women-only; the service is provided on the basis of the gender that the individual self-identifies with.” To this, the Mumsnet user responded: “I don’t think I’d feel comfortable with this at all and it’s yet another example of women’s spaces being erased.” Soames then entered the fray in person by tweeting: “I think you are referring to the possibility that people may say that they are a woman when in fact they are a man – sigh.” His passengers, he said, were not “deceitful”. With a single word – “sigh” – Soames ensured that he would be cast in this controversy as the voice of cloth-eared patriarchy. As it happens, he is no such thing. In the best sense of the word, he is a liberal who, faced with an ethical conundrum, decided to err on the side of trust of his customers. You can bet that this decision will be challenged, perhaps in the courts or, politically, by direct appeal to Chris Grayling, the secretary of state for transport. Soames may well be overruled. But do not assume that his instincts are those of an atavistic male with no sensitivity towards the dilemmas of modernity, for that is simply not the case. What he is experiencing is what will face many thousands of public service managers, employers, teachers and health professionals in the years ahead: how to negotiate the practical, granular consequences of enhanced transgender rights. The last time I wrote about this in July I was pilloried from both sides, by the trans community and feminists alike. And that’s absolutely fine: it comes with the job. Threats of violence and other breaches of the law are another matter but otherwise – fill your boots. This is not a provocation, but an invitation. I learned a lot last time round from those who wanted to engage as fellow citizens. No less striking, however, was that the outraged on both sides essentially agreed: I should “stay in my lane”. As a cis person, I apparently had no right to say anything about trans issues. As a man, I was not entitled to offer an opinion on the effect of new gender recognition rights upon cis women. I’ve thought long and hard about this and realised that, to use the technical term, it is bullshit. The notion that only those with “lived experience” of a specific phenomenon can write about it effectively abolishes journalism – which might be snappily defined as “finding out stuff you didn’t know about, and reporting it”. Worse, the notion that only those with a direct stake in a controversy can talk about it represents a mortal threat to the principle that underpins pluralism: which is that the only way to enable those with apparently “incommensurable values” to coexist is an endless process of inclusive negotiation. Thus far the debate on trans rights has mostly been conducted at a giddy level of intellectual and ideological purity. Watch, for instance, the now-famous October 2016 segment from TVOntario’s show, The Agenda, in which Nicholas Matte, a historian at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, states, as if incontestably: “It’s not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex …That’s a very popular misconception.” On the other side, there are opponents of liberalised gender recognition who sincerely regard the entire process as a patriarchal plot rather than an attempt – however clodhopping – to increase the sum of human happiness. The debate between the two intellectual factions is barely worthy of the name: it is a battle as fruitlessly cacophonous as it is impenetrably abstract. For those engaged in the conflict, it means everything. For most of those outside, it means next to nothing – so far, at least. As always, reality bites when the rubber hits the road; or, in Serco’s case, the carriage mounts the track. The devil is in the detail. But detail can be a home for angels too. So: theatres will have to build toilets that accommodate trans visitors without making cis women feel uncomfortable. Good: the new Bridge theatre in London is already trying this. At rape crisis centres, trans women seeking work will have to accept that their aspirations are trumped by the rights of the horribly violated. Sorry, but there it is. In countless facilities, new infrastructure will be required to accommodate this new and complex web of needs: adaptation of health services, careful evaluation of prisoner categories, more cubicles in all facilities. Praxis will be more important than theory. It will be a slow, frustrating and fractious process. There will be many setbacks, especially if – as Labour nearly did over all-female shortlists – organisations act too hastily, without consultation and care. Serco may yet have to change its contentious policy on the Caledonian Sleeper. But if it does, this will not be a victory of good over evil, but an instance of properly contested evolutionary change. Revolutions look great on T-shirts. But real progress is always messier. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/02/mauricio-pochettino-chelsea-tottenham-tactics-balance-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T10:17:51Z","webTitle":"Pochettino used to bow to Chelsea but now Tottenham dictate the terms | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/02/mauricio-pochettino-chelsea-tottenham-tactics-balance-of-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/02/mauricio-pochettino-chelsea-tottenham-tactics-balance-of-power","fields":{"headline":"Pochettino used to bow to Chelsea but now Tottenham dictate the terms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Progress is never an easy thing to chart in football. To speak of points or goals or positions or even trophies can seem a little reductive, too contingent on circumstance or opponents to offer an entirely accurate reflection. It’s unlikely Tottenham will finish second this season as they did last, and they may not even finish third as they did in 2016. Even if they win all seven remaining games, they will not achieve the 86 points they racked up last season. And yet the sense is of progress. Another means of measurement, then, is required. Tottenham’s development can be measured out in Chelsea games. Five times now Mauricio Pochettino has faced Antonio Conte. All five have been tight, intriguing games, but the balance has shifted. In November 2016, Tottenham went to Stamford Bridge and set up in a 4-2-3-1 against Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1. Then too Christian Eriksen scored with a ferocious shot from outside the box, but Pedro equalised before Diego Costa laid on a winner for Victor Moses. In January last year, at White Hart Lane, Pochettino changed. He matched Chelsea shape-for-shape, 3-4-2-1 for 3-4-2-1 and saw his side overpower Chelsea, winning 2-0 as Victor Wanyama and Mousa Dembélé had the better of a tumultuous midfield battle with N’Golo Kanté and Nemanja Matic. The FA Cup semi-final three months later brought a similar match-up of formations but Son Heung-min never looked comfortable as a left wing-back, conceding a penalty with a clumsy foul on Moses as Chelsea won 4-2 despite Tottenham having had the bulk of the play. That was enough to force Conte to change for the league meeting at Wembley at the beginning of the season as he withdrew one of his inside-forwards into a deeper role, using David Luiz in midfield in a 3-5-1-1 that seemed designed to deny space to Eriksen and Dele Alli. It was a grim, functional Chelsea, one heavily reliant on Willian for creativity but it withstood pressure from a Spurs side struggling a little for rhythm and won thanks to a Marcos Alonso free-kick and then a late winner from the same player. The shape, though, has not brought Conte much joy since, the focus on Eden Hazard making Chelsea a little predictable, and so the 3-4-2-1 has returned as the default since January. What was significant on Sunday was that Pochettino felt no need to alter his approach to face it, using a 4-2-3-1, just as he had in the first of the five meetings. Chelsea’s wing-backs remained an issue; Totenham never seem quite to have got to grips with them. Alonso’s late runs were a persistent problem, most notably leading to the first-half effort he had ruled out for offside when he seemed not to have been picked up. It was Moses, though, who had the greater impact, finding an alarming amount of space, which led to the Chelsea goal. That seemed a consequence of the way Eriksen drifted inside, which perhaps was a risk worth taking, both because it meant the Dane got into more dangerous positions and because it meant Tottenham often outnumbered Chelsea three-on-two in central areas. As the game wore on, Eric Dier increasingly dropped deeper, becoming almost a third central defender which in turn allowed the full-backs to push higher, engaging Moses and Alonso higher up the pitch. But the game, really, was won less through positional tweaks than through the energy and snap of Tottenham’s counter-pressing. It brought the first goal but more importantly it stifled Chelsea. Conte’s sides had won the last two meetings because of the pace and effectiveness of their transitions; here they were notable by their absence. Pochettino was able to revert to the shape he had deployed early last season and, this time, his side had the aggression and organisation to impose themselves. Chelsea, it’s true, are not the side they were then, but it’s a mark of Spurs’ progress that they could dictate the terms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/04/beyond-the-dazzle-behind-the-scenes-at-cartier","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T02:07:33Z","webTitle":"Beyond the dazzle: behind the scenes at Cartier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/04/beyond-the-dazzle-behind-the-scenes-at-cartier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/04/beyond-the-dazzle-behind-the-scenes-at-cartier","fields":{"headline":"Beyond the dazzle: behind the scenes at Cartier","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s easy to be dazzled at the National Gallery of Australia’s blockbuster Cartier exhibition, but there’s one section that shouldn’t be missed. It’s past Dame Nellie Melba’s glittering collection, past the maharaja’s opulent Patiala necklace, beyond Lady Mountbatten’s candy-coloured Tutti Frutti diamond bandeau. It’s just before the royal room where Queen Elizabeth’s and the Duchess of Cambridge’s tiaras catch the light, and well before the celebrity jewels: Elizabeth Taylor’s rubies, the Duchess of Windsor’s flamingo brooch and Grace Kelly’s devastating 10.47 carat emerald-cut diamond engagement ring. It’s a small room off to one side, dedicated to the Cartier workshop in Paris. Here the glass vitrines are not filled with sparkling baubles; instead they hold the small hammers, miniature saws, loupes, chisels and other well-worn tools used to create the jewellery. And while those staggeringly beautiful pieces glint away in their display cases, it’s the journey they took from fanciful idea to glittering bauble that’s just as interesting. The NGA exhibition, which opened last week, showcases more than 300 items from the French jewellery house’s 150-year history. Along with the rings, brooches, tiaras and necklaces there are bejewelled clocks, cigarette cases, archival drawings and photographs. The exhibition’s co-curator Margaret Young-Sánchez says while Cartier’s style evolved, there is also a sense of continuity. Although the founder, Louis-Francois Cartier, was not a designer, he had strong ideas about design, and because he was friends with “everyone who was anyone”, he knew what they wanted. “He was able to push the design ethos forward in a way that they weren’t simply following trends, they were creating trends,” she says. The 1920s were a high point for Cartier designs, and the exhibition sparkles with art deco jewellery, geometrical lines inlaid with white diamonds and multicoloured stones. In 1925 the Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder Singh, travelled to Paris with his crown jewels. While it was traditional for Indian royalty to reset their ceremonial jewellery for each generation, Young-Sánchez explains that this maharaja took his jewels to Cartier for an ultramodern look. His hefty treasure chest included almost 3,000 diamonds, a number of Burmese rubies and the 234.6-carat De Beers yellow diamond, then the seventh-largest diamond in the world. With careful consultation, the Cartier team created what became known as the Patiala necklace, completed in 1928, and said to be one of the most expensive pieces of jewellery ever made. While they may not all be on that scale, each Cartier piece is unique. And from idea to bauble, a piece of jewellery goes through numerous hands – among them designers, then jewellers, setters and polishers. In Canberra for the opening of the exhibition, Pierre Rainero, Cartier’s head of image, style and heritage, explains that unlike other houses, the emphasis has never been on a single designer or jeweller; instead it’s about the group. “Of course the designer is responsible, he’s the creator of the idea, but as far as the jeweller is concerned, his interpretation in terms of volume, in terms of conception, in terms of articulation has an incredible impact on the final aesthetic. Even the setters and the polishers have an impact on the beauty of the object.” A new Cartier creation begins life in various ways: it could be a design idea or inspired by the purchase of a significant stone. Cartier is also commissioned to make special pieces by royalty, by celebrities and by others of substantial means. Although Cartier jewellery designers work mostly with gouache on paper, they know how a piece will look in various lights and when it moves. There is a difference, says Rainero, between “a design that is jewelled and a piece of jewellery that is designed”. And, he says, in that matter-of-fact French way: “Cartier is about design and style – and not just about assembling stones.” The design then goes to a jeweller who is tasked with bringing it to life. One of the reasons Cartier became so renowned was because their jewellers pioneered the use of platinum. The precious metal is unwieldy, with a high melting point, and was difficult to use in jewellery until Louis-Francois Cartier figured out how to do so. Its rarity, durability, whiteness and the comparatively small amount used – leaving the gems to sparkle – made it popular with those who could afford it. Once the jeweller has worked the metal, the piece goes to the setters who place the gems. Usually cut when they are bought, the stones are occasionally recut by Cartier craftsmen into small gems as part of a design. The house’s signature panther brooches, for example, are covered in tiny jewels. “In some circumstances we are obliged to recut each of the diamonds to create the smooth soft aspect of the diamond. So they are not totally brilliant cut in the traditional way, they are recut the certain way to be set to create a smoothness.” While it’s thrilling to see the pieces in a museum, Rainero says each piece is designed to be worn so it must not snag clothing or be uncomfortable. “Their destiny is to be worn and to play with light on the body and … they are conceived to be articulated, to be in total harmony with the movement of a person and the comfort of the skin and that is something that we cannot measure when you see the piece in a window.” Throughout the creation process, the piece goes back and forth to the polishers, who use all manner of items – including feather shafts, ribbons of paper and soft wooden dowels – to polish the metal internally and externally. This painstaking polishing is one of the marks of quality, says Rainero: “That’s the first thing that we do at Cartier [or at] any jewellery specialist … is to look at the back, how it is done, how it is made and how it is polished.” Usually the designer who works on a piece follows it through this process. For the Patiala necklace, a design team worked on its multiple strands over the three years. At the time the necklace was the largest commission Cartier had received but Rainero says the company is regularly commissioned to make jewellery on the same scale these days. “I can mention one recently,” he says, smiling slightly, “and I think the maharaja would be ashamed.” Ashamed? What does that mean? He smiles once again: “Because the number of stones we had to assemble was much more than that one,” he says. “More, much more.” • Cartier: The Exhibition is on at the National Gallery of Australia until 22 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/03/20-years-on-from-the-jabiluka-mine-protest-we-can-find-hope-in-its-success","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"What anti-Adani protestors can learn from the Jabiluka blockade | Scott Ludlam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/20-years-on-from-the-jabiluka-mine-protest-we-can-find-hope-in-its-success","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/20-years-on-from-the-jabiluka-mine-protest-we-can-find-hope-in-its-success","fields":{"headline":"What anti-Adani protestors can learn from the Jabiluka blockade","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of Australia’s proudest land rights struggles is passing an important anniversary: it is 20 years since the establishment of the blockade camp at Jabiluka in Kakadu national park. This was the moment at which push would come to shove at one of the world’s largest high-grade uranium deposits. The industry would push, and people power would shove right back. The blockade set up a confrontation between two very different kinds of power: on the one side, the campaign was grounded in the desire for self-determination by the Mirarr traditional Aboriginal owners, particularly the formidable senior traditional owner Yvonne Margarula. They were supported by a tiny handful of experienced paid staff and backed by an international network of environment advocates, volunteer activists and researchers. Their task, somehow, was to mobilise thousands of people to travel across the continent to put themselves in the path of heavy equipment that mining company Energy Resources of Australia (which operates the nearby Ranger uranium mine) was seeking to get on to the mineral lease before the wet season set in, and linking this effort with a broader legal, political and corporate strategy. On the other side, people deploying the full resources of the mining industry, the Northern Territory and federal governments, with backing from the global uranium lobby, speaking through a handful of corporate media platforms at enormous volume. You wouldn’t have bet on us. Shortly before I departed for the blockade in September 1998, a friend shook his head, appreciating the effort but suspecting that it was doomed. “Mate, what’s the point? They’ve already made the decision.” But somehow, sparked by the election of John Howard as prime minister in 1996 and the lead business page of the Australian declaring that there would shortly be 25 uranium mines in operation, something extraordinary took place. After bumping down an overgrown track to the blockade camp site on the Oenpelli Road just out of Jabiru, the first thing you were presented with was a passport to Mirarr country. For some of us, this campaign was about the global nuclear industry; for some, it was about the abuses of capitalism; for some, it was about protecting one of the world’s most extraordinary natural places. The passport cut across all of that: whatever may have brought you here, you’re on country now, it said. This struggle is about land rights, about the ability of a sovereign people to determine what happens on their land. This reality was brutally underscored in May 1998, when Margarula was arrested for trespassing on land her family had occupied, cared for and cultivated for at least 65,000 years. Two systems of law were now fully in collision, and at the epicentre, for a time, stood the Jabiluka blockade camp. This dusty assemblage of tents and handmade pavilions would stand for eight months, population indeterminate, as the campaign to stop the mine scaled, and scaled, and scaled. Jabiluka action groups sprang up around the country to support the Mirarr, to go after Westpac Bank for providing finance, and to get in the face of the Howard government which had made the mine a signature policy issue. More than 5,000 people travelled to the camp over the course of the blockade, and around 530 were arrested for peaceful protest. Stories and footage of the arrests record the hair-raising conditions in the eye of the storm. The blockade story was intimately captured by Pip Starr in his documentary Fight for Country. It reminds us that despite the rituals and formalities that can arise between demonstrators, police, contractors and legal authorities in long-running campaigns of nonviolent civil disobedience, life at the point of collision can still be risky and as scary as hell. By July 1998, Newspoll reported 67% nationwide opposition to the project: a mine that almost no one had even heard of six months earlier. On the eve of the wet season, with storm clouds threatening to inundate the site, the blockade camp was packed down, its architectures, internal politics and subcultures passing into activist folklore. But by then, the campaign had hit critical mass and was opening eyes, ears, hearts and doors across Australia and around the world. Over the course of the next few years careful legal, political, financial and social leverage was applied, coordinated by the Mirarr from Jabiru. Occasional miraculous good fortune played its part, and a powerful collective will was brought to bear on a simple focal point: stop the Jabiluka mine. In 2002, following sustained political and media attention, Rio Tinto, by then the majority shareholders of ERA, announced that it was over. Jabiluka would not be mined without Mirarr consent. Just down the road, the Koongarra uranium lease, sited across the extraordinary Nourlangie escarpment, was incorporated back into Kakadu in 2013, as a result of years of almost single-handed campaigning by the Djok traditional owner Jeffrey Lee. That leaves the behemoth Ranger uranium mine, established 20km south of the Jabiluka lease in 1980, through brutal coercion by the Fraser government following the acquisition of 50% of the mine’s equity by the Whitlam government. It, too, is on its last legs; Rio Tinto announced it would not expand the mine through an underground extension in 2015, leaving the company with the daunting task of securing more than 30m tonnes of finely powdered radioactive mine wastes and somehow returning the site to a state in which it can be reincorporated into the surrounding Kakadu world heritage area. Mining has ceased and the company is morosely working through the last of its stockpiles, meaning that by 2021, for the first time in four decades, no uranium oxide will be shipping out of Kakadu. Led by the Mirarr and their representative body, the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, master planning to convert the Jabiru township from a battered little mining village to a world-class cultural and tourism hub is now well under way. Sometimes, as my friend pointed out, the decision has already been made. But sometimes the decision is so catastrophically wrong as to demand a challenge. Those who stood up at Jabiluka, and at the Franklin river, and those who stand today against Adani’s coalmine will be accused of standing in the way of “progress”, will be attacked by government and industry, and will cop huge fines for their acts of trespass and nonviolent obstruction. Until we come to a more intelligent agreement about what we mean by “progress”, these confrontations will continue to happen. In many of them, the bulldozers roll, the pepper spray flows, and people and places go under the wheels. But sometimes, it’s good to know, people grounded in their law and country can prevail. Twenty years on seems like a good time to remind ourselves of that.

All it took was the simple love of a dog – an adorable, scruffy, year-old mongrel of the small oodle variety and with the softest eyes I’ve ever seen on a canine. Teddy be his name and joining me on adventures be his game. I feel happier, more active and healthier than I have been in years. I know it sounds crazy but I could cry just thinking about how much I love and care for this little bundle of fur I’ve known nearly a couple of months. As a willing volunteer, I had my key health stats measured as part of the University of Sydney’s study into the effects of dog ownership on human health about a week before I found and adopted Teddy. I can’t wait to learn how my baseline measurements compare with those to be taken later in the year. The study’s leader, associate professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, said the research “could support programs promoting and enabling dog ownership as a means to increase physical activity, improve general health and prevent cardiovascular and mental illness”. I know my faith in the healing and transformative powers of dog is not shared by everyone. That’s cool. I’m not looking for converts. Rather, I want a few minor rule changes, like those implemented by the Andrews government in Victoria, so dog ownership is a real possibility for any and all who wish to practise their faith in the privacy of their own homes or the sanctity of the local dog park. I want to know I can take my well-socialised and toilet-trained dog on public transport with me when it is reasonable to do so. And I do not want to see dog ownership restricted to those lucky enough to find themselves on the right side of the inequality gap who can afford to own the roof over their heads. In this era of insecure employment and housing in cities bursting with ever-more inhabitants susceptible to epidemics of loneliness and depression, the presence of man’s best friend could benefit many. So why, in Australia, where nearly 40% of Australian households are home to a canine do we have so many prohibitions on dogs in public, and most perversely, private places? My love of dogs hasn’t just begun with Teddy. From a general love of dogs born in the pages of children’s literature, and my grandparents’ alsatian, came Major. A living, breathing, jumping, wagging, drooling, gentle giant whose rough start in life did not limit his ability to play with, protect and unconditionally love the whole Burrell brood. His big brown eyes offered counsel, understanding and pacification through years of growing pains, teenage angst and rebellion. When the whole world was against me, he was by my side. He died just as I had flown the coop in my second year of university. In the years between Major and Teddy, I did lose sight of how important being needed by another living being is to a meaningful and purposeful life. Man’s best friend can fulfil this primal human need as well as other people can. Some go so far as to suggest dogs are better. For the best part of the two decades I barely let myself think about getting a dog of my own. This was for a myriad of seemingly grown-up and responsible reasons. Granted, fun things like travel, freedom, independence and a desire for adventure all played parts. But looking back, it was more so I could fit the neoliberal world’s ideal of a good little moveable independent unit of educated-but-expendable labour. Getting a real dog when I moved back to Australia after 10 years abroad was part of my longer-term efforts to keep the black dog of depression at bay. Finding dog-friendly rental accommodation when I returned to Sydney late last year was a top priority. It did limit my flat-hunt significantly, especially when coupled with a firm desire never again to be in a position where I had to own a car. In the UK and Europe dogs are a far more visible and accepted part of public life. On any given day, outside peak hour, you’ll see dogs on trains, in pubs, cafes and restaurants. American Airlines even allows passengers to bring small dogs and cats into the cabin with them. I see no reason governments in Australia, a nation of dog lovers, couldn’t encourage and adopt these more liberal approaches to one of life’s simplest pleasures for the love of dog. The potential health and social benefits make it seem like a small price to pay probably incalculable benefits, like strengthening neighbourhoods and ameliorating if not reducing social isolation.

The Augusta Chronicle’s front-page headline is profound: “Roberts found dead; Masters co-founder”. As detail is subsequently relayed, that the 83-year-old chairman of Augusta National had been discovered on the property with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the widespread perception of Clifford Roberts is easy to detect. He was, the newspaper insisted, the chairman “with an iron hand”. Inside, an editorial portrays “a genius organiser” and “the indestructible man, the forceful personality whose iron will would normally carry him through any crisis, physical or otherwise”. In reality, deteriorating health proved too much for Roberts to bear. He had not been able to leave his bed during the Masters that year. He killed himself, just as his parents had done in what represents a horribly sad culmination of circumstances. Roberts, with hair cut and dressed in new pyjamas, was found close to the water on Augusta National’s par‑three course. Alongside a pistol were a brief note of apology to his wife and, by way of explanation, a copy of his medical records. The Roberts story is not one anyone in Augusta is encouraged to revisit, for pretty obvious reasons. Nonetheless, his role in the formation of not only a club but also one of sport’s most identifiable events is a fascinating one. It is generally overlooked. Roberts is virtually absent from view, save a three‑minute YouTube clip which reveals his curious speaking style. Roberts, who was widely credited with managing the fiscal affairs of Dwight D Eisenhower, formed a friendship with Bobby Jones in New York which was to culminate in the realisation of the golfing great’s dream. Jones wanted to create a golf venue, if initially not one remotely on the scale of what has evolved since its opening in 1933, with Roberts the great facilitator. Roberts’s investment-banking history on Wall Street belied the Great Depression as Augusta National rose on the site of a former plant nursery. This year, as is standard, Dr Robert Jones IV, the grandson of Bobby and an individual who retains the charm of his legendary relative, will watch the Masters from Augusta National. He had met nieces and nephews of Roberts – who had no children of his own – at the property but they are now conspicuous by their absence. No relatives of Jones or Roberts are believed to be current Augusta members. “The relationship between Cliff Roberts and my grandfather is one of the most interesting things I have studied,” says Dr Jones. “There have been two ways of presenting their relationship; one to portray as my grandfather wore the white hat and Cliff wore the black hat, which I don’t think is particularly fair. The second portrayal is that they were the dearest and closest of friends and remained so until their dying days. To be honest, that is as artificial as the other one. “Here’s where the truth lies, I think. They were both very powerful men. Each of them had extremely unique skill‑sets. My grandfather wanted an informal, relaxed club where friends could gather and occasionally have a tournament among buddies in the spring. He wanted it to be the Augusta National Invitational. Cliff had a very different vision. He was much more detail-conscious and extraordinarily focused on the mission. He saw the Masters for what it could and has become.” Augusta’s link to endemic racism is such that Roberts cannot emerge without implication. Far from it, in fact. “As long as I’m alive, all the golfers will be white and all the caddies will be black” is the most infamous remark attributed to him. In his own acclaimed writings, the author Tom Callahan sharply remarked: “Jones and Roberts might not have been any more racially bigoted than the average American born in 1902 or 1894, but neither of them was a champion of affirmative action.” Callahan tells a cringe-inducing story from the 1974 Masters, whereby Roberts seeks to pre-empt the possible qualification of Jim Dent, a black player. Roberts reveals the player’s cousin is the Augusta National maître d’. When asked for the cousin’s name, a top-table whispering discussion ensues. “We just call him Dent,” replied Roberts. Ludicrous as it may appear against such a backdrop, perhaps elements of history have treated Roberts unfairly. He was largely responsible for hauling Augusta National back from the financial precipice more than once. And on the precipice it was; at one stage there was no money to buy toilet rolls. Alister MacKenzie, the course architect, was given a notice of debt as owed when seeking payment – in the knowledge that nobody in Georgia would be willing to accept it as credit. Dan Jenkins, the renowned US sportswriter and a man who knew Roberts better than anyone on the “outside”, paints a picture not regularly seen. “I saw nothing but his warmth in person,” he explains. “He had committeemen to do some of the dirty work for him, like all great leaders. “In the early days, my wife and I were twice invited to join him for dinner in the clubhouse. It was just the three of us. “He waved us over. Otherwise, he would have dined alone. He was great to us and always to me. He would comment on something I’d written. Once or twice he said: ‘You should have asked me about that. But if I told you the real story, you couldn’t have printed it.’ It took a man like Cliff to get the Masters going.” And go it did. This week marks the 82nd edition. If Jones’s fame rightly went before him, the Roberts impact remains identifiable. • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Headteachers from schools in deprived areas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland say they are having to provide basic services such as washing school uniforms for pupils from poor households, and are even paying for budget advice and counselling services for parents. Teachers and school leaders also said they were regularly providing sanitary products such as tampons for pupils, buying shoes and coats in winter, and in some cases giving emergency loans in cash to families. The experiences of the school leaders are borne out by the findings of a survey published on Monday by the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Education Union (NEU), which is holding its annual conference in Brighton over Easter. In the survey of 900 teachers, 60% said child poverty in schools had worsened since 2015, and one in three said it had got significantly worse. “Poverty on paper seems to be getting better, our number of free school meals seems to be going down, but the reality is completely the reverse – poverty is just becoming more and more extreme. Benefit entitlement rules are shutting more and more families out of the system,” said Jane Jenkins, the headteacher of an inner-city primary school in Cardiff. “It is really tough. When people are asking you about standards and why a school is not higher in the league tables, often that is very much a secondary consideration for us these days. More and more, for third-sector ‎services and children’s services, the pressures that those services are under are absolutely massive. So school is now the only agency where children and parents are getting that sort of support.” Howard Payne, the headteacher of a primary school in Portsmouth, said: “Over the last 18 months the number of child protection issues I have seen has increased fourfold – and I’m in a small school. Every single one of those issues has been related to poverty, debt, not eating enough, and that has increased dramatically.” During the snowstorms this winter, Payne said, he kept his school open when other schools in the area were closed. “I kept ours open because I was really worried about the number of children who wouldn’t get a hot meal that day,” Payne said. Several school leaders said they had noticed a visible difference in health and stature between children from their schools in deprived areas and those from better-off areas. One headteacher from a school in Cumbria, who did not want to be named, said she was shocked to witness the differences between former pupils from her school and those from other primaries. “My children, who have gone from me up to the local secondary school, have grey skin, poor teeth, poor hair, poor nails. They are smaller, they are thinner,” she said. “At sporting events, you see your children in the year group compared to other children in an affluent area and you think: our kids are really small. You don’t notice it because you’re with them all the time, but when you see them with children of the same age who are from an affluent area, they just look tiny.” Other school leaders reported having to clean pupils’ school uniforms, especially after weekends when some children from poor households had no way of washing their clothes. “We are expected to be social workers, to be carers, doctors, we are expected to deal with every issue at the same time as doing all the other things that government wants us to do,” said Louise Regan, the head of a primary school in Nottinghamshire. “We have a food bank, so we give out food parcels, particularly on Fridays, we buy clothing, we do a lot of buying, particularly coats in winter and shoes,” Regan said. “We’ve had children who haven’t come to school because they didn’t have shoes. We’ve gone and bought shoes, taken them to their house and brought the child into school.” The headteachers, all delegates attending the NEU’s conference, said Mondays were often the worst days, with children arriving in school hungry and tired after a weekend with little food. Celia Dignam, an NEU official responsible for child poverty, said the union’s survey revealed the reality of 4.1 million children living in poverty. “Schools, as well as educating children, are now a safety net, particularly for children in poverty,” Dignam said, noting that the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that 5 million children would be living in poverty by 2021. “This is not a situation that is getting better, it’s actually getting significantly worse,” she said. The survey found that 55% of teachers felt free school meal provision did not come close to meeting the needs of pupils from poor backgrounds. “From 2022 there’s going to be an income threshold for universal credit, so there are children currently entitled to free school meals who will not be getting them,” said Dignam. “We’re heading for an absolute crisis. You think we’ve got a crisis now but it’s going to get even worse unless we see some policy change from government.” The NEU argues that all children whose families are receiving universal credit should become eligible for free school meals. Although child poverty sits outside of the Department for Education’s remit, the DfE has allowed pupil premium funding to be used for poverty alleviation. “We continue to support the most disadvantaged children [in England] through free school meals, the £2.5bn funding given to schools through the pupil premium to support their education and the recently announced £26m investment to kickstart or improve breakfast clubs in at least 1,700 schools,” a DfE spokesperson said. Last week the education minister Nadhim Zahawi announced funding for research into ways of supporting disadvantaged families during the school holidays, to overcome “holiday hunger”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/01/trump-says-no-more-daca-deal-attacks-nafta","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T20:07:17Z","webTitle":"Easter tirade: Trump attacks Nafta and says 'No more Daca deal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/01/trump-says-no-more-daca-deal-attacks-nafta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/01/trump-says-no-more-daca-deal-attacks-nafta","fields":{"headline":"Easter tirade: Trump attacks Nafta and says 'No more Daca deal'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An hour after wishing the world happy Easter, Donald Trump followed up by seeming to call off any lingering hopes of a deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented migrants who arrived in the US as children. In a series of characteristically aggressive tweets on Sunday morning, the president announced that a deal to secure status for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) recipients was “NO MORE”; threatened once again to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico and Canada; and called on congressional Republicans to force through a vote on tougher immigration law. In his first public appearance with his wife Melania since CBS broadcast an interview with an actor in adult films who says she had an affair with him in 2006, Trump attended an Easter service at a church close to his exclusive members’ club in southern Florida. The Trumps were married in the church, Bethesda-by-the-Sea, in 2005. Shortly before the service, the president tweeted: “Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release. Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!” Although the president is prone to outbursts on Twitter over unsubstantiated and false claims about immigration, and to U-turns on policy, his apparent decision to call off any hope of a deal on Daca is a potentially severe setback to the ongoing debate in Congress over immigration reform. Trump has previously been open to negotiating with congressional Democrats to protect recipients of protection from deportation under Daca, an Obama-era program that Trump abruptly ended last year. In exchange, the president has called for funding to build a wall on the southern border between the US and Mexico, along with other hardline immigration measures. But recent reports have suggested Trump has grown increasingly frustrated at the lack of funding for the wall, which he promised throughout the 2016 campaign would be funded entirely by Mexico. This week he hinted that perhaps the Department of Defense could pay for the wall. Experts said that would be almost impossible. Although Trump moved to end Daca by executive order, a federal judge has ordered the administration to continue renewing applications. A permanent legislative deal on Daca is seen by Democrats as the foundation for any wider immigration reform. In calling on Republican leaders in the Senate to “go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW”, the president was referring to Senate rules that require 60 votes for legislation to pass. Trump has long called for the majority to fall to 51 – a move that has so far been resisted by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Speaking to reporters briefly outside the church in Florida, Trump said Democrats “blew it” on Daca and called on Mexico to ramp up immigration enforcement. “Mexico has got to help us at the border,” he said. “If they’re not going to help us at the border, it’s a very sad thing between our two countries.” He also claimed: “A lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Daca, and we’re going to have to really see.” To be eligible for Daca, applicants must have lived in the US continually since 15 June 2007 and come to the US before their 16th birthday. Applicants must also either be in school, or have graduated high school, or have been honorably discharged from the US military or coast guard. The president also accused Mexico of laughing “at our dumb immigration laws”, adding: “They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!” The US is engaged in ongoing negotiations with Mexico and Canada over the future of Nafta. As recently as last week, officials expressed optimism that a new deal could be reached expeditiously. Among Trump’s opponents, the Democratic Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison tweeted: “‘NO MORE DACA DEAL’?!! You were never doing a DACA deal. Your actions gave you away: cancelling DACA with no plan, making racist comments about Black/Brown immigrants, ejecting several by bipartisan deals. You didn’t fool anybody.” Ohio’s governor, John Kasich, a potential Republican challenger to Trump in the 2020 primary, wrote: “A true leader preserves &amp; offers hope, doesn’t take hope from innocent children who call America home. Remember, today is Easter Sunday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/01/adam-peaty-determined-to-increase-performance-and-bank-balance","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T21:00:07Z","webTitle":"Adam Peaty determined to increase his performance and bank balance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/01/adam-peaty-determined-to-increase-performance-and-bank-balance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/01/adam-peaty-determined-to-increase-performance-and-bank-balance","fields":{"headline":"Adam Peaty determined to increase his performance and bank balance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the titles have stacked up for Adam Peaty he has become more pragmatic in his approach to success.

You don’t want to get to the end of your career when you have only just thought about that. You want something to be proud of and that you have built up. I want to make the best of the situation I am in for the next few years, hopefully the next 10 years.” That is not to say Peaty has grown immune to the emotion of standing atop a medal podium. He has 26 senior career medals and wants at least double that number by the time he hangs up his swimming trunks for good. “I’ve done that in three or four years, so anything above 50 would be pretty good. If they can all be gold, then even better. That is a massive feat to achieve but you have to have something that is really up there to push yourself every day, particularly in the winter months back home.” As a single stroke swimmer, Peaty’s dominance is limited to the 50m and 100m breaststroke, meaning he will never get close to the number of medals won by Michael Phelps or even Ian Thorpe, who were both multi‑stroke athletes. But Peaty’s dominance in his own discipline is every bit as stunning. His 100m breaststroke world record at the Rio Olympics was 57.13 seconds and his winning margin in the final was more than 1.5sec. It is what prompted him to initiate “Project 56” with the aim being to be the first swimmer to dip under 57sec. “Obviously I’ve seen Phelps do what he did and it’s an amazing achievement,” he said. “But I’m only breaststroke at the moment and have no plans to change, so it’s very different in terms of medals. I’m aiming to swim the fastest anyone’s swum ever. Phelps was probably going for that as well but I’m trying to push it to a point where hopefully people can’t get to for many years. It would be like Bolt running 9.2/9.3sec for 100m. The rest of the world are still on 58.4 and they haven’t been that fast for four years. To be almost two seconds up on the rest of the world is almost unheard of.” In the more immediate future, Peaty is passionate about wearing the flag of St George and competing for England, as opposed to Great Britain. At the Team England training camp in Brisbane part of the preparation outside the pool has been to harness the feeling of what it means to be English. “It’s quite easy to be Scottish or Welsh,” Peaty said. “But for the English it’s quite hard to get an identity. It’s something we’re trying to discover. As English we are not defenders, we are attackers. That’s the way we’re going to approach sport. We’re not going to sit on a high horse, we’re going to get down and dirty and race our hearts out. Just because we haven’t got such a strong identity as Scotland and Wales doesn’t mean that we’re not going to give it to them in the pool and in any other sport.” There is also the additional challenge of swimming outdoors, in the Gold Coast’s Optus Aquatics Centre – an arena which seats 10,000 – something Peaty is relishing. “I’m a ginger kid from Uttoxeter, so it might be a bit difficult in heat,” he joked. “But actually when you’re swimming outdoors it’s a lot better, you can take in the atmosphere. I came out to Brisbane two years before Rio, so I’ve already got that under my belt. You’ve got the sun on your back and tan as you swim. You kill two birds with one stone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/01/ben-barba-st-helens-win-trophies-super-league","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T15:19:23Z","webTitle":"Ben Barba happy to concentrate on helping St Helens win trophies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/01/ben-barba-st-helens-win-trophies-super-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/01/ben-barba-st-helens-win-trophies-super-league","fields":{"headline":"Ben Barba happy to concentrate on helping St Helens win trophies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ben Barba is unlikely to make a decision on whether he will return to the National Rugby League next season until the end of the current campaign and he says his sole priority now is delivering a sixth Super League title to St Helens. The full-back has been the outstanding player in the opening two months of this season, inevitably prompting speculation about a return to the NRL, with the 28-year-old having now served the suspension for the failed drugs test that left him exiled from Australian rugby league. But he insists he is still open‑minded about his long-term future. “The speculation is obviously pretty intense and the honest answer right now is it’s a tough question to try and work out,” Barba said. “There’s a lot going on but I don’t want to think about that until the end of the season. “It’s a massive decision and there’s pressure from family in Australia who want you to come home. I won’t discuss it until way down the track, though, because right now it’s about getting St Helens to a few finals and winning some trophies with this great club.” Barba says he and his family have adapted well to life in England. “They love it here. If they’re happy, that’s the main thing – and they’re loving it right now. The club and the town have been so wonderful – they’ve made us feel welcome and we’ll forever be grateful for that.” St Helens travel to Widnes on Monday and, with Barba having not joined St Helens until midway through last year, it will be his first experience of the maligned Easter period when Super League sides play twice in four days. The Australian says he is not concerned about the rigours of such a demanding schedule. “I’m actually looking forward to it,” he said. “I’ve played in a lot of footy carnivals back home where you play a few games in a few days; there are indigenous carnivals where you can play five times across a weekend. “We’ve got the right people here who will make sure we’re OK. Players want to play and playing in games is the fun bit after all. We’ll recover properly and, in a way, it’s a good thing for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/let-married-women-keep-their-name","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T17:16:53Z","webTitle":"Let married women keep their name | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/let-married-women-keep-their-name","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/let-married-women-keep-their-name","fields":{"headline":"Let married women keep their name","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some of your correspondents (Letters, 31 March) appear to be totally missing the point that Joanna Moorhead (Don’t dare call me Mrs. I kept my own name for a reason, 29 March) is trying to make.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Let’s start in the middle - of nowhere. Valerian Albanov’s In the Land of White Death: An Epic Story of Survival in the Siberian Arctic has impressed goldgato: This is the amazing story of the 1912 Brusilov Expedition to the Arctic and the desperate attempt by a handful of men to make it back alive. I wasn’t thrilled about Albanov’s constant markdowns of his fellow team members, but it was quite an exciting read. Meanwhile, greenmill has been in the Australian Outback with Jill Ker Conway’s The Road from Coorain: About her childhood on a remote sheep station in Australia in the 1940s and her realisation as a young adult, (feted as a gifted intellectual in Sydney but drawn back to the solitude and hard scrabble life of the Outback) that in the end she could never be who she really wanted to be in the country she loved. Her descriptions of the struggle between duty to a lonely and unfulfilled mother, and her overpowering need to get away and rewrite Australian history in a non-British Empire idiom are intense and moving. A marvellous read. The Inimitable Charles Dickens made one of his regular appearances last week, with SydneyH enjoying Oliver Twist: I had in mind a sort of over-sentimental depiction of an orphan begging for more food, and a number of reviews I’ve encountered which have represented it as a flawed early text. What I found was a brilliant, cruel satire in the manner of Jonathan Swift, which morphs into an adventure narrative in which a gang of criminals are rounded up for retribution. Critics of Oliver Twist find that it fails as both a Naturalist text and as a work of social criticism: the plot becomes implausibly elaborate, and the good characters lack personality; and Dickens doesn’t stay true to his earlier satire of working-class hardship, passing on opportunities to emphasise the conditions of child-criminals and prostitutes. But I feel that he succeeds in avoiding the heavy-handed Social Realism of Hard Times, and in crude patches in some of his later works. The novel’s dramatic qualities for me outweigh its many imperfections. HaveOneOnMe3 has a lot to say about Renata Adler’s Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker, which she “flew through it in a couple of sittings”: I guess it’s because the backstabbing, cronyism, the cliques, the subtle politics of power in an office space - it’s a microcosm of society. Finally, Magrat123 finished The Enchanted April by Elizabeth Von Arnim “and it was just delicious”: In 1922 a couple of unhappily married women arrange to go without their husbands for a month’s holiday in a castle in Italy, rented to them by its wealthy English owner. To defray expenses they add to the party a famously beautiful but discontented young aristocrat and an elderly widow (65 she is, oh dear!) whose disapproving view of the world was fixed in her Victorian childhood when she was patted on the head by literary lions like Browning and Tennyson. What ensues is witty and very funny, confusion and misunderstandings leading to all sorts of farcical events, in the style of Wodehouse but underpinned by considered social commentary. And, be still my beating heart, it finishes with happy endings all round! The perfect place to wrap up for the week.

To an instinctive vision of the game and a superlative range of skills he was already bringing elegance, composure and, most of all, a precocious sense of responsibility that enabled him to instil a sense of purpose into a team who had just been relegated to the old Second Division. As a classical inside-forward, Wilkins was always a joy to watch. He led Chelsea back into the top tier in his second season as the captain of a team assembled by Eddie McCreadie, a manager willing to put his faith in youth, before taking his qualities to Manchester United, Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Rangers. He was respected everywhere he went in those years, from the mid-1970s to the end of the 80s. He left Old Trafford in 1984 as the supporters’ player of the season in a team who also included Bryan Robson and Arnold Muhren, and is warmly remembered at San Siro, where he spent three years during a difficult era for the Rossoneri and made his exit only when a new owner, Silvio Berlusconi, reshaped the squad around a group of Dutch masters at a time when only two foreign players were allowed. His stay with PSG was brief but at Ibrox he won the Scottish league title and wept with the fans when saying his farewell. His 84 caps for England – 10 of them as captain – came under Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson. In a midfield where players such as Bryan Robson, Glenn Hoddle and Peter Reid were also vying for places, he was often the victim of that innate sense of responsibility. He would frequently sit deep, holding position, playing a simple ball and encouraging others to take on the creative role to which he was better suited. In that way he allowed some observers to persuade themselves that he was an unimaginative player, when the opposite was the truth. The delusion was cemented when Ron Atkinson nicknamed him “The Crab”, for his supposed habit of passing sideways. It would not be the last time that Atkinson’s mouth did more damage than he intended. Wilkins was not a prolific scorer but his goals could be memorable. United’s fans remember an exquisite left-footed curler in the 1983 FA Cup final against Brighton, while Rangers’ supporters cherish another memorable strike, a sweetly timed right-footed volley from outside the area, for Graeme Souness’s side in an Old Firm match in 1988. His 10-year England career was spoiled near its end by a moment of hot-headedness that was wholly uncharacteristic but had its origins in his better qualities. Bryan Robson, his former United team-mate, and he started the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico as the twin pivots of England’s midfield, respectively captain and vice-captain. Robson, however, had been suffering from a dislocated shoulder before the tournament and should not have been included in the squad. When the injury recurred and Robson had to leave the field during the second group match against Morocco, his tournament clearly over, Wilkins’s frustration led him to throw the ball at the referee while disputing a decision. It was the first time an England player had been sent off during a World Cup finals. Wilkins came from a west London football family – his father had played for Brentford and Nottingham Forest, and his three brothers all played professionally – and he was reluctant to let his playing career go. After touching the heights he was happy to slide gently down the scale, from Queens Park Rangers and Hibernian to fleeting spells at Wycombe Wanderers, Millwall and Leyton Orient, where he hung up his boots after three games in 1997, aged 40. He had made just under 700 league appearances for his 11 clubs in England, Italy, France and Scotland, scoring 49 goals. By that time he had already spent two years as player-manager at QPR, taking them to eighth in the Premier League in his first season but to relegation in his second. He spent a year as Fulham’s head coach, taking them to the play-offs in the Second Division (as the third tier was then known) before being removed by Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner, who installed Kevin Keegan, previously the club’s chief operating officer, as manager. Then came three further spells at Stamford Bridge as assistant first to Gianluca Vialli, then to Luiz Felipe Scolari and finally to Carlo Ancelotti. It was a role and an environment that suited Wilkins perfectly, particularly after the arrival of his friend Carletto, a fellow ex-Milanista. Together in 2009-10 they won the first league and Cup double in the club’s history and Wilkins’s first trophies in his long and intimate association with the club. “Ray is one of those select few, always present, noble in spirit, a real blue-blood,” Ancelotti wrote in his autobiography. “Chelsea flows in his veins.” But one day at the training centre at Cobham, a few weeks into the following season, he was told that his services were no longer required. The reason was never made public, although it was suspected that he may have said something out of turn in the presence of the owner, Roman Abramovich. That would have been strangely untypical, since Wilkins was the most well-mannered and courteous of football men. In his later years he provided generous-spirited if often anodyne contributions to Sky Sports and Talksport and after receiving a four-year driving ban, admitted to problems with alcohol. He also suffered from ulcerative colitis and underwent a double heart bypass operation last year. On TV he was talking to an audience who mostly had little knowledge of his prime as a player. Like Abramovich, they had not been present at Stamford Bridge in the mid-70s to see the young captain return an opposition goalkeeper’s clearance straight back into the net from the halfway line, or to witness him play a pass from the edge of his own area and race up the field to meet the return, scoring with a full-length diving header. Nor had they seen the teenager putting a hand on the shoulder of Peter Bonetti to console Chelsea’s veteran keeper for some disastrous error. That was the real and very remarkable Ray Wilkins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/01/victims-sexual-violence-john-worboys","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T16:08:08Z","webTitle":"Victims of sexual violence are right to fear another John Worboys | Harriet Wistrich","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/victims-sexual-violence-john-worboys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/victims-sexual-violence-john-worboys","fields":{"headline":"Victims of sexual violence are right to fear another John Worboys","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the Parole Board decision to release John Worboys was reported in the media in early January, I was asked to comment. This was because I was representing two of his victims, DSD and NBV, in a successful challenge of the police investigation under the Human Rights Act. My clients had not been consulted, and first heard about the decision in the news. They were shocked and horrified. Both were convinced he would offend again and asked if there was anything they could do. Calls from many other victims followed; some had reported him previously but their cases were not prosecuted, others had never come forward before – but now felt compelled to do whatever they could to stop someone they believed remained a danger to women from being freed to offend again. While the vast majority of the public shared the victims’ belief that the decision defied logic, some legal commentators asked for calm, reminding us that “the usually risk-averse Parole Board” was expert. As a lawyer who has represented women convicted of killing violent partners and going through the parole process, I am aware of Parole Board decisions requiring a life-sentence prisoner to serve years beyond her tariff because of evidence of some mental instability not uncommon in victims of trauma. So how did the Parole Board get it so wrong and what lessons might we learn from its mistakes? Well, partly, as the court found, the failure lay with the secretary of state, whose officials had responsibility for compiling the material for consideration by the board. Although there were references to Worboys’ wider offending, details of relevant evidence was not put before the panel. For example, the high court judgment against the police that documented how Worboys was ultimately linked to 105 reported attacks on women was not included. Second, the Crown Prosecution Service had failed in deciding to prosecute only a sample of offences that had taken place over a relatively short time span. This led to the insultingly short eight-year minimum tariff, and the Parole Board wrongly restricting its considerations of Worboys’ risk by referring to only those crimes he was convicted of. The board relied on the reports of three forensic psychologists who supported the release decision and, despite opposition from his offender manager and other prison staff, concluded: “You have learned to be open and honest with professionals and you are assessed as being compliant” … And “you say that SOTP [the sexual offences treatment programme] has taught you to identify risk factors and put in place strategies to self-manage risks”. Worboys attended an SOTP which was subsequently withdrawn because it was found to have led to an increase in offending. Such courses may do little more than teach manipulative prisoners how to act and say the right thing to secure release. Risk assessment and sex offender treatment are focused on the risk of repeating acts of sexual violence, or of being reconvicted for a sexual offence. However, that risk is measured in statistical outcomes that may be virtually meaningless when we know that most sex offences are not reported, and that only 6-7% of those that are reported result in a conviction. Thus, the risk of reconviction is very small. As all the victims who contacted me have said, Worboys – who played a slightly pathetic and friendless character – persuaded them, against their better judgment, to have a drink in the back of his cab and celebrate his lottery win. Surely the Parole Board should have considered that someone who miraculously decided to accept his offending only nine months away from his first board review might similarly have been trying to pull the wool over their eyes? What the Worboys case tells us, from the failures of the police right through to every other criminal justice agency that dealt with him, is that we have a long way to go before victims of sexual violence can get justice. • Harriet Wistrich is a director of the Centre for Women’s Justice"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/01/former-speaker-michael-martin-calls-for-labour-conference-on-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T23:37:33Z","webTitle":"Former Speaker Michael Martin calls for Labour conference on antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/01/former-speaker-michael-martin-calls-for-labour-conference-on-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/01/former-speaker-michael-martin-calls-for-labour-conference-on-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Former Speaker Michael Martin calls for Labour conference on antisemitism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michael Martin, the former Commons Speaker, became the latest senior figure to speak out against antisemitism in Labour on Sunday when he called for a special one-day conference to address the problem. In a rare intervention in party politics for someone who had to quit the party whip when he became Speaker, Lord Martin said he was “appalled” by what was happening in Labour and that failure to tackle antisemitism could cost it the next election. Stressing that he was not criticising Jeremy Corbyn personally for the problem, the former Labour MP, who now sits on the crossbenches in the Lords as Lord Martin of Springburn, said a special conference would allow party members to show how strongly they were opposed to antisemitism. Martin’s intervention came as Labour confirmed that Corbyn has suspended his personal Facebook account. Party sources said it was administratively simpler for Corbyn to have just one Facebook account – he has retained his official one –although the move came as the party faced fresh criticism over senior officials belonging to Facebook groups where antisemitic messages were posted. In an interview with the Guardian, Martin said that he had decided to speak out because ill health meant he could not attend the protest organised by Jewish leaders outside parliament last Monday, saying Labour should take antisemitism more seriously. “You recall the saying, ‘evil happens when good men do nothing’. I have not been attending parliament because I’m on sick leave, but if I had been there on Monday last week, I would have joined the protest,” he said. “I don’t want anyone ever coming back to me and saying, ‘Michael, you said nothing about antisemitism.’” Martin said he believed antisemitism was a genuine problem within Labour and he rejected the argument that those raising concerns about it were only doing so to attack Corbyn. “If you ran a restaurant, and it was dirty and there were cockroaches, you wouldn’t get away with saying ‘the restaurant down the road is dirty and has cockroaches too’. You would be expected to sort out the problem,” he said. Martin said that, although the media were demanding answers from Corbyn, it would be better if ordinary party members could attend a one-day conference – a mechanism that has been used by Labour in the past to resolve specific disputes – to express their abhorrence for antisemitism. “I think the time has come when we’ve got to get a one-day conference – that conference can be done in a regional basis, or in a national basis – but we need the membership to come together and say: ‘In no circumstances are we antisemitic. We are a democratic party and we thrive on decency,’” he said. Martin, the first Catholic to serve as Commons Speaker since the Reformation, said there were personal reasons why he felt so strongly about this issue. His uncle was killed in the second world war, and his father served at sea, surviving a U-boat attack. He said he did not want not people to forget the sacrifices that were made by that generation in the fight against fascism and antisemitism. He also said one of the people who most inspired him most to go into politics was Myer Galpern, the first Jewish Lord Provost of Glasgow and a subsequent deputy speaker of the House of Commons. “The only way that the Labour party can improve the quality of life for men and women, and children, is if they are elected to public office and they have a parliamentary majority,” he said. “And if Labour is seen as antisemitic, then that is going to be at risk.” On Sunday, the Sunday Times reported that a two-month investigation into 20 of the biggest pro-Corbyn Facebook groups had uncovered more than 2,000 racist, antisemitic, misogynist, violent and abusive messages. Twelve senior Labour staffers were members of these groups, it said. The paper did not provide evidence of any of them posting or supporting offensive messages, and a Labour source said the staff members identified by the paper were adamant they had not seen the offensive material in question. Labour insiders dismissed a report in the Times claiming that the party is facing a worrying fall in membership. The newspaper claimed that 3,000 members refused to renew direct debits last week, but a source familiar with the latest internal figures said this was not a figure that has been reported to the party. The Times also said the party had lost 17,000 members since the start of the year, a drop off rate of about 3%. Membership was more than 570,000 after the election. But the source said these were misleading figures that did not take account of people joining and that there was nothing unusual about the trend in recent months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/01/ashley-giles-turns-down-approach-to-be-ecb-national-selector-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T12:53:45Z","webTitle":"Ashley Giles turns down approach to be ECB’s new national selector","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/01/ashley-giles-turns-down-approach-to-be-ecb-national-selector-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/01/ashley-giles-turns-down-approach-to-be-ecb-national-selector-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Ashley Giles turns down approach to be ECB’s new national selector","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ashley Giles has turned down an approach from the England and Wales Cricket Board to become its new national selector. Andrew Strauss, the England team director, announced an overhaul to the selection process after – but apparently not in spite of – the 4-0 Ashes defeat in Australia, with James Whitaker stepping down after 10 years on the panel, of which four were spent in the lead role. Giles, the former spinner, was previously a selector from 2008 to 2014. This was combined with his first spell as Warwickshire’s director of cricket and then 18 months as the England one‑day coach. He then moved on to Lancashire when the split-coach model, in which Andy Flower was in charge of the Test side, was ended. The 45-year-old, now in his second year back at Edgbaston as sporting director, is understood to have been contacted about the new England vacancy in the past week. This was declined, however, as Giles looks to rebuild Warwickshire from their place in Division Two following relegation last summer. Strauss advertised the national selector role a fortnight ago as part of a revamped system that slims the panel down by one spot but increases the input of an extended scouting network. The new national selector will appoint the deputy, who will sit on the committee along with the head coach, Trevor Bayliss. The existing selectors Mick Newell and Angus Fraser – the cricket directors at Nottinghamshire and Middlesex respectively – have been invited to apply for the top job but would have to leave their county jobs if they were appointed. Such dual roles are being cut from the England set-up to avoid perceptions about any conflict of interest. Strauss began establishing the new scouting network last summer when the former England players Geoff Arnold, Bob Cottam, John Emburey, Jack Birkenshaw and Mike Hendrick helped to spot players for the England Lions and England Under-19s. Now the Loughborough coaches Graham Thorpe, Kevin Shine and Peter Such will also have greater input into the decision-making process, with Mo Bobat, the player identification lead, overseeing the network. “The new approach will allow us to see more players throughout the county game more often, and simplify the selection process,” Strauss said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/03/man-booker-prize-criticised-for-changing-taiwanese-authors-nationality","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T05:55:41Z","webTitle":"Man Booker prize criticised for changing Taiwanese author's nationality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/03/man-booker-prize-criticised-for-changing-taiwanese-authors-nationality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/03/man-booker-prize-criticised-for-changing-taiwanese-authors-nationality","fields":{"headline":"Man Booker prize criticised for changing Taiwanese author's nationality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Man Booker prize nominee has had his nationality changed from Taiwan to “Taiwan, China” after Beijing exerted pressure on the organisers of the literary prize. Wu Ming-Yi was put on the long list for the Man Booker international prize this month and posted the news on his Facebook page. “Even though this is only the first stage of the long list, I am extremely honoured to be on it and even more so given that my nationality is listed as Taiwan. I hope this novel will allow readers to see Taiwan’s history, view, and spirit.” A little over two weeks later, his nationality, as described on Man Booker’s website, was changed in line with Beijing’s stance that the self-governed island almost 200 miles (320km) east of mainland China is part of China. Wu wrote on his Facebook page that his new listed nationality did not reflect his “personal position on this issue” and said he would be making his views known to Man Booker. Man Booker’s Facebook page was soon filled with criticism and one-star reviews. One reviewer wrote: “Nationality is as much a part of one’s personal identity as it is a political designation. An organisation that is supposed to celebrate and honor creative minds should be able to respect and acknowledge one of their finalist’s self-reported nationality.” Man Booker said on Tuesday it was “seeking clarification” from the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the country’s official position on Taiwan. The awards organiser said it had received earlier advice that “Taiwan, China, was the correct, politically neutral form,” according to the spokesperson Truda Spruyt. Spruyt confirmed that the awards organiser had received complaints from the Chinese embassy. “We are aware that Wu Ming-Yi defines himself as Taiwanese and have kept him informed throughout the process,” she said. Wu told the Guardian on Monday he was “waiting for clarification” on the issue. His nominated novel, The Stolen Bicycle, follows a bicycle restorer in search of his father and who, in the course of restoring antique bicycles, retraces the history of modern Taiwan. For most of the last six decades since China’s nationalist army fled to the island in 1949, Taiwan has ruled itself with its own democratically elected government, currency, military, and diplomatic ties with a handful of countries. It has never declared formal independence. Over the past year, China has ramped up pressure on foreign companies that describe Taiwan as a country. The German airline Lufthansa and the UK’s British Airways dropped Taiwan from their lists of countries. Beijing has also barred those on the wrong side of the Taiwan issue from access to its massive domestic entertainment market. Beijing recently banned the Taiwanese film Missing Johnny over claims the lead actor supports calls for Taiwan’s independence. “China has already been using arts and culture to enforce its One China policy,” said Brian Skerratt, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Chinese Literature and Philosophy, Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. “Since China is the biggest audience for Chinese-language culture, that can hurt.” Wu has declined to speak on the subject, referring journalists to his past work. When visiting a school in Macau two years ago, a student asked him for his thoughts on the relationship between China and Taiwan. According to his account of the exchange, Wu spoke carefully, choosing what he thought were neutral words. “From my observations, most of the younger generation, or myself, don’t think about this question of returning to China. They live in a new cultural, political, and social environment,” he said.

Growing up in country Victoria from the Gunditjmara and Yorta Yorta tribes, she had played team sport as a teenager, but after the birth of her son, found the barriers too great to re-engage. Having recently lost three family members, and struggling with anxiety and depression, however, she knew something needed to change. This happened dramatically when she took up a friend’s invitation to apply for the Robert de Castella Indigenous Marathon Foundation team. “We had to do a 3km tryout and an interview. I struggled with my 3km, [because] I’d never run more than 5km and had no idea how far a marathon was,” she said with a laugh. “When I got the call and they said I made the team, I felt like crying. I think I just needed a goal to focus on. I felt I needed to do something for myself.” Taking up long-distance running in her late 20s, however, wasn’t easy for Lovett-Murray. To begin with, she was worried about how she would look practising for a marathon from a base of just 3km. “I never used to go to the gym and run if there were heaps of people in there. So, when I first started, I did a lot of early morning stuff, when there weren’t many people out. I was quite embarrassed in case I looked funny, or didn’t look very cool, or wasn’t fast enough.” This aspect of Lovett-Murray’s story is a familiar story for many women. According to Victorian-based campaign, This Girl Can, 52% of women worry about being judged while exercising, and for over 40%, this feeling of embarrassment or intimidation is so strong they think it unlikely they will start at all. These numbers add up to an alarming three in five (or 60%) of Australian women who are not sufficiently active, and one in five women who don’t do any physical activity in a typical week. For Lovett-Murray, becoming a mother compounded these existing barriers to returning to physical activity. Her son, she said, would often cry when she left to jog, which made her feel like she was a bad mother for exercising. “The first couple of months, he would cry when I walked out the door. But by the end of it, he would be like, “OK, Mum’s going for a run, and that’s OK, she’s coming back.” “[Having kids] definitely makes it harder to get back into exercise, but if I didn’t have a sitter or he was upset, I’d just take him with me in a jogger. You can always find a way around. Sometimes I’d work out at home if I couldn’t get to the gym: I’d be on the treadmill at 10 o’clock at night, because that’s the only time I could fit it in.” Lovett-Murray’s persistence has now paid off in a big way, having recently competed in the New York Marathon, a half marathon on the Gold Coast, and a special Mother’s Day Classic event in the company of one of her biggest inspirations: her Aunty. “My Aunty has always been a runner, and last year, she ran her 20th consecutive Mother’s Day Classic. So I organised a group of women from our community [near Heywood], Aboriginal women, to run at her side. There were about 25 of us that ran with my 74-year-old Aunty. Seeing her out there doing it, just makes you think there are no excuses really. “Now I organise big fun runs for the community, and each year, we select a team for the National Indigenous Deadly Fun Run. The community gets really excited about it. It’s a trip to Uluru and it’s getting them out the house, and they love being out on country running.” Lovett-Murray’s success story is one of several chosen to be at the forefront of This Girl Can, which builds on the UK-based campaign of the same name. Created by Sport England, This Girl Can was responsible for a set of viral videos that inspired a record 3.9 million British women to get active. The key to its success, says VicHealth CEO Jerril Rechter, was that the campaign took time to dig deeper into the reasons women don’t exercise or participate in sport. “It’s the barrier that no one has been talking about, but our foundation research really clearly showed that fear of judgement is huge. It can be defined under three areas: appearance, priority and ability. With appearance, women were worried about being judged for being too sweaty, having a red face, changing in front of other people, getting too muscular or not appearing feminine enough,” she said. “With priorities, women felt like they were being judged for spending time exercising when they should be with family, because that’s more important. Or that they should be with friends, or studying, or working. “And with ability, it was not being fit enough, not [being] good enough, [or] not knowing the rules. One of the things that was quite strong was women didn’t want to feel like they were holding the team back. That is why they will exclude themselves from sport.” Another of This Girl Can Victoria’s ambassadors, Lisa Schuppe, added that one of the biggest issues for women was the difference between theirs and men’s “entitlement” to space. At 53, she is a keen surfer, but has only recently taken up the sport again after her experience as a girl who wanted to surf just like her friends who were boys – but was instead treated inequitably. “I’ve always been in the water, from when I was a young girl. But we would use surf mats back in the day, because little girls didn’t surf in the 70s and 80s,” she recalls. “My dad had a surf ski and we would go out on that. That wasn’t cool, you know. All my boy mates had surfboards, and my sister and I had surf mats, which were these blow-up things that we sat around in the water on the waves. We’d surf just the same, but you can’t stand up on a blow-up surf mat!” Without being conscious of it at the time, she turned her attention to body boarding, because of her surf mat experience as a girl. She didn’t think to return to surfing, until she was in her late 30s and had some friends come and stay from overseas and encourage her to take up lessons again. Now, she says, she is grateful to be back in the water, but still keenly feels the effects of gender inequity in this space. “There’s a lot of testosterone in the water” is Lisa’s signature quote for the This Girl Can campaign. “When you’re out there and you’re thinking you’re going to get a wave, you look across and instead see a bloke going for it, so you hang back,” she says. “You see them look around, paddling and racing to get the wave. So you feel like you can’t [go for it]. In fact just the other day, I watched a guy drop in on a young woman. And she was having a great time on the waves, until he dropped in. Look, I’m no Stephanie Gilmore. I’m really just a beginner with a long journey, but for me that just deflates me and makes me feel that I’m not as entitled to go for it.” As a result, says Schuppe, she no longer surfs at the “wild” beaches like Bells or Jan Juc, instead preferring to stick to Torquay. She hopes, however, that with campaigns like This Girl Can, women will “get out there and participate, and don’t take on anything external that’s negative”. Rechter says this is exactly what the campaign hopes to achieve. “We know that if women can identify themselves in advertising and media, they’re more likely to overcome their fears of judgment. We want to empower women to be comfortable in their bodies and in public space.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/02/look-beyond-tiger-woods-homegrown-masters-champion","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T20:28:22Z","webTitle":"Look beyond the revived Tiger Woods for a homegrown Masters champion | Bryan Armen Graham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/02/look-beyond-tiger-woods-homegrown-masters-champion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/02/look-beyond-tiger-woods-homegrown-masters-champion","fields":{"headline":"Look beyond the revived Tiger Woods for a homegrown Masters champion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Masters has never been a more international affair than in recent years. When the season’s first major championship tees off on Thursday morning amid the flowering dogwoods and blooming azaleas at Augusta National Golf Club it will mark the 12th straight year the Americans in the field will be outnumbered by players from outside the country – with six of the last 10 winners hailing from foreign soil. A global contingent including Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Jason Day and the defending champion, Sergio García, are the prime contenders to keep the Green Jacket off a homegrown player’s back for a third straight year, which would represent the lengthiest American drought at Augusta in nearly three decades, when Sandy Lyle (1988) and Ian Woosnam (1991) sandwiched Nick Faldo’s decade-bridging double. But there are no shortage of American contenders who appear to be peaking entering the Masters – and the roster goes far deeper than the resurgent Tiger Woods, whose three top-12 finishes this year were enough to make him the betting favourite. There is Dustin Johnson, who entered last year’s Masters as an overwhelming favourite on ranking (No1 in the world) and form (three straight wins) before he was forced to withdraw on the eve of the tournament after doing his back in a slip down the stairs of his rental home near the club. He is still the world No1 even as the wins have come with less frequency and an improving record in his two most recent starts at Augusta (tied 4th in 2016 and 6th in 2015) demonstrate an improved grasp of the course’s unique challenges, though he never seriously contended on the Sunday in either of them. Then there is Jordan Spieth, the 24-year-old wunderkind who won the first of his three majors with an epochal performance at Augusta three years ago, tying Woods’ 72-hole record while becoming the only player ever to reach 19 under par at any point of a Masters. He enters in patchy form, coming off a missed cut at the Valspar Championship with no recent wins since last year’s Open at Royal Birkdale and a short game in open rebellion, leaving the tour’s chattering class to posit whether the first extended slump of the recently-engaged star’s career might be attributed to wedding planning. (The horror!) That said, the course at Augusta is tailor-made for Spieth’s strengths and the proof is in the form sheet: finishes of second, first, second and 11th in four career attempts. Justin Thomas, no longer best known as Spieth’s sidekick and closest friend on the tour, has been the world’s hottest player throughout a sharp ascent to world No2 that has included six titles in the last 15 months, none bigger than his first major win at last year’s US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow. He is poised to usurp Johnson on top of the world rankings, but what could be better than the melodramatic touch of doing it with a first-time win at Augusta? Bubba Watson and Phil Mickelson are a pair of in-form contenders with multiple Green Jackets who might not rate among the first tier of favourites but whom no one would be surprised to see among Sunday’s final pairings. Watson, the two-time Masters champion, is the type of left-handed big hitter that Augusta would appear to favour. After a lacklustre 2017 campaign in which he failed to register a top-10 finish while his ranking dropped to No117 in the world Watson’s odds to win the Masters have shortened dramatically since his victories at Riviera and last week’s World Match Play. As for Mickelson, the three-time champion at Augusta could, at 47, unseat Jack Nicklaus as the oldest champion. It is an outcome that might strain credulity after a season where he failed to break 70 in a round at any of the four majors but the 47-year-old has shown a flicker of his peak form. Ryder Cup enthusiasts will no doubt have an eye on Patrick Reed, the matchplay savant who had never come in better than 12th in 15 previous major starts before a runner-up finish at Quail Hollow last year. The 27-year-old has struggled in four previous starts at Augusta and gone 20 months without a tour win but three straight top-10 finishes make him a dangerous floater. And there is Rickie Fowler, the prodigious talent who would no doubt like to break his major championship duck before his 30th birthday later this year. He has finished in the top five at five majors since 2011, including all four during the 2014 campaign, and twice entered the final round at the Masters within touching distance of the lead only to fall flat on Sunday. Seven years after taking heat for wearing his hat backwards during a press conference in his Augusta debut could now finally be the time for the self-taught southern Californian? America’s most tradition-steeped tournament is richer with a fit Tiger in the hunt and the four-time Augusta champion’s flashes of world-beating form have been more than enough to stoke interest among casual observers as the tournament draws near. But Woods is simply one of many reasons this year’s star-laden field – the smallest in 21 years with no more than 87 players expected to play – augurs a Masters to remember."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/03/its-been-my-compass-helping-the-homeless-failed-by-the-government","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T16:13:25Z","webTitle":"'It's been my compass': helping the homeless failed by the government | Rachel Obordo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/its-been-my-compass-helping-the-homeless-failed-by-the-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/03/its-been-my-compass-helping-the-homeless-failed-by-the-government","fields":{"headline":"'It's been my compass': helping the homeless failed by the government","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"From Tuesday rough sleepers and people at risk of homelessness in England will have a legal right to help from their local council. The Homelessness Reduction Act has been described as the “most significant legislation” to tackle the issue for 40 years. It is hoped it will mean more early intervention and a reduction in rough sleeping, where numbers have risen 169% in England since 2010. It’s good news for those who would otherwise be refused help by their local authorities but for some it’s too little, too late from the government. Where official bodies have failed to help, communities have been supporting those who have experienced all forms of homelessness. Just off Silicon Roundabout in east London, named so because of the large number of tech businesses near Old Street, I meet members of Beam, a crowdfunding platform which allows those who have been homeless to seek donations towards the training and qualifications they need to work. Tarquin, who now works while training to be a gas safety engineer, raised just under £4,000. His parents were drug users and he started at 14. He points outside and says: “I grew up down the road with Tony (another member of the group) and heard how Beam helped him out. His story inspired me.” Tarquin was in hostels and on the streets for more than half his life but has been drugs and alcohol free for nearly four years. “We get these cards from anonymous donors with words of encouragement like: ‘My husband was a gas engineer, we live a good life and we want to help out.’ It builds your esteem up,” he says. Founded by Alex Stephany in September 2017, Beam has funded 20 campaigns and raised over £43,000 for a range of industry-recognised qualifications. Defined as a social impact business, Stephany not only wanted to address the homelessness crisis but also “use technology to solve big real world problems”. “In short, a social impact business makes money by doing good - and in a way that can be measured,” he says. Working with charities, Beam helps individuals who have been referred by preparing a fundraising campaign, breaking down the costs and helping them crowdfund online. Supporters are kept up to date with a member’s progress and often, when in stable employment, members choose to pay back the money raised and help fund other members’ campaigns. One member, Jordan, tells me he wants to become an electrician. After leaving the armed forces he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. “Structure is important for me,” he says. “Without Beam I would be stressing about how my addiction would take hold of me again.” Hana, a refugee from East Africa, has recently trained as a beautician. She says it was difficult when she was homeless. “Beam has been my compass.” Tony was one of the first people to benefit from the scheme and is dubbed its “poster boy” by Tarquin. Over the last 10 years he has sofa surfed, lived in hostels and slept in cars. “I was a bit apprehensive and thought it might not work but it’s more positive change than I was expecting. There used to be no light at the end for me, but the Beam’s shining bright now.” In Cambridge, those who are homeless – and not averse to cycling – can return to work with the help of Overstream Clean. It was developed in 2014 by Rachel Newell, 40, social enterprise manager for the charity Wintercomfort. People receive training then are given work in cleaning and gardening. “One of the problems for those living on the streets is that most people don’t have the documentation needed to work,” says Newell. “We help pay for birth certificates but for a bank account you need an address. It can sometimes be tricky to break the cycle.” Overstream Clean, which only employs homeless people, uses bikes to get around the city. At the moment, 10 people work in cleaning with one person offering gardening services. An average of 20 to 30 people get involved annually with 60% of those who move into work afterwards remaining in employment. “We don’t market ourselves as a social enterprise but as a professional cleaning company and it’s great to see people feeling an affinity with what we do,” says Newell. She says the scheme has attracted a lot of interest and they’re hoping to grow and scale up operations. “There are a lot of people who want to work. Our gardener used to live under a bridge when he started volunteering with us. Now he works full time and has bought a motorcycle which he takes on holiday. People are just trying to make a go of things and we want to help where we can.” Salisbury made headlines in March with the nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. A month on and there are signs of recovery but Austin Cohen says businesses are still being affected. “It’s a small city,” he says, “and everyone knows each other, and after the recent news we wanted to do something positive.” In 2017, the rate of those sleeping rough in Wiltshire was 72% higher than the previous year, with 2015 seeing the worst crisis in the last eight years with a 156% change compared to the year before. Cohen, 33, left his job as an accountant manager to set up a charity working with the homeless, vulnerable and elderly. “I lost my parents when I was nine and I received a lot of kindness from people because of it,” he says. “I’ve been brought up in a way where it’s natural to give back and help others.” With freezing temperatures brought by the “beast from the east” in February, Cohen wanted to help those who were street homeless. In March he came up with the idea of offering hot drinks in mugs but with free refills at local cafes and churches. “We found that a lot of homeless people weren’t really welcome in establishments,” says Cohen. “We wanted to change that … It’s not just about offering a warm cup of tea or coffee but feeling like a part of society.” The mugs have been donated by Mole Country Stores and several commercial and church cafes offer free refills seven days a week. So far 23 mugs have been handed out and Cohen hopes to launch similar schemes in Southampton, Birmingham and Bristol. “We managed to deliver this project by just getting people to work together and I don’t think it will need any funding. It started off as a community project and I hope it stays that way. “I once gave a mug to a girl at church and she was so thankful. She said: ‘Sometimes all I want is just someone to look at me, acknowledge me and see me.’ That stayed with me. It’s not much to say hello to a homeless person. Sometimes people just want someone to talk to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/02/hugo-lloris-tottenham-verge-something-big","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T21:42:00Z","webTitle":"Tottenham are on the verge of something big, says Hugo Lloris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/02/hugo-lloris-tottenham-verge-something-big","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/02/hugo-lloris-tottenham-verge-something-big","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham are on the verge of something big, says Hugo Lloris","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hugo Lloris believes “something big is waiting” for Tottenham Hotspur as the club seek to guarantee Champions League football at the redeveloped White Hart Lane when they return home next season. Spurs’ first win at Chelsea since 1990 on Sunday moved Mauricio Pochettino’s side eight points clear of their fifth-placed opponents with seven games to play – they are four points off second – with Tottenham, unbeaten domestically since mid-December, having won 10 of their past 13 top-flight matches. If doubts had surfaced outside the club as to whether Tottenham could thrive while playing home games at Wembley, they were not shared by those within the set-up. “We were always quite honest with ourselves and we knew we have a lot of quality like the other top teams in the league,” Lloris said. “This is the most competitive league in the world and there are a lot of great teams but we’ve reduced the gap to them. “Now we are ready to compete against them and we must maintain that, because Tottenham have to stay at this level at least. Obviously, with the new stadium, something big is waiting for us and we cannot see this future without the Champions League. So winning at Chelsea was a good answer, a collective answer, and we will keep working hard with the manager we have got. He will be behind us.” The victory on Sunday was achieved courtesy of two goals from Dele Alli, with the midfielder reminding the world of his qualities after a difficult 10 days with England. His involvement had been limited to a 22-minute cameo in the Netherlands, with Jesse Lingard and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain having staked claims to be first choice. “The best answer he could give was on the field on Sunday,” Lloris said. “He is still young but has a big personality. To react in that way is fantastic. It is not easy for him, or for people like Paul Pogba with France, because you need to give time to them to get to the right age, to mature. There is a lot of expectation but he stays calm and good in his mind. He came back to training from the national team with a big willingness to show his quality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/02/general-principle-gordon-elliot-irish-grand-national","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T19:26:29Z","webTitle":"General Principle gives Gordon Elliott his first Irish Grand National victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/02/general-principle-gordon-elliot-irish-grand-national","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/02/general-principle-gordon-elliot-irish-grand-national","fields":{"headline":"General Principle gives Gordon Elliott his first Irish Grand National victory","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gordon Elliott finally won an Irish Grand National on Monday in circumstances that could hardly have been more dramatic, his General Principle getting up to beat Isleofhopendreams, trained by Elliott’s title rival, Willie Mullins, by just a head. Those precious inches meant a prize money swing between the two men of €175,000 (£153,000) and give Elliott an excellent chance of becoming champion Irish trainer for the first time, ending a run of 10 consecutive titles for Mullins. Approaching the climax of a race in which five horses fell and four others were brought down, it seemed that Mullins was about to land the race for the first time with Bellshill, who travelled like the best horse most of the way. But his stamina drained into the saturated Fairyhouse turf as he approached the last, where he all but refused, turning left to run down the take-off side before clambering over. In doing so he ended the chance of Arkwrisht, who had given Rachael Blackmore a fine ride but could only plod home for sixth after being knocked sideways. Arkwrisht in turn barged into the Elliott-trained Folsom Blue, who nonetheless finished strongly to be beaten less than two lengths in fifth. The latter was then promoted one place at the expense of Bellshill, punished by the stewards for his waywardness. Folsom Blue is owned by Gary O’Brien, who was presenting live coverage on At The Races and gamely found the words to describe what had happened while swallowing his own disappointment. “I hardly know where to start,” was his opening line. Ruefully, he added: “You wouldn’t believe that, after three miles five furlongs on that sort of ground, it would only be a length and a half separating the first five home.” “It’s unbelievable,” said Elliott, who made an effort at consoling O’Brien during his winner’s interview. “I was watching your horse the whole way. I thought he was very unlucky. He was coming with a run; he got stopped a couple of times.” For almost the whole length of the straight Elliott believed Folsom Blue was his best chance of victory and he freely admitted to having thought very little of General Principle’s chance. “He was fifth last year, very disappointing all year, I couldn’t get a tune out of him at all. He wasn’t one of our leading fancies.” Indeed, Elliott recalled a recent, doleful conversation with Eddie O’Leary, who manages the racing interests of his brother, Michael, owner of General Principle. “There’s no point running him, he won’t stay,” was apparently the O’Leary view, which was fully justified by the horse’s form but proved less than prescient. “To be honest, I wanted to run everything I had,” said Elliott, whose 13 runners in this race was unprecedented for any stable in any major horse race, anywhere in the world. Mullins, meanwhile, is still waiting for his first Irish National win, having fielded 34 runners over the years. His best chance this time may have ended at the fifth fence, where Pairofbrowneyes fell and took out four of those who had been tracking him. Bellshill still holds an entry in the Grand National itself a week on Saturday but it is hard to believe Mullins will want to send him there 12 days after he finished so tired.

In a quaking voice, she whispers, “Doctor, the children are asking me not to translate the word ‘cancer’ every time you say it.” Her expression leads me to wryly conclude her newcomer status. After all, doesn’t every clinic encounter that problem? The well-groomed, elderly patient is seated in a wheelchair. Her forearm is plastered, a result of her latest fall when she tried to get the bathroom in a hurry. Her rehabilitation has been hampered by a diagnosis of cognitive impairment, leading her doctors to back off. Then, she complains of abdominal pain and is unexpectedly diagnosed with widespread cancer. The son distracts his mother while the daughter engages me. “Please tell mum she has an ulcer.” In my early years as an oncologist, my face would have revealed my incredulity, but after many of these requests I am more inscrutable. “She doesn’t have an ulcer”, I say gently. The dread in her eyes makes me feel like the threat that I must represent to her family’s peace. Defeated, she switches places with her brother. “In our culture, this is how it is”, he explains. “She has dementia, so what’s the point of burdening her even more?” I hate my invidious position. “If she has severe dementia, she won’t understand me”, I reason with him. “I don’t want to upset you, but my duty is to your mother.” The interpreter wheels her towards me and her children close in, as if poised to catch the grenade I am about to lob. “How are you?” “Quite well”, the patient says via the interpreter. “The arm hurts a bit but that’s to be expected.” Her dementia can’t be too bad, I think. “My insides hurt sometimes”, she continues. “Would you like to know why?” I keep my eye and my focus on my patient although I can sense the children’s discomfort. She nods hopefully, or at least I think so. “You might remember you had some scans. Unfortunately, they found cancer.” ‘So, it is cancer? But they said the scans were normal.” “Mother, you must not worry”, her son exhorts. “In our culture, we make peace with such things.” Without batting an eyelid, she says, “Of course we do, son.” Where I was expecting recriminations, this changes the tenor of the consultation. The tense knot in my stomach relaxes. In the 1960s, 90% of oncologists admitted they would not disclose a terminal cancer diagnosis to a patient. Twenty years later, 90% said they would. Today, in the era of patient autonomy, full disclosure is painted as a moral absolute, but my experience has shown me a more nuanced reality. In many cultures, it is a filial duty to make medical decisions on behalf of a parent. Doctors might bypass a patient and speak first to adult children and patients willingly concede this onerous role to their children. Decisions about treatment are not solely about the individual but also the family unit. Sometimes I ask patients what’s important to them and they mean it when they say, “Whatever my family wants.” Then, just as I think I know a thing or two about cultural norms, I overstep the mark with someone else. For doctors steeped in the teachings of western medicine, withholding a terminal diagnosis seems anathema but as the requests keep coming, I have learnt that my response needs to be as nuanced as the problem. First, doctors should not generalise based on culture, language or their own past experience. Second, it’s fine for patients to bypass the brutal details of their illness even if the evidence shows that they are not as traumatised by disclosure as we fear. Finally, we will never know what patients want if we fail to ask. We should assume nothing but respect an individual’s decision to know only so much. Navigating this fine line comprises the art of medicine. “Mother, can we ask a few things?” The patient waits outside while brother and sister pepper me with questions they have been too afraid to ask. We discuss the trajectory of her decline and what to look for. I watch as they shed their feelings of guilt and conflict and understand how their mother’s involvement will help them all plan ahead. Their vulnerability is replaced by a sense of empowerment and in leaving, they thank me for treating their mother with “unexpected kindness.” This coinage makes me a little wistful but remembering the family members who have thought otherwise, I am mostly relieved. Later, there is a knock on the door. “I want to thank you for saving me.” I am about to dismiss the interpreter’s effusive praise when she continues, “We belong to the same community, we pray together. I felt caught between loyalties although I always knew my job was to be your interpreter.” Her words remind me that the burden of non-disclosure isn’t carried by the doctor alone and we spend some time debriefing. Disclosing a terminal diagnosis to the seemingly unwilling or unprepared may well be amongst the most difficult tasks doctors are called upon to do. It’s a hollow feeling to disappoint relatives but it feels even worse to hide the truth from the patient. Often, there is one chance to get it right, and it ought to be the highest duty of medicine to sensitively encourage a conversation that holds so many consequences. But part of being a good doctor is accepting that a good patient doesn’t have to think like you. As my patient deteriorates, her family is able to congregate openly, grieve together and find consolation together. The consultation comes full circle when the children reflect that the experience changed their view about disclosure but concede that in future, they might still find themselves at the same starting point. That’s okay, I say, thinking of Oscar Wilde’s wise words, “The truth is rarely pure and never simple.” • Ranjana Srivastava is a Guardian Australia columnist and oncologist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/06/constable-who-copped-the-agony-of-endometriosis-claims-she-then-had-to-battle-bullying-bosses","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Constable who endured agony of endometriosis claims she then had to battle 'bullying' bosses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/06/constable-who-copped-the-agony-of-endometriosis-claims-she-then-had-to-battle-bullying-bosses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/06/constable-who-copped-the-agony-of-endometriosis-claims-she-then-had-to-battle-bullying-bosses","fields":{"headline":"Constable who endured agony of endometriosis claims she then had to battle 'bullying' bosses","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When police constable Sarah Berry tried to tell her superior officer she needed surgery and extra sick leave for her debilitating medical condition, she was told to increase her pain threshold, drag herself to work and throw up in the toilet all day if needed. Her boss, a senior sergeant, said he “didn’t understand” her disease and that’s what she’d have to do to prove she wanted to be part of South Australia’s police force. Berry was also told to undergo a psychological evaluation for her physical condition. Twice. “He said because it was a ‘female medical problem’ I had to see the psych,” she said. “I laughed and then cried.” Berry endures severe dysmenorrhea – period pain – and endometriosis, a gynaecological condition which affects one in 10 people with a uterus and can cause excruciating pain and, in some cases, infertility. Her case against her former employer, which went to the federal court, produced a six-page list of agreed facts and appears likely to set a significant precedent for people with endometriosis in the workplace. “I thought it would just get better because it made no logical sense the way they were treating me,” Berry says. “It didn’t improve, regardless of how much I explained or tried to work with them, so I had to do something to fix it.” “It wasn’t just for personal reasons. It was to benefit other women who may be in a similar situation.” Berry says she kept her superiors informed of everything from the day she applied for her job, with medical documentation, but she was still harassed and discriminated against by senior officers – including one in her first position and a second after she was transferred. Her condition is particularly acute and has been since her teens, but she wasn’t diagnosed until 2012, three years into her job as a constable working in the family violence and child abuse sphere. “Prior to 2012 or 2013 I didn’t take any sick leave beyond the allocated amount per year,” Berry tells Guardian Australia. At that time her condition worsened and she was admitted to hospital several times, including for surgeries, and required both paid and unpaid sick leave. Berry says her sergeant at the time of her diagnosis in 2012 was “very understanding” and she was comfortable discussing her situation with him, but an acting senior sergeant became involved and wanted multiple meetings and repeated explanations and directed her to the police psychologist. “They drove me into to town, walked me into the HQ building while I cried the whole time, saying, ‘I don’t need to be here,’” she recalls. The psychologist found nothing wrong with her. Berry requested a transfer but her new boss “ended up being even worse”, making her attend one-on-one meetings once or twice a fortnight to go over her medical issues again and again, an ordeal which she says affected her more than her work with traumatised families. “I loved [my work] every second of it,” Berry says. “But I could not handle the constant questions and pressure and harassment and bullying from him surrounding my medical condition. It got to the point where I would shake or cry – and I’m not a crier – and I couldn’t stop. “I would walk out of meetings with him and would go to the bathroom hyperventilating.” Court documents confirmed the questioning continued even when she was “sobbing uncontrollably and obviously in extreme distress”. In one meeting he made her do a role play of managing herself and her disability. He told her she was a burden, that she “frustrated the fuck out of him”. “He told me: ‘You need to increase your pain threshold, and if you need to drag yourself to work and throw up in the toilets all day then that’s what you do to prove to SAPol that you want to be part of this organisation.’ “I don’t think it comes from a bad place. He’s old school and was of the opinion that you just go to work regardless of any medical condition.” Berry sought advice from the Police Association and, in March 2014, took stress leave. “I was pretty much a shell of my normal self and every day thought I needed to get out of here, but I have done so much to get where I am and I love my job and I shouldn’t have to quit,” she says. Six months later Berry and her representatives filed a claim with the Human Rights Commission. When a mediation process failed, the case was referred to the federal court. The judge ruled that endometriosis and severe dysmenorrhea fell within the definition of disability in the Disability Discrimination Act. In September SAPol agreed to settle for an undisclosed sum and issue a written apology. “The management of your medical condition in relation to your employment was below the standards that are expected by SAPol,” the letter said. “Specifically, I apologise for the fact that: your supervisors questioned the legitimacy of your condition; and you were referred to a police psychologist when you were suffering from a physical condition. “As a direct result of the unacceptable treatment you endured, I will do all I can to ensure that no SAPol member is subjected to similar behaviour.” Most importantly, SAPol agreed to change police general orders governing the management of staff with disabilities, to ensure none are treated as a burden and all conversations are respectful. In June last year just 0.7% of SAPol’s workforce had a disability. In its 2017-20 disability access and inclusion plan the organisation has committed to reviewing and amending policies surrounding self-identification, support and opportunities for employees with disabilities. Lesley Freedman, a cofounder of the non-profit awareness group EndoActive, says there is still a lot of ignorance in the workplace about the impact of endometriosis. “We are often contacted by women who are being given a hard time at work through not being believed,” she says. “One recently told EndoActive that her HR manager refused to let her take annual or sick leave for a laparoscopy because she considered that it was elective surgery. “The stress would have been so difficult for [Berry] to cope with and would probably have impacted negatively on her endo. Thankfully her union supported her and together they have won a battle for all women who struggle at work with endometriosis.” Berry is on maternity leave from her current job in victim management. She cannot discuss the monetary settlement but says she ensured there would be no non-disclosure agreement. “It’s not about getting vengeance,” she says. “Morally it’s not right. I was always going to do this.” SAPol was contacted with a number of questions, including about any cultural changes, but responded that it did not discuss the outcomes of specific civil court matters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/03/celebrated-by-the-tabloids-the-welfare-bill-punishes-those-already-doing-it-tough","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T03:29:44Z","webTitle":"Celebrated by the tabloids, the welfare bill punishes those already doing it tough | Emma Dawson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/celebrated-by-the-tabloids-the-welfare-bill-punishes-those-already-doing-it-tough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/celebrated-by-the-tabloids-the-welfare-bill-punishes-those-already-doing-it-tough","fields":{"headline":"Celebrated by the tabloids, the welfare bill punishes those already doing it tough","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So much for “Christian values”. On Easter Sunday, the Daily Telegraph assaulted readers with a remarkably vicious attack on some of Australia’s most disadvantaged citizens. “Centrelink welfare cheats to lose payments if they fail to look for work under new laws”, screamed the headline of a report that used every pejorative term in the conservative book to describe people living on Newstart while they look for work. “Lazy jobseekers” and “disobedient dole bludgers” could lose their “taxpayer-funded handouts”, we were told, in “new laws [that] pass Parliament last week”. It was an extraordinary punch-down on people who are barely surviving on the stingy safety net we provide them when they fall on hard times. It’s becoming the worst kind of holiday habit. Three months ago, in that sleepy week between Christmas and New Year, Australians woke up to headlines telling them that the average Australian worker was paying $83 a week to “pay the nation’s growing welfare bills”. The Daily Telegraph then lamented that “average taxpayers are handing over $35 every week to prop up aged pensioners”, as though those being “propped up” on the inadequate pension hadn’t made any contribution to their own welfare throughout their working lives. The tabloids, of course, are dutifully delivering a narrative dictated by government media releases and cherry-picked data. Despite the fact that Australia’s tax and transfer system is the most tightly targeted in the OECD, it seems the government is intent on demonising our most disadvantaged citizens as a terrible burden on the rest of society. But this narrative is wrong. As demonstrated by recent research undertaken by Per Capita for Anglicare, the cost to our nation of subsidising the lifestyles of the wealthiest 20% of Australians far exceeds that spent on providing support for any single welfare group. In a week when the government was desperately scrambling to ram through its gift of billions of dollars in tax cuts to large corporations, treasurer Scott Morrison in question time and rightwing cheerleaders in the media attempted to distract from the facts of the report by claiming we had called for an end to the capital gains tax concession on the family home. Of course, we did no such thing. The benefit afforded by the CGT concession disproportionately goes to the owners of expensive homes, which is why it was included in calculating the total largesse that goes to the wealthy in foregone tax revenue. But the report itself simply demonstrates that, in looking for budget savings to repay debt and fund essential services, the government has options other than cracking down harder on people already living in poverty – as it did the day after the release of our report, with the passage of the so-called “welfare reform bill”. As celebrated in the tabloids, this particularly nasty piece of legislation makes it harder than ever for unemployed Australians – of whom, on latest figures, there are 10 for every three available jobs – to get the measly $273 a week they are expected to live on while they look for work. The bill, which has been defended by human services minister Alan Tudge as “simplifying” our unemployment benefits system, actually implements a number of incredibly mean measures designed to punish jobseekers, apparently in the belief that this will “motivate” them to find jobs that simply aren’t available in a country with more than 1.8million people looking for more work. Those measures include no longer backdating Newstart payments to the date the applicant first made a claim, and preventing job seekers using drug or alcohol dependency as an excuse for failing to meet “mutual obligation” requirements. It will impose even more draconian punishments on people who miss job interviews or appointments with Centrelink, regardless of the fact that many may be suffering from mental illness, or fleeing domestic violence, or homeless, or simply caring for their kids. The legislation, which after significant amendment in the Senate won’t deliver many savings to the budget at all, will, according to Acoss, cut more than 80,000 people off payments in 12 months, making life even more miserable for people already living below the poverty line in one of the wealthiest nations on earth. Yet in the excitement over the government’s determination to pass a tax cut for big business, the media paid it scant attention – until Sunday’s extraordinary attack. It’s heartening, then, to find that new independent South Australian Senator, Tim Storer, has nominated raising the rate of Newstart as a “priority” of his three year term. As the government seeks to prosecute its agenda to subsidise wealthy Australians through forgone tax revenue by pressuring Storer and Derryn Hinch to support their unaffordable largesse towards big business, they’ll have to keep grappling with the facts – facts like those we published last week. Our research for Anglicare used exactly the same methodology, drawn from a question on notice during budget estimates from Senator Eric Abetz to treasury officials last year, as the government used to determine that Newstart recipients cost the “average taxpayer” just $6 per week to support. And we found that the same taxpayer is contributing $37 a week to make up for the shortfall in government revenue due to tax concessions for people living high on the hog. Yet, according to Tudge, it’s “non-genuine job seekers” the rest of us should resent. “People don’t want to see their taxpayer dollars funding the lifestyles of people who refuse to look for work and do the right thing”, he thundered in defence of his nasty laws. But Tudge and his cronies have read the Australian people wrong. If the government wants to understand why it can’t pass its big business tax cuts, maybe they should ask those “average taxpayers” whether they’d rather give a bit more than the current six bucks a week to someone living below the poverty line while they look for work, or keep handing over $37 to someone negatively gearing an investment property and using a family trust to reduce their taxable income. I reckon I know the answer, and I think Tim Storer does too. • Emma Dawson is Executive Director of thinktank Per Capita"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/03/monash-forum-coalition-backbenchers-lobby-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T06:22:27Z","webTitle":"Coalition backbenchers unite to lobby for coal under banner of Monash Forum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/03/monash-forum-coalition-backbenchers-lobby-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/03/monash-forum-coalition-backbenchers-lobby-coal","fields":{"headline":"Coalition backbenchers unite to lobby for coal under banner of Monash Forum","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Twenty Coalition backbench MPs have joined a group warning against the “demonisation” of coal, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly has revealed. Kelly – the chairman of the government’s backbench committee on the environment and energy – confirmed the existence of the Monash Forum, which supports the use of coal-fired power. Kelly told Guardian Australia the group’s manifesto was not inconsistent with the Turnbull government’s National Energy Guarantee, which he said was a “good policy”. But the group’s position will add to pressure for government support for a new coal-fired power station. He confirmed the list of the group’s members published in the Australian includes Tony Abbott, Eric Abetz and Kevin Andrews. The former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce was reportedly “linked to” the group. But the Liberal MP Ian Goodenough said he had been part of a social gathering of conservative MPs that discussed policy for “some years” that had recently adopted the name the Monash Forum. The comments suggest the core of the group is the longstanding “Monkey Pod” conservative grouping in the Liberal Party combined with a group of Nationals MPs. George Christensen reportedly invited Nationals MPs to join a group “encouraging the government in the promotion of and facilitation of and/or construction of coal-fired power stations”. The Nationals senator John Williams said he supported coal-fired generation and he had replied to a text message to join but had not seen any pledge or manifesto. The group is named after the first world war general John Monash, owing to his role in opening up Victoria’s Latrobe Valley for coal production. “It’s not like it’s a secret society,” Kelly said. “One of the aims of the group is to emphasise the importance of coal-fired generation. “Coal is demonised by a large section of the community – that demonisation is incorrect, because coal is absolutely vital to the national economy both for export and the generation of cheap, reliable electricity.” Kelly said if AGL’s Liddell power station were closed, the “optimum outcome for the grid” would be to construct a new coal-fired power station. He said private-sector investment in coal might not be forthcoming due to possible technological change and changes to climate policy by a future government so “the government may need to step in and assist the build” of a new power station. On Tuesday Sky News reported that the Monash Forum manifesto included a petition that posed the question: “If the government can intervene to build Snowy 2.0, why not intervene to build Hazelwood 2.0 on the site of the coal-fired power station in Victoria that’s now being dismantled?” It suggests a new low emissions coal-fired power station could be built for “no more than $4 billion”. But Kelly claimed the manifesto stopped short of calling for a specific form of government support for coal, and the question posed was “an analogy” not an ask. Goodenough disavowed the idea of a subsidy, telling Guardian Australia: “I would generally not advocate for government subsidies for any form of power generation, preferring the technology to be financially sustainable on its own merits.” Asked why the government should support coal if the private sector refused and renewables continued to become cheaper, Kelly said: “No matter how much solar and wind you have, you’re going to need some baseload power.” AGL plans to replace its ageing Liddell power station with renewables, batteries, gas power, upgraded coal power and demand response, and has resisted government calls to sell the power station to prevent its closure. Williams said if AGL refused to sell to a private buyer, the government should compulsorily acquire it to on-sell or “as a last resort” run the plant itself. The Turnbull government’s energy guarantee is still being designed by the Energy Security Board and requires sign-off by the states before proposed reliability and emissions reduction requirements are imposed. At a press conference on Tuesday Malcolm Turnbull said the National Energy Guarantee provides “every incentive for the energy sector to invest in dispatchable power”. He said the Neg “puts a premium on dispatchability” which can be provided by coal, gas and hydro-electric power. Earlier, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the Monash group and the government wanted “exactly the same thing”. “[The Neg] will deliver more affordable and reliable energy without subsidies, taxes or trading schemes, levelling the playing field for all types of generation,” he said in a statement. “Independent modelling undertaken by the ESB suggests coal will continue to remain part of the energy mix making up more than half of supply in 2030.” Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said the Monash Group “exemplifies how chaotic energy policy has become [under] the Liberals”. “The energy industry has been clear they have no appetite for building new coal-fired power stations,” he said. “New coal is more expensive and more polluting than alternatives, yet the hard right want to waste taxpayers’ money on their coal fantasies demanding Malcolm Turnbull to guarantee new investment in coal-fired power.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/03/football-transfer-rumours-iker-casillas-to-leave-porto-for-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T07:23:10Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Iker Casillas to leave Porto for Liverpool?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/03/football-transfer-rumours-iker-casillas-to-leave-porto-for-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/03/football-transfer-rumours-iker-casillas-to-leave-porto-for-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Iker Casillas to leave Porto for Liverpool?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"José Mourinho is ready for a summer splurge.

In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring. On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected. These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture. The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition. The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age. Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially. In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge spans the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree. While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend. “It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.” “There were all these shows, and you could never go to them,” says Riley Jones, the band’s drummer. “You could go to the [radio station] Triple Zed car park shows sometimes, and that was a nice treat, but it was very frustrating.” Beyond Brisbane Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future. “There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music. “If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.” It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises. The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.” Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.” All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol. Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University. “There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.” The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment. Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.” Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?” The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.” In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year. From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story. “A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.” The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.” Valuable venture In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised. The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops. Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues; they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.” At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.” In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Although the meagre consolation of the Europa League awaits, next season would be the second in three spent outside Europe’s premier club competition. So what could be the ramifications? Finances will take a hit Failure to qualify for the Champions League will affect income, even with the sums generated through Premier League media rights. The club’s most recent financial figures, covering a 2016-17 campaign spent out of Europe altogether, serve as a gauge. They show revenues rose by £32m, yet that was less than half the increase recorded by Manchester United (£82m), Arsenal (£72m) and Manchester City (£66m), who were competing in the Champions League. Match-day incomes fell 6% to £66m and, although the Europa League awaits, those games will not attract the same glitz, glamour or gates. A club who made £193m between 2012 and 2017 from playing in Europe will inevitably suffer another downturn. More pertinently perhaps, so will the club’s reputation In October Chelsea’s commercial director, Chris Townsend, targeted doubling revenues to more than £650m over the next seven to 10 years “to be a top-four or -five club in Europe [by revenues], rather than ranked eighth”. The aim was to increase the number of sponsors from 12 to between 30 and 35 premium brands, plans considered highly ambitious in a market where clubs such as Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid boast a significant head start. It would, according to Townsend, “allow Chelsea to invest more in players”. Yet will prospective sponsors find Chelsea as attractive without the Champions League? At a time when Roman Abramovich is hoping to push through a £1bn redevelopment of Stamford Bridge, a scheme likely to require significant outside investment, the suspicion that Chelsea have regressed into a club who flit in and out of Europe’s elite competition would be damaging. Will the pursuit of a new head coach be affected? The chances of Antonio Conte remaining next season were remote even if the team achieved a top‑four finish, given his relationship with the hierarchy has long since fractured beyond repair. The Italian was plucked from his national association by a club apparently on their knees but the worry remains that the recruitment of an elite successor may be hampered without Champions League football. Certainly any faint hopes of luring Mauricio Pochettino across the capital would have to be abandoned. Luis Enrique might not be overly concerned at life outside the European elite in the short term but his contract at the Camp Nou in his previous position is understood to have been worth far more than Conte’s £9.5m a season. Thomas Tuchel is apparently not under consideration, though other young coaches may come into the hierarchy’s thinking. A club who go through two-season managerial cycles may have to sell a long-term project to prospective candidates. There will be an impact on retaining key players and the current staff Chelsea retained their best players after the trauma of 2015-16 but, two years down the line, concerns centre on their Belgians. Thibaut Courtois enters the last 12 months of his contract in July and, although talks are scheduled to resume in the summer, a goalkeeper consistently linked with a return to Spain may not be quite as keen to re-sign if the immediate future comes without the perk of Champions League football. Eden Hazard’s deal does not expire until 2020, with Chelsea apparently willing to offer him the most lucrative terms in their history, but he seems intent on waiting to see if Real Madrid’s long-standing interest crystallises into a firm offer. Squad strengthening may be harder Chelsea thrived in the summer of 2016, prising N’Golo Kanté from Leicester, with David Luiz and Marcos Alonso also added, so they have strengthened without the Champions League factor in the recent past. Theirs is a relatively young setup and hardly in need of a radical overhaul, which is just as well because recruitment would be a challenge. They have spent relatively heavily in recent windows, for all Conte’s complaints, albeit with money recouped for players such as Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic. The problem has arguably been the reluctance to secure stellar arrivals – Conte was after established pedigree – and the size of the revamp instigated in each window, with so many ins and outs. The senior squad hardly feels significantly deeper than it did two years ago. This will be a shorter summer window, crammed largely into the post‑World Cup period, which will bring its own complications to be confronted at present without a technical director. Marina Granovskaia has held informal talks with prospective candidates to replace Michael Emenalo but the club do not appear certain quite what the role will entail. Whether that lack of clarity proves a hindrance remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/02/winnie-mandela-nelson-radical-south-africa-anc","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T18:17:24Z","webTitle":"Winnie Mandela helped Nelson become the radical that he was | Peter Hain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/winnie-mandela-nelson-radical-south-africa-anc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/winnie-mandela-nelson-radical-south-africa-anc","fields":{"headline":"Winnie Mandela helped Nelson become the radical that he was","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"During Nelson Mandela’s 1962 trial in Pretoria, before he was sent to Robben Island, Winnie turned up each day, often magnificent in traditional chiefdom dress. My anti-apartheid activist mother Adelaine was often alone, showing solidarity, in the whites-only section of the public gallery. Once, when my younger sisters went with her, dressed in their primary school uniforms, Winnie bent down and kissed them, to the very evident horror and disgust of the onlooking white policemen, who spat and cursed. The very notion of a black woman behaving that way towards two blonde girls offended every apartheid instinct. But Winnie didn’t care. She was indomitably defiant. Later, suffering so much and bringing up her own two girls while Nelson Mandela served his 27 years in prison, she was beaten up, banned, then banished to remote Brandfort in the Orange Free State, harassed and imprisoned too. Once, when relatives turned up unexpectedly in Brandfort, she was convicted of contravening her banning order. This, among many other things, restricted her to meeting only one person at a time. Fearless in the face of the apartheid police state, she became the increasingly iconic representative of Nelson Mandela. She also tutored him. Winnie was among the first to understand the significance when, in 1976, black children were gunned down while protesting against apartheid schooling in Soweto, outside Johannesburg. Soweto exploded, triggering fresh resistance and repression in other black townships throughout the country. Visiting Mandela on Robben Island, she urged him to identify with and support this new wave of unrest, even when it took the form of a wave of “black consciousness” that veterans in his African National Congress saw as offensive to their non-racialism. It was nothing of the kind. Mandela listened to Winnie, and embraced the young activists, who soon began joining him on the Island, rebellious and suspicious of his old guard. The two had fallen in love after Nelson, two decades older, had spotted the vivacious, charismatic young social worker waiting for a bus as he drove past. But as she later observed, she never had the conventional marriage she hoped for. She had married a freedom fighter, not a husband. Soon he was on trial, then released, then driven underground when they would occasionally meet illicitly; he hardly knew his two daughters when he was sent to prison. Security services made it as difficult as possible for her to visit, preventing her from travelling by train, forcing her to fly or drive the 800 miles. Mandela’s letters to her displayed a touching affection and deep admiration. Throughout, she was steadfast in his support. But she became increasingly wayward, taking younger lovers into her new Soweto home. In the 1980s she became embroiled in the murky murder of young activist Stompie Moeketsie, for which she was later tried and found guilty, the judge labelling her “a liar”. Nelson, after his release, spoke of being the “loneliest man” after their divorce. But he never shunned her. She had become a quasi-revolutionary to Mandela’s reformism in the transition from apartheid to non-racial democracy, presaging a debate live today, especially among younger elements in South Africa. Tragic, heroic and ultimately deeply flawed, Winnie can be correctly criticised for her rogue later life, but her courage and radical spirit in adversity should never be forgotten. • Peter Hain is a former Labour MP and minister for Africa.

But spare a thought for the more than 4,000 children who have learning disabilities. They won’t be taking a break from school: they’re stuck at home for the long-term, as no local schools can take them. The number of children with special educational needs in England without a school place has more than doubled from 1,710 in 2016 to 4,050 in 2017. The government argues the budget is protected, but councils point out that it doesn’t take into account inflation or increased need. Local authorities are allocated funds to spend on special needs in both mainstream and specialist schools: many have asked that they be allowed to transfer cash from the main budget to the specialist budget to increase the provision for children currently stuck at home without a place. Parents have told me of the battle to gain a diagnosis for their children, who are often written off by teachers as troublesome and disruptive, especially in the case of autism. Once they do secure a diagnosis and a statement of needs, they spend just as long attempting to have the provisions their statement requires put in place. Schools are overworked and underfunded, with teachers reporting that entrenched poverty is causing huge problems, and education budgets are failing to stretch to cover basics such as glue and paper. Is it any surprise children with more complex needs are forgotten, when even the bare bones of the curriculum are proving a struggle for overworked, underfunded teachers? And even those struggling teachers might not be around for long: four-fifths have considered quitting the profession in the past year alone, according to a survey by the National Education Union. Heavy workloads were cited as a major factor, with 40% of teachers working 21 hours or more at home and at weekends in addition to classroom time. Respondents said the strain had affected their marriages and friendships. Who would choose to enter a profession in crisis that offers so little reward for such high stress? The academisation of schools under New Labour helped the Conservatives bring free schools into being. They said the new model would allow enthused parents to open schools. Instead, most free schools and academies are run by large chains that can outsource their IT facilities, cleaning services and other non-teaching jobs. This slow process of privatisation is lauded as decentralisation, but gives local authorities even less control over education, with the disastrous results that we see. What can schools do when money is so tight? Some have resorted to renting out buildings, trying to provide extra services which they can charge for, or even hiring out buildings for weddings. The government will say this shows initiative, and “innovative thinking”. I say it is desperation from institutions that should be allowed to focus on their core mission of education, instead of constantly having to focus on balancing the books and counting pennies. For children with special educational needs to receive the help they need to thrive in education, councils need targeted funding that properly addresses the costs of including children in mainstream classrooms with support, or creating space in specialist schools. But they also need teachers who aren’t so stressed and overworked they can barely complete the standard paperwork that is currently required of them. Exceptional teaching requires more time and space for teachers to address the differing needs of a classroom, with assistance in staffing and funding. Most parents I know are frustrated by the way their schools are forced to work, yet accept that it isn’t the fault of teachers, who are in an impossible position. In the meantime, families muddle through, with children stuck at home, denied a basic right to a good education, and their parents either forced to take time off work to provide what the state cannot, or forced to impoverish themselves further by turning to tutors. And pity those children: written off, robbed of the social aspect of their schooling, convinced from an early age that the fact they need more assistance renders them too difficult to engage with. This should be a source of national shame. There have been many alarms sounded by teachers at their conference this week. They have talked of malnourished pupils, burgeoning workloads, declining capacity. All these things are born of an ideology that has pleased politicians but has robbed schools of the ability to truly fulfil their social responsibilities. Ask a teacher. They would like to have that back. • Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/02/teachers-vow-to-oppose-introduction-of-baseline-assessments","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T17:59:18Z","webTitle":"Teachers vow to oppose introduction of baseline assessments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/02/teachers-vow-to-oppose-introduction-of-baseline-assessments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/apr/02/teachers-vow-to-oppose-introduction-of-baseline-assessments","fields":{"headline":"Teachers vow to oppose introduction of baseline assessments","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Teachers have vowed to oppose the government’s plans to assess children in the first weeks of school, as the country’s largest teaching union called for a boycott of pilot schemes planned for next year. The baseline assessments, to be taken at the start of a child’s reception year in primary schools in England, were proposed by the government last year as a replacement for national tests in year 2, when children would be seven years old. But delegates at the National Education Union’s annual conference in Brighton voted against cooperating with the new tests, which are likely to be rolled out for the first time on a voluntary basis in schools from September 2019. The Department for Education argues that the assessments will simply measure the emerging abilities of children at the point they start formal education, and be used to measure their later progress. But NEU members heard that the assessments could distract children when they first arrive in school. Katharine Lindenberg, a teacher from Waltham Forest in London, said the baseline tests were unnecessary, expensive and even immoral. “Baseline tests will be given to four-year-olds in the first weeks of reception. They are unnecessary, they are pointless, they are expensive and above all they are damaging and they are immoral. “This is a time when children should be building their confidence, gaining trust with their teachers and support staff. Learning through play, establishing routines. They will become data, that is what baseline testing is all about,” Lindenberg said. The government first attempted to introduce baseline assessments for reception classes in 2015. But the move was undermined by the DfE’s insistence on using several private providers, and the tests collapsed after research showed the different assessments were incompatible. Alex Kenny, a member of the NEU’s executive, said: “We want to pile pressure on heads and governors to say that they won’t volunteer to take part in baseline in 2019. “But if that pressure doesn’t work, we will combine it with indicative ballots so that we can identify the schools and areas where we can use industrial action if heads say they will go ahead with the pilot.” Earlier, the conference delegates endorsed a motion in support of public libraries as a way of introducing children to books. Jennifer Bhambri-Lyte, a delegate from North Somerset, said some children were so unfamiliar with books that they thought they operated like tablets or smartphones. “In a world of food banks, as my colleagues have previously talked about, books are a luxury that many families just cannot afford,” she said. “Sharing a book brings parents together for precious moments, and I’ve taught both nursery and reception and I personally still find it disturbing to see a child pick up a book and try to swipe left.” Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said while there was a statutory requirement for prisons to have libraries, there was no such rule for schools – meaning that many relied on council-run libraries. “Given the closure of many public libraries, we are losing the tools to create confident, excited young readers,” Courtney said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/02/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T16:32:31Z","webTitle":"Impressive Warrington sparkle in the wet to brush aside Castleford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/02/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/02/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Impressive Warrington sparkle in the wet to brush aside Castleford","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With the 50th anniversary of the “Watersplash Final” only weeks away, perhaps it was fitting that two of Super League’s best sides put on an Easter Monday show in conditions not unlike those for that iconic Challenge Cup final of 1968. As on that day at Wembley – when Don Fox missed a simple conversion that would have taken the cup to Yorkshire withWakefield Trinity – this was not an afternoon for free-flowing rugby although for Warrington, who won their fourth match in succession with this victory at Castleford, that will matter little. This result – in abysmal conditions following heavy rain in West Yorkshire overnight – represents another important step for Warrington under their new coach, Steve Price. And how grateful the Wolves will be that the game passed a pitch inspection. “That was tough going considering the conditions,” Price said. “I’ve just spoken to Hilly [the captain, Chris Hill] and he’s never played in those conditions before. I was always keen to play the game and it’s credit to Cas for going above and beyond to get the game to go ahead. It was a tough battle and it’s good to get away with the two points.” By half-time Warrington led 10-0, an impressive advantage given they were attacking an end of the Mend‑A‑Hose Jungle which was in parts under water. Conditions made the prospect of tries remote but after Stefan Ratchford had kicked Warrington into a 4-0 lead some glorious handling enabled Toby King to score on the half-time hooter. Ratchford improved that try to open up a 10-point lead but Castleford, who were in pursuit of a sixth consecutive win, made matters interesting midway through the second half when a Luke Gale kick ricocheted into the path of Oliver Holmes and Gale reduced the gap to four with the conversion. The Tigers looked as though they had levelled the scores with 15 minutes remaining but Jake Webster’s try was ruled out by the referee, Robert Hicks, after he was adjudged to have kicked the ball from the grasp of a Warrington defender. Daryl Clark’s try in the final moments then secured victory for the visitors. Of the disallowed try Daryl Powell, the Castleford coach, said: “I thought we had some tough calls today. I’m not sure he had it fully in his hands, I need to see it back. But I’m not blaming anybody but ourselves and a good performance by Warrington.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-automation-put-human-needs-first","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T17:06:29Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on automation: put human needs first | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-automation-put-human-needs-first","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-automation-put-human-needs-first","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on automation: put human needs first","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Marc Andreessen, a programmer who made a fortune off one of the first web browsers and then a bigger one by investing the spoils, predicted some years ago that the world would soon be divided into those people who told computers what to do, and those who are told what to do by computers. It is a pithy demonstration of the half truths that drive Silicon Valley. The task for humanists must be to ensure that the other half of the truth is valued and acted on. Computers are of course turning the world upside down, and transforming many of the jobs that they don’t abolish. The process seems absolutely certain to continue: a recent OECD study suggesting that only one in six jobs in industrial countries will disappear as a result of automation has been hailed as a wonderfully optimistic counterblast to earlier predictions that nearly half the jobs in advanced economies would disappear. One job in six would – will – still involve a major social transformation. Unless regulatory action is taken, this will not be a transformation for the better. For one of the characteristics of this wave of automation is that many of the new jobs which appear are worse and less interesting than the ones they replace, in part because the humans doing them are fitted into the decision-making hierarchy below the people who write the algorithms that control them and the computers that interpret the programmers’ intentions. To that extent Mr Andreessen was right. But the new work has other disadvantages. It is much less secure and less well paid. Those factors are not determined by technology, but are the consequence of deliberate political decisions that technology serves to obfuscate. This is already obvious to young people, and drives a lot of the support both for Jeremy Corbyn and, separately, for populist nationalist politicians in Europe, who represent the threat to security as coming from immigrants more than automation. The OECD report reaches its relatively optimistic conclusions by analysing job descriptions more carefully than previous estimators did. The kinds of skills which the report sees as hard to replace are those involving social knowledge and interaction. This optimism may be to some extent unwarranted, for two reasons. The first is that computers are getting far better at analysing and classifying both sounds and imagery – the kinds of skills which are easily mistaken for understanding. Software which runs on pretty ordinary computers and can pick the cars and the pedestrians out of a video recording of Indian traffic (in which cars, lorries, people and so on are mixed apparently at random) is already freely available to anyone who wants to play. The second is that just as computers are being trained to accomplish more, we, the public, are being trained to accomplish – and to expect – less. Increasing amounts of customer service require us to interact directly with computers at the other end, whether by filling out forms or dealing with voice recognition systems. At the same time, those humans still employed for social interactions are increasingly scripted and regimented; so that in dealing with a modern bureaucracy it makes no difference whether there is a human or a robot on the other side of the transaction. No doubt real human servants will increase in value as status symbols for the rich, but this is hardly a future to anticipate with pleasure. A more human and equal future will require a great deal more than simply training and re-education, necessary though those will be. It will require the kinds of politics and economics in which no one may be thrown on the scrapheap as useless to society."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/03/facebook-abusing-data-law-privacy-big-tech-surveillance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T11:05:00Z","webTitle":"A radical proposal to keep your personal data safe | Richard Stallman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/facebook-abusing-data-law-privacy-big-tech-surveillance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/facebook-abusing-data-law-privacy-big-tech-surveillance","fields":{"headline":"A radical proposal to keep your personal data safe","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Journalists have been asking me whether the revulsion against the abuse of Facebook data could be a turning point for the campaign to recover privacy. That could happen, if the public makes its campaign broader and deeper. Broader, meaning extending to all surveillance systems, not just Facebook. Deeper, meaning to advance from regulating the use of data to regulating the accumulation of data. Because surveillance is so pervasive, restoring privacy is necessarily a big change, and requires powerful measures. The surveillance imposed on us today far exceeds that of the Soviet Union. For freedom and democracy’s sake, we need to eliminate most of it. There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected. Thus, instead of the EU’s approach of mainly regulating how personal data may be used (in its General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR), I propose a law to stop systems from collecting personal data. The robust way to do that, the way that can’t be set aside at the whim of a government, is to require systems to be built so as not to collect data about a person. The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data. Data about who travels where is particularly sensitive, because it is an ideal basis for repressing any chosen target. We can take the London trains and buses as a case for study. The Transport for London digital payment card system centrally records the trips any given Oyster or bank card has paid for. When a passenger feeds the card digitally, the system associates the card with the passenger’s identity. This adds up to complete surveillance. I expect the transport system can justify this practice under the GDPR’s rules. My proposal, by contrast, would require the system to stop tracking who goes where. The card’s basic function is to pay for transport. That can be done without centralising that data, so the transport system would have to stop doing so. When it accepts digital payments, it should do so through an anonymous payment system. Frills on the system, such as the feature of letting a passenger review the list of past journeys, are not part of the basic function, so they can’t justify incorporating any additional surveillance. These additional services could be offered separately to users who request them. Even better, users could use their own personal systems to privately track their own journeys. Black cabs demonstrate that a system for hiring cars with drivers does not need to identify passengers. Therefore such systems should not be allowed to identify passengers; they should be required to accept privacy-respecting cash from passengers without ever trying to identify them. However, convenient digital payment systems can also protect passengers’ anonymity and privacy. We have already developed one: GNU Taler. It is designed to be anonymous for the payer, but payees are always identified. We designed it that way so as not to facilitate tax dodging. All digital payment systems should be required to defend anonymity using this or a similar method. What about security? Such systems in areas where the public are admitted must be designed so they cannot track people. Video cameras should make a local recording that can be checked for the next few weeks if a crime occurs, but should not allow remote viewing without physical collection of the recording. Biometric systems should be designed so they only recognise people on a court-ordered list of suspects, to respect the privacy of the rest of us. An unjust state is more dangerous than terrorism, and too much security encourages an unjust state. The EU’s GDPR regulations are well-meaning, but do not go very far. It will not deliver much privacy, because its rules are too lax. They permit collecting any data if it is somehow useful to the system, and it is easy to come up with a way to make any particular data useful for something. The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for the collection of their data, but that doesn’t do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Noam Chomsky’s phrase). Most users consent to a site’s terms without reading them; a company that required users to trade their first-born child got consent from plenty of users. Then again, when a system is crucial for modern life, like buses and trains, users ignore the terms because refusal of consent is too painful to consider. To restore privacy, we must stop surveillance before it even asks for consent. Finally, don’t forget the software in your own computer. If it is the non-free software of Apple, Google or Microsoft, it spies on you regularly. That’s because it is controlled by a company that won’t hesitate to spy on you. Companies tend to lose their scruples when that is profitable. By contrast, free (libre) software is controlled by its users. That user community keeps the software honest. • Richard Stallman is president of the Free Software Foundation, which launched the development of a free/libre operating system GNU Copyright 2018 Richard Stallman.

They were protesting against a law aimed at restricting abortion rights further. The colour symbolised the anger and grief of women who suffer. This legislation, if fully implemented, will in effect force some women to give birth to terminally ill children. That same day, a smaller “white protest” was held. Its participants demanded a complete ban on abortions. These opposing protests were a stark illustration of the tensions brewing in my country. In the international media Poland’s de facto ruler, Jarosław Kaczyński – a nationalist conservative – has been compared with Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, or even Vladimir Putin. Stunned, I wonder if Kaczyński really has become like those figures. I’m part of a generation, now turning 40, that can be described as “children of the revolution”. I remember jumping with excitement as a child when the news broke that Lech Wałęsa, the hero of the 1980s anti-communist opposition, had become Poland’s first freely elected president in 1990. The year 1989 was one of dizzying change and immense hope. By contrast, 2015 – the year that Kaczyński’s Law and Justice party returned to power and set about dismantling checks and balances – was the most bitter. For older liberals who had struggled under communism for democracy to take hold, 2015 ranked as the victory of populist, revanchist and irrational forces. For my generation of liberals, it was a stumbling block. Earlier, we thought we’d be taking responsibility for the country, as ministers or officials. Instead, we found ourselves protesting in the streets, waving Polish and European flags. It may be tempting to think Poland’s adventure with democracy is coming to a close – or that, confronted by unbridgeable divisions, it is foundering. But I believe that what’s unfolding rather resembles a convulsion of the political system that was built in the 1990s. We are witnessing an unravelling of the post-communist myths we had long attached to the west – a phenomenon first articulated by the writer Jarosław Kuisz. After 1989, the nation’s transformation was based on an almost entirely uncritical attitude towards western Europe and the US. This was partly due to the fact that people were trying to extract themselves from poverty using western economic models. But those emerging from behind the iron curtain weren’t striving only for material gains. Western countries also represented a better world in a moral sense. Perceiving the west through rose-tinted spectacles had to come to an end eventually, it seems. As time passed, and with scandals erupting – such as the revelations about a secret CIA prison in Poland in the mid-2000s – and then the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, many started thinking that western morality could be as ambiguous as the “eastern” brand. A generation after its democratic breakthrough, Poland found itself in dire need of a new identity. Liberal elites were unable to fill that void. Populists skilfully exploited it. They built a narrative of hostility towards Brussels, western values, and even western lifestyles – all of this leading to the country’s current, deepening international isolation. Democratic transition in Poland was the accomplishment of a generation of dissidents. But the dividing lines that existed within the 1980s Solidarity movement, between “conservative nationalists” and “liberal conservatives”, are still playing out. The dispute has become ever more radical and personal – with each side demonising the other. Kaczyński and Wałęsa, who are roughly the same age, stand on opposite sides. The first famously burned a puppet of Wałęsa in 1993 during a street demonstration. The second calls Kaczyński a deceitful coward. In 1989 Polish liberals set out three goals for the country: democracy, a free-market economy, and integration into Nato and the European Union. A quarter of a century on, all this had been accomplished. But the generation who realised those objectives became complacent and failed to create a new sense of political direction. Today’s erosion of the rule of law is extremely worrying and can hardly be ignored. But a return to the pre-2015 period is neither possible nor desirable. Voters have simply become too critical of the flaws in the political setup that emerged from the 1990s. Law and Justice’s victory at the ballot box in 2015 was a result of widespread frustrations overlooked by many. We seem to be stumbling in the dark, but this phase will surely end. That’s because young people who were born into democracy have no real interest in the grievances of the old politics. Instead, they think of Poland as an umbrella under which everyone can belong, regardless of their political views. Ideological clashes, such as the protests around abortion, have made us realise that the most important task today is to build a common framework for the future. Discreetly, some hands are being stretched out to try to overcome differences. Within civil society groups and in many private conversations, people from the rival political camps have started talking to each other constructively. In those discussions I’ve seen how exhausted many citizens have become with polarisation. Many are worried that further divisions might even threaten the existence of a common republic. Away from cameras or political podiums, topics such as identity, sovereignty and rule of law are debated in an attempt to identify what can unite us, not what breaks us apart. Poland is not stuck in its current predicament, it is an evolving scene. It’s obvious that Law and Justice has trampled on the constitution, assaulted the independence of the judiciary, and put pressure on women in ways no other government has dared since 1989. But to draw the conclusion that Poland is inexorably sliding into a new brand of authoritarianism is wrong. It misses nuances and the behind-the-scenes efforts to seek solutions. EU institutions may well consider imposing sanctions on Poland, which would have a symbolic meaning – but the truth is, only civil society can change the country’s current course. We just need a bit more time. • Karolina Wigura is a historian and the political editor of the Polish weekly Kultural Liberalna"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/04/martin-sorrell-ceo-role-in-doubt-as-wpp-investigates-misconduct-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T07:20:02Z","webTitle":"Martin Sorrell's CEO role in doubt as WPP investigates misconduct claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/martin-sorrell-ceo-role-in-doubt-as-wpp-investigates-misconduct-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/04/martin-sorrell-ceo-role-in-doubt-as-wpp-investigates-misconduct-claims","fields":{"headline":"Martin Sorrell's WPP role in doubt after misconduct claim","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell’s iron grip as chief executive of WPP is under threat after the advertising group hired a law firm to investigate an allegation of personal misconduct. Sorrell is one of Britain’s best-known and most highly paid business leaders. He is also the longest-serving FTSE-100 chief executive and has run the sprawling WPP empire since starting the business in 1985. In the last five years alone Sorrell has been paid well over £200m for running the world’s largest advertising group thanks to lucrative and highly controversial reward schemes. His £70m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history. The investigation will increase pressure on Sorrell, who is already feeling the strain as WPP’s share price has tumbled almost 40% in the last year to its lowest point since 2013. The price slump has wiped £9bn off the value of the business, which owns 406 separate advertising and marketing firms in more than 100 countries, including top-flight brands such as Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J Walter Thompson. It has 134,000 staff. WPP recently reported its worst performance since the advertising recession in 2009, which Sorrell described as “not a pretty year”. The 73-year-old “unreservedly” denied the misconduct allegation, which involves the improper use of company funds and allegations of improper personal behaviour. “The board of WPP has appointed independent counsel to conduct an investigation in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer of WPP,” the company said. “The investigation is ongoing. The allegations do not involve amounts which are material to WPP.” Sorrell, who is on a rare holiday, said he rejected the allegation but understood that the company had to investigate the matter. “WPP is investigating an allegation of financial impropriety by me, specifically as to the use of company funds,” Sorrell said. “This allegation is being investigated by a law firm. I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it. I understand that this process will be completed shortly. Obviously, I shall play no part in the management of the investigation under way.” WPP has called in two top law firms, Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May, to advise on the investigation. The trouble at the top has once again put a spotlight on the issue of succession at WPP amid accusations of a “Sorrellcentricity” – the view that Sorrell runs the giant business autocratically as a personal fiefdom, dominating decision-making. The question of who will succeed Sorrell is raised every year at the company’s shareholder meeting. Sorrell has never given any indication that he may be ready to step back. Roberto Quarta, a US businessman hired as WPP’s chairman two years ago, has said that succession planning has intensified, becoming “even more focused and detailed”. He said there was an “exceptional team of potential candidates” from WPP’s top management, as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”. There is understood to be tension about Sorrell’s future among members of WPP’s 12-strong board, which has been heightened by the recent performance slump. At least one director is known to be agitating to oust him. “If Sorrell were to leave the company for any reason, WPP has a relatively deep bench of talent who could pick up any slack on a near-term basis,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. “A more significant issue relates to who would lead the company next and what strategic direction the company would pursue.” WPP shares fell a further 2% in trading on Wednesday in response to the investigation. Sorrell has denied the group’s poor recent performance was a result of his agencies being cut out of deals between advertisers and Google and Facebook. He said WPP spent more than $6bn (£4.4bn) of its clients’ advertising and marketing money with Google, its biggest single investment, last year, a 10% rise. Facebook received about $2.1bn of its ad spend last year, a 30% rise. Sorrell and his family trust owns a stake of about 1.8% in WPP, worth about £250m. “As a significant share-owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over 30 years ago, remains absolute – to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders,” Sorrell said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/04/uluru-reconciliation-and-republic-a-chance-to-re-imagine-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T02:32:29Z","webTitle":"Uluru, reconciliation and republic: a chance to reimagine Australia? | Paul Daley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/04/uluru-reconciliation-and-republic-a-chance-to-re-imagine-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/04/uluru-reconciliation-and-republic-a-chance-to-re-imagine-australia","fields":{"headline":"Uluru, reconciliation and republic: a chance to reimagine Australia?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Most of us old enough to vote will remember where we were when our republic, with Malcolm Turnbull as helmsman, burbled down a whirlpool of acrimony and division to the rock bottom of public consciousness for almost a generation. I was on my way to East Timor. Indonesia and its proxies had just razed the place, murdered and displaced the population, because the East Timorese had dared vote for independence from Jakarta despite courageously anticipating the very violence that eventuated. Independence from the occupier had been a dramatic, high-risk and hard won proposition for the tiny, fledgling nation I was sailing for aboard a giant catamaran laden with military kit and troops. It was a rough crossing from Darwin; Kwells and sickbags, few takers for the army catering and long queues to the heads about sums it up. Sturdier civilians took a slug of duty-free, while all around was the bemoaning or celebration of captain Turnbull’s sunken republic. Many Australian troops seemed evidently pleased, their banter freighted with assumptions that military tradition, drawn from the imperial forces, went scabbard and sheath with support for the crown. I’d been chatting to the army bloke next to me. Naturally we got on to the lost republic. He’d voted against it. He explained, “I’m Aboriginal – see?” But I didn’t. And I still feel foolish that I needed him to explain why: because an Australian republic came with no guarantee of transformation of Indigenous lives. I soon forgot about the republic. But like many who favour change it’s blipped on my radar again in recent years. Though not as resoundingly as what I regard as the far more urgent debate around Indigenous rights including constitutional recognition, a discourse that has been held largely in isolation from that on the republic. Things are changing. There is an awakening among constitutional progressives that perhaps the Australian republic ought not be so divorced from the cry out of Uluru last May for a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament and a formal truth-telling. Australia is nearing the inevitable moment where it might define itself through introspection – away from the palace, Gallipoli or John Howard’s sheriff, the USA. This continent’s timeless Indigenous occupancy, meanwhile, with its miracles of spirit, culture and essential love of country, continue to find increasing purchase in our national psyche. Could, then, this enduring Indigenous continental presence come to form the bedrock of an Australian republic? Certainly the progressive public intellect is grappling with this question in a way that should please, if not quite delight, republicans – albeit in an it’s-always-good-to-be-talked-about kind of way. Just as it might have monarchists slapping their thighs with anticipation that some sort of deja vu 1999-style split could revisit republicans to once again protect the monarch as Australian head of state. *** It was Megan Davis, a constitutional law academic, member of the referendum council (to gauge Indigenous sentiment regarding recognition) and Cobble Cobble women, who read the Uluru Statement from the Heart after the Indigenous delegates met in central Australia last May. In an essay for the Monthly, Davis writes of her own disappointment at the result of the 1999 republic referendum. It is poignant and pointed: “The least glamorous part of Australian republicanism has always been the question of Aboriginal sovereignty. And it is yet to be reconciled,” she writes towards the beginning. And near the end: “For Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander peoples, the stakes are high. We run the very real risk of a republic that renders the First Peoples invisible in the same way the constitutional monarchy did. And when we object they will blithely say, ‘That was under the old system, this is the new Australia.’ And for many mob ... the morning after a successful referendum nothing will change.” That in-between is nuanced and steely, challenging republicans to avoid minimalism, to reject a model that fails to deliver better Indigenous lives – and most of all, to avoid the lip service to symbolism (in rhetorical strategy and image) that has defined the (until recently) bipartisan approach to merely symbolic constitutional recognition. The Uluru statement was no broad claim of rights or demands. It was an astute, polished petition, an expression of sentiment responding to the federal government’s question: what sort of recognition do you want? Not least, it was an act of supreme, respectful diplomacy, as articulated in the final line Davis read that expansive Uluru day: “We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.” Here was a once-in-a-generation makarrata – an overture to legislators to clasp hands across the divide, to create a new nation that gives expression to the Indigenous experience of history, land management, culture, science and connection to the cosmos, through that constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament. It was crafted to inspire passion and imagination, and the more I read it the more obviously it seems written with an astute sensibility that the republic is close and that it must not – can not – leave blackfellas behind ... again. “With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia’s nationhood,” it says. But the passion and imagination overestimated once-bitten constitutional hardman, Turnbull. It was even more lost on underlings like Barnaby Joyce, that great sage of Australian public sentiment, who immediately said of the voice, “It’s not going to happen.” Government MPs who bothered to engage were either so intellectually bovine they couldn’t grasp the concept or (more likely) cynically dismissive of it as a fallacious third parliamentary chamber. The PM played the third chamber ruse with alacrity once he eventually saw fit, many months later, to formally respond to the Uluru statement by press release. All this would seem to me to present an opportunity to Australian republicans – other than Turnbull, that is. Indeed, while Turnbull said early this year, just months after dismissing the voice proposal as too hard, that he might consider a same-sex marriage-style postal survey on the republic, the mainstream republican movement is all but convinced he can deliver little in the space. Bipartisanship (overprotective of generations of federal failure in Indigenous policy) is gone on this one, with Labor’s Bill Shorten saying he’d move on the voice in government ahead of a referendum. While leading republican movement figures say they naturally respect the Indigenous aspiration for the voice, truth-telling and spirit of makarrata spelt out in the Uluru statement and want Aboriginal identity and rights to be front and centre of an Australian republic, they don’t want to “colonise” or overshadow the recognition movement. The ARM has always assiduously avoided aligning with other interests (including that for recognition or changing the national flag) who’d also alter the constitution. Nothing has, for the moment, changed on that front. As ARM chairman Peter FitzSimons – who has increased membership exponentially over the past two years – has said, the ARM is singularly occupied with not having “an inherited position at the head of our government”. “The Australian Republican Movement, we are a one-horse pony, a one-horse trick, a one-trick pony, one of those things.” Some republicans (myself included) might, however, prefer to see another trick or two – a broadening of ambition – that draws the Indigenous quest for equality, for voice and truth-telling closer to republicanism’s core. All this is, of course, up for public contemplation, as Mark McKenna does in his latest Quarterly Essay, Moment of Truth – History and Australia’s Future. McKenna’s books and essays compel with superb narratives and writerly elegance that lets them shine from the academy. They are indispensable to anyone concerned with Australia’s place in the world. He writes: We have looked outwards rather than within, knowing what we want to reject but being less certain about what we want to create in the monarchy’s absence ... We have already ‘broken away’ and become an independent nation except in two crucial respects: we are without an Australian head of state and we have yet to anchor our vision of popular sovereignty in the continent’s Indigenous antiquity, as the Uluru Statement from the Heart invites us to do. This is the true source of a more mature and independent Australia – the grounding of our sovereignty on our own soil, in the songlines and histories of an ancient island continent. Here I believe McKenna also offers us opportunity to redefine our notions of Australian patriotism – away from cricket, surf clubs, “mateship”, fair-goes, the Anzac furnace and empty claims to egalitarianism – and towards a deeper, ancient, tangible, more meaningful love of country. The Indigenous edition of Griffith Review, First Things First, released this month, is also canvasing Aboriginal responses to Australian republicanism. Warraimay historian Victoria Grieves writes: Australia, among all settler-colonial nations, is in a unique position whereby the call for a new Republic of Australia can segue appropriately with the need for Aboriginal sovereignty, an end to injustice and abrogation of the humanity of Aboriginal people. Waanyi and Jaru medical anthropologist Gregory Phillips writes: I believe a republic will be good for Australia, but not if it is simply an act of recolonising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples under normalised white supremacy ... The Uluru Statement from the Heart offered the federal government an inclusive opportunity towards a more meaningful, just Australia. Turnbull and his ministers, foolish, disrespectful and impetuous, slapped away the extended Indigenous hand. But it’s a hand that remains extended to republicans willing to grasp it.

The ruling paves the way for Faehrmann to stand to fill the casual vacancy left by the departing Mehreen Faruqi, and is a significant development in the infighting plaguing the Greens. It has also prompted strong words from her ally, Justin Field, a NSW MP, who accused the party bureaucracy of running “internal political agendas” in blocking Faehrmann’s candidacy. Field said democratic reforms in the NSW Greens were “now becoming more urgent”. “I’m concerned at what appears to be the party bureaucracy running internal political agendas rather than acting in the overall interest of the Greens and grassroots democracy,” he told Guardian Australia. “This approach is deeply divisive, distresses members and costs the party financially.” “I’m sure many members will be deeply disappointed to hear the arguments made in court by the party to try to exclude a member from the preselection.” Faehrmann was initially blocked from contention for Faruqi’s upper house seat in NSW, because she recently held membership of the Victorian Greens. The NSW party deemed she should serve a three-month “provisional” period in NSW after transferring from Victoria. The decision effectively took Faehrmann out of the race. Provisional members are not eligible for preselection and the cutoff to nominate for Faruqi’s seat was 9 April. Faehrmann took the matter to the NSW supreme court, seeking an urgent hearing to determine her eligibility before the looming cutoff. The chief judge in equity, Julie Ward, found in her favour on Wednesday morning. She ordered that the NSW Greens: “Remove any recording of the plaintiff on the membership list as a ‘provisional’ member and to record the plaintiff as a financial member of the political party known as the Greens NSW.” Faehrmann later issued a statement saying the ruling “reinforced the primacy of grassroots democracy” in the Greens. “This ruling now means that all financial members from another state who move to NSW and transfer their membership won’t lose their rights as members,” she said. “This is an important principle of equity and fairness that was built into the Australian Greens constitution decades ago. It is a win for grassroots democracy.” During the hearing, the Greens NSW had argued the dispute should never have come to the supreme court. They argued it should have been dealt with privately. Ward said the urgency of the case made that impossible. “It is obvious in my opinion that it would have been preferable for the disputants to have been able to resolve their dispute consensually by way of mediation rather than to incur the expense (and to invite the prospect of public comment) that follows inexorably from the invocation of the court’s processes,” Ward wrote. “However, a highly relevant factor in this regard is the timing issue.” Faehrmann has a long history with the NSW Greens. She previously held a seat in NSW parliament between September 2010 and June 2013, and joined Greens NSW in January 2004, but had moved to Victoria to take up her job with Di Natale. In a statement distributed to members, the Greens NSW convenor, Debbie Gibson, accepted the court’s decision but said it was “regrettable” that legal action was taken. Gibson said the Greens had attempted to resolve it out of court. She said the party had simply applied long-standing principles to Faehrmann. “The party’s decision to defend the action was based on independent legal advice that concluded the correct status of an individual from interstate is that of a provisional member,” Gibson wrote. “The legal advice confirmed a long-standing practice of the Greens NSW that had been consistently applied to interstate transfers. Given this advice, we believed it was beyond the power of the committee of management to overturn our existing practice.” She argued that her provisional period should be counted as the three months since she first paid membership fees to the NSW party, which had long since expired. In her statement, Faehrmann said the party’s founders would have wanted to encourage full participation by members and not disadvantage those who move interstate to serve its interests. “I first joined the NSW Greens in 2003 and have poured my heart and soul into the Greens for nearly two decades. It’s why I felt I had to stand up and defend our grassroots democracy,” she said. Faehrmann previously told Guardian Australia she had launched the court action reluctantly and the case was an “unnecessary distraction”. “I would have much preferred that this had been resolved without the need to go to court,” Faehrmann said last month. “It’s an unnecessary distraction at a time when we should be focusing 100% of our efforts on the upcoming federal and state elections.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/03/youtube-headquarters-report-shooting-police-san-bruno","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T22:57:50Z","webTitle":"YouTube shooting: at least three injured and female suspect dead in apparent suicide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/03/youtube-headquarters-report-shooting-police-san-bruno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/03/youtube-headquarters-report-shooting-police-san-bruno","fields":{"headline":"YouTube shooting: at least three injured and female suspect dead in apparent suicide","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A shooting at YouTube’s California headquarters left at least three people wounded and a female suspect dead of an apparent suicide, police said Tuesday. The San Bruno police chief, Ed Barberini, said during a news conference that police had responded to 911 calls from the Silicon Valley tech campus and discovered a woman, whom they believed to be the shooter, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Barberini did not release any information about a possible motive or the suspect’s identity, though late on Tuesday officials briefed local media that she was Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s. Barberini said the attack was carried out with a handgun and that there was no further threat to the public. Four people were transported to local hospitals, police said, including three with gunshot wounds. The three are being treated at San Francisco General hospital, a spokesman confirmed, including a 36-year-old man in critical condition and a 32-year-old woman in serious condition. It was not immediately clear where the fourth victim was being treated and in what condition. A female shooter is a rarity; an FBI study of 160 “active shooter” incidents between 2000 and 2013 found that only six incidents, or 3.8%, were perpetrated by a female shooter. News of the shooting initially spread on social media as YouTube employees posted about barricading themselves inside rooms as police and ambulances arrived at the scene. “Heard shots and saw people running while at my desk. Now barricaded inside a room with coworkers,” Vadim Lavrusik, a YouTube employee, posted to Twitter. A YouTube employee, Michael Ho, told the Guardian he was on the phone with his wife in an open-floor-plan area when he saw people running. “At first I wasn’t sure if it was something they were doing for fun,” he said, before noticing looks of panic on people’s faces. Zach Vorhies, a senior software engineer at YouTube, told the Guardian that he was at his desk when the fire alarm went off. As he passed through an interior courtyard between the main building and the parking garage he saw a man on the ground with what appeared to be a bullet wound to the stomach. He said he heard a voice he assumed to be the shooter’s shout “come and get me!” and saw police with assault weapons responding. A project manager, Todd Sherman, said he was sitting in a meeting when he heard people running to leave the building. Upon exiting the room he saw “blood drips on the floor and stairs” and heard people say there was a potential shooter before he managed to escape the building. “Police cruisers pull up, hopped out with rifles ready and I told them where the situation was as I headed down the street to meet up with a couple team members,” he said. Aerial footage shot by CBS News showed staff leaving the building with their hands in the air. Offices of other companies nearby were also on lockdown. By late afternoon, the steady stream of employees leaving YouTube’s hilltop campus in San Bruno, a mostly residential suburb of San Francisco, had ceased. Among the last to leave was the chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, who was flanked by security and did not stop to speak to reporters. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of YouTube’s parent company, Google, said in an email to staff the shooting an “unimaginable tragedy” and that the company was working to support the victims and their families. Other tech company executives, including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, sent messages of support on Twitter, with some, including Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi, calling for an end to gun violence. Chris Dale, YouTube’s global head of communications, appeared at an afternoon press conference with police where he expressed “a debt of gratitude” to officers and first responders. “We are an incredibly tight knit community within YouTube, where it feels like a family,” Dale said. “Today, it feels like the entire community of YouTube and all of the employees were victims of this crime.” Donald Trump, who was criticized for his slow response to the 14 February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 students and teachers dead, commented on the shooting on Twitter. Andre Campbell, a trauma surgeon who is treating three of the gunshot victims at San Francisco General hospital, expressed his frustration at a press conference: “Once again we are confronted with the specter of a mass casualty situation in the county of San Francisco. You would think that after Las Vegas, Parkland, the Pulse nightclub shooting, that we’d see an end to this but we have not. “Gun violence happens every day in the United States. We’ve got a serious problem we need to address. I don’t have all the answers but at least we need discussion about it nationally.” The shooting comes during a renewed debate over American gun control laws, following the Parkland shooting . Hundreds of thousands of Americans demonstrated for stricter gun laws on 24 March in Washington and across the country. With Republicans in Congress blocking any new gun control legislation, much of the activism after the Parkland shooting has shifted to the private sector, with calls for boycotts and corporate action. When a Fox News host tweeted disparagingly about a Parkland activist not getting into his top colleges, the 17-year-old successfully called for advertisers to boycott her show. YouTube is one of the companies that introduced new policies after the Parkland shooting. In late March, it quietly debuted restrictions on some gun-related video content, Bloomberg News reported. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun manufacturers, called the new policy “worrisome” in a statement to Bloomberg News in late March. YouTube has also come under scrutiny for the way its platforms have been used after mass shootings to spread conspiracy theories that mass shootings are hoaxes perpetrated to advance gun control and that grieving survivors and family members of shooting victims who appear in the media are “crisis actors”.

Speaking at a lunch with Baltic leaders on Tuesday, the president said he has been discussing the idea with his defence secretary, Jim Mattis. “We’re going to be doing things militarily,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military. That’s a big step. We really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.” Soon after, at a joint press conference with the Baltic leaders, the US president criticised current so-called “catch and release” laws concerning undocumented immigrants and said: “We are preparing for the military to secure our border between Mexico and the United States. We have a meeting on it in a little while with Gen Mattis and everybody and I think that it’s something that we have to do.” The president has expressed frustration, via Twitter, for three days in a row about America’s “weak” border. He is under pressure from the right after signing a $1.3tn budget last month that includes $1.6bn in border wall spending – far short of the $25bn he wanted. That money is mostly earmarked to repair existing fencing rather than for building the sort of concrete barriers Trump envisages. It would not be first time the military has been deployed at the border. In 2006, under Operation Jump Start, 6,000 troops were sent there in an effort to increase security and surveillance. Over two years, about 29,000 national guard forces participated in the missions, as forces rotated in and out, the Associated Press reported. More than 30 miles of fencing and 13 miles of road were built, and more than 86 miles of vehicle barriers were installed. With the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania under potential threat from an aggressive Russia, Trump’s relationship with Vladimir Putin was again in the spotlight during Tuesday’s visit. When a reporter raised it at the press conference, the president insisted: “Nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have, and I know you’re nodding yes because everyone agrees when they think about it.” Whereas his election opponent Hillary Clinton was in favour of “windmills”, he continued, the US was now an exporter of energy and “that is not a positive for Russia but it’s certainly a positive for the United States”. Boosted US military spending, a strengthened Nato and the expulsion of 60 diplomats were not to Moscow’s benefit, Trump contended. “With that being said, I think I could have a very good relationship with President Putin. I think. It’s possible I won’t. And you will know about it. Believe me, this room will know about it before I know about it.” Trump was also questioned about recent remarks concerning an imminent withdrawal of US troops from Syria, where Russia has helped prop up the dictator Bashar al-Assad. He claimed the fight against Islamic State was “almost completed” and said: “I want to get out. I want to bring out troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation.” At one point during the media conference, he encouraged the Latvian president, Raimonds Vējonis, to take a question from a Baltic reporter as opposed to an American one, quipping: “Real news, not fake news.” As Trump left the room, he ignored a shouted question about the pornographic actor Stormy Daniels, who alleges they had a sexual encounter. Trump has been intensifying his rhetoric on immigration in recent days. He called on Republican members of Congress to immediately pass a border bill by using the “Nuclear Option if necessary” – a change to Senate rules so that a simple majority of 51 votes is enough to advance legislation. Trump’s favored solution for extending protections to Dreamers mustered only 39 votes in the Senate. He also seized on the case of more than 1,200 Central American migrants on a 2,000-mile journey from the Mexico-Guatemalan border and threatened to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) if they were not stopped. “We will be doing things with Mexico, and they have to do it, otherwise I’m not going to do with the Nafta deal,” told reporters. He said if the “caravan” reaches the US border “our laws are so weak and so pathetic ... it’s like we have no border”. Mexican officials increased efforts on Tuesday to process the dwindling group and determine whether they had the right to stay in Mexico or should be returned to their countries of origin. Mexico has said such “caravans” of mostly Central Americans, including many escaping violence in Honduras, have occurred since 2010. Trump spent much of the Easter weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he hosted conservative commentators including the Fox News presenter Sean Hannity. Staffers with Trump included his policy adviser Stephen Miller, a chief architect of anti-immigration policies. On Monday, White House officials said they were crafting a legislative package aimed at closing immigration “loopholes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/03/wales-wayne-pivac-warren-gatland-scarlets-tuilagi-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T21:26:00Z","webTitle":"Wales open talks with Wayne Pivac about succeeding Warren Gatland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/03/wales-wayne-pivac-warren-gatland-scarlets-tuilagi-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/03/wales-wayne-pivac-warren-gatland-scarlets-tuilagi-england","fields":{"headline":"Wales open talks with Wayne Pivac about succeeding Warren Gatland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Scarlets coach, Wayne Pivac, has confirmed he has held talks with the Welsh Rugby Union with a view to replacing Warren Gatland as Wales head coach after the 2019 World Cup. Pivac’s stock has risen after he guided the Scarlets to the semi-finals of the Champions Cup – a season after winning the Pro12 – and the New Zealander, who signed a new contract with the region in October, has been sounded out by the WRU. Martyn Phillips, the WRU chief executive, said in December he wants an appointment to be made by the summer and Pivac was at the time believed to be on a three-man shortlist which also included Chris Boyd, who has since agreed to take over at Northampton, and Dave Rennie. After it emerged over the weekend that the WRU had sought permission to speak to Pivac, the 55-year-old was on Tuesday quoted by the BBC as saying there had been “discussions over my contract here”. He added: “As you’d expect, I’m sure most coaches at the highest level in Wales would have had conversations. But there has not been a formal interview.” Meanwhile, Manu Tuilagi’s hopes of touring South Africa with England may rest on whether Leicester reach the Premiership play-offs, according to his coach, Matt O’Connor, who confirmed the 26-year-old centre is expected to return from a pectoral injury at the end of the month. O’Connor revealed Tuilagi, who has not played for England for more than two years, had suffered a muscle strain against Wasps last time out and that he is likely to make a return against Newcastle on 27 April. The Tigers, fifth in the table, have only one more regular season match after that but O’Connor believes a run to the knockout stages could lead to Tuilagi’s involvement with England over the summer. “It should be a couple of weeks rather than months,” O’Connor said. “I suppose the England tour will depend a little bit on how many games and how far we go into May. It will have a large bearing on what Eddie’s plans for him and the tour to South Africa are.” Bath have dismissed any possibility of their England lock Dave Attwood making a permanent switch to Toulon this summer following reports the French club are keen to offer the player a permanent deal. “We won’t be interested,” said Todd Blackadder, Bath’s director of rugby. “Dave Attwood will be playing for Bath next season. We’ve acted in good faith and done the right thing by the player. It would be really disrespectful of them to make an offer.” Elliot Daly has recovered from the nasty finger injury sustained after scoring two tries against Leicester and has been declared fit to take his place for Wasps against Sale on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/03/tottenham-shooting-london-violence-worse-than-ever-says-mp","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T21:20:30Z","webTitle":"Second teenager in 24 hours dies amid calls to tackle London violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/tottenham-shooting-london-violence-worse-than-ever-says-mp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/tottenham-shooting-london-violence-worse-than-ever-says-mp","fields":{"headline":"Second teenager in 24 hours dies amid calls to tackle London violence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MPs and campaigners have said authorities are failing to get a grip on violent crime in London after two teenagers were fatally shot on the same night in the capital. A 17-year-old girl died first after a drive-by shooting in Tottenham, north London. Police said on Tuesday evening that a 16-year-old boy shot on Monday had died in hospital after succumbing to his injuries. With violent crime levels feared to be heading back to their worst level in more than a decade the two became the capital’s 47th and 48th suspected murder victims this year. Labour MP David Lammy said the situation was “worse than I’ve ever seen it”. He blamed the rapid growth of the illicit drug economy and cuts to public services for the rising violence. Tanesha Melbourne-Blake was with friends in Tottenham when a gunman opened fire from a moving car at about 9.30pm on Monday. “The car just pulled up and started shooting,” said a 21-year-old from the area, who did not want to be named. By the time police and paramedics arrived the victim was surrounded by dozens of people, including her mother, according to witnesses. “She was screaming. She didn’t know what to do. She didn’t deserve that. Her mum didn’t deserve to watch her die,” one said. Tanesha’s killing and the apparently unrelated shooting three miles away in Walthamstow that resulted in the death of a 16-year-old boy have fuelled concerns about a rise in violent crime in London in 2018. There were eight killings in January, 15 in February and 22 in March, and there have been three so far in April. At the present rate, London could surpass 180 homicides this year, a return to levels last seen in 2005 when there were 181. Last year there were 116 homicides in London, excluding the deaths in the Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park terrorist attacks. On Tuesday police identified the victim of a stabbing in Greenwich last week as 23-year-old Reece Tshoma and gave more details of the death of Devoy Burton-Stapleton, 20, who was stabbed as he walked home from a night out on Easter Sunday. The spate of violence has been met with growing calls for action from victims’ loved ones. Last week the family of Abraham Badru, who was shot as he opened his car boot in Hackney, appealed for an end to “the gun culture [that] is becoming rampant in our community”. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, argued that austerity was responsible for the growth in violence, tweeting: “Government cuts have decimated services for young Londoners.” The deputy mayor for policing and crime, Sophie Linden, echoed that claim by calling for more government funding for police. But the government insisted the problem was the mayor’s responsibility, with a spokesman for the prime minister saying: “The mayor of London is accountable for the performance of the Metropolitan police.” Others pointed out that the stark figures on deaths were only one part of the picture of violent crime in London. On Monday an emergency doctor at St Bart’s hospital tweeted that the number of young victims he and colleagues had dealt with that weekend was “upsetting”. “This is an epidemic of violence against and between kids and we ought to be outraged, we ought to be motivated to fix it and we shouldn’t rest until we have,” he wrote. In the aftermath of Tanesha’s death, DCS Richard Wood said the Met was doing everything in its power to combat violent crime. “We’ve got officers out there working hard day in, day out trying to stem the tide of violence,” he said. “Clearly there have been a number of incidents and there is no avoiding that. Of course I never forget that behind these incidents is the family and friends.” Detectives are investigating the possibility that Tanesha’s killing was linked to a feud between gangs in Tottenham and Wood Green. Sources have said they believe the attack was connected to incidents in which a young person was shot in Tottenham and another was shot and killed outside the Vue cinema in Wood Green. That was followed the next day by what was believed to be a reprisal stabbing outside a sixth-form centre in north London. Local sources said tensions had flared again over the weekend, with provocative social media posts said to have played a part. Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, said the deeper reason for the violence was a failure to tackle inequality and the illicit drug economy. “All of this is being driven by McMafia, by gangsters, by massive amounts of cocaine coming into Britain,” he said. “You’ve got a decriminalisation of coke for white folk in Notting Hill, but it’s black young foot soldiers” who were taking the risks of involvement with the unregulated drug economy, Lammy said. “The context in the London borough of Haringey is that it’s basically a borough that has had huge cuts to the local authority, has cut youth services, it’s not got the best mental health services, and has certainly not been able to implement a proper public health response to gun and knife crime.” In the drive-by shooting on Chalgrove Road in Tottenham, at least two shots were fired in a busy street at about 9.30pm. Tanesha was struck in the upper body, and another bullet hit a nearby property. When police first arrived they found about 60 people at the scene. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said paramedics worked to save the girl but she was pronounced dead at 10.43pm. “Her next of kin are aware and a crime scene is in place. No arrests have been made at this stage,” she said. Tanesha’s mother laid flowers at the scene on Tuesday with a card reading: “To my baby Nesha. I’m gonna miss you so much, you’re always gonna be with me everywhere I go.” It was signed “Love Mummy”. Vicky Foxcroft, a Labour MP who has set up a youth violence commission after the deaths of five young people in her Lewisham Deptford constituency, said violence was blighting people’s lives. “I think we have a lot more violence in society and things are being normalised,” she said. She called for an integrated approach where children who came into contact with one service were automatically referred to relevant support. “If this many young people died at a football match or at a concert we would have an immediate inquiry into what happened,” Foxcroft added. “The government urgently needs to revisit its approach.” The government is expected to respond to the surge in violence with a violent crime strategy this spring. Asked whether Theresa May was concerned about the number of murders in London this year, a Downing Street spokesman said: “These are all tragic cases and our thoughts are with the families of the victims. There can be no place in our society for violent crime. The government is determined to do everything it can to break the cycle.” Maria Killick, who was standing outside her home watching camera crews and onlookers assemble at one end of Chalgrove Road, said: “There’s nowhere for the young people to go. It started with [David] Cameron when they just started taking away everything for them. Sure they can train and work hard at school, but where are the jobs for them?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-frances-transport-strikes-make-or-break-for-macron","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T17:30:17Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on France’s transport strikes: make or break for Macron | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-frances-transport-strikes-make-or-break-for-macron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-frances-transport-strikes-make-or-break-for-macron","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on France’s transport strikes: make or break for Macron","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the first anniversary of his election nears, President Emmanuel Macron has embarked on one of the decisive political power struggles of his five-year term as France’s leader. There was never any doubt that such a moment would come. The president was always going to face a showdown over the liberalising labour and economic reforms on which he campaigned a year ago. Trade unions were always going to attempt to use the power of the street and the shopfloor to redress the power of the ballot box. Now that moment has come. It will be watched not just in France but across Europe. Mr Macron won a number of skirmishes last year over labour market reforms and public sector jobs. Now and over the coming months, he faces a full-on battle with the rail unions over plans to reform the state-owned SNCF. The president is taking his stand on an SNCF reform package based on February’s report by the former head of Air France, Jean-Cyril Spinetta. Under this plan, the French government would help to bail out the SNCF’s almost €50bn debt in return for opening up French rail markets and scrapping generous pay, retirement and benefit terms for new SNCF employees. The unions are fighting more than anything to preserve their enviable existing deal; but they are casting the dispute as an attack on unions in general and a defence of state ownership against privatisation (an aim the government has disavowed). Both sides know that French voters treasure their welfare state. France’s international reputation as a bulwark of unionisation can be misleading. Only 11% of French workers are in unions, a smaller proportion than in the UK. The largest union, the CFDT, is much less militant than the left-led, and historically pro-Communist CGT, which is calling the rail strikes that began this week. But the strength and militancy of the rail workers is beyond question, and this confrontation is not just real but emblematic. There has not been a strike-free year on the SNCF since 1959. In 1995, the rail workers were decisive in killing off Jacques Chirac’s welfare reforms, while in 2010 they helped water down Nicolas Sarkozy’s attempt to raise the pension age. The stakes for Mr Macron are very high. Mr Macron is calculating that the combination of his 2017 election win, the parliamentary election success of his La République en Marche party and the readiness of French public opinion to embrace reform will allow him to do in 2018 what his predecessors failed to do in 1995 and 2010. He has already made some concessions in his plans – reprieving loss-making rural rail lines that the Spinetta report has earmarked for closure, for example. He is putting his prime minister and his transport minister out front to deal with the day-by-day arguments. But the industrial battle could be a close-run thing. Mr Macron only won a quarter of the vote for his reform programme in last year’s first round, and only got his second-round majority because the choice was between him and Marine Le Pen. Public opinion has moved against Mr Macron recently. His personal ratings have slipped beneath 50%, while public support for his SNCF reform has narrowed from 16 points in mid-March to seven points now. The strikers believe momentum is on their side – even making comparisons with the May 1968 uprising. Other disputes – including at Air France and the Carrefour supermarket chain – are taking place alongside the SNCF strikes, so a weak parallel with 1968 is there, providing one doesn’t look too carefully. At this stage, though, this is not a festival of the oppressed. Some will see the SNCF conflict as the mirror image of the clear mood across the Channel in favour of renationalisation of the UK railways. The costs and disputes in British rail privatisation are often invoked as a horror story in France; Mr Macron has been compared to Margaret Thatcher. Britain’s chaotic recent rail history certainly has lessons for France. Here again, though, the closer one looks, the more distinct the two situations are. Britain’s rail system is a lesson in the dangers of unreformed privatisation. France’s exemplifies the problems of an unreformed nationalised system. The truth is that they both need to change, not to swap identities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-grindr-and-data-protection-dont-trade-our-privacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T17:28:12Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Grindr and data protection: don’t trade our privacy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-grindr-and-data-protection-dont-trade-our-privacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-grindr-and-data-protection-dont-trade-our-privacy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Grindr and data protection: don’t trade our privacy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The gay hookup app Grindr, used by millions of people every day to find sexual partners, has been sharing its users’ HIV status with third parties. There could not be a more dramatic illustration of the pervasive nature of the data economy. The first thing to note is that no one was compelled to hand this information over to the people they hoped to meet through the app or the company that runs it, all of them complete strangers. It is most unlikely that users imagined that such potentially damaging and certainly deeply private information would be shared with further companies they had never heard of, and whose business is hard for any outsiders to understand. Whether the users were at fault for excessive trust, or lack of imagination, or even whether they were at fault at all for submitting information that would let their potential partners make a better informed choice, as liberal ethics would demand, the next thing to scrutinise is the role of the company itself. Grindr has now said that it will no longer hand over the information, which is an admission that it was wrong to do so in the first place. It also says that the information was always anonymised, and that its policy was perfectly standard practice among digital businesses. This last is perfectly true, and perhaps the most worrying part of the whole story. We now live in a world where the valuations of giant companies are determined by the amount of personal data they hold on third parties, who frequently have no idea how much there is, nor how revealing it is. As well as the HIV status, and last test date, Grindr collected and passed on to third parties its users’ locations, their phone identification numbers, and emails. These went to two companies that promise to make it easier to deliver personalised advertisements to phones based on the users’ locations and to increase the amount of time they spend looking at apps on their phones. The data was in theory anonymised, although repeated experiments have shown that the anonymity of personal information on the internet is pretty easily cracked in most cases. It is a further complication that none of the companies involved knew, or could know, what would eventually be advertised against the information that Grindr delivered. The modern system of real-time auctions for webpages as they are loaded means that the advertisements you see on your phone or screen are determined by the operations of computer programs operating at unimaginable speed. That is one reason why the system appears to be both incomprehensible and out of anyone’s control. But it must be possible to understand enough to bring it back under human, democratic control. Some categories of information, such as HIV status, should never be shared with third parties for commercial gain. Much more should never be saved at all. Only by slow reforms of that sort can the monster we have built be tamed and made to serve and not exploit us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2018/apr/04/martin-luther-king-mlk-archive-1968-50","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T10:43:30Z","webTitle":"From the Guardian archive: a day of mourning for Dr Martin Luther King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2018/apr/04/martin-luther-king-mlk-archive-1968-50","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2018/apr/04/martin-luther-king-mlk-archive-1968-50","fields":{"headline":"From the archive: a day of mourning for Dr Martin Luther King","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Another Black Friday, a front page story on 6 April 1968 about King’s assassination told how the civil rights leader had walked many times into the cauldron of racial violence in the stoical knowledge that his days might soon be numbered.

The practice was confirmed by research conducted by Murdoch University, which conducted a genetic analysis of wild pigs that found evidence of animals being deliberately relocated around the state. It’s a problem for farmers in the state’s southwest, who say they can lose up to half an acre of crops per night if feral pigs get into their paddocks. “That could be $600 a night in a crop, easily,” the WA Farmers Federation livestock president, David Slade, told Guardian Australia. “And if they do that over a period of time they can root up your pastures, all your crops, everything. So they can be very destructive. They wreck your fences too – they’re such a solid animal, they just barrel through.” Slade said he was aware of cases where the pig population in an area had been bolstered by hunters. He said some hunters also tried to avoid shooting female pigs, because that would ensure there were more pigs to hunt next year. It was not an uncommon hunting philosophy but should not be the approach if the goal was the eradication of a feral animal, Slade said. “We almost got rid of them but as I said, they drop them,” he said. “The pig hunters drop them again and start them off again. “[They] grab them in the ute, come down, and drop them off. Then they come through next year and shoot them.” The 2015 Murdoch study, conducted in conjunction with the Department of Parks and Wildlife, used a system of genetic markers similar to that used in criminal forensic investigations to trace related populations. “We found recently colonised regions that had previously been uninfested by feral pigs,” a report by study co-author Peter Spencer said. “We also found evidence where animals from geographically isolated areas had been introduced into established feral pig populations; these populations were in areas that were in close proximity to public road access and towns.” Slade farms sheep, cattle, and crops near Mount Barker, in the great southern region. Annabelle Garrett, a Landcare officer for the great southern region, told the ABC that both feral pig numbers and reports of illegal pig dumping, or “pig seeding”, had increased. “We’re seeing a lot of that happen around the state now,” she said. “People are actually breeding and transferring pigs for recreational hunting.” A spokeswoman for the WA agriculture department said breeding and release of feral pigs was illegal and substantiated reports of illegal pig release were rare. “The department receives occasional reports of people holding and breeding feral pigs,” she said. “Genetic research undertaken by Western Australian university researchers in 2005 did provide evidence that pigs had been deliberately moved in some instances.” Pigs were introduced to Australia by colonists in the late 1700s. The federal environment department considers them “a serious environmental and agricultural pest across Australia” and all states run control programs. According to the department, there are an estimated 23.5m feral pigs in Australia, causing an estimated $100m damage per year. Shooting and trapping are the most effective methods of pig eradication. Many farmers pay hunters to come on to their land to remove the pigs. Slade said there was a need for better regulation to ensure that hunters were not shooting the animals for sport. “They are very hard to get rid of once you’ve got them,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/04/jaws-drop-as-great-white-shark-interrupts-australian-police-operation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T03:15:33Z","webTitle":"Jaws drop as great white shark interrupts Australian police operation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/04/jaws-drop-as-great-white-shark-interrupts-australian-police-operation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/04/jaws-drop-as-great-white-shark-interrupts-australian-police-operation","fields":{"headline":"Jaws drop as great white shark interrupts Australian police operation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A great white shark swimming in one of Australia’s most renowned shark habitats interrupted a police operation on Saturday by serenely terrifying the officers. The shark, dubbed Noah by South Australia police, glided in between a police dinghy containing two life-jacketed police officers and their intended target, a recreational fishing boat selected for a random breath test. It was about 4.5 metres (15ft) long – longer than the inflatable dinghy – and swam after the small boat before circling back to the 5.7-metre fishing boat that it had been following for the previous 10 minutes. “Police were concentrating on recreational boats and checking registration, licences and safety equipment along with alcohol and drug-testing operators when they were paid a visit by one of the locals,” SA police wrote on social media. “Noah wasn’t keen on being breath tested and our Water Operations Unit officers were happy to oblige!” One of the men on the recreational fishing boat told ABC radio in Adelaide that they had been trying to escape the shark when police approached. “We kind of had thoughts of changing our Bonds [underwear] a couple of times,” Mark Oates told the ABC. “So we powered up and cruised out of there but it just kept following us for 10 minutes.” The SA police patrol boat Investigator II was also in the area, about nine nautical miles east of Edithburgh on the Yorke Peninsula in the Spencer Gulf. Neptune Island, a global hotspot for great white sharks, was about 30 miles (50km) west. Oates said he saw two police approaching in the inflatable dinghy. “I told the boys to back off a bit because the shark was right next to us,” he said. “For probably the next 10 or 15 minutes we just sat around … there was very little fish caught that day, I can tell you.” Attempts to breath-test Oates and his companions were also abandoned. “I don’t think they were quite that game to come up close to us by that stage,” he told the ABC. Great white sharks are listed as vulnerable under Australian law and cannot be harmed without an exemption granted by the federal environment minister. There are no firm population estimates of the migratory species, which can travel up to 4,000km in the open ocean, but CSIRO researchers this year used a genetic analysis to determine there were at least 5,500 individuals swimming in waters off Australia’s east coast and about 1,500 living off the west coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/03/chamapionship-roundup-oskar-buur-saves-wolves-hull","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T21:20:03Z","webTitle":"Championship roundup: Oskar Buur saves Wolves from sinking at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/03/chamapionship-roundup-oskar-buur-saves-wolves-hull","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/03/chamapionship-roundup-oskar-buur-saves-wolves-hull","fields":{"headline":"Championship roundup: Oskar Buur saves Wolves from sinking at home","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wolves’ cruise towards the Championship title hit a patch of rough water in a 2-2 draw with Hull. They were 2-1 down at Molineux after 78 minutes before the rookie defender Oskar Buur headed the leaders level with seven minutes left. Nuno Espírito Santo was not best pleased. “We had to show our character. Our character is always there but it was not a good performance,” the Wolves manager said. “We wanted three points so we are not happy.” Wolves were without the midfielder Rúben Neves and the full-back Matt Doherty after they were sent off in Friday’s game at Middlesbrough. Diogo Jota put them ahead with an 18th-minute penalty after being fouled by Michael Hector but Hull, desperate to boost their survival hopes, equalised with a spot-kick of their own, scored by David Meyler eight minutes before half-time. They took the lead when Ryan Bennett scored an unfortunate own goal. A point for Wolves increased their advantage over second-placed Cardiff, who they visit on Friday, to six points. Slavisa Jokanovic wants Fulham to keep putting pressure on Cardiff after his side moved to within five points of the automatic promotion places with a 2-0 home win over Leeds. A bizarre goal off Kevin McDonald’s backside was followed by Aleksandar Mitrovic’s eighth strike in as many games as Fulham extended their unbeaten league run to 18 matches. Jokanovic said: “We can do it, we can try to repair ourselves and be ready for our next game but everything depends on Cardiff, they must lose.” Steve Bruce was also thinking of going straight up after Aston Villa’s comfortable 3-0 home win over struggling Reading, who were reduced to 10 men for the last hour. Second-half goals from Birkir Bjarnason, Conor Hourihane and Scott Hogan did the damage. Bruce said: “There are going to a few twists and turns, and remember we take on Cardiff at home next week.” Garry Monk oversaw a third win in a row for Birmingham with a 1-0 victory at Bolton, even though Che Adams was sent off. Lukas Jutkiewicz scored with a left-footed shot in the 40th minute. “We knew it was a massive game against a team who are directly above us,” Monk said. “What three wins in a row have done is keep boosting the belief. However, we are still very much in a relegation fight. It is going to change week to week.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/05/killing-eve-review-dazzling-thriller-from-fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridge","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:30:46Z","webTitle":"Killing Eve review – dazzling thriller from Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/05/killing-eve-review-dazzling-thriller-from-fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/05/killing-eve-review-dazzling-thriller-from-fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridge","fields":{"headline":"Killing Eve review – dazzling thriller from Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the woman behind Fleabag, arguably television’s sharpest – and darkest – comedy, Phoebe Waller-Bridge proved herself both a skillful, perverse chronicler of modern times and an instinctually funny actor. She’d already done so with six-part comedy Crashing, playing one of six 20-something misfits squatting in a dilapidated hospital, but Fleabag was to Waller-Bridge what Atlanta was to Donald Glover: an instant all-timer in the field of auteurist comedy and a de facto statement of its creator’s arrival. Then, in an unexpected pivot, Waller-Bridge was cast as a droid in the upcoming Ron Howard-directed Han Solo movie. And now, as if there weren’t enough balls in the air, she’s penned Killing Eve, an eight-episode miniseries pitting an MI5 spy against a bloodthirsty contract killer. If the 32-year-old’s ability to transcend genre was in question, the answer, as with most things concerning Waller-Bridge, is yes, yes she can. Slickly made and mightily entertaining, Killing Eve brings a new energy to the well-worn game of cat-and-mouse staged by many a murder mystery: this time, both the assassin and the spy are women, the former played with savage wit by Jodie Comer, the latter by a keen, unwavering, and often very funny Sandra Oh. Watching it you’re reminded of 007, with its breakneck pace and and schizophrenic, rock-n-roll soundtrack; Hannibal, with its ever-increasing body count and psychosexual undertones; and even Fargo, thanks to the blend of clumsiness and resolve Oh brings to the character of Eve, who’s rescued from her ho-hum job as an MI5 analyst when she’s assigned to track down a dexterous assassin named Villanelle. That she’s named after a 19-line poem structure that has its roots in 16th-century Italian dance is curious. But the villanelle, five tercets capped by a quatrain, has often been a vehicle to express obsession and intensity, as it was for poets like Dylan Thomas and Sylvia Plath. And as the show proceeds, Eve and Villanelle become progressively obsessed with one another, lured into ever more dangerous territory by the knowledge that they’re hot on each other’s trails. So hot, in fact, that before they even officially meet one has stolen the other’s scarf. We first see Villanelle in a pastry shop in Vienna, where she has a stare down with a little girl before abruptly thwacking an ice cream sundae into the child’s face and leaving. It’s a strange place to open the series, but it helps communicate something Eve will have to learn if she’s to catch her: that she’s an unfeeling adrenaline junkie, someone who murders not for vengeance but for pleasure. Villanelle’s weapons of choice are impressively diverse – a hairpin, a handgun, a lethal injection, and a toxic homemade fragrance – as are her victims: Italian mafia men, Russian politicians, Chinese colonels. It would be nice to know exactly why she’s being hired to dispatch these men, but you’re far more focused on the playful arrogance and mischief with which she does it. Meanwhile in London, Eve Polastri harbors a fascination with female killers. She knows one when she sees one, but is relegated mainly to thankless tasks as an intelligence analyst. When she goes beyond the scope of her powers to follow a potential lead, she’s fired for insubordination. Shortly thereafter, with admissible contrivance, Eve’s former boss Carolyn (played by a steely Fiona Shaw) takes note of her initiative and recruits her as an MI6 spy. “They all think we’re having affairs before they think we’re secret agents,” Carolyn says of their unwitting husbands, who in a refreshing twist on the genre appear as the set pieces women so often play in run-of-the-mill spy thrillers. Though Killing Eve, based on Luke Jennings’ Villanelle novels, is primarily a showcase for its two fantastic lead performances, it has a strong supporting cast, many of whom supply the deadpan one-liners we’ve come to expect from Waller-Bridge’s pen (insults include “monkeydick” and “dickswab”, and one victim is wounded in a kink clinic by a testicle clamper). Shaw, as Eve’s superior, is a brainy, strong-willed spy, and David Haig, as Eve’s work husband and occasional doubting Thomas, plays a charming klutz caught in Eve and Villanelle’s crossfire. Together with Comer and Oh they elevate an otherwise boilerplate plot to something thrilling, deranged and sincerely fun. If the show in concept reads like a feminist retort to a traditionally macho genre (and the headlines ahead of its premiere have framed it as such) it’s only because Waller-Bridge presents her dual leads as the independent and fiercely capable women they are. Like most good screenwriters, she refrains from heavy-handed go-girl virtue signaling in favor of old-fashioned entertainment. The result is a superbly acted and amply suspenseful drama, and yet another feather in Waller-Bridge’s cap. Killing Eve begins in the US on BBC America on 8 April and in the UK on BBC One later this year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/03/trump-baltic-leaders-press-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T20:08:34Z","webTitle":"Trump and the Baltics: president brings out old hits as guests try to keep up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/trump-baltic-leaders-press-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/03/trump-baltic-leaders-press-conference","fields":{"headline":"Trump and the Baltics: president brings out old hits as guests try to keep up","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than an event involving four heads of state, Donald Trump’s press conference with the three Baltic leaders on Tuesday resembled a concert by a hastily assembled Motown covers band. Trump, the lead singer, dominated the stage, singing familiar songs about everything from Vladimir Putin and Nato to Hillary Clinton’s love of windmills. The other three performers shuffled awkwardly behind him, trying to keep in tune. The three heads of state resisted the temptation to sway like the Four Tops when Levi Stubbs grabbed the mic. The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, turned her head intently towards the American leader. The Estonian president, Kersti Kaljulaid, stared straight ahead, trying to hide a slight smirk. It emerged occasionally nonetheless. The Latvian president, Raimonds Vējonis, did a little bit of both. Trump only took one question from an American reporter, which was about US troops in Syria and his announcement last week that they might come home soon. The question was also about his surprise announcement that morning, that he would send US troops to guard the Mexican border. In answer to the first part, Trump sounded typically confused notes. Listeners were left unclear if American troops would leave Syria soon, or stay, or if it all depended on whether Saudi Arabia would foot the bill. In answer to the second, he produced familiar themes. The border was unprotected. America needed strong immigration enforcement. His only elaboration on his wish for troops was that he would meet Defense Secretary James Mattis “and everybody” to discuss it “in a little while”. For Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, Trump had vague but copious praise. They were industrious nations, he said, filled with tremendous people. They were great places to invest. He even praised their media. Baltic reporters were real news, he said, as opposed to their American counterparts who were – a familiar refrain – “fake news”. His Baltic backing band tried their best to harmonize. They praised American leadership, touted their own contributions to Nato and noted that the US had been a strong ally during their half-century under Soviet occupation. They had to do so. After all, as long as they are singing back-up for Trump, he can’t duet with Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/baftas-nominations-tv-2018-the-crown-black-mirror","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T08:04:13Z","webTitle":"Bafta TV nominations 2018: The Crown, Line of Duty and Black Mirror lead the way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/baftas-nominations-tv-2018-the-crown-black-mirror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/04/baftas-nominations-tv-2018-the-crown-black-mirror","fields":{"headline":"Bafta TV nominations 2018: The Crown, Line of Duty and Black Mirror lead the way","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Crown and Black Mirror helped Netflix to a strong performance in the TV Bafta nominations, as the streaming giant’s Royal and sci-fi dramas shared top spot with the BBC’s Line of Duty and Three Girls with three nominations each. Claire Foy, who plays the Queen in The Crown and has been caught in the middle of a pay gap dispute after it was revealed Matt Smith was paid more than her, was nominated for best actress for a second year in a row. Vanessa Kirby, who plays Princess Margaret, repeated her nod in the supporting actress category, while The Crown will compete for best drama along with End of the F***ing World (Channel 4), Line of Duty (BBC One) and Peaky Blinders (BBC). The BBC’s Line of Duty was recognised in the acting categories with Thandie Newton (lead actress) and Adrian Dunbar (supporting actor) both receiving nods. Netflix’s six nominations in the major categories were rounded out by Black Mirror with Joe Cole (who also stars in Peaky Blinders) being nominated for lead actor for his performance in Hang The DJ. Tim Pigott-Smith, who died in April last year, received a post-humous nomination for his performance in King Charles III in the lead actor category, which also saw Sean Bean (Broken) and Jack Rowan (Born To Kill) receive nods. Three Girls, the drama based on the Rochdale sexual abuse scandal, was recognised with three nominations – Molly Windsor goes up in the best actress category. West Country mockumentary This Country received several nominations in the comedy categories with lead actors, and real life brother and sister Daisy May Cooper and Charlie Cooper, both recognised for acting and writing. The show, which won plaudits for its farcical take on rural life in Gloucestershire, has been one of the BBC’s big critical hits of the last year and has recently returned for a second season. International television was once again dominated by the US, with Handmaid’s Tale (Channel 4), Big Little Lies (Sky Atlantic), Feud: Bette and Joan (BBC Two), and the documentary series The Vietnam War (BBC Two) all up for the gong. It was another year of diverse nominees – in some areas – after last year’s pledge from the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV to commission more work from writers and actors from different backgrounds. Comedy saw Asim Chaundry from People Just Do Nothing and Samson Kayo from sketch show Famalam were both recognised in best male performance while Chewing Gum and Timewasters, shows with majority black casts, were nominated in best comedy. The lead drama categories were less diverse, with Thandie Newton being the only person of colour recognised. In the factual category, David Attenborough’s Planet Earth II will go up against Jean-Michel Basquiat documentary Basquiat: Rage to Riches, and two other BBC Two productions: Blitz: The Bombs That Changed Britain and Elizabeth I’s Secret Agents.

Today, while overall church attendance has declined, Britain’s 42 cathedrals report evensong congregations up by a third in the past decade. In an increasingly secular world, with our lives often taken prisoner by technology, it seems that more people are seeking 40 minutes of quiet contemplation and the healing balm of good music. Even avowed atheists appreciate it – Richard Dawkins among them, apparently. • Two recent recordings remind us of the richness of the repertoire heard in cathedrals and college chapels up and down the land every day of the year. The Gesualdo Six offer a collection of 17 Renaissance English Motets (Hyperion), sung with precision, perfect balance and glowing warmth under the direction of Owain Park. Byrd’s Vigilate is delivered with suitably vital urgency, while Sheppard’s Libera nos, salva nos I unfolds with quiet, stately grandeur. This is singing at its most contained and intimate. • In contrast, the full cathedral experience can be found on Evensong from York Minster (Regent). Sheppard’s Libera nos sounds totally different here, with greater forces and in the glorious acoustic of that majestic building. Notable is director Robert Sharpe’s masterly handling of Howells’s St Paul’s Service, thunderously accompanied by organist Benjamin Morris and thrillingly sung by this great choir. • Listeners will be familiar with the BBC’s longest continually running outside broadcast, Radio 3’s Choral Evensong, transmitted live every Wednesday from a cathedral or college chapel somewhere in Britain (repeated on Sundays and available on iPlayer). Also worth exploring are the increasingly available webcasts from choral institutions across the country. Most of the major Oxbridge college choirs webcast at least some of their services – St John’s, Cambridge, for example – as do Hereford, Canterbury and Glasgow. And so the maddening technology that is perhaps driving more folk to seek solace in hearing this music live is now harnessed to bringing it to even more people at home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/03/bright-object-may-have-fazed-bellshill-irish-grand-national-willie-mullins","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T18:19:28Z","webTitle":"Bright object may have fazed Bellshill in Irish Grand National, says Willie Mullins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/03/bright-object-may-have-fazed-bellshill-irish-grand-national-willie-mullins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/03/bright-object-may-have-fazed-bellshill-irish-grand-national-willie-mullins","fields":{"headline":"Bright object may have fazed Bellshill in Irish Grand National, says Willie Mullins","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A rueful Willie Mullins is working on a theory Bellshill was distracted by something bright in his line of vision when he made his mad leftwards plunge that threw the finish of Monday’s Irish Grand National into disarray. The consensus in the immediate aftermath was the horse’s wayward path was the result of fatigue but Mullins does not accept that explanation, having talked it over with Bellshill’s jockey, David Mullins. “No, he wasn’t emptying at all,” the trainer said. “David said he had plenty of running left in him. Whether something caught his eye or what, I don’t know. “I’ve got to have a look at the tapes but someone said there might have been a photographer’s coat or a hi-vis jacket might have taken his eye off the fence. David said there was plenty in the horse because he was brought to a standstill and then ran on again.” Bellshill moved like the best horse for most of the race and was trading online at odds of about 1-3 as he approached the final fence. However, instead of producing the straightforward leap that would have all but ensured victory, he slowed and hung to his left before clambering over, losing ground and momentum. He was beaten by only one length. Mullins said he will not race Bellshill in the Grand National at Aintree a week on Saturday but will instead rely on Total Recall, Pleasant Company and Children’s List. He does not plan to run his other entrants, Rathvinden and Acapella Bourgeois. He will also bring his Arkle winner, Footpad, over for a novice chase at Aintree’s three-day meeting, while Yorkhill may be tried in the Aintree Hurdle. Mullins does not expect to run much at Aintree beyond those, having his eyes trained on targets closer to home. Pairofbrowneyes, an early faller in the Irish National, is expected to skip next week’s Topham Chase in favour of a race at Punchestown later in the month. Mullins is in great danger of losing the title of reigning champion trainer, since Gordon Elliott leads him by €500,000 with less than a month left in the season. “We’re up against it but still we keep going for the time being,” Mullins said. “There’s a lot of prize money to come, a big festival at Punchestown. Who knows what’ll happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/03/national-parks-entrance-fees-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T17:24:21Z","webTitle":"National parks to rethink plan to hike entrance fees after widespread anger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/03/national-parks-entrance-fees-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/03/national-parks-entrance-fees-plan","fields":{"headline":"National parks to rethink plan to hike entrance fees after widespread anger","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Department of the Interior said on Tuesday that it planned to revise a controversial proposal to drastically increase entrance fees at some of the most popular national parks in the country. The interior department press secretary, Heather Swift, said the Trump administration decided to rethink its proposal after Americans flooded the National Park Service (NPS) with more than 100,000 comments, many of them sharply critical of the proposed surge pricing scheme. In October, the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, announced a plan to hike entrance fees as high as $70 at 17 different parks – including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone and Glacier – during peak visitation season. Zinke justified the fee increase as a way to raise revenue and help the NPS tackle its roughly $12bn deferred maintenance backlog. “During the public comment period, the National Park Service received more than 109,000 comments on the original peak-season fee proposal,” Swift wrote in an email. “We’ve taken the public’s suggestions seriously and have amended the plan to reflect those.” Swift would not comment on the details of the changes under consideration, writing that the plan was “still being reviewed and not yet finalized”. The Washington Post, which first reported the story on Monday, said there was fear inside the interior department that a steep fee increase might cause visitation to drop. “It seems to be par for the course at the interior department to shoot first and ask questions later,” says Aaron Weiss, media director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation organization based in Colorado. “We are glad that interior is realizing what a terrible idea it would be to hike entrance fees by that amount. It would hurt American families and have a harmful effect on overall attendance at national parks.” Prominent public interest organizations and conservation groups, including the National Parks Conservation Association, the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club, staunchly opposed the proposed fee increase. Last November, meanwhile, a bipartisan group of attorneys general from 10 different states and the District of Columbia wrote a letter to the NPS denouncing the idea. “We cannot let the most popular and awe-inspiring national parks become places for the wealthy,” they wrote. “As Americans, we are all public landowners.” Many Americans shared that sentiment and in public comments urged the interior department to forgo the fee increase. “So the NPS would **more than DOUBLE** the current entry fee for peak season?” argued one such commenter. “Is this intended to drive down total visitorship?” “I am opposed to the fee increases for park fee entrance,” wrote another. “I raised my son as a single mother and set money aside to take him camping/visiting in our National Parks. The fees that you suggest would have hindered our visits.” The National Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA, conducted a statistical analysis of the public comments and said it found that approximately 98% were opposed to the fee increase. “Americans did not like this ill-conceived proposal from the administration and they spoke out,” says Emily Douce, the NPCA’s director of budget and appropriations. Democrats on Capitol Hill, for their part, hailed the interior department’s change of heart on Tuesday. “The people have made their voices heard and the Trump administration seems to be listening,” said Raúl Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House natural resources committee. “It was completely ludicrous to propose that the American people should have to pay higher entrance fees at our top national parks all so that the Trump White House could make big cuts to the park service’s budget. The good news is that we now have confirmation that the majority of people agree with us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/03/poetic-gifts-from-russia-with-love","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T17:17:30Z","webTitle":"Poetic gifts from Russia, with love | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/poetic-gifts-from-russia-with-love","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/03/poetic-gifts-from-russia-with-love","fields":{"headline":"Poetic gifts from Russia, with love","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In these frenzied and troubled times a wonderful event, much more than an event, took place at the residence of the Russian ambassador on Saturday evening: Anastasia Kuznetsova, singer, songwriter and translator daughter of Joseph Brodsky, performed songs “From those who haven’t forgotten me”, a perfect combination of her own settings and poems from her father and, among others, a beautiful Hebrew song.

The six bodies found in the grave were of people arrested several days earlier by the military, residents of the village of Dogo told the human rights group. Searching for the missing group, villagers said they discovered thee bodies buried and blindfolded. Sixty-five people have died in bombings since the beginning of the year and the increasing number of attacks by armed groups, including Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin’ (JNIM), have left over 200,000 children out of education as schools have closed. The current period of violence in Mali has emerged partly as a result of the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi in neighbouring Libya in 2011. Seasoned Tuareg fighters returned to Mali, along with seized Libyan arms and equipment. The Tuareg uprising in 2012 was then used by extremists as an opportunity to take over towns and impose sharia law. Although the Malian military, backed by France, routed jihadists from towns in 2013, the state still has no control over parts of central and northern Mali. A presidential election is planned for July, though it is unclear how the government expects to organise this amid the growing insecurity. Hopes are high for the new military force, the G5 Sahel, a joint effort involving troops from Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Chad which is funded mostly by Saudi Arabia and the European Union. But those countries are each grappling with problems that will make building an effective regional force challenging, especially when the area it covers is enormous and lacks infrastructure. Operation Barkhane, a regional counter-terrorism force made up of several thousand well-trained French troops based in the Sahel, has struggled. Meanwhile, the region’s UN peacekeeping mission, known as the world’s most dangerous, is limited in terms of the terrain it can control. In Timbuktu, peacekeepers patrol the streets, maintaining enough calm that occasional concerts can be staged – as long as they finish in time for the evening curfew. But outside the city, armed groups come and go as they please. On Wednesday, a man suspected of war crimes in Timbuktu is scheduled to appear before the international criminal court at The Hague, after Malian authorities surrendered him at the weekend. Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud was allegedly the Islamic police chief of the JNIM’s predecessor Ansar Dine when the jihadist group occupied the ancient Malian city in 2012. Al Hassan is accused of destroying Timbuktu’s ancient mausoleums, but also of torture and sexual slavery. It is unclear why he could not have been tried in Mali. The 2016 conviction of Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi for destroying cultural heritage was hailed as historic and precedent-setting, but the ICC was also criticised for focusing on him, rather than jihadists who had meted out cruel punishments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-04T09:30:20Z","webTitle":"Liverpool v Manchester City: where Champions League tie could be won or lost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool v Manchester City: where Champions League tie could be won or lost","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liverpool 1) The success of Klopp’s press Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool’s pressing game in the second half of January’s 4-3 defeat of City was “on a different planet”. He is likely to request a repeat given the multitude of problems it caused Pep Guardiola’s team in what remains their only Premier League defeat this season. Liverpool’s full press created several openings and goals that day – Sadio Mané struck a post after another forced error with the game at 2-1 – and Klopp is unlikely to change tactics as he seeks a seventh win in 13 against Guardiola. “You have no alternative if you want to beat City,” said Klopp, who has beaten his counterpart more than any other manager. “You could sit deep in your box and hope nothing happens but we are Liverpool and we should try to win this way.” 2) City’s problems at left-back whet the appetite of Salah With Benjamin Mendy and Fabian Delph sidelined, and Danilo unconvincing, it was Aymeric Laporte’s turn to occupy the left-back spot against Everton on Saturday as Guardiola switched the world’s second-most expensive defender out wide. Even in a comprehensive away win that position remained City’s one concern, with Everton occasionally getting in behind the former Athletic Bilbao centre-half, and the outstanding Mohamed Salah poses far greater danger. Salah has scored in each of his last seven starts at Anfield – a sequence of 12 goals in total – and has regularly dismantled established full-backs throughout a season that has brought 41 goals in 46 appearances for club and country. Liverpool are strongest in attack while City are weakest in defence and the Egypt international shows no sign of slowing down. 3) Liverpool’s threat at set pieces When discussing what makes Liverpool an “extraordinary team” following the win at Everton, Pep Guardiola cited the “almost unstoppable” front three of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain running through the middle plus the aerial threat of Virgil van Dijk. The latter was praised with good reason. Van Dijk missed the 4-3 win with a tight hamstring and has helped Liverpool record five clean sheets in their last eight matches but it is his ability to dominate at set pieces that will worry a City team that is not exactly blessed with height. The £75m defender has scored only once for his new club, a late set-piece winner on his debut against Everton in the FA Cup, but alongside Dejan Lovren he offers Liverpool another way to punish the Premier League champions-elect. Andy Hunter Manchester City 1) Ederson key to City attacks Forget whether the Brazilian performs the goalkeeper’s bread-and-butter of keeping the ball out of the net. Instead, the 24-year-old’s X-factor in this City side is as its first point of attack and the astute choices he makes between short and long balls. If his radar is on – as it usually is – Liverpool could concede in a flash, as was illustrated at Everton on Saturday. After Yannick Bolasie missed a headed chance in the first half, Ederson drove a pinpoint pass to Leroy Sané, who pirouetted in the centre circle before finding Kevin De Bruyne. His cross was headed home by Gabriel Jesus and suddenly City were 2-0 up. 2) De Bruyne and Silva to pull the strings (yet again) Strangely for Guardiola, David Silva was an unused substitute when City came out on the wrong end of that remarkable Anfield match in January. The manager will surely not make the same mistake again, because when the Spaniard and Kevin De Bruyne are in tandem the pair define “unstoppable”. The latter has been so formidable he has a real chance of vying with Silva as City’s best-ever footballer, should his form continue over coming seasons, as well as being a strong contender for the 2017-18 Premier League player of the season. Both find space and time most are unaware of, with Silva’s more subtle sorcery complemented by De Bruyne’s greater directness. 3) Jesus to prove star quality? Sergio Agüero’s injury absence may have saved Guardiola having to drop his 30-goal man because, despite the impressive return, he still fails to enjoy the full confidence of his manager. Jesus’s goal at Everton was timely, then, as it was only his second since mid-November. The Catalan believes City play a fraction more quickly and on the turn with the Brazilian, rather than Agüero, heading the team, which against Liverpool will be just what Guardiola wants. For Jesus this is a golden chance: it constitutes his biggest game yet for City and presents an opportunity to show he can carry the attack when it really matters.

Transparency","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Piecing together how Russian trolls have been using social media to disrupt authentic electoral democracies is a slow and disjointed business. But, little by little, help is available to try to understand what has been happening. Societies that value the many purposes of public debate cannot be passive about this potent threat to their information health. Assisted by data analysts, I have been looking into the vast data lake that forms under the Guardian’s international journalism, and into which flow comments from audiences worldwide. It is a modest effort to chart how far, in 2016-17 in particular, Russian trolls infected the Guardian and its online debate forums. The results are heartening, in the sense that they indicate a relative lack of impact – which is in part a credit to the mostly unsung work of the moderators of comment threads. Sifting 47m comments received since late 2015, the analysts looked into the impact of a set of 55 companies, individual names (real and fake), Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and email accounts, and Twitter hashtags, which was gleaned from an indictment made public by US special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Bear in mind that an identified account or hashtag may not be Russian-made; it may be genuine, but its sentiments chime sufficiently with trolls’ aims for them to boost it. Coupled with other data about confirmed Russian activity, the material provides more evidence of how the Russians went about supporting Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton as Democratic candidate, and Donald Trump over Clinton for president. Among 111 appearances in Guardian comment threads by Mueller-identified entities, the Twitter hashtag HillaryForPrison cropped up most, 53 times, followed by the hashtag TrumpTrain, 25 times. The data has to be interpreted with care, but early impressions are that the trolls seemed to cluster most around comments alleging criminality or warmongering by Clinton. One commenter, who appeared in Guardian threads between March and December 2016, seemed to promote a particular hashtag in comments posted in quick succession. One aim appears to be to leverage a large media organisation’s online forums to spread exposure to hashtags, and also to other social media presences where there is less moderation, more extreme material, or both. Trump’s current travails with Mueller permit a thin smile at the irony of this comment that cites the HillaryForPrison hashtag: “Hopefully Hillary will be indicted by the FBI and DOJ.” The New York Times has used the indictment disclosures to chart the Russians’ manipulation of the Trump campaign via Facebook; the Daily Beast has reported that trolls also used Reddit and Tumblr; and NBC News has done substantial work to analyse the effects of troll Twitter accounts, including the ways they were unknowingly amplified by celebrities. At least 1,062 more impugned Twitter accounts are yet to be released by the intelligence committee of the US House of Representatives, which disclosed 2,752 last November. One of the great advantages of democratic systems over authoritarian ones is the democracies’ ability – through techniques such as independent journalism, public inquiries and litigation in independent courts – to detect, expose, learn lessons and make necessary change for the better.The bigger the dataset examined, the greater the collaboration among the organisations’ technical experts, and the more useful these exercises could be to professional journalism and the public. The most telling patterns are more likely to emerge through large-scale retrospective analysis of what took place and when. If journalism institutions do more of this kind of work and prudently share their findings, their audiences become more aware of tactics that can distort elections. The effort dovetails with a fundamental aim of journalism over the centuries – a better informed electorate. • Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s readers’ editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14957","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T23:00:03Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,957","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14957","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14957","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,957","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/02/relative-of-priest-accused-of-abuse-seeks-headstones-removal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T12:51:24Z","webTitle":"Relative of priest accused of abuse seeks headstone's removal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/02/relative-of-priest-accused-of-abuse-seeks-headstones-removal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/02/relative-of-priest-accused-of-abuse-seeks-headstones-removal","fields":{"headline":"Relative of priest accused of abuse seeks headstone's removal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The next of kin of a senior Catholic priest who was accused of sexual abuse before his death wants the headstone she paid for to be removed and destroyed. Deirdre McCormack said she was “outraged and disgusted” at the allegations made by an Oxford academic against Canon Dermod Fogarty, and said the church had tried to sweep the disclosures “under the carpet”. She is seeking the urgent removal of the headstone. The allegations were made by Stephen Bernard in an acclaimed book, Paper Cuts, published in February, which details more than 300 assaults over a four-year period starting in 1987 when Bernard was 11. The disclosures came as a shock to McCormack, who was Fogarty’s closest living relative and inherited his personal effects. Bernard reported his alleged abuse to the diocese of Arundel and Brighton, where Fogarty was based, in September 2012. The case was not passed on to the police and McCormack was not informed. A month later Fogarty died at the age of 92. He was given a lavish funeral, attended by the then leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor, and at least 80 priests. Murphy O’Connor, who died last year, told the congregation that Fogarty “had fulfilled what every priest has to do – to teach and preach the faith from Jesus Christ, and that he did admirably with knowledge and with care”. As next of kin, McCormack had Fogarty’s ashes interred at St John’s seminary at Wonersh in Surrey. She commissioned and paid for a headstone with the words: “A wise priest much loved by his family and all who knew him.” But since reading Bernard’s book, McCormack – who was also abused by a priest when she was a child – has demanded the removal and destruction of the headstone. Fogarty “misused his power and position of trust as a priest, and a very highly respected one, in a most appalling way”, she said. She believed that “information was withheld from me over the period of Fogarty’s death and funeral and so I became unknowingly complicit with the diocese’s decision to sweep Stephen’s disclosure under the carpet”. She said: “I find their treatment of him very shocking, and a pattern of events we see far too frequently in the way the church responds to survivors.” In an email to the rector of St John’s seminary demanding the removal of the headstone, she wrote: “My hope is that this action might provide Stephen with some sense that justice is finally being done, and that may help him to move on with his life, secure in the knowledge that both Canon Fogarty’s family and the church, having learnt the wrongs Canon Fogarty perpetrated, fully acknowledge them and want to do whatever is in our power to support Stephen and ease his suffering.” McCormack is due to meet Richard Moth, the bishop of Arundel and Brighton, next week to discuss the matter. The diocese confirmed it had received Bernard’s allegation of abuse on 6 September 2012 and had “responded in accordance with the church’s national procedures”. A member of the diocesan safeguarding team met Bernard four days later but “the matter was not referred to the police or to any third parties in 2012”. It said: “At the time the allegations were made Canon Dermod Fogarty was seriously ill and shortly afterwards died so it was not possible to put the allegations to him and for him to respond to them.” Bernard, who reported his claims to the police in 2015, said he had nothing to add to the disclosures in his book."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/02/fears-for-asylum-seekers-as-nauru-moves-to-cut-ties-to-australias-high-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T19:00:05Z","webTitle":"Fears for asylum seekers as Nauru moves to cut ties to Australia's high court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/02/fears-for-asylum-seekers-as-nauru-moves-to-cut-ties-to-australias-high-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/02/fears-for-asylum-seekers-as-nauru-moves-to-cut-ties-to-australias-high-court","fields":{"headline":"Fears for asylum seekers as Nauru moves to cut ties to Australia's high court","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nauru has severed a long-standing arrangement to allow appeals to the high court of Australia, impacting on the rights of asylum seekers to challenge the refusal of refugee status. The high court is the final appellate court for Nauru, under an agreement between the two countries that has been in place since 1976. It can be terminated by either government with 90 days notice. Matthew Batsiua, a former justice minister of Nauru who is one of 19 people charged over protests outside Nauru parliament in 2015, said the Nauru solicitor general Jay Udit told his lawyers on Friday that the Nauru government had given such notice in January or December. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that Australia was notified of the termination on 12 December, meaning the 90 day period concluded on 12 March. “Nauru’s termination of the treaty is unilateral, as provided for by the terms of the treaty,” a spokeswoman said. “Australia supports Nauru’s sovereignty and its decision to terminate the treaty.” Severing access to the high court would have a significant impact on the rights of asylum seekers held in detention on Nauru at the behest of the Australian government, the human rights lawyer George Newhouse said. Of the 16 appeals decided by the high court under the arrangement since 1976, 11 have concerned asylum seekers disputing the refusal of their refugee status. Of those, eight were allowed and two were dropped because refugee status had been granted in the mean time. Only one was dismissed. “We are sending asylum seekers to an island prison where they have virtually no rights if rights of appeal to the high court are taken away,” Newhouse said. “Everybody should be concerned if important legal rights are being taken away from vulnerable asylum seekers and Nauruan citizens in secret.” Batsiua said he believed the decision had been made in response to the high court in October upholding an appeal by three of the so-called Nauru 19 against a bid by the Nauru government to increase the length of their prison sentences. The three men were re-sentenced to longer prison terms by the Nauru supreme court on Thursday, and again stated their intention to appeal to the high court. “This step by the Nauruan government to cut the link with the high court of Australia before an alternative is in place could leave not just us, but all Nauruan citizens and the asylum seekers here without any avenue of appeal from decisions made in the supreme court,” Batsiua said. “One of the avenues that we have been using is appealing to the high court of Australia for certain decisions that have gone against us, and we have had some success with that. So we believe the government is reacting to those situations and they are trying to shut off those avenues.” The Nauru president, Baron Waqa, spoke about the proposed change last month, telling parliament that establishing a court of final appeal on Nauruan soil was an “affirmation of Nauru’s sovereignty, independence, and maturity as a nation”. “Severance of ties to Australia’s highest court is a logical step towards full nationhood and an expression of confidence in Nauru’s ability to determine its own destiny,” he said. Waqa said the change would be made as part of the constitutional amendment bill 2018, but Batsiua said that was not due to be debated by parliament until late April. Newhouse called on the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, to address the issue, calling it a “constitutional crisis”. The Melbourne University law professor Jeremy Gans wrote in an analysis last month that the number of appeals from Nauru had jumped from five between 1976 and 2016 to 13 in 2017. About 1,000 asylum seekers, including children, remain detained on Nauru in conditions the United Nations has warned are “devastating” to their mental health."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/31/anthony-joshua-beats-joseph-parker-on-points-in-heavyweight-unification","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T23:02:51Z","webTitle":"Anthony Joshua beats Joseph Parker on points in heavyweight unification","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/31/anthony-joshua-beats-joseph-parker-on-points-in-heavyweight-unification","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/31/anthony-joshua-beats-joseph-parker-on-points-in-heavyweight-unification","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Joshua beats Joseph Parker on points in heavyweight unification","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Anthony Joshua, taken the distance for the first time in 21 paid bouts, collected a third world title belt when he cruised to a convincing if drama-free win over the WBO champion, Joseph Parker, and looks in good shape to raise his game for what will be a more demanding assignment against Deontay Wilder. Two of the judges saw it 118-110, and the third had it 119-109 – a bit harsh on the New Zealander, who might have had a share of the sixth and a shout of stealing the seventh in a fleeting period of success. But the verdict was, overall, fair. It was a technical fight, a clinical victory. As Joshua said in the ring: “I was always going to stick behind the jab, one of the most important weapons in boxing, and kept the right hand up. This is boxing. It’s what we do. Forget the hype. Joseph Parker is a good world champion. As I said before, this would be about boxing. The main thing now is I am the unified heavyweight champion of the world.” And as for Wilder? “Let’s go baby, let’s go!” Joshua said. “And we’ll do it in London.” There is a rematch clause, which will have to be firmed up if Parker is to get his wish to “have another go”. After a 25-minute preamble – from ring walks to three national anthems and Michael Buffer’s stentorian lead-in –the Samoan-New Zealander and Watford’s most famous fighting son finally got down to some rumbling. Both looked nervous – as they should do; at stake were Joshua’s WBA and IBF titles and the WBO belt that Parker brought to the negotiations, as well as the prospect of mega-fights up the road against Wilder and, perhaps, Tyson Fury. The referee, Giuseppe Quarterone, was controlling his first full world title fight. This was also the first world heavyweight title fight in this country between two unbeaten champions, a distinction that speaks to the chaos in the sport as much as the excellence of the combatants. All distractions were set aside when the fighters let the punches go. Joshua, 12lb lighter than in his last defence at 17st 4lb, still outweighed Parker by nearly a stone, and the visitor kept his distance in the early sounding out. Remarkably, this was his first outing since surgery in early December on both elbows; that, surely, generated unwanted uncertainty. Joshua was in the shape of his life. The British fighter, buoyed by the support of 80,000 fans in his third consecutive stadium fight (it was Parker’s first), stalked his man methodically, wary of a countering right that has kept the New Zealander unbeaten. He is heavy-handed and busy rather than devastating, but Joshua was taking no risks. The Joshua jab dictated the pace and intensity of the fight, and blood seeped from Parker’s bottom lip. A short uppercut stunned him in a clinch in round three, the first inkling of vulnerability. Parker had never experienced such quality pressure in 24 fights and Joshua sensed it as he widened his lead. The Parker camp, led by his experienced trainer, Kevin Barry, urged more aggression at the start of the fourth, but his boxing was not good enough to get him into range, and Joshua, whose own skill set improves by the fight, punished his occasional charges. Frustration and concern spread on Parker’s face, which was starting to swell around the eyes. His main avenue back into the contest was to turn a boxing match into a brawl. He tried in the fifth and sixth, but was soon on the back foot again. Comfortably in control at the halfway stage, Joshua had only to stay focused to become a three-belt champion. Parker’s chin has always been sound but was trusting it to a dangerous degree. The choice for Joshua was to try for a finish or to manage the more frequent assaults of his anxious but determined opponent. So he waited and watched for awhile, perhaps giving up the seventh. With five rounds left, Parker suspected he probably needed a knockout. The danger was he would lose concentration and Joshua capitalised on his anxiety with a solid eighth. Joshua ran to centre-ring at the start of the ninth but remained watchful and cautious – and just a little annoyed with Parker’s indiscriminate use of the head. Even when he shook Parker, Joshua remained conscious of the threat of retaliation, respectful all the way to the end. Parker, bleeding slightly around the left eye, had some success switching to the body, but not enough to change the course of the contest. A short left hook that would have floored most fighters,rocked Parker’s head back in the penultimate round, but he was still there when the bell went. The final round was a microcosm of the 11 that had gone before, with Parker’s solid chin absorbing Joshua’s power. But the gap was as wide at the end as it was at the beginning. And, despite the few niggles they had during an engaging rather than exciting fight, they embraced at the end, as we knew they would. Alexander Povetkin, Joshua’s WBA mandatory challenger, is firmly in the frame to challenge again for the title he once held for two years, after destroying Liverpool’s David Price with quite stunning two-punch knockout in the fifth round of their undercard eliminator. At 38, he remains a dangerous item. At 34, Price should seriously consider retirement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/03/how-villanova-learned-to-win-against-college-basketballs-nba-talent-machines","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T12:15:56Z","webTitle":"How Villanova learned to beat college basketball's NBA talent factories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/03/how-villanova-learned-to-win-against-college-basketballs-nba-talent-machines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/03/how-villanova-learned-to-win-against-college-basketballs-nba-talent-machines","fields":{"headline":"How Villanova learned to beat college basketball's NBA talent factories","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The NCAA Tournament that featured the first-ever victory by a 16-seed and a run to the Final Four by Loyola-Chicago and 98-year-old nun Sister Jean fittingly had an underdog story even in a title game won by the heavily-favored Villanova Wildcats. Michigan led for most of the first half, but Villanova took the lead with 6:08 remaining before the break on a three-pointer by redshirt sophomore reserve Donte DiVincenzo. It was the second of five three-pointers DiVincenzo would hit on the night on the way to a career-high 31 points. Villanova would not trail again in the game and cruised to their second national championship in three years, 79-62. “Even if we had played our best, it would have been very difficult to win that game with what DiVincenzo did,” Michigan head coach John Beilein said after the game. “Sometimes those individual performances just beat you, and you just say: ‘OK, we played you the best we could, and tonight you were better that us.’” DiVincenzo wasn’t just better than Michigan on Monday night, he was better than any other bench player in Final Four championship game history. His 31 points are a record and earned him tournament Most Outstanding Player honors. And while Beilein’s Wolverines did not play their best – Michigan shot 3-for-23 from three, for example – they were successful in corralling Villanova’s two top scorers. Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson combined for 28 points in the title game, nine below their season average, and Bridges was the only other Wildcats player after DiVincenzo in double figures. It’s that ability to spread the floor and find other scoring options that’s been a feature of the Wildcats since Jay Wright took over in 2001 and began building the nation’s best college basketball program. Sitting side-by-side in the crowd at the Alamodome on Monday night were Ed Pinckney and Kyle Lowry, Villanova basketball royalty. Pinckney the star of the 1985 Wildcats team that upset Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in the national title game and Lowry, now of the Toronto Raptors, one of the top players on the first great team of the Wright era. Any other blue blood college basketball program – and Villanova are decidedly one now – would feature an entire section dotted with recognizable professional stars. Consider the NBA rolls of Duke, North Carolina and Kentucky, for example. But Wright’s Wildcats, despite winning 20 or more games in 13 of the past 14 seasons and finishing in the top six of the polls in each of the last five seasons, have just five players in the NBA: Lowry, Ryan Arcidiacono, Dante Cunningham, Josh Hart and Darrun Hilliard. Forget being stars, Lowry is the only NBA starter among them. None of that discredits the Villanova program. On the contrary, in the era of one-and-done, Wright has figured out not just how to compete with programs that churn out NBA lottery talent, but consistently beat them. He’s done it by mirroring the model of the NBA’s top team: the Golden State Warriors. The Wildcats spread the floor, lean on depth, efficiency and versatile players, eschew having a traditional big man underneath and let it fly from three. They let it fly from three a lot. A lot a lot. Historically so. Villanova’s 464 three-pointers on the season are the most in college basketball history. The 77 threes they made in this year’s tournament is a record. And the 18 they hit in the national semi-final against Kansas is a Final Four record. Wright said this weekend that his biggest influence is not today’s Warriors, but the up-tempo offense run by Mike D’Antoni with the Suns in the mid-2000s. “Yeah, the NBA influences all of us in college,” Wright said this weekend. “We all watch the best players, the best coaches and see what we can learn. And the Golden State Warriors have been using this style for a while now. Mike D’Antoni ... when he was with the Suns, we all watched it.” Wherever the inspiration came from, Wright is now the inspiration for every other college coach in the country. He joins Mike Krzyzewski and Roy Williams as the only other active coaches with multiple national titles and Bill Self as just the second coach in Division I history with 30-win seasons four years in a row. Vegas sportsbooks have already released the odds for the 2019 men’s college basketball national champion and Villanova – despite those four straight 30-win seasons and the two titles in three years – are not the favorites. It’s Duke. But the Wildcats will return with the bulk of their roster, with only Brunson likely to bolt for the draft and grow Villanova’s NBA ranks to six. The Wildcats will roll out another deep, skilled team that bombs away from three and could very well win Wright’s third title next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/02/stop-jeremy-corbyns-trial-by-media-over-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T17:05:16Z","webTitle":"Stop Jeremy Corbyn’s mistrial by media over antisemitism | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/02/stop-jeremy-corbyns-trial-by-media-over-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/02/stop-jeremy-corbyns-trial-by-media-over-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Stop Jeremy Corbyn’s trial by media over antisemitism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the main concepts in journalism education is that of framing: the highlighting of particular issues, and the avoidance of others, in order to produce a desired interpretation. We have been reminded of the importance of framing when considering the vast amounts of media coverage of Jeremy Corbyn’s alleged failure to deal with antisemitism inside the Labour party. On Sunday, three national titles led with the story while news bulletins focused on the allegations all last week. Dominant sections of the media have framed the story in such a way as to suggest that antisemitism is a problem mostly to do with Labour and that Corbyn is personally responsible for failing to deal with it. The coverage has relied on a handful of sources such as the Board of Deputies, the Jewish Leadership Council and well-known political opponents of Corbyn himself. Yet where are the Jewish voices who support Corbyn and who welcome his long-established anti-racist record? Where are the pieces that look at the political motivations of some of Corbyn’s most vocal critics? Where is the fuss in your news columns about the rising tide of antisemitism in Europe, such as in Hungary, where the Fidesz government has used antisemitic tropes to bolster its support, or in Poland, where the government is attempting to criminalise revelations about the country’s antisemitic past? Where are the columns condemning the links between Conservative MEPs and rightwing parties across Europe in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group which trade on antisemitism? It is not “whataboutery” to suggest that the debate on antisemitism has been framed in such a way as to mystify the real sources of anti-Jewish bigotry and instead to weaponise it against a single political figure just ahead of important elections. We condemn antisemitism wherever it exists. We also condemn journalism that so blatantly lacks context, perspective and a meaningful range of voices in its determination to condemn Jeremy Corbyn.

Earlier this month CNN broke the news that anchors at Sinclair, the largest local news network with close to 200 television stations across the country, had been told to read a script attacking “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country”. The script warns about fake news and claims: “Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control ‘exactly what people think’ … This is extremely dangerous to a democracy.” A video compilation of those speeches created by Deadspin went viral over the weekend, prompting Trump to tweet on Monday: “So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.” A copy of the Sinclair speech was published last week by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, which reported that employees at local news station, KOMO, said the segments had not affected their local coverage. Sinclair journalists leaked details of their contracts on Monday and said they faced fines if they quit while under contract. Chaired by David Smith, a low-profile multi-millionaire with close ties to the Trump administration, Sinclair is the US’s largest broadcaster and reached about 38% of US households. It is currently attempting to take over Tribune Media, a $3.9bn deal that would add another 42 cities to its portfolio but which has hit a roadblock with regulators in Washington. Sinclair did not immediately return calls for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T15:00:01Z","webTitle":"Wild Wild Country review – Netflix’s take on the cult that threatened American life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life","fields":{"headline":"Wild Wild Country review – Netflix’s take on the cult that threatened American life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At the start of the first episode of Wild Wild Country (Netflix), John Silvertooth is remembering how it all began, back in 1981. John, now a smiley old dude with a moustache and dungarees, was the mayor of Antelope. Sounds like a big deal, but the population of Antelope, in Wasco County, Oregon, was about 40, most of whom had probably been mayor at some point. Anyway, John was walking to the post office and he ran into a man – not an American, John could tell from the shoes – standing in the middle of the street. “They’re coming,” the man told John. And they did. Who came? Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, from India. The great guru, spiritual teacher and mystic. Or the dangerous cult leader, master criminal and terrorist, depending on which side you were on. Or maybe simply a hippy with a long, wispy beard, a collection of dodgy outfits and a penchant for Rolls-Royces. Along with Rajneesh came several thousand of his followers, including Ma Anand Sheela, his personal secretary, lieutenant and mastermind of most of what went on at Rajneeshpuram, which is what the land formerly known as the Big Muddy Ranch became. What did go on? Ha – what didn’t go on, more like. It wasn’t just about a bunch of blissed-out, brainwashed hippies waving their arms in the air and shagging whomever they fancied, whenever and wherever, while their neighbours – the God-fearing folks of Antelope – cursed them and waved their stars and stripes from over the fence. There is more to this story than that. You want fear and loathing, paranoia and megalomania? You got it, baby, big time. Plus attempted murder, biological warfare, an arms race, automatic weaponry, bombs, Learjets, the FBI, the National Guard, espionage, drugs, the biggest immigration fraud case in US history, wire-tapping, a sad subplot involving 6,000 homeless people, Hollywood glitz, Nike, the US constitution getting waved about by various people. Look hard and you might even see parallels with more recent events: electoral manipulation; a poison terror attack on a small town (people know whodunnit, but where is the evidence?). And don’t forgot the beaver in a blender. It doesn’t matter how well you know the Rajneeshpuram story – you won’t have seen or heard it told as thoroughly as this. There are extensive interviews, most notably with Sheela, now out of jail (for attempted murder and assault) and living in Switzerland, where she works in a nursing home. I am not sure I would want any relative of mine going there. If this is anyone’s story, it is Sheela’s: obsession personified. Also interviewed: Antelope residents (including Silvertooth), followers of Rajneesh, attorneys for both sides, attorney generals, politicians and investigative journalists. The interviews are interwoven with archive footage from inside and outside Rajneeshpuram and news coverage from the time – anchors with 80s hair unable to hide their excitement at the story of the sex cult that threatened the American way of life. Plus, when there is nothing else to go with visually, they opt for illustrations that look a bit like court drawings. Odd, but better than lame reconstructions. It is beautifully constructed and balanced, since it alternates between the two camps. Yes, Rajneesh’s followers were dangerously obsessed, but they did build a functioning city very quickly in the middle of nowhere. The authorities who went after them don’t come over as angels, either: suspicious and self-righteous, they twisted the rules to get the Rajneeshees out. You might think six one-hour-plus episodes is a lot. Not too much, though. In fact, I still had further questions. Wild Wild Country barely touches on what Rajneesh believed and taught: he wanted to raise the consciousness of humanity, for everyone to see who they really were … actually, I am not too fussed about that; the new agers can get a book about it. But I wanted to know about more about life at Rajneeshpuram, for the children, for example. And about the finances: how much did it cost to build the airport, buy the Learjets and all the Rollers? Also about some of the other characters, such as Puja, the nurse and poisoner-in-chief (and possibly beaver-blender). Hey, it is still an exhaustive and utterly absorbing piece of work by brothers Maclain and Chapman Way. Scary for non-Netflix documentary makers, too. As Silvertooth and the other residents of Antelope did on seeing the hordes showing up in their funny shoes, they will look at the ambition, scale and budget of Wild Wild Country and shake their heads, wondering what the hell they can do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/hunger-games-narendra-modi-tit-for-tat-fast-opposition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T10:34:32Z","webTitle":"Hunger games: Modi to lead tit-for-tat fast in row with opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/hunger-games-narendra-modi-tit-for-tat-fast-opposition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/hunger-games-narendra-modi-tit-for-tat-fast-opposition","fields":{"headline":"Hunger games: Modi to lead tit-for-tat fast in row with opposition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, will lead a daylong fast on Thursday in a tit-for-tat protest against the opposition, whose leaders were caught feasting moments before they launched their own hunger strike. The rival protests are part of growing showdown between Modi’s ruling nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) and the Congress party before national elections. Both sides have faced social media ridicule over their fasts. Congress organised a five-hour hunger strike on Monday in a pre-emptive move against a BJP plan for a fast on Thursday. But the party was left embarrassed after photos circulated on social media showing senior leaders tucking into chickpeas and fried roti shortly before the fast. Congress faced sarcastic comments on Twitter, while the BJP called their protest a “joke”. With Modi poised to lead Thursday’s protest, the BJP has reportedly issued strict rules to its lawmakers, including a ban on eating at public places or being photographed munching treats before Thursday. It is also shooing away street food vendors from the protest venue in New Delhi, according to the Mail Today daily. Congress has called the BJP’s plans “a farce of a fast”. The BJP has said it will reject food for a day to show anger at the disruption of parliamentary business by Congress. Parliament sessions are regularly suspended amid unruly shouting matches. Modi will fast to expose Congress’s “undemocratic style of functioning and pursuing divisive politics and [an] anti-development agenda”. A strictly observant Hindu and teetotal vegetarian, Modi fasts every year for the Navratri festival – a nine-day ritual when he consumes only liquids during daylight hours. In a 2012 blog, Modi called his annual fast an act of self-purification. Fasts in Indian politics were pioneered by Mahatma Gandhi as a moral weapon against the British empire as well as his compatriots. He also fasted as a means of penance when he felt he or the freedom movement had erred. The British regarded the high-profile fasts as political blackmail but feared riotous consequences if Gandhi were ever to die during one. The tradition continued after independence, and in 1952 the south Indian political activist Potti Sriramulu died after fasting for 58 days to campaign for the creation of the state of Andhra Pradesh. The activist Anna Hazare catalysed a national anti-corruption movement in 2011 by fasting in Delhi. Critics continue to argue the tactic is coercive and a form of blackmail at best, and often a cheap political stunt.

It is said to retain an “important place in the collective memory of the Belgian nation”. A series of events are being held in the Atomium, the futuristic landmark built for the spectacle, in recognition. Yet as the Belgian capital indulges in nostalgia, one exhibit staged at the time is not being revisited: a live display of black men, women and children in “native conditions” laid on for the education and amusement of white Europeans. It was the world’s last “human zoo”. As of 1958, Belgium still ruled Congo, a piece of territory some 80 times its own size, and a source of great pride to the country. The mineral-rich central African state was not only hugely economically rewarding but garlanded Belgium, a small European nation in the shadows of Britain and France, with standing in the world. Expo ’58 was seen by Belgian politicians as a chance to burnish this achievement, sealing what was seen as a special bond with Belgian Congo. At the foot of the Atomium, a rejoinder to Paris’s Eiffel Tower, and the centre piece of the exhibition, eight hectares of land peppered by seven pavilions were dedicated to the themes of mining in Congo, its arts, transport and agriculture, among others. It was known as the Kongorama. In its three hectares of tropical gardens, Congolese men, women and children were put on show day-after-day, in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence. Human zoos were in no way a novelty to the west and had been held regularly earlier in the century in London, Paris, Oslo and Hamburg. In New York in 1906, a young Congolese man with sharpened teeth was given a home in the monkey house in the Bronx zoo. In the summer of 1897, King Leopold II had imported 267 Congolese to Brussels to be on show around his colonial palace in Tervuren, east of Brussels, paddling in their canoes on the royal lakes; 1.3 million Belgians, out of a population of 4 million, visited, walking over a rope bridge to get the best view. That summer was bitterly cold and seven of the Congolese died of pneumonia and influenza, their bodies dumped in an unmarked mass grave in the local cemetery. But such was the popularity of the zoo and other exhibits that a permanent exhibition was to be later established at the site. Initially called the Museum of the Congo, it is now the Royal Museum for Central Africa. The 1958 exhibit was smaller in scale, but similar in content. A “typical” village was set up, where the Congolese spent their days carrying out their crafts by straw huts while they were mocked by the white men and women who stood at the edge. “If there was no reaction, they threw money or bananas over the closure of bamboo,” one journalist wrote at the time of the spectators. Another report told of people gossiping about “seeing the negros at the zoological gardens”. The Congolese on display were among 598 people – including 273 men, 128 women and 197 children, a total of 183 families – brought over from Africa to staff the wider fair. The colonial office was “very nervous about what this stay of such an unprecedented number of Congolese in Belgium might do”, according to Dr Sarah Van Beurden, a historian of central Africa. But housed in a dedicated building isolated from the Expo from which they could be bussed in and out, the Congolese complained of cramped accommodation, the strict limitations on visitors or excursions from the building, and, of course, daily abuse at the fair. By July, the Congolese artists and artisans, and their families, could take no more and some went back home. The human zoo, as the Congolese recognised it to be, closed down, and the rest of the fair carried on. Such a zoo was not to be staged anywhere again, and in June 1960, Congo won its independence. But for Guido Gryseels, the director general at the Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA), the permanent exhibition that grew from 1897, combating the prejudices that were at the core of the zoo and still, he says, persist, is the focus of his working life. On 1 December, following a €75m renovation, the RMCA will reopen five years after it last opened its doors to the public. There is a new visitors centre and a vast underground space that has doubled the museum’s exhibition area to 11,000 sq metres. But beyond the physical transformation, a much more significant change is about to be undertaken. When Gryseels took over the museum in 2001, the permanent exhibition had barely changed since the 1920s, he said. Along with Leopold II’s double L motifs looking down on visitors in almost every room, and the royal quotations celebrating the higher moral plane of the colonisation, the story that was told was of Belgium bringing light where there was darkness. “For 100 years we have been a colonial institution”, Gryseels said. “For most Belgians their first encounter with Africa is our museum. The initial impression of Africa by most Belgians was made here in this museum, and that is that the white person is better than the black person. We were there to civilise them. The Africans we portray here are naked with a spear without a culture of their own.” A reason for the inertia at the museum, he believes, is that in reality Belgian society has not wanted to rethink its colonial past. “It is very emotional here because every Belgian family has a family member who worked in Congo. All of them. A missionary, a teacher, an administrator. You ask any Belgian and they all have. So it is a very emotional debate.” Gryseels said discussions about the colonial past didn’t start in Belgium until the publication of the Adam Hochschild’s book King Leopold’s Ghost in 1998. “Bit by bit there was more discussion”, Gryseels said. “But, [the] curriculum in Belgian schools until recently was ‘we brought civilisation’.” There are some voices from the Congolese diaspora calling for the “decolonisation” of his institution, and its closure. But Gryseels says his job in the next nine months is to tell a new story about Belgium in the Congo. On the opening day, the minister of foreign affairs is expected to give a speech on Belgium’s colonial past in the presence of the royal family. “We have a responsibility for cultivating an attitude that a lot of Belgians have of being superior to black people”, Gryseels said. “And that is changing. But it is going to take a while.” •This article was amended on 17 April 2018.

It’s a violent rape-revenge tale that takes place in the sunbaked and sweeping plains of Sumba in eastern Indonesia, which Surya endows with the same stark quality that Sergio Leone gave Spain’s Tabernas Desert. Marlina (Marsha Timothy) is a widow; seven men from the local village arrive at her house intent on stealing her livestock and raping her. But Marlina has her fierce payback with poisonous berries and a machete that she has perhaps been keeping for just this eventuality. Her escape brings her into contact with the pregnant Novi (Dea Panendra) and these two women’s destinies entwine. This movie, with its four coolly conceived chapters, is well crafted and composed, a little like a Tarantino film – although it is the opposite of macho. Timothy brings a purposeful stillness to the role and gives weight to the drama, but I thought that the film was perhaps no more than the sum of its parts. One of Marlina’s chief tormentors, Markus (Egy Fedly) reappears in the drama as a headless ghost, and it is a disquieting moment – although it is not entirely clear what his effect on Marlina is. If it is a metaphorical haunting this is opaque, as Marlina does not feel guilty, and her intention to go to the matter to the police is a simple matter of reporting an entirely understandable act of self-defence. Eventually, the drama closes in on itself and attains the logic of a dream, though a dream that dissipates quickly on waking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/12/custody-review-the-screw-turns-in-understated-separation-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Custody review – the screw turns in understated separation drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/12/custody-review-the-screw-turns-in-understated-separation-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/12/custody-review-the-screw-turns-in-understated-separation-drama","fields":{"headline":"Custody review – the screw turns in understated separation drama","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s a unidirectional agony to this psychological drama from actor turned director Xavier Legrand – this is the much-talked-about festival prizewinner which Legrand developed from his 2013 short Avant Que De Tout Perdre, or Just Before Losing Everything. Legrand could have kept that title for his full-length feature version. It’s almost a story without a story, in that there is hardly any narrative progression as such, no phased revelation of character, no twist and counter-twist, and no point-of-view switches designed to raise queries about the truth. No: the focus is on one single horrible situation, getting steadily and unwatchably worse: a simmering pot of rage and toxic masculinity under which the gas-ring gets turned up and up. It concerns a divorce, and a legal hearing about custody. Denis Ménochet plays Antoine, a glowering, heavy-set guy who is in dispute with his ex-wife Miriam (Léa Drucker) about custody of their 11-year-old son Julien (Thomas Gioria). The couple have an elder daughter Joséphine (Mathilde Auneveux) who, being about to turn 18 and enter adulthood, does not form part of the case. The drama begins with a hearing in front of the judge (Saadia Bentaïeb) who must hear Miriam’s fears about Antoine’s violence and threats, although there is no clear legal evidence. The case is settled by the judge in a way that surprises both parties. Now Antoine is allowed access to Julien, but not allowed to know Miriam’s address, to interfere with their household arrangements – and he certainly has no say in the matter of Julien acquiring a new stepfather. With icy rage, Antoine decides he has a right to know everything that’s going on and begins to turn the screw on his innocent, terrified son. The performances are frighteningly good – and without these performances, in fact, the film would have been merely blank or histrionic. This especially applies to Gioria as the young son, and more than any actor in a film I can remember, he conveys what emotional and physical abuse is like. Julien’s scenes with Antoine have to be watched between your fingers. Legrand shows how simply getting into his dad’s car and being driven by him is an unspeakable ordeal; there is a clever moment when the seatbelt alarm keeps pinging because Julien has failed, to his dad’s irritation, to buckle up. Later, Antoine will be too enraged to do it himself and the pinging becomes an ominous alarm system for his state of mind. Meanwhile, other family tensions are orbiting. The film shows that a lot of Antoine’s macho rage and bullying derives from anger at his own father, Joël (Jean-Marie Winling). Miriam is also concerned that Joséphine’s education is about to be derailed by her possessive boyfriend, Samuel (Mathieu Saikaly), who seems charming enough – but Miriam knows how these things can turn out. And where are we going with all this? The temptation is to compare Custody with Asghar Farhadi’s modern classic A Separation. But they are quite different. Custody doesn’t have the subtlety or nuance of Farhadi’s film, nor is it quite like Joachim Lafosse’s divorce drama from 2016, L’Économie Du Couple, or After Love. There are moments in the original custody hearing here which hint that blame may not be straightforward. But actually, blame is pretty straightforward, and it is incidentally a flaw of this film that it sticks very predictably to Chekhov’s rule about what happens to a firearm which is produced in act one. The film it resembles much more is something like Claude Chabrol’s L’Enfer, or Hell, from 1994, about a married man who simply descends into the horror of fanatical jealousy and paranoia. There is not much storytelling light and shade in Custody, but it has the shock and swipe of real life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/11/shame-review-brudenell-social-club-leeds","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T11:02:58Z","webTitle":"Shame review – wet sweat and dry quips from seething post-punk kids","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/11/shame-review-brudenell-social-club-leeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/11/shame-review-brudenell-social-club-leeds","fields":{"headline":"Shame review – wet sweat and dry quips from seething post-punk kids","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shame come flying out of the traps. Rhythm guitarist Eddie Green twitches in his ill-fitting suit jacket as if he’s undergoing an invisible electrocution. Singer Charlie Steen shivers his body like a dog after a downpour. “We don’t tolerate any abuse, any oppression or discrimination,” he says, delivering his first mission statement as their latest audience becomes a seething melee. “Anyone doing any of that can fuck off now.” The electric shock of these first few minutes is a microcosm of a year in which they have emerged from the Brixton’s Queen’s Head pub scene to be hailed as “2018’s angriest, shoutiest young British guitar band”. But they do not disappoint thereafter. The frenetic, jerky post-punk energy recalls Fugazi and Leeds’s own Gang of Four; the intense rhythmic repetition suggests early Fall; and Steen’s gruffly intense vocals are reminiscent of Killing Joke’s Jaz Coleman. The 20-year-old makes a joke of their lack of originality – “This is one we ripped off from hundreds of other bands” – but obvious influences are spun into new and thrilling combinations. The soaring One Rizla finds the singer again defiantly addressing supposed limitations – “My voice ain’t the best you’ve heard / And you can choose to hate my words / But do I give a fuck?” The juxtaposition of his not conventionally palatable voice and sardonic, dirt-stained frustrations with lead guitarist Sean Coyle-Smith’s hurtling, tuneful riffs should be jarring, but is utterly hypnotic. The livewire singer peppers the gig with dry observations. “Remember, this is just entertainment, don’t take it seriously,” Steen quips. “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re just semi-semi-professionals,” he declares as songs from their debut album, Songs of Praise, make a mockery of such sarcastic self-deprecation. The Lick rejoices in “our sweet disorder”; Gold Hole creates audience mayhem.

She died at home in the South Shore area of Chicago, in the care of her siblings Mavis and Pervis Staples – all three sang in the group at various points, along with their late father Roebuck “Pops” Staples and late sister Cleotha Staples. The Staple Singers formed in 1948, and first released music in 1958. In these early days of the group, Yvonne helped with the band’s business matters, but graduated to a singing role after Pervis was drafted into the US army and Cleotha took time out to get married. From 1971, she performed with the group as they went from the socially conscious work of the 1960s to their most commercial period with Stax Records. Yvonne sang on hits including Respect Yourself, I’ll Take You There and Let’s Do It Again, the latter two reaching the top of the US charts. Yvonne went on to provide backing vocals for her sister Mavis after she began a successful solo career, and also worked as her manager. Mavis once credited Yvonne for restarting her career after the death of their father in 2000 left her depressed and unmotivated. “Yvonne said, ‘Mavis, your daddy would want you to keep singing. You’ve got to get up. You’re daddy’s legacy.’ … And that’s when she started with the other words: ‘Damn it, Mavis,’ and worse. It woke me up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/11/gabriela-ybarra-dinner-guest-grandfather-murder-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T14:51:30Z","webTitle":"Terror hits home: Gabriela Ybarra on the family stories behind her novel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/gabriela-ybarra-dinner-guest-grandfather-murder-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/11/gabriela-ybarra-dinner-guest-grandfather-murder-interview","fields":{"headline":"Terror hits home: Gabriela Ybarra on the family stories behind her novel","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the Spanish writer Gabriela Ybarra heard she had been nominated for the Man Booker International prize, she could hardly believe it. “I had just fed the baby and was going to take a nap,” she says, her four-month-old son gurgling and squawking on her knee, as she speaks at her home in Madrid. “I was super-relaxed. Then I read the email from my UK editor and I couldn’t sleep, because I was so excited.” The novel that has put this debut author alongside literary stars such as Laurent Binet, Han Kang and László Krasznahorkai is The Dinner Guest, a bold examination of silence and mortality that explores her grandfather’s murder at the hands of Basque separatists in 1977, and her mother’s death from cancer in 2011. The novel was born from Ybarra’s frustration with her mother’s obituaries, and her own struggle to capture the woman she loved in prose. “I didn’t know how to tell the story of my mother without sounding super-cheesy,” she says, “because all I could think of was good memories.” As she thought about the six months between diagnosis and death, she was struck by her mother’s calm in the face of her imminent end. Ybarra found her acceptance hard to understand. “I thought that death was something completely new to me … When I looked back, I realised that I had lived surrounded by death, but I just couldn’t see it.” Born into one of Vizcaya’s most illustrious families in 1913, Ybarra’s grandfather Javier fought for the Nationalists in the Spanish civil war and served as mayor of Bilbao from 1963 to 1969. When four Eta militants arrived at his house carrying machine guns in 1977, they handcuffed his children to a bed and bundled him into a car. His body was discovered in a mountain gully a month later. The family was still under threat when Ybarra was born in 1983, and throughout her childhood – a bomb arrived in the post at their Madrid apartment in 2002 – but nobody ever talked about it. “Talking about terrorism was completely taboo,” she says. “Although the problem existed and there were bombs exploding every other day, people just pretended nothing was happening.” The silence surrounding the violence in the Basque country extended even to her own family: “In my family there still is a taboo. I didn’t dare ask anybody about [my grandfather] until the book was published.” Instead of talking to her relatives, Ybarra trawled through newspaper archives for answers that would help her understand her family history – where she came from and who she was. But there were gaps in the media coverage of her grandfather’s assassination, and Ybarra was left with only her imagination to fill them in. “I always tried to be faithful to what I thought would have happened and I tried to make it look as real as possible,” she says, “but many, many passages are completely made up.” In the second half, where Ybarra turns to her mother’s death, fact and fiction remain difficult to tease apart. “You are always relying on memory and memory tricks you all the time,” she says. “When my sisters and my dad read the book they constantly said ‘This didn’t happen that way, we didn’t go to that place,’ or ‘This wasn’t like that’.” Readers always want to know how much a work of literature is real, she says, but “the truth is that for me, as a writer, it doesn’t matter. I just want the book to work by itself. The story of the book belongs to the book and real life is something different.” After ignoring her family’s close acquaintance with death for so long, the act of imagination required to write a novel has made it seem more real. “We live in an equilibrium between fiction and nonfiction, because if we were always aware of all the dangers we have around us, we wouldn’t be able to enjoy anything, we would always be scared,” she says. “Sometimes you have to escape … The problem is that, in my case, I had escaped too much.” The short, declarative sentences of Natasha Wimmer’s translation reflect the direct, minimalist prose of the Spanish original, a style Ybarra chose partly to allow her some distance: “I was so involved emotionally that in order to understand how it had affected me I needed to take a step back and try to analyse everything as if I were a surgeon.” Her father was furious when she showed him the manuscript; why, he asked, had she written about something that hadn’t really hurt him? “He had the pain so encapsulated he was convinced he hadn’t suffered,” she says. “After that, he spent two weeks crying.” At first she feared it would wreck their relationship, but instead “it was the opposite. It opened a new channel of communication that had been blocked.” The Dinner Guest is opening other doors for Ybarra: its Man Booker International longlisting offers her a chance to find readers beyond her Spanish-language audience. “Other countries always look to what is translated into English, so you get more possibilities to get translated into other languages if you are translated into English. [The Booker listing] opens up the world. It’s very exciting.” The Dinner Guest by Gabriela Ybarra is published by Vintage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/11/football-transfer-rumours-mousa-dembele-to-leave-tottenham-for-juventus","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T08:21:46Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Mousa Dembélé  to leave Tottenham for Juventus?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/11/football-transfer-rumours-mousa-dembele-to-leave-tottenham-for-juventus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/11/football-transfer-rumours-mousa-dembele-to-leave-tottenham-for-juventus","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Mousa Dembélé  to leave Tottenham for Juventus?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tottenham Hotspur central midfielder Mousa Dembélé has been one of several players to excel under Mauricio Pochettino in recent seasons and the man hailed as “a genius” by his manager has given players as good as Nemanja Matic, Sami Khedira, and Miralem Pjanic, among many others, plenty to think about since August, making him one of the best in his position in Europe. With his contract due to expire next season, the 30-year-old Belgian could be forgiven for chasing one final, lucrative contract from a club less parsimonious than his current employers and is likely to have no shortage of suitors, with Juventus believed to be monitoring his situation with interest. Asked about his future earlier this month, Dembélé made the kind of noises that will keep Spurs fans happy but nervous. “At this moment, I am very happy at Tottenham,” he said. “I do not lie when I say that. I do not think about a big transfer. I want to play a World Cup and afterwards we will see.” Meanwhile at Old Trafford, Anthony Martial is understood to have joined Marcus Rashford in an unseemly scramble for the Old Trafford exit door. Reports from France say the winger has turned down the offer of a new five-year deal but will have no shortage of offers if speculation that – deep breath – Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid and Inter are all interested in giving the 22-year-old a fresh start is to be believed. Having failed to create too much of a stir at Manchester United after making his name with a series of impressive performances with Borussia Dortmund, Shinji Kagawa may give the Premier League another crack with West Ham or Everton after turning heads with a series of impressive performances with Borussia Dortmund. West Ham are also interested in Barcelona midfielder André Gomes, who has struggled to fit in at the Camp Nou since his £30m move from Valencia in the summer of 2016. An 81st-minute substitute in Barcelona’s humiliation at the hands of Roma last night, Gomes is also wanted by Manchester United and Milan. Elsewhere in Spain, Atlético Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann has scotched increasingly tedious talk he’s already agreed terms with Barcelona. He has, however, said he wants his future sorted before he heads to the World Cup with France. Liverpool’s interest in Roma goalkeeper Alisson is well documented, but the Serie A side’s president has said he thinks the 25-year-old Brazilian will be going nowhere. James Pallotta, who celebrated his side’s magnificent win over Barcelona with an invigorating plunge into the Fontana dell’Obelisco at the capital’s Piazza del Popolo, insists his bearded stopper will stay at Roma. “I love him and I have never wanted to sell him,” he said. “I thought he was great and now he’s showing how good he is.” Even if Alisson decides he does want to leave, Liverpool will still have to fend off interest from those pesky wad-wavers at PSG. Liverpool and Spurs are both sniffing around exciting young Norwich prospect James Maddison, whose late free-kick was instrumental in depriving relegation-threatened Sunderland of all three points in the match between the two sides at an increasingly gloomy Stadium of Light on Tuesday night. Elsewhere in the north-east, Newcastle’s inability to convince Chelsea to insert a “first dibs” clause into the loan contract of Kenedy could cost them. The Brazilian’s impressive performances for the Toon have got antennae twitching all over Europe. Bayern Munich, PSG and Tottenham are ready to hitch their skirts in the 22-year-old’s direction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/11/supporters-rugby-paddy-jackson-stuart-olding-acquitted-rape-take-out-newspaper-ad","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T08:11:04Z","webTitle":"Supporters of rugby stars acquitted of rape take out newspaper ad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/11/supporters-rugby-paddy-jackson-stuart-olding-acquitted-rape-take-out-newspaper-ad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/11/supporters-rugby-paddy-jackson-stuart-olding-acquitted-rape-take-out-newspaper-ad","fields":{"headline":"Supporters of rugby stars acquitted of rape take out newspaper ad","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Supporters of two Irish rugby internationals acquitted of rape have taken out a full-page newspaper advertisement demanding their playing suspensions be lifted. Paddy Jackson and his Ulster clubmate Stuart Olding were cleared last month in a high profile trial in Belfast. Their two friends, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison, were found not guilty of indecent exposure and perverting the course of justice. The ad in Wednesday’s Belfast Telegraph states: “As Ulster and Irish rugby fans we want these innocent men reinstated and rightly allowed to resume their roles for both club and country. The IRFU [Irish Rugby Football Union] should take note of the silent majority and not bow to the court of social media.” Their backing for Jackson and Olding, who are currently suspended from all Ulster and Ireland duties, comes ahead of a planned protest outside the Kingspan stadium in Belfast on Friday. Campaigners are planning to hold a demonstration at the home of Ulster Rugby before the province’s clash with the Welsh side Ospreys. They want Ulster and Ireland to ban the pair from playing for both sides. Supporters of the 21-year-old woman who was at the centre of the case against Jackson, Olding, McIlroy and Harrison also took out an ad in the Belfast Telegraph last week. The four men were unanimously cleared of all charges by a jury at Belfast crown court, but the ad referred to evidence heard in court of WhatsApp messages in which the men used lewd language to describe a sexual encounter at the centre of the allegations made by the woman. Organised by a rugby fan, Anna Nolan from Belfast, the ad last week said the players’ behaviour “falls far beneath the standards that your organisations represent and as such we demand that neither of these men represents Ulster or Ireland now or at any point in the future”. Supporters of Jackson and Oldding said that both men had apologised for the content of messages. “What is reprehensible is the extent of the social media backlash aimed at incriminating men unanimously acquitted of any crime,” they said. “We are fed up with this cyber persecution.” The advertisement on Wednesday, printed in red ink on a white background, is signed: “Real fans standing up for the Ulster men.” Later on Wednesday, the judge in the trial, Justice Patricia Smyth, will consider challenges to a number of reporting restrictions regarding the case that are still in operation. She will consider a legal appeal from a number of media organisations in Northern Ireland to have the restrictions, which were imposed during proceedings, lifted. On the future rugby careers of Jackson and Olding, the IRFU has said: “A review process in relation to this matter is under way and it would be inappropriate to comment on any matter pertaining to that process until it is completed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/13/australian-bill-to-create-back-door-into-encrypted-apps-in-advanced-stages","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T18:00:15Z","webTitle":"Australian bill to create back door into encrypted apps in 'advanced stages'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/13/australian-bill-to-create-back-door-into-encrypted-apps-in-advanced-stages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/13/australian-bill-to-create-back-door-into-encrypted-apps-in-advanced-stages","fields":{"headline":"Australian bill to create back door into encrypted apps in 'advanced stages'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian government is pushing ahead with controversial legislation it says will create “back doors” into encrypted communication services – but still can’t say when it will introduce the bill. After originally aiming to have the legislation before parliament in the first quarter of this year, the government has delayed its introduction. A spokesman for the acting attorney general, Marise Payne, would only say it was in “the advanced stages of development”. “The government is continuing to consult with key stakeholders,” the spokesman said in a statement. The former attorney general George Brandis first floated the idea mid last year, in response to law enforcement frustrations that encrypted communication services, which include popular apps such as Whatsapp, Wickr, iMessage and even Snapchat, remained out of their reach. The legislation had been planned for November last year, before it was pushed to the first quarter of this year. It has once again been delayed. Typically, messages and data sent within these services, which senior government ministers themselves have admitted to using, disappear after being read or remain impervious to decryption efforts by third parties. The government’s efforts to legislate to allow access, through what it has previously termed a “back door” for its authorities and agencies, have been frustrated by the companies’ reluctance to allow government interference. Labor, which has typically supported the government in matters of national security, remains sceptical additional legislation of this nature is practical. “Labor will continue to work with the government to put in place practical national security measures, that are fit for purpose and effectively protect Australia and our community,” acting shadow attorney general Brendan O’Connor said. “It was clear, however, when this idea was first floated last year that the government had significant work to do in making any proposed legislation in this area workable,” he said. “If it is to proceed, Labor calls on the government to release an exposure draft of this legislation, to allow for proper consultation. This is important given the complexities around this novel area of lawmaking.” Greens senator Jordon Steele-John said the whole concept was laughable. “Once the government has a back door into encrypted devices and platforms, everybody has a back door into encrypted devices and platforms,” he said. “That has been proven over and over again. Once it is created, somebody gets in. I wouldn’t trust a government that can’t keep Medicare information protected to be inserting a back door into a tin shed. “So I certainly wouldn’t be trusting them to do something as serious as this.” In July last year, Australian federal police deputy commissioner Mike Phelan said “the vast majority” of investigations now involved some sort of encryption, but the “legislation has not yet kept pace with technology”. In 2016, then-US president Barack Obama withheld White House support for legislation that would have allowed courts to force encryption companies, which include Apple and Google, to allow access. The UK government is also examining ways it can force access to encrypted services, as part of its own wider national security push."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/12/weatherill-backs-mark-butlers-bid-to-stare-down-wayne-swan-for-alp-president","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"Weatherill backs Mark Butler’s bid to stare down Wayne Swan for ALP president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/weatherill-backs-mark-butlers-bid-to-stare-down-wayne-swan-for-alp-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/weatherill-backs-mark-butlers-bid-to-stare-down-wayne-swan-for-alp-president","fields":{"headline":"Weatherill backs Mark Butler’s bid to stare down Wayne Swan for ALP president","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill has endorsed the Labor left frontbencher Mark Butler to remain as ALP national president, underscoring his longstanding commitment to party democratisation. The fresh endorsement surfaced just before the close of nominations for the ALP national president on Friday. Butler, currently party president, is trying to secure a second term against significant pushback from the right faction. Also in the field is the Queensland rightwinger Wayne Swan, the former treasurer and deputy prime minister during the Rudd/Gillard period, who is making a concerted pitch for left votes by highlighting his front-running policy advocacy on inequality during this period in opposition. Another leftwinger, the Queensland senator Claire Moore, is expected to nominate and there are suggestions a fourth candidate connected with the right faction may yet emerge. Once nominations close, ALP members will elect three positions: party president, vice president and junior vice president. Weatherill has recorded a video endorsing Butler – his South Australian colleague and longtime friend – trumpeting the frontbencher’s advocacy on climate change and renewable energy, and his commitment to increasing grassroots participation in party votes and forums. The former South Australian premier says in the video Butler is committed to increasing party democratisation, including allowing rank-and-file voting for Senate preselections – which is a controversial push institutionally. Both Butler and Swan are currently travelling the country in an effort to court voters. Swan launched his campaign in Sydney on Tuesday night and Butler has fronted events in Sydney and Melbourne over the past few days. Swan will spend the next couple of days in Melbourne and in Tasmania. Swan’s campaign is emphasising the fact he will have time to devote to the role, given his recent confirmation that he won’t stand again for parliament at the next federal election; and his advocacy on economic issues. Left candidates generally prevail in grassroots votes, reflecting the dominance of left-aligned party members in the party’s big inner-city branches, but the right has endorsed Swan to run believing he will attract cross-factional support because of his relentless campaign to make the ALP’s economic policy offering more progressive. Butler’s push for democratisation has seriously alarmed the right faction, which generally resists proposals to open up party processes on the basis it increases the power of the left in internal forums."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/apr/12/david-squires-on-the-new-socceroos-strip","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T18:00:09Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... the new Socceroos strip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/apr/12/david-squires-on-the-new-socceroos-strip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/apr/12/david-squires-on-the-new-socceroos-strip","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... the new Socceroos strip","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-night-i-had-to-choose-between-russell-crowe-and-jimmy-barnes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T01:34:23Z","webTitle":"The night I had to choose between Russell Crowe and Jimmy Barnes | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-night-i-had-to-choose-between-russell-crowe-and-jimmy-barnes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/the-night-i-had-to-choose-between-russell-crowe-and-jimmy-barnes","fields":{"headline":"The night I had to choose between Russell Crowe and Jimmy Barnes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was a warm night in Newcastle and the theatre was filling up with excited Jimmy Barnes fans who had tickets to see his new show – a spoken-word performance combined with song that was opening the Newcastle writers festival. I had just relinquished my Barnesy ticket to a festival volunteer – I had to go back to my hotel and rewrite my story about Russell Crowe’s divorce auction. I’d studied the catalogue that week and written about some of my favourite items of movie memorabilia, with my recollections of Rusty in those roles. They were the early parts: Proof, The Sum of Us, Romper Stomper. But where was the Gladiator reference, asked my editor? In Guardian parlance, this was a “global story”. And did we really need to know so much about the Balmain workers’ cottage where The Sum of Us was set? It needed to be rewritten straight away. So I said goodbye to my friends going to see Barnesy. I was in a bad mood and tweeted: “Life of a journalist circa 2018 : giving up your jimmy Barnes concert ticket because you’ve got to rewrite your story about @russellcrowe divorce auction.” Fellow journalists responded – their news desks had sent them to cover the Crowe auction, which was being held in Sydney on Saturday night. “I have to go to the bloody thing tomorrow,” Sydney Morning Herald journalist Nick O’Malley tweeted. “So do I,” said Margot Saville, writing for Crikey. Back in the hotel I browsed the catalogue again: that flimsy codpiece from Cinderella Man, that yellow shirt from Proof, the endless lots of guitars, the fake swords, the cricket bats and jerseys pinned behind glass, the envy-inducing art collection, the diamond rings. Then, just as I settled in to rewrite the piece, came another tweet – from @russellcrowe himself: “Interesting . We haven’t talked , and it hasn’t taken place yet ... so...just making stuff up are we ? Haha Go to the gig . I can’t deal with being responsible for you missing the legend that is @JimmyBarnes .” Russell Crowe was ordering me to get the Jimmy Barnes concert! Did his directive override that of my editor? I could hear Crowe’s beautiful, mellow but commanding baritone (his Master and Commander voice – “Men must be governed!”) urging me back to Hunter Street to see Barnes, to lose myself in those anthemic, jangling, evocative first chords of Working Class Man (“Wor-kiiiing hard to make livin’/ seeking shelter from the rain/ father’s son meant to caaaarry on/ Blue denim in his veins/ wwwwooooh o o o he’s a working class man!!”). But then there was the first part of his tweet with its odd punctuation: “ Interesting . We haven’t talked , and it hasn’t taken place yet ... so...just making stuff up are we ? Haha ” It seemed a little menacing in an LA Confidential kind of way, as opposed to a Romper Stomper-level, boot-on-neck menace. Crowe was accusing me of “making stuff up” – then he added a “Haha” to the end. Was it a funny haha (as in “just joking”??) or an evil haha? It’s so hard to tell on Twitter. Nick O’Malley told me he also received twitter response from Crowe: “At first he ordered me not to attend as I was obviously ‘not the right man for the job’ then relented, apologised for stuffing up my weekend and told me to bring a hip flask.” After reading Crowe’s tweet to me, another journalist, Shannon Molloy, challenged Crowe: “This seems unnecessarily bitchy, Rusty.” My breath quickened as I read the exchanges. Would it possible that this would end up with me fighting Russell Crowe, JUST LIKE GLADIATOR???!! It would be a fight I was sure to lose. Rusty’s fans (he has 2.76 million followers) had already started trolling me, along with O’Malley, who had complained about having to cover the auction on a Saturday night. My Twitter defence sounded pathetic. I assured Crowe that I loved his art collection! He has great taste (he does have very good taste, that much is true)! And it was true I hadn’t spoken to him – but I was writing about his auction catalogue, not him! I didn’t need to speak to him! And my piece was a preview – that is why it was written before the auction took place. (Subtext: Please like me, Russell! I am not like journalists who make shit up about you!!) Meanwhile my deadline approached. Barnes was already an hour into what would be a three-hour performance and I still hadn’t rewritten the piece I was missing the concert for. It was now hard to focus on my auction catalogue story with Crowe and his followers in my ear. Twitter – for me just a place for mindless banter, random thoughts and sharing story links – was now living up to its meta potential. As I wrote a story about Crowe in a hotel room in Newcastle, he was speaking directly to me, while his trolling fans provided a shrieking background chorus and my friends offered murmured, unhelpful asides such as: “If there’s a more Australian tweet out there I’ll eat my hat,” and “Why does he put spaces before punctuation. It’s weird and unsettling.” The auction went ahead. It was a roaring success, smashing expectations and bringing in what Crowe described as “$3.7m at the coal face”. At the writers festival I kept checking my phone, half fearful, half hoping Crowe had tweeted me again. He didn’t. He had moved on to challenging New Idea magazine for writing what looked to be a fairly far-fetched story that he was in love with the radio personality Fifi Box (“something so wrong with the leadership of this magazine”). And he tweeted a mega closeup of his beard. But this is an unchallengeable truth: one weekend in Newcastle I had to choose between spending a night with Jimmy Barnes or Russell Crowe – and I chose you, Rusty, you. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/11/what-is-it-about-coal-that-makes-old-white-men-so-crazy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T07:37:33Z","webTitle":"What is it about coal that makes old white men so crazy? | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/what-is-it-about-coal-that-makes-old-white-men-so-crazy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/what-is-it-about-coal-that-makes-old-white-men-so-crazy","fields":{"headline":"What is it about coal that makes old white men so crazy?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/12/cheering-on-their-own-team-how-the-gold-coast-has-welcomed-lgbti-athletes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T18:00:09Z","webTitle":"'Cheering on their own team': how the Gold Coast has welcomed LGBTI athletes | Kate O'Halloran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/12/cheering-on-their-own-team-how-the-gold-coast-has-welcomed-lgbti-athletes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/12/cheering-on-their-own-team-how-the-gold-coast-has-welcomed-lgbti-athletes","fields":{"headline":"'Cheering on their own team': how the Gold Coast has welcomed LGBTI athletes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sixty-nine percent of Commonwealth nations criminalise many of their own LGBTI citizens – 37 of 53 countries. That’s the affronting statistic that greets visitors to the Gold Coast’s Rise bar and club, which, for the duration of the Games, has been turned into Pride House – a safe space for LGBTI athletes and the fans and community that form around the 11-day event. Pride House has a short but defiant history. In 2010, Whistler local Dean Nelson approached the organisers of the Vancouver Olympics with a proposal – Nelson was aware of the growing hospitality movement within the Games, whereby each nation typically takes over public venue for their fans to gather and cheer on their team. As Gold Coast Pride House volunteer Emma-June Curik explains, Nelson felt there should be an analogous venue for the LGBTI community “to gather together and cheer on their [own] team, so to speak”. Since then, Curik says, there has been a Pride House at every major Commonwealth and Olympic Games, with the notable exception of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. There, she says, it was unsafe to have a venue on site, but there were instead Pride Houses in capital cities of other competing nations, as well as an online community where fans and athletes could stay connected anonymously. “There’s not really a formula for a Pride House,” Curik says. “It should just reflect your city and community, as long as it’s a safe space. Quite rightly, the Gold Coast version has ended up on the beach, overlooking Surfers Paradise.” One of the key considerations for such a venue, says Curik, was that while the space was designed to be “safe”, there was the possibility that LGBTI athletes could be outed as a result of attending – a particularly dangerous proposition for those hailing from countries with laws as severe as the death penalty. The venue thus has a strict confidentiality agreement, including that photos are not taken and uploaded on social media. “Safety and protecting the identity of athletes was something that came up a lot, mainly from community,” says Curik. She says most were familiar with what happened in Rio – when a straight, married reporter from the Daily Beast posed as gay on app Grindr and outed LGBT athletes he found, including those from nations where they would be persecuted for their sexuality. So far, both athletes and officials have visited from countries such as Canada, Wales and Scotland, all of whom were happy to be open about their sexuality. Others, however, tended to come at night when they were less recognisable, particularly those from nations with less progressive LGBTI civil rights records. Curik says that it had been important to the Gold Coast Pride House collective to provide a space that would reflect Australia’s own changing context of LGBTI rights. “I don’t know if soft diplomacy is the right term, but as a country that has recently updated its own civil rights record on the positive side of the ledger [with marriage equality], I think it’s important to model to other countries that the world hasn’t fallen down around us, we’re all OK, none of the negative spin has come true.” Australian Matt Mitcham, the first openly gay Olympian to win gold, is working as an ambassador for Pride House, and says the venue’s existence would make a difference to LGBT athletes, even if they were not prepared to access it. “Think about it, of the 72 countries in the world where homosexuality is criminalised – 36 of those are in the Commonwealth,” he says. “Imagine coming from one of those countries and seeing this. When you’re in the closet, you’re always gathering evidence, about whether it’s going to be safe to come out or not. You’re always thinking of the worst case scenarios. “Coming to the Games and seeing the program of amazing LGBTI events and Pride House and how inclusive it is – that’s going to do a lot for people who are gathering evidence as to whether they’ll be safe enough.” Mitcham says he had never personally attended a Pride House while competing at either the Olympics or Commonwealth Games – predominantly because his diving event was regularly scheduled for the final day of competition – but had been aware of its existence. “I thought it was a really amazing initiative, just knowing about Pride House made me feel really safe and validated,” he says. Mitcham added that he thought homophobia in sport was still a big issue for both LGBTI athletes and fans, despite various degrees of progress since he had come out in 2008. “With the participation numbers of [out] LGBTI athletes being so low, significantly lower than the percentage of the wider population, it means there’s something about sport that might not be conducive to LGBTI people feeling safe,” he says. “Even if that’s people watching sport, an initiative like this makes community feel like it’s going to be safe to watch [the Games], knowing they’re not going to be harassed or attacked.” One man who knows plenty about progress on LGBTI issues in sport is Gold Coast Pride House project manager Matt Hall. In 2002, Hall became the first out Australian rules footballer (at amateur level), while in 1998 he was embroiled in controversy after declaring his HIV positive status to his football club. “Back in 1998, I declared to my Ivanhoe team-mates that I was HIV positive,” he recalls. “And my football club wrote it on my medical form. Then when I turned up to play, I found out that I was banned from playing football due to the club’s insurance company not wanting to insure me because I was HIV positive.” This was despite the fact, Hall says, that “at the time, as per today, I have an undetectable viral load, meaning untransmissable.” Hall had been assured by the HIV sector, as well as his doctor Darren Russell, that he was “100% safe to participate” and was encouraged by Russell to take the matter to court. “He told me I had an obligation to stand up for what was right,” says Hall. “When you respect someone of that calibre [like Dr Russell] and they tell you you have a moral obligation to society, you stand up and take it on, so I did.” Hall says the resultant hearing, held at the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal, found “overwhelmingly” in his favour. “They ruled that I was 100% safe to participate in Australian rules football, or any other sport for that matter. I think the quote from the court hearing was that you ‘would have more change of being pecked to death by a seagull than me transmitting HIV on a sporting field’.” The case, Hall says, subsequently set an international precedent for HIV positive athletes, and led to the stricter implementation of the blood rule in AFL, as it had shone a light on blood-borne viruses in sport. Four years later, he came out publicly on the advice of Ian Roberts, but continued to struggle with his sexuality. “Ian thought it was important for the community to see gay role models, and masculine role models, because back in the 90s and earlier, gay people were stereotyped on television; always the butt of jokes or effeminate,” he says. “So he wanted me to step up and say I was gay and it was OK to play football as well. “It was a lot more homophobic back in the day, though. I experienced depression and attempted suicide when I was coming out and still playing.” As a result, Hall now volunteers for Beyond Blue and Lifeline, with tackling queer youth and suicide a cause particularly close to his heart. He says he couldn’t resist when he saw an ad in a local paper looking for a Pride House project manager – sensing the opportunity to come full circle back to his “activist” days as an out, HIV positive, gay trailblazer. “Pride House is all about mental wellbeing and people feeling safe,” he says. “This is an important LGBTI community space, and community-led initiative. It’s about inclusion, education, equality and awareness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/kremlin-us-strike-against-syria-heighten-instability","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T21:40:23Z","webTitle":"US-Russia tensions build as Moscow hits back at Trump's Twitter threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/kremlin-us-strike-against-syria-heighten-instability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/kremlin-us-strike-against-syria-heighten-instability","fields":{"headline":"US-Russia tensions build as Moscow hits back at Trump's Twitter threat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The US and Russia came significantly closer to a direct clash over Syria on Wednesday when Donald Trump fired off an incendiary tweet that told Moscow to “get ready” for incoming US missiles, which the Russian military has vowed to shoot down. A standoff over a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb of Damascus on Saturday has since spiraled into the most dangerous confrontation between the two nuclear-armed powers since the height of the cold war, driven by Vladimir Putin’s uncompromising backing for the Assad regime in Damascus and the volatility of the US president. “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,” the US president tweeted. “Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’ You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called for calm. “We do not participate in Twitter diplomacy,” Peskov was quoted as saying by Interfax. “We support serious approaches. We continue to believe that it is important not to take steps that could harm an already fragile situation.” Despite the president’s menacing tweet, both the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, and the defence secretary, James Mattis, suggested a decision on military action was still pending. “All options are on the table and a final decision hasn’t been made,” Sanders said. Mattis said the US was “still assessing intelligence” on Saturday’s attack on Douma , before attending a White House meeting of military and intelligence chiefs chaired by Vice-President Mike Pence. In anticipation of an attack, Syrian planes had been flown to three Russian airbases and senior Syrian government officials had been moved to safe houses in Damascus, according to sources in Turkey. A US naval battlegroup – including the guided missile destroyer USS Donald Cook, and mostly likely a cruise missile submarine, USS Georgia – was in place in the eastern Mediterranean on Wednesday night. France has a missile ship, the Aquitaine, in the eastern Mediterranean and Rafale fighters armed with cruise missiles in Jordan and Abu Dhabi. President Emmanuel Macron has declared that proven Syrian regime responsibility for chemical weapons use would cross a red line for France. In London, Theresa May summoned her cabinet for an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the next steps, after warning that the Douma attack, “could not go unchallenged”. MPs are not due to return to Westminster from their Easter recess until next week; but the prime minister is under pressure to decide whether the UK will join coordinated military action. Speaking on Wednesday, May pointed the finger at the Assad government, and promised to ensure that those responsible were “held to account”. “The use of chemical weapons cannot go unchallenged,” she said. “We’re rapidly reaching an understanding of what happened on the ground. All the indications are that the Syrian regime was responsible.” It is not entirely clear what sparked Trump’s 7am tweet, but it came after news reports quoted the Russian ambassador to Lebanon, Alexander Zasypkin, warning that Russian forces in Syria would intercept any incoming US missiles, and return fire at their source, likely to mean US planes or ships. Russian air defence did not try to shoot down US Tomahawk cruise missiles the last time Trump ordered punitive strikes following a chemical weapons attack attributed to the Assad regime. But the Russian chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, warned last month that the next time could be different, and that Russia would use air defence and other weapons if its forces in Syria were threatened. Zasypkin’s reported remarks appear more sweeping, suggesting any incoming attack would trigger retaliation – whether or not there were Russian casualties. Vladimir Frolov, a foreign affairs analyst in Moscow, told the Guardian that he believed the ambassador’s remarks were mistranslated, and noted that the Russian envoy had referred directly to Moscow’s stated policy. But with tensions rising, he said, he believed Putin may have to step in to restate Moscow’s policy. “I think until now they thought it would be good to keep the US in doubt about the real Russian reaction, but Trump has raised the stakes today,” Frolov said. The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, claimed that a US missile salvo could be used to destroy evidence of the gas attack, which Moscow claims was staged. On Wednesday the Russian army said it was going to send military police into Douma to safeguard the site. Their deployment appeared part of a plan proposed by Moscow to bring specialists from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to the site of the reported attack. Western officials have warned that any Russian effort to control the visit could turn the inspection into a new flashpoint, rather than a potentialway out of the looming crisis. Syria’s other main backer, Iran – which has signficant ground forces in the country – could also retaliate if its troops are hit on a fraught battlefield crisscrossed by tense rivalries between outside powers. “It is hard to think of a more risky situation,” said Joseph Cirincione, the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control advocacy group. “You have the US attacking from the air against ground forces intermingled with Iranians and Russians. The chances of the US killing Russians or Iranians are quite high. Their reaction is unknown but it is certainly not going to be understanding.” Less than an hour after warning Russia to “get ready”, Trump appeared to strike a less aggressive tone in a second tweet. “Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this,” he wrote. “Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?” But there appeared little room for compromise between the two sides on the central issue: the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The UN’s World Health Organisation, based in Geneva, said on Wednesday that it had received reports that 500 patients had been admitted to hospital with symptoms of a chemical attack. But the Russian foreign ministry doubled down on its claim that no chemical attack occurred, saying at a briefing: “This is a total deception on a global scale.” “Damascus has neither the motive to use chemical weapons nor the chemical weapons themselves,” Zakharova, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, said. “There is no proof of their use by Damascus.” The latest bellicose tone from the White House, and pressure from the military not to give Russia time to prepare its air defences inside Syria, raises questions about whether the US will wait for a British parliamentary endorsement for action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/11/shakespeares-globe-casts-its-own-artistic-director-as-hamlet","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T14:32:37Z","webTitle":"Shakespeare's Globe casts its own artistic director as Hamlet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/11/shakespeares-globe-casts-its-own-artistic-director-as-hamlet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/11/shakespeares-globe-casts-its-own-artistic-director-as-hamlet","fields":{"headline":"Shakespeare's Globe casts its own artistic director as Hamlet","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The first experiment in democratic casting by Shakespeare’s Globe has led to its artistic director, Michelle Terry, taking the role of Hamlet and, in As You Like It, a role normally played by an elderly man. Terry announced her first season as artistic director at the London open-air playhouse in January with the eye-catching promise of giving more power to the casts and other creative people involved in the plays. A company of 12 actors helped decide who played who in the two productions once the rehearsals had started. Gender swapping in the theatre is not the novelty it perhaps once was but a woman playing Hamlet, the most coveted of any of Shakespeare’s roles for young or youngish actors, is still an infrequent event. Given Terry’s stage pedigree, including a barnstorming performance as Henry V in Regent’s Park, London, in 2016, it is no surprise the company chose her to play Hamlet. High-profile recent Hamlets have included Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Scott, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Hiddleston and Maxine Peake. In the play As You Like It, Terry will play Adam, the elderly (“almost fourscore”) faithful family servant. The Globe’s gender-blind approach to casting means Jack Laskey, known for his role as DS Peter Jakes in ITV’s series Endeavour, can play the heroine Rosalind in As You Like It, a role which has been played by Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith and, in 1991, a young Adrian Lester. Bettrys Jones will play the lovesick Orlando, and, in Hamlet, she will be Laertes. A spokesperson for the Globe said: “The directors and Michelle assembled 12 excellent actors and cast from that group. At the start of the process we were keen not just to cast to type, but ensure that any actor could play any character. “Each of the ensemble were aware that they would get one larger role in one play and one or a series of smaller roles in the other. We’re thrilled to be putting these two plays, written in the same year, in the playhouse for which they were written.” Hamlet and As You Like It are the opening shows in Terry’s inaugural summer season. Some eyebrows were raised when she was appointed because she was an actor who had never directed but she said that too much pressure was placed on a director to “solve” the plays. “It is unfair that everything gets dumped on the director’s shoulders, and actually it is a really collaborative process, especially for our theatre, which is one of the most democratic and egalitarian spaces that we’ve got.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/13/feminist-fiction-drives-big-money-at-london-book-fair","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T13:29:39Z","webTitle":"Feminist fiction drives big money at London book fair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/13/feminist-fiction-drives-big-money-at-london-book-fair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/13/feminist-fiction-drives-big-money-at-london-book-fair","fields":{"headline":"Feminist fiction drives big money at London book fair","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From a distance, the only thing that separates Donald Trump from the fake-tan smeared impersonator posing at London book fair is that this one is holding a book. The Trump-a-like has been brought in by Penguin Random House to promote The President Is Missing, a thriller co-written by James Patterson and former US president Bill Clinton. Holding up a fake copy of the book – it isn’t due until June – in the middle of a fake Oval Office (complete with Russian dolls on the table and Diet Coke in the drinks globe), the similarities between Trump and his doppelganger stop at pout and paunch alone; everyone is pleased to see him, and stretch for selfies. Clinton and Patterson’s thriller is possibly the starriest book at the fair, despite being announced months ago. But this publicity stunt is emblematic of the cash and publicity pizazz on display at London book fair each year. A lot of what we end up reading coming through the fair 18 months before, to be snapped up by publishers and eyed by film and TV studios for possible adaptations. And Trump-a-like aside, it seems politics was never far away from anyone’s mind this year, with many of the biggest deals going to feminist fiction: novels starring female leads, navigating dangerous worlds with agency, off the back of the huge success of the TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale and conversations born of #TimesUp and #MeToo. There’s Chandler Baker’s The Whisper Network, about four women scheming to take down a sleazy colleague before he becomes CEO; The Illness Lesson by Clare Beams, a novel set in a 19th-century Massachusetts girls’ school, where the students develop strange, shared symptoms; and Joanne Ramos’s The Farm, where women conceive the children of an elite, receiving payment if they follow strict rules. Joining those is After the Flood, Kassandra Montag’s postapocalyptic novel about a mother searching for her daughter; Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows, Balli Kaur Jaswal’s novel exploring “honour” killings in the UK; and Vardø, the adult debut of children’s author Kiran Millwood Hargrave, a historical novel about the 1621 Norwegian witch trials. All were subject to intense bidding wars: particularly Millwood Hargrave’s Vardø, which, after a 13-publisher fight, went to Picador for a “significant six-figure sum” and is due in early 2020. Afterwards, Millwood Hargrave likens the process to speed-dating: “For me, I looked at publishers who are publishing a lot of women and picked out the ones who do it well. We’re at a time when women’s stories are getting noticed and selling really well. I hate to look at things in trends, but there is currently a push for female-lead narrative. Just look at Naomi Alderman’s The Power – it won the Bailey’s and it has just exploded.” Alderman herself landed a four book deal at the fair: a collection of short stories, a non-fiction book and two novels, the first of which is due in 2019. A three book deal for Caitlin Moran was also announced, as were new novels from Jonathan Coe, Marilynne Robinson and Jeanette Winterson, whose Frankissstein will be a modern reimagining of Mary Shelley’s novel, grappling with technology and sexuality. “As the world fixes its eye on these issues, so does fiction,” says Suzie Dooré, publishing director of Borough Press, an imprint of Harper Collins, which snapped up Montag’s After the Flood and In at the Deep End by Kate Davies, a debut billed as “a lesbian Bridget Jones”. “There are some things that are too current, that don’t appeal to readers because it is a bit too much – it’s happening in the real world, so why would they want to read about it? But we know people are interested in gender politics because of The Handmaid’s Tale, and after The Essex Serpent, a big lush historical novel with a female lead is always popular – but while we watch trends, we’re always after the best written book.” While publishers seem buoyant, some agents are slightly disappointed with the direction of their attentions, saying that such intense bidding over a select few titles had left others in the dark. The potential sale of Waterstones to a private equity firm in the UK, and bookshop chain Barnes and Nobel underperforming in the US, were mentioned as possible reasons why publishers seem particularly risk-averse this year. Jonny Geller, agent at Curtis Brown, says that it appeared that publishers “have room for one big debut, one literary book to win them a prize and everything else is genre.” “These auctions you see where 10 or 12 publishers compete for one book just shows how fixated they can be on trends,” Geller says. “A sky-high advance for a book can actually not be good for the author, publisher or reader, it can put pressure on its success.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/should-little-britain-and-the-simpsons-change-with-the-times","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T11:29:03Z","webTitle":"Should Little Britain and The Simpsons change with the times?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/should-little-britain-and-the-simpsons-change-with-the-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/should-little-britain-and-the-simpsons-change-with-the-times","fields":{"headline":"Should Little Britain and The Simpsons change with the times?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In an interview with the Radio Times, David Walliams has admitted that Little Britain would probably be unrecognisable if it were made today. Following Matt Lucas’s claim that the show featured “a more cruel kind of comedy than I’d do now”, Walliams said that he would approach sketch comedy differently in 2018 because “it’s a different time”. Of course he would. Little Britain’s first series came out in 2003 – light years ago in public tastes – and it has aged spectacularly badly. There isn’t a broadcaster in the land now that would now commission a comedy featuring two privately educated white men in blackface or playing a Thai bride called Ting Tong or women with such pronounced mental illnesses that they can only communicate in squawks. Even Come Fly With Me – the Little Britain follow-up where Walliams and Lucas played full-blast stereotypes from Jamaica and Pakistan – felt uncomfortably out of step when it aired in 2010. Obviously they want to walk it back a little now. Walliams and Lucas are comfortable members of the establishment – Walliams is a beloved childrens’ author, Lucas played Nardole in Doctor Who – so it makes sense for them to express unease about an aspect of their comedy past with which they are now uncomfortable. And Little Britain wasn’t just a shocking outlier. It was embraced wholesale by the public. It rose through the ranks from BBC Three to BBC One at record speed, being watched by almost 10 million people at its peak. It spawned sold-out tours and blanket merchandise. Its catchphrases were picked up and repeated across the land for years. This was a big, mainstream comedy that people loved. If Walliams and Lucas are holding themselves to account in 2018 for making it, then we should do the same for greedily wolfing it down. But it happens. Tastes change, and yesterday’s flavour of the month can quite easily become today’s sock soup. Walliams and Lucas are by no means the only creators confronting the rough edges of their past work, but at least they’ve approached it upfront with candour. The same cannot be said for The Simpsons. Following Hari Kondabolu’s documentary The Problem With Apu – in which he interrogated the legacy of a two-dimensional south Asian character voiced by a white actor doing an impression of Peter Sellers doing an Indian accent – The Simpsons this week responded by having Lisa Simpson directly address the audience by saying, “Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?”, which feels like a flat-out refusal to address the controversy. What can you do? There’s always Looney Tunes, which now prefaces some of its most retrospectively insensitive cartoons with a legend that reads: “The cartoons you are about to see may depict some of the ethnic and racial stereotypes that were commonplace in American society … These cartoon are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.” Now, this works for Looney Tunes, because those cartoons are 70 years old. A similar legend would even work for repeats of Little Britain. Or The Breakfast Club, now that Molly Ringwald has explained her delicate relationship with it. Or any of the shows being made today that will undoubtedly fall foul of changing tastes in years to come. But Apu is still part of The Simpsons. He may have been a product of his time in the early 90s, but he certainly isn’t now. If David Walliams can express regret for calling someone a “ching-chong Chinaman” a decade and a half ago, then The Simpsons needs to react with something more meaningful than a shrug."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/13/even-when-i-fall-review-ex-circus-slaves-turn-the-tables-on-traffickers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Even When I Fall review – ex-circus slaves turn the tables on traffickers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/13/even-when-i-fall-review-ex-circus-slaves-turn-the-tables-on-traffickers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/13/even-when-i-fall-review-ex-circus-slaves-turn-the-tables-on-traffickers","fields":{"headline":"Even When I Fall review – ex-circus slaves turn the tables on traffickers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sky Neal and Kate McLarnon have made a sober, thoughtful documentary about Nepalese children and young girls who were trafficked to India, forced to work in circuses and abused by circus owners and others. The Indian government has now begun a process of liberating these young people, returning them to Nepal where they are reclaiming and detoxifying their experiences by setting up their own circus troupe called Circus Kathmandu, which tours internationally and is part of an educational project about trafficking. Before the film arrives at the redemptive third act in its story, it is downbeat and sombre, and it does raise troubling thoughts about the unexamined role that coercion may actually have played in circuses throughout history – not just of animals but maybe humans as well. The film is most interesting, and emotionally painful, when it reunites these young women with their parents, whose reactions are very complex. They are quietly overwhelmed with guilt at having allowed the trafficking to happen in the first place: one mother says that the trafficker tricked them into thinking that their daughters would earn good money in India that they would send back and return in a year. But the film suggests they are ambivalent at their abused children reviving circus skills as a force for good, as these are associated, in their minds, with betrayal. It is almost unbearably sad when a young woman actually asks her mother what happened: “Did someone take me, or … ?” and the older woman has to tell the story with quiet dignity, perhaps the first time she has had to say out loud what has troubled her for so long. A quietly valuable film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/11/nicolas-cage-joker-batman-gotham","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T13:38:28Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Cage as The Joker could be a masterstroke – or a major mistake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/11/nicolas-cage-joker-batman-gotham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/11/nicolas-cage-joker-batman-gotham","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Cage as The Joker could be a masterstroke – or a major mistake","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If there were ever a Marmite actor, dividing opinion equally between those who believe he is a maverick genius and those who see him as a giant ham, it is Nicolas Cage. When the part is right, as it was for Cage’s Oscar-winning role as a suicidal alcoholic in Mike Figgis’s Leaving Las Vegas, or as an unhinged cop in Werner Herzog’s mesmeric Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, he is one of the most watchable actors on the planet. When Cage goes too far out on a limb – one need hardly mention his infamous “The bees!” scene in Neil LaBute’s horrendous 2006 remake of The Wicker Man – it can feel as if he is not only appearing in a completely different movie from those around him, but perhaps inhabiting a parallel acting reality. At least Cage tries things – his decision to channel Adam West as vigilante Big Daddy in the comic book flick Kick-Ass was inspired, and helped mark that movie out from the crowd. The problem is that the things Cage tries are as likely to go wrong as right, and once they have done so there seems to be no off switch. That should perhaps lead us to view with caution the actor’s suggestion this week that he might make a decent Joker in an upcoming Batman movie. “I mean, I think my comic book days are kind of … I’m on to other things,” Cage, a noted comic-book fan whose son is named Kal-El after Superman’s birth name, told JoBlo. “But I always thought I’d make a great Joker and I always thought that I would’ve been a good villain in one of the Marvel [movies] like Doctor Doom ... At this point if I was to go back into the format it would probably have to be as a villain.” With apologies to the Fantastic Four super villain, it’s Cage’s suggestion that he might enjoy getting under the clown prince of Gotham’s skin that has grabbed most of the attention online. There appears to be little in the way of an opening right now at DC, with Jared Leto still inhabiting Batman’s nemesis for the DC Extended Universe movies and Joaquin Phoenix reportedly lined up to take the role in Todd Phillips’s upcoming Martin Scorsese-inspired Joker origin movie. But if DC studio Warner Bros is prepared to undermine Leto by casting another actor in a completely different take on the cackling supervillain, it should hardly be a stretch for studio execs to greenlight a third production. It’s not difficult to see why Cage is drawn to The Joker. For it ought, in theory, to be impossible to overact while playing the role. Not for a moment, we imagine, did Mark Hamill rein himself in while portraying the villain in the wonderful 90s TV show Batman: The Animated Series. Jack Nicholson hardly kept his powder dry for that pantomime turn in Tim Burton’s Batman (1989) and Heath Ledger put everything on the table in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008). And yet there is a fear that a Cage Joker might sending the movie he appeared in into a ravine. The actor seems too risky a proposition to replace Leto in the DCEU movies, where an unwieldy performance might further derail a cinematic universe. His Doctor Doom would be intriguing, however, and there is space to try for a definitive take on the Fantastic Four’s nemesis. Fargo and Legion’s Noah Hawley is said to be working on an origins story for the supervillain – though it’s unclear whether that production is likely to survive the character’s imminent move from Fox to Disney. It’s hard to imagine the big cheeses at Marvel casting Cage, given the actor’s propensity for eccentric decision-making and the MCU’s episodic nature. Cage as Doom might well become a highlight of the cinematic universe. But it’s just as likely that the star of the Ghost Rider movies would do something characteristically brave and daft at the same time, like deciding to play the part in unwieldy homage to Bela Lugosi (in tribute to Doom’s eastern European origins).

The 33-year-old CEO of Facebook appeared to spend the session perched atop a large cushion, swiftly dubbed a “booster seat” by social media users. Zuckerberg, at 5ft 7in (1.7m), is not especially short, but the cushion enabled him to maintain a higher profile while seated behind a desk for the duration of the five-hour hearing. A spokesperson for Facebook told the New York Post that it was “the committee’s standard practice” for comfort, and had not been brought along by either Facebook or Zuckerberg himself to enhance his height. But it was too late to stop the mocking on social media. Zuckerberg is due to appear before members of the US congress again on Wednesday, starting at 3pm BST/10am EST."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/11/indhu-rubasingham-relaunch-kilburn-tricycle-theatre-the-kiln-zadie-smith-white-teeth","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T10:23:18Z","webTitle":"Kilburn's Tricycle relaunches as Kiln theatre with Zadie Smith's White Teeth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/11/indhu-rubasingham-relaunch-kilburn-tricycle-theatre-the-kiln-zadie-smith-white-teeth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/11/indhu-rubasingham-relaunch-kilburn-tricycle-theatre-the-kiln-zadie-smith-white-teeth","fields":{"headline":"Kilburn's Tricycle relaunches as Kiln theatre with Zadie Smith's White Teeth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the six years since Indhu Rubasingham was appointed its artistic director, the Tricycle theatre has achieved three West End transfers, two Olivier awards, a Liberty human rights award and the distinction of mentoring hundreds of London’s teenage refugees through its Mind the Gap programme. Now, almost two years since it closed for a £7m facelift, the building is preparing for its most dramatic flourish. The Tricycle is no more: Rubasingham is relaunching it as the Kiln theatre. “It’s an opportunity we could only take at this moment,” she says, visibly excited as she gives me a hard-hats-and-fluoro-tabards tour of the refurbished space, which is still five months from being curtain-ready. “It’s been bubbling in my head and I never thought it would happen but it’s the next part of the story for this building. Kiln as a word is associative with Kilburn. Kilns have a relationship with cultures across the world, they are a physical thing, melting pots associated with heat and cooking.” To put it another way, Rubasingham is hoping to establish the Kiln theatre as the hottest ticket in town. “People who love us aren’t going to not come because we’ve changed the name,” she laughs. “We can’t have been that good in the first place if that’s true, but this is an opportunity to grab people who don’t go to the theatre. It’s for people who think we were a children’s theatre, or that we run yoga classes, or aren’t sure what we do.” Under her predecessor, Nicolas Kent, the Tricycle became known for political dramas such as The Great Game and The Bomb, and verbatim, tribunal plays, staging inquiries based on spoken evidence. “I do believe in political theatre,” says Rubasingham. “But I think I express it differently: my politics are that it’s about the story first and the stories we don’t hear, from the people who don’t have a platform. I’m committed to showing the world through different lenses.” To that end, her new season features six new plays including five world premieres, and one British premiere. The theatre reopens in September with Holy Sh!t by Alexis Zegerman, telling the story of two London couples and their four-year-old daughters, and will be followed by the theatre’s most ambitious project yet: the first stage adaptation of Zadie Smith’s White Teeth, a story rooted in the Kiln theatre’s north-west London neighbourhood. Both productions will be directed by Rubasingham. “New writing is risky,” says Rubasingham, of her tendency to avoid staging the classics, “but if you really want to be in on the zeitgeist and capture what people are thinking or talking about now, it’s the best way to do it.” She cackles when I mention that her gift for staging “caustic, foul-mouthed plays” has been praised in the Observer. “I love language whatever form that takes, I relish it.” Next January, a co-production with Tamasha and Live theatre companies will see taxi driver-turned-playwright Ishy Din follow-up his smash-hit 2012 play Snookered with Approaching Empty, a play set in a Middlesborough minicab office following the death of Margaret Thatcher. The Son, the final part of Florian Zeller’s acclaimed family trilogy (which includes The Father and The Mother), will carry the season into spring and will be followed by more new commissions from Samuel Adamson and Anupama Chandrasekhar. Rubasingham has had much to prove on her “longer, more meandering” journey to become one of the first women of colour to run a major London theatre. “Everything is defined by your race and gender when you’re not ‘normal’ in that picture,” she says, with slow consideration. When I first started, I was often asked, ‘How does being Asian influence you as a director?’ and I’d say, ‘I have no idea!’. Or, I would do plays with so many different writers and then be told, ‘Oh, it’s a shame you’ve been pigeonholed’. I wasn’t pigeonholed – I wanted to tell all these new stories! It’s such a tightrope, you have to be comfortable in your skin and have confidence in yourself. You don’t want to be a tickbox exercise or be accused of being a tokenistic add-on.” She was born in Sheffield, in a traditional Sri Lankan Tamil household, and studied drama at Hull University after a transformative stint of work experience at Nottingham Playhouse when she was 16. I ask, following the Royal Shakespeare Company’s recent suggestion that a theatre review in the Daily Mail had a “blatantly racist attitude”, whether critics have become less prejudiced during her career. She offers a wry smile and points me towards coverage of her Romeo and Juliet, which she set in Ottoman-era Istanbul at Chichester Festival theatre in 2002, or when she cast David Harewood in The Misanthrope. “But that journey of frustration and obstacles has informed me and pushed me,” she points out. “It made me better and made me clear about my vision. It’s more difficult if you do not see people like you in the industry, people like you on stage, people like you in the stories that are told. But it’s also the fuel that drives and makes me curious about people’s journeys and cultures, to fight for the unheard and tell stories that demand empathy.” As a consequence perhaps of running a building and endlessly applying for funding grants, Rubasingham has a tendency to speak in form-filling arts jargon, but her passion and talent burns bright; her current production of The Great Wave at the National Theatre, about the scandal of North Korea’s abduction of young Japanese citizens, has gripped audiences and sold out its run. She has a startling track record for kicking down the door of the established canon with new, original work. “Theatre needs different voices to make it relevant for now and the future,” she says, matter of fact. “It’s exhilarating.” This article was amended on 13 April 2018. An earlier version described Indhu Rubasingham as “the country’s first woman of colour to run a theatre”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/first-dog-on-the-moons-guide-to-australias-urban-stereotypes","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"First Dog on the Moon's guide to Australia's urban stereotypes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/first-dog-on-the-moons-guide-to-australias-urban-stereotypes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/first-dog-on-the-moons-guide-to-australias-urban-stereotypes","fields":{"headline":"First Dog on the Moon's guide to Australia's urban stereotypes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/11/first-home-owner-grants-and-the-peoples-bank-plan-push-house-prices-higher","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T05:42:54Z","webTitle":"First home owner grants and the people's bank plan push house prices higher | Stephen Koukoulas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/first-home-owner-grants-and-the-peoples-bank-plan-push-house-prices-higher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/first-home-owner-grants-and-the-peoples-bank-plan-push-house-prices-higher","fields":{"headline":"First home owner grants and the people's bank plan push house prices higher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Reserve Bank of Australia must be dismayed at the policies from several state governments that have increased cash payments to first home buyers and propose a people’s bank that, among other things, will make it easier for potential owner-occupiers to access credit and bid for a house. The last thing potential property buyers need is easier access to credit and cash handouts to boost demand. Indeed, the RBA and other regulators are still working the other way, keeping policy tight so that credit growth continues to slow and with that, there will be some rebalancing of household balance sheets away from ever increasing debt. The first home owners grant increases in NSW and Victoria have underpinned prices, with the number of first home buyers rising around 35% over the past year. In addition to adding to demand for housing, these policies have also been costly to the state budget position. Without this surge in first home buyer activity, house prices would have no doubt been weaker still and that may have allowed the RBA to be more proactive in setting monetary policy with an eye to boosting demand and lowering unemployment which would impact positively on wages growth and in time see inflation return to the target. One of the important economic issues that will likely have a significant impact on the economy and policy, is the fall in house prices that is steadily unfolding. Outside Darwin and Perth, where prices have slumped by over 20% and 10% respectively from their peaks, the falls are not yet substantial, but they could be signalling the early stages of a fall in household wealth which, if sustained, would have consequences for the economy. In the two mega-cities, Sydney and Melbourne, prices are down 4% and 1%, respectively, from the late 2017 peaks and according to the Corelogic price data, there is no evidence that the falls in prices are abating. A cooling housing market where prices stabilise or even fall a little, was a key aspect of the RBA decision to leave interest rates relatively high since about 2013 when the rest of the industrialised world was implementing near zero interest rates. Along with enhancing financial stability, a weakening in house price growth was an unspoken but obvious consequence from the regulators as they imposed a range of rules to scale back bank lending, especially to investors and more risky borrowers. The cost to the rest of the economy of deflating the house price boom has been sub-trend economic growth, little or no progress in reducing unemployment, ongoing weakness in wages and depressed levels of business investment. The RBA had made it abundantly clear that it is happy to see the economy pay this price for the sake of a weaker house prices and a marked slowing in credit growth. Yet some policy advocates are looking at ways to rekindle demand for housing which would completely undermine the years of RBA policy. This is where the boost to first home owners grant and the proposed people’s banks are unhelpful. As the RBA and other housing analysts have often noted, the best long run way to further improve housing affordability is to increase the supply of dwellings relative to changes in demand. Translated, this means building more dwellings in areas that are well services by public transport, school, shops, employment opportunities and other basic amenities. This means either increasing the population density in the big cities, which is reasonably easy to plan for, or undertaking a significant spend on infrastructure so that living away from the centre of the major cities is more desirable. If the government also wants to see an improvement in housing affordability, it could trim the immigration inflow which would work from scaling back underlying demand. It is easy to do – the stroke of a pen could see immigration levels lowered. Many issues in economics and economic policy can be analysed and the problems addressed with relatively straightforward policy prescriptions. For housing, it is adding to supply relative to a given level of demand. Well intentioned policies, such as the first home owners grant and the home buyer friendly people’s bank, work the other way and make housing even more unaffordable. They also suffer from the economists nightmare of complexity and productivity destroying red tape, and even a cursory look at the economic effects make them counterproductive. They push prices higher as would-be buyers go to housing auctions with access to more money either with the grant or extra credit. While these misguided policies are in place or threatened to be imposed, it will be harder for housing prices to adjust so that affordability is further improved, especially for would be first home buyers. • Stephen Koukoulas is a research fellow at Per Capita, a progressive thinktank"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T04:00:40Z","webTitle":"The key moments from Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to Congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments","fields":{"headline":"The key moments from Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to Congress","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, faced US Congress for the first time on Tuesday over the data sharing scandal. Zuckerberg answered questions from the Senate commerce and judiciary committees on privacy, data mining, regulations and Cambridge Analytica during the course of the marathon five-hour hearing. Here are the key moments: Right to privacy “I believe it’s important to tell people exactly how the information that they share on Facebook is going to be used. “That’s why, every single time you go to share something on Facebook, whether it’s a photo in Facebook, or a message, every single time, there’s a control right there about who you’re going to be sharing it with ... and you can change that and control that in line. “To your broader point about the privacy policy ... long privacy policies are very confusing. And if you make it long and spell out all the detail, then you’re probably going to reduce the per cent of people who read it and make it accessible to them.” His own privacy Senator Dick Durbin asked if Zuckerberg would be comfortable sharing the name of the hotel he stayed in last night. “No. I would probably not choose to do that publicly, here” he said. “I think everyone should have control over how their information is used.” Cambridge Analytica “Cambridge Analytica wasn’t using our services in 2015, as far as we can tell ... They weren’t an advertiser. They weren’t running pages. So we actually had nothing to ban.” Later Zuckerberg corrected himself. “I want to correct one thing that I said earlier in response to a question … [on] why we didn’t ban Cambridge Analytica at the time when we learned about them in 2015. “[From] what my understanding was ... they were not on the platform, [they] were not an app developer or advertiser. When I went back and met with my team afterwards, they let me know that Cambridge Analytica actually did start as an advertiser later in 2015. “So we could have in theory banned them then. We made a mistake by not doing so. But I just wanted to make sure that I updated that because I ... I ... I misspoke, or got that wrong earlier. “When we heard back from Cambridge Analytica that they had told us that they weren’t using the data and deleted it, we considered it a closed case. In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake. We shouldn’t have taken their word for it. We’ve updated our policy to make sure we don’t make that mistake again.” Storing and selling personal data “Yes, we store data ... some of that content with people’s permission.” “There’s a very common misconception that we sell data to advertisers. We do not sell data to advertisers.” “What we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement … That’s a very fundamental part of how our model works and something that is often misunderstood.” Senator Tammy Baldwin asks whether the Cambridge University neuroscientist Aleksandr Kogan sold the Facebook data to anyone besides Cambridge Analytica? Zuckerberg: “Yes, he did.” “We’re investigating every single app that had access to a large amount of information in the past. And if we find that someone improperly used data, we’re going to ban them from Facebook and tell everyone affected.” Regulations “My position is not that there should be no regulation. “I think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people’s lives, is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or not.” Russian interference “One of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016. “We have kicked off an investigation … I imagine we’ll find some things. “There are people in Russia whose job it is to try to exploit our systems and other internet systems and other systems as well. “This is an ongoing arms race. As long as there are people sitting in Russia whose job is it to try to interfere in elections around the world, this is going to be an ongoing conflict.” Taking responsibility “It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. “I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here. “It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/10/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-congress-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T02:03:50Z","webTitle":"Congress tried to crack Zuckerberg – but Facebook still has all the power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/10/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-congress-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/10/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-congress-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Congress tried to crack Zuckerberg – but Facebook still has all the power","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If there was one moment that crystallized the absurdity of Tuesday’s marathon Senate grilling of Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, it was the tweets. Two tweets, one each from Senators Richard Blumenthal and Kamala Harris, urged their constituents to follow a link to their own Facebook pages, where they were streaming Facebook Live video of the proceedings on Capitol Hill. The pair of Democrats were among the sharpest questioners of Zuckerberg on a day that was long on political theatrics and short on new information. But their tweets reveal the unspoken dynamic: Zuckerberg is in the hot seat today, but Facebook still has all the power. No matter how much political hay elected officials might make out of criticizing Facebook, they are just as locked into the system as other users are. Legislation, regulation or antitrust action could change that by loosening Facebook’s stranglehold on our data and attention, but all three are exceedingly unlikely in the current political climate. So while the politicians raged within the confines of their self-imposed impotence and Zuckerberg unveiled the latest in artificial intelligence (he presumably programmed himself to begin every sentence with “Senator”), Facebook’s stock price had one of its best days since the Observer broke the news of the massive data harvest last month. Facebook is such a pervasive force in modern society that it was impossible for all 44 senators to limit themselves to the ostensible topic of the hearing: social media privacy and data. Questions from the senators, who got five minutes apiece, covered issues including foreign interference in elections, illegal discrimination in advertising, law enforcement access to data, the tech industry’s lack of diversity, the impenetrable prose of Facebook’s terms of service, social media addiction, hate speech, censorship, monopoly and competition, the persistent suspicion among users that Facebook is listening to their conversations (it’s not), and the difference between platforms and publishers. Zuckerberg hewed closely to his talking points, which relied heavily on Facebook’s foundational myth: that users are in control of their data. Again and again, the 33-year-old executive asserted that users control who has access to the data they “share” with Facebook. When questions were raised about information that Facebook derives about its users separately from their status updates or photographs – the decidedly creepier ad-tech surveillance that allows Facebook to do things like track users across the internet – Zuckerberg dodged, deflected and at times even claimed ignorance. When Harris finally got to speak, she used up much of her five minutes with a list of all the questions Zuckerberg hadn’t answered, including “whether Facebook can track activity after a user logs off, whether Facebook can track you across devices, who is Facebook’s biggest competition, [and] whether Facebook stores up to 96 categories of users’ information”. There were some interesting exchanges, especially from those senators who treated Zuckerberg more like the billionaire executive that he is than the precocious college student that he undoubtedly once was. Senator Patrick Leahy raised the urgent question of Facebook’s complicity in amplifying the hate speech that has fueled the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in Myanmar – and cut Zuckerberg off when he offered platitudes about the “terrible tragedy”. Blumenthal revealed that the terms of service for the app that was used by Aleksandr Kogan to harvest the data in question actually did include permission for his company to “edit, copy, disseminate, publish, transfer, append or merge with other databases, sell, license (by whatever means and on whatever terms) and archive” the information – calling into question Facebook’s stance that Kogan “deceived” them. Senator Jerry Moran, in a back and forth about whether Facebook violated its consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, got Zuckerberg to concede that “the system worked as it was designed” when Kogan harvested the data: “The issue is that we designed the system in a way that wasn’t good.” And Zuckerberg revealed that Kogan sold his cache of data to other companies besides Cambridge Analytica. In the end, it was Zuckerberg’s attitude toward his own privacy that was most revealing of the difference between the control that Facebook offers users and actual privacy. Zuckerberg said many times that he and his all his family used Facebook – a talking point we were apparently meant to take as proof that Facebook is safe. Yet under questioning from Senator Dick Durbin, Zuckerberg expressed discomfort with revealing certain personal information, such as which hotel he was staying at while in Washington DC. I’m a relatively well-informed Facebook user. I probably pay more attention than most people to privacy settings, and I consistently turn off things like location tracking. And yet, my Facebook data includes dozens of cases where the company has logged my location based on my IP address. Zuckerberg may not want us to know where he slept last night, but his company sure as hell knows where the rest of us are sleeping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/10/bill-cosby-retrial-heidi-thomas-accuser","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T23:19:34Z","webTitle":"Bill Cosby retrial: first accuser describes being drugged before days of attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/bill-cosby-retrial-heidi-thomas-accuser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/10/bill-cosby-retrial-heidi-thomas-accuser","fields":{"headline":"Bill Cosby retrial: first accuser describes being drugged before days of attacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The first of six Bill Cosby accusers has taken the witness stand at his retrial in Pennsylvania, recalling in disturbing detail how she was allegedly lured to the comic’s house in Reno, Nevada, made to consume an unidentified soporific and then attacked over four days of semi-consciousness. Heidi Thomas, from Castle Rock, Colorado, took the 12 men and women of the jury back to 1984, when she was 24 and hoping to build a career in musical theater. While she was still seeking a break in the entertainment business, her agent, the late Annie Maloney of JF Images, contacted her and said an icon in the industry, whom she referred to only as “Mr C”, was looking for “promising young talent” to mentor. A phone call was arranged and Bill Cosby came on the line. “He said he was looking forward to working with me, that I had been highly recommended,” Thomas told the jury in courtroom A of the Montgomery county court of common pleas. It was the second day of the retrial, and the first occasion in which a Cosby accuser had been heard directly recounting allegations of abuse. The TV celebrity has denied that he drugged and molested Thomas, as he has denied the allegations of all of the more than 50 other women who have publicly accused him. He now stands trial for the second time in 10 months – the first trial, last June, ended in a mistrial – on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. After Tuesday, the trial will continue with four other accusers as well as the woman at the center of the prosecution, Andrea Constand, still to tell their stories. In her testimony on Tuesday, Thomas went on to relate how a flight was arranged to Reno in April 1984. She was picked up by a driver in a black sedan and driven out of the city to a ranch-style house where, to her surprise, Cosby personally answered the door to her. She found herself, also to her amazement, alone in the house with the star of The Cosby Show. She said he encouraged her to dress in something more comfortable, then asked her to to read from a play script to him to assess her acting abilities. “I’m looking [the script] over and I realize the person I’m supposed to be playing is intoxicated,” Thomas said under prosecution questioning. She tried to act drunk – not an easy challenge as she came from a dry family and had never herself had the experience of intoxication. Cosby appeared unimpressed by her rendition of a drunk woman, she said. Then he asked her: “If you were to drink, what would you drink?” and handed her a glass of white wine. After just one sip, Thomas alleged from the witness stand, the world changed on her. She remembers very little after that – for the next four days, all she retained were tiny slivers of memory that she called “snapshots”. “There’s nothing, there’s just a blank, until there’s a picture, and then another blank, and then a picture,” she said. Snapshot one: “I remember waking up on a bed, I don’t know whose bed. I had my clothes on, he did not. I was lying down and he was forcing himself in my mouth. I remember thinking I felt sick, and how did I get here?” Snapshot two: “His head was at the head of the bed. My head was at the foot of the bed. I heard his voice saying – he always referred to himself in the third person, he was either ‘Mr C’ or ‘your friend’ – and he said, ‘Your friend is going to come again.’” Snapshot three: “I don’t know how I got there, but I had just slammed the door to that room. I thought, ‘I’ve just slammed the door on Bill Cosby!’ I remember opening the door again and saying sorry and then closing it very quietly.” The rest of the Reno trip, Thomas said, was similarly fuzzy. She eventually made her way back home to Denver, but did not tell her agent or her parents about what had happened. She only revealed the experience to her husband years later. She blamed herself for the events. “I did feel like I must have said something that was misunderstood. I needed to fix this, to work out what I said and work out where I messed up.” She only had one other encounter with Cosby, she told the jury. A few months after Reno, she arranged to go to one of his shows in St Louis, Missouri, where she wanted to talk to him about what she had done wrong to make him think he could treat her like that. But after the show, they were surrounded by Cosby fans and they could not speak privately. “It was clear at this point this mentoring wasn’t happening, I wasn’t going to get any answers to what I had done wrong.” She had never seen Bill Cosby from that day until Tuesday, when she sat about 15 feet away from him in courtroom A. Throughout her testimony, Cosby remained silent, sitting slightly slumped in a chair located by his defense team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/10/mick-mccarthy-ipswich-leaves-post-barnsley-win","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T21:28:13Z","webTitle":"Mick McCarthy leaves Ipswich post despite victory over Barnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/10/mick-mccarthy-ipswich-leaves-post-barnsley-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/10/mick-mccarthy-ipswich-leaves-post-barnsley-win","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m out of here’: McCarthy leaves Ipswich post despite victory over Barnsley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mick McCarthy dramatically announced his departure as Ipswich manager following their 1-0 victory over Barnsley. A headed goal from Danish World Cup hopeful Jonas Knudsen in the 54th minute following a corner won the game for the home side. But it was McCarthy who grabbed the headlines after he was quizzed about the fans’ negative reaction to the 56th-minute substitution of debutant Barry Cotter. The former Republic of Ireland boss, who was already due to leave the club at the end of the season, retorted: “I won’t have to listen to that again, that’s my last game - I’m out of here.” His curt remark cut short his managerial career at Ipswich with four games to go in the Championship, with his relationship with some of the home fans reaching a low point. A spokesman for the club said he made the decision to leave the club along with his assistant Terry Connor on Sunday, following the 1-0 away defeat against Brentford, and plans are being made to put in a replacement until the end of the season. The Blues boss, who announced at the end of March he would be leaving his role in the summer, gave a three-minute press conference at the end of the game before revealing he was leaving. Reacting to boos when young defender Cotter was substituted in the second half, McCarthy said: “It was a disgraceful reaction, that, but I won’t have to listen to it again because that’s my last game. I’m out of here.” With that he banged the desk and departed, with the club then confirming the news on their website and Twitter feed. “I spoke with Marcus (Evans, owner) at the weekend and we agreed that it was in the best interests for me, the players and the club that I move on now,” McCarthy said in the website story. “I said I would see the season out but it’s been a new experience and it’s not one I have been enjoying to be honest. “I have continued to do my job to the best of my ability but there is something missing and I’m not comfortable with that. “I have had a great time here and worked with some great people and to all those who have given me wonderful support over the last five and a half years - and there are many - I want to put on record my personal thanks. “The players here can look forward to a new challenge with whoever comes in and I want to wish them, the staff and the club the best of fortunes.” McCarthy was linked with his hometown club Barnsley before the appointment of Jose Morais, who saw his side’s hopes of Championship survival take a hit with Tuesday’s result. Morais said: “It’s a defeat and there’s nothing more than to move on. All the games are big games and must-win games and we expected this game to be a must-win game. It was a difficult game, I don’t expect it to be easy, but I expect us to have the ability to win. “We created chances and we had the chances to lead the game and the confidence still exists in the team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/10/zuckerberg-facebook-testimony-latest-news-regulation-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T01:17:07Z","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg vows to fight election meddling in marathon Senate grilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/10/zuckerberg-facebook-testimony-latest-news-regulation-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/10/zuckerberg-facebook-testimony-latest-news-regulation-congress","fields":{"headline":"Mark Zuckerberg vows to fight election meddling in marathon Senate grilling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, warned on Tuesday of an online propaganda “arms race” with Russia and vowed that fighting interference in elections around the world is now his top priority. The 33-year-old billionaire, during testimony that lasted nearly five hours, was speaking to Congress in what was widely seen as a moment of reckoning for America’s tech industry. It came in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which, Facebook has admitted, the personal information of up to 87 million users were harvested without their permission. Zuckerberg’s comments gave an insight into the unnerving reach and influence of Facebook in numerous democratic societies. “The most important thing I care about right now is making sure no one interferes in the various 2018 elections around the world,” he said under questioning by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico. The senator made reference to a billboard displayed earlier in the hearing that showed images – including Trump, the Green Party candidate Jill Stein and the Confederate flag – allegedly spread online by Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election. He asked if Zuckerberg could guarantee such images would not appear on Facebook again. “Senator, no, I can’t guarantee that because this is an ongoing arms race,” the CEO said. “As long as there are people sitting in Russia whose job it is to try and interfere with elections around the world, this is going to be an ongoing conflict.” Earlier in the hearing, Zuckerberg acknowledged that “one of my greatest regrets in running the company” was being slow to uncover and act against disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the election. The blockbuster joint hearing of the US Senate’s commerce and judiciary committees on Capitol Hill was a humbling moment for the young entrepreneur. Wearing a suit, white shirt and sky blue tie instead of his customary T-shirt, he sat contrite and silent as senator after senator expressed deep concerns about the company’s gathering of personal information. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, told him: “Let me just cut to the chase. If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy anymore. If Facebook and other online companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to. We, the Congress.” Senator John Thune, a Republican and the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, noted that Facebook’s business model offers a free service in exchange for personal data. “For this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to know what’s involved,” he said. “I’m not convinced Facebook’s users have the information they need to make decisions.” Thune added: “Mr Zuckerberg, in many ways you and the company that you’ve created, the story you’ve created, represent the American dream ... At the same time, you have an obligation, and it’s up to you, to ensure that dream doesn’t become a privacy nightmare for the scores of people who use Facebook.” Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the Cambridge Analytica story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper in the UK, and he continued to apologize several times during Tuesday’s hearing. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook should not have trusted Cambridge Analytica’s assurance that it would stop using the personal information it harvested. “In retrospect, that was a mistake. We shouldn’t have taken their word for it. We considered that a closed case.” He admitted that Facebook did not alert the Federal Trade Commission about the data collection. Under questioning, he promised that Facebook was conducting a “full investigation” into every app that has access to users’ information, numbering tens of thousands. “If we find they’re doing anything improper, we’ll ban them from Facebook,” he said. He also initially claimed that Cambridge Analytica had not been an advertiser in 2015 but, after a brief adjournment in which he consulted with staff, he corrected himself: it had indeed been an advertiser later that year and therefore could have been banned. When Zuckerberg, who was making his first appearance before Congress, first took his seat, surrounded by a thick forest of clicking cameras, he looked somewhat like a prisoner in the dock. But he seemed to grow in confidence as the afternoon wore on and tried to appear open and cooperative. He frequently used the respectful term “Senator” and complimented them for asking “important questions”, some of which he said “his team” would report back on later. Some senators tried to throw him off balance. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly: “Your user agreement sucks.” Democrat Dick Durbin asked: “Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?” There was a long pause before Zuckerberg replied: “No.” There was laughter in the room. But the Facebook co-founder was not eviscerated as some commentators had predicted. The stock market agreed: Facebook’s price, which had fallen badly in recent weeks, ended the day up 4.5%. Zuckerberg evidently felt he was acquitting himself well. When Thune asked if he wanted a break after nearly two hours in the spotlight, the witness said: “We can do a few more.” He turned and smiled at his team and there was laughter in the public gallery. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal then almost gave him cause to regret it. He challenged Facebook’s contention that Aleksandr Kogan, a Moldovan-born researcher from Cambridge University, deceived the company when he harvested user data. Blumenthal had what he claimed was a previously undisclosed 2014 terms of service document that explicitly permitted Kogan to “sell, licence (by whatever means and on whatever terms) and archive your contribution and data”. Blumenthal said: “We’ve seen the apology tours before. You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical violation to report this violation of the FTC consent decree. My reservation about your testimony today is that I don’t see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road. Your business model is to maximise profit over privacy.” Several topics dominated the hearing, including the 2016 presidential election. Zuckerberg confirmed that Facebook officials have been interviewed by officials from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been investigating Russia’s role in meddling in the 2016 election. “I know we are working with them,” said Zuckerberg, acknowledging that “there may be” a subpoena but he was uncertain. Regulation was also brought up repeatedly, including by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who asked Zuckerberg whether Facebook was a monopoly. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” he replied, prompting mirth in the public gallery. Graham pressed him on the issue of regulation. Zuckerberg said: “My position is not that there should be no regulation.” Asked if Facebook would therefore embrace regulation, the CEO said: “If it’s the right regulation, then yes.” Graham: “Would you work with us?” Zuckerberg: “Absolutely.” Senator John Cornyn pushed him on whether Facebook is a neutral platform. Zuckerberg replied: “I agree that we are responsible for the content” – a significant concession that could open the way for Facebook to be held to the same legal standards as a traditional media company. Zuckerberg will face a second grilling on Wednesday from the US House energy and commerce committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/10/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-pay-90m-for-paulo-dybala","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T08:38:08Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to pay £90m for Paulo Dybala? | Nick Ames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/10/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-pay-90m-for-paulo-dybala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/10/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-pay-90m-for-paulo-dybala","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to pay £90m for Paulo Dybala?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liverpool clearly need some help running riot against highly favoured opponents so, before they try to do it all again at the Etihad, the grapevine is abuzz with suggestions they would like someone to do the honours next season. That man is Paulo Dybala, the Juventus whizz, for whom Jürgen Klopp could cough up £90m before sitting back and watching his team attack, attack, attack. Should that not come off there is always Fiorentina’s winger Federico Chiesa – the son of 1990s favourite Enrico – whom Liverpool and Chelsea are both keen on and his manager, Stefano Pioli, admits the 20-year-old could depart the club in pre-season. The picture is slightly more modest across Stanley Park but Sam Allardyce – assuming in bold Big Sam fashion that he will be in charge of Everton next season – has his eyes on a big-money addition of his own. He would like to shell out £25m on the West Ham left-back Aaron Cresswell, who is apparently keen on a move back to his home city. Westfield or Las Ramblas? That could be the dilemma facing Barcelona’s Yerry Mina at the end of the season, with West Ham keen on snapping up the Colombian defender on loan. He only arrived at the Camp Nou in January and a dash of Premier League experience is thought useful for his long-term prospects. Another South American could join David Moyes’s project this summer, but rather more cheaply than expected. Salomón Rondón will be available for £16.5m if – when – West Brom are relegated, meaning they will receive around half the sum Tianjin Quanjian offered them a year or so back. West Ham are up for the bargain but Chelsea and Tottenham could also see the Venezuelan as a decent back-up bet for their current first-choice forwards. Perhaps Rondón would fill the boots of Javier Hernández, whose vital equaliser at Stamford Bridge came from the bench and who is cheesed off at his lack of starting action, making him consider a move once this season is done. Meanwhile, some of the league’s bigger guns are chasing wonderkids for – and you can decide – stockpiling or careful, step-by-step introduction to the first team. Manchester United are interested in the Sheffield Wednesday forward George Hirst – another son of a famous father, David – while Arsenal are favourites for Real Madrid’s attacking midfielder Robert Navarro after Manchester City cooled their interest. Navarro turns 16 on 12 April and, after that, can choose his own career adventure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/10/centrist-party-politics-reform-womens-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T09:30:23Z","webTitle":"A centrist party backed by the people who created this mess is pointless | Sophie Walker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/centrist-party-politics-reform-womens-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/10/centrist-party-politics-reform-womens-equality","fields":{"headline":"A centrist party backed by the people who created this mess is pointless","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dear Simon Franks, As the leader of Britain’s newest political party, the Women’s Equality party, I thought I’d offer some reflections on the job ahead as you prepare to take the plunge with a new, centrist party. First of all – congratulations. You’ve fundraised 50 million quid already. No matter that according to one person close to your project you “don’t have a viable plan”. Money talks. Politics is built on it. Election campaigns are won with it. Trust me: I represent women, who make up most of Britain’s poorest people and generally don’t have millions of pounds to invest in a political system that has barely seen them. The fact that our party isn’t heard as much as I predict yours will be is directly related to the difference in our bank accounts. Second of all – you’ve got the perfect political profile for these anti-establishment times. You’re white, male and a businessman. Hey presto! You are perfectly placed to follow Donald Trump and Nigel Farage in persuading voters that really, you are just like them. This will be a particular advantage when the alternative centre-ground party that is also mobilising right now launches under the aegis of Tony Blair and disgruntled MPs. Third – you will have the grateful thanks of all of the other new political parties for taking the blame for “splitting the vote”. This criticism will be levelled at you mainly by the Labour party, but probably also by some Conservatives, given that you look like you’re planning to park some tanks on their lawn too. Don’t go thinking the vote belongs to the electorate. In fact it belongs to the two main parties who have taken it as their due for centuries and won’t hear otherwise. Good luck convincing them that they have to earn their votes. You have some very distinct advantages. But I think one of your disadvantages is perhaps a lack of strategy. So let’s examine at this point exactly what public need you are responding to. The country is split and divided as never before. Brexit seems inevitable, without us ever having the national conversation about fair immigration and investment that was promised. The Liberal Democrats staked their 2017 election hopes on being the party for remainers who wanted to stop Brexit. But remainers didn’t vote for them in big enough numbers and the experiment failed. Meanwhile right and left are polarised as never before. And after last year’s snap election, our first past the post voting system was condemned by the Electoral Reform Society as failing a diverse electorate forced to choose between two camps and largely reduced to voting tactically. More than two-thirds of the total votes were wasted. Given all of the above, I have to say that a party backed by the same people who have formed and funded the current state of dysfunction isn’t really going to cut it. You’re not going to break the Westminster mould by scraping the mould from policies that aren’t working. It’s not a new party people want – it’s a whole new way of doing politics. And guess what, Simon – that whole new way of doing politics is right out there. Another movement for change has been swelling over the last year and a half. And this one is truly thrilling. A global Women’s March in January 2017 gave way to a huge uprising; a #MeToo collective consciousness-raising that has breathed new life into politics. Radical political ideas, on the scale required to rescue us – investment in social infrastructure on a par with physical infrastructure, universal childcare and truly shared parenting, and a socially just immigration system – are beginning to find traction. New ways of doing politics are emerging too – the first thing the Women’s Equality party did after registering with the Electoral Commission was to throw our doors open to members of all other political parties and start mobilising activists who had never before been involved in politics. Because at this point, it’s only those at the very margins of our political system who have the understanding of how to entirely rebuild our toxic institutions and tired democracy. You’ve got £50m burning a hole in your pocket. Such is the casual power of men who have been wielding it for so long they have no clue how hard the rest of us must fight for our voices to be heard, to shine a light on perspectives that aren’t white and male and establishment, to focus on the experiences of those who have been left behind. You don’t need to rebrand the current turbulence as the lack of a centrist party. Join those of us who are already out here dealing with that turbulence to build something really new. • Sophie Walker is the leader of the Women’s Equality party and a former Reuters journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/12/the-hateful-eighth-artists-frontline-ireland-abortion-rights-battle-eighth-amendment","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"The hateful Eighth: artists at the frontline of Ireland's abortion rights battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/12/the-hateful-eighth-artists-frontline-ireland-abortion-rights-battle-eighth-amendment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/12/the-hateful-eighth-artists-frontline-ireland-abortion-rights-battle-eighth-amendment","fields":{"headline":"The hateful Eighth: artists at the frontline of Ireland's abortion rights battle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On the road to Limerick from the airport, you can see two huge billboards funded by a Christian lobby group. One shows a foetus at 11 weeks’ gestation with the words “one of us”. Another shows a man saying he would never forget what he saw while working in an operating theatre where abortions were taking place (though the poster implies he was a nurse, the hospital revealed he was a porter). It is six weeks until the referendum in Ireland on whether the eighth amendment to the constitution – which essentially gave a foetus the same rights as the woman carrying it – should be repealed, and the campaigning on both sides is intensifying. One of the groups involved is the Artists’ Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment. On Friday, they will stage a procession through the streets as part of the opening of Limerick’s biennial art festival, EVA International. Pointedly, it will start at the city’s art college, housed in a former Magdalene laundry – the workhouse where “promiscuous” or “fallen” women were sent. The campaign began in 2015, following Ireland’s referendum that legalised same-sex marriage. “The eighth amendment has always been unfinished business for every feminist,” says one of the founders, painter and sculptor Cecily Brennan. As an art student, she campaigned during the 1983 referendum that brought the amendment in. She has come with one of her co-founders, painter and sculptor Alice Maher, and we are sitting in an empty room above the EVA offices, in a beautiful Georgian building. They now have more than 3,500 signatories from every arts discipline in Ireland, including high-profile supporters such as writers Anne Enright and Edna O’Brien and actor Saoirse Ronan. “Immediately it opened, artists were signing up in thousands,” says Maher. “It gave us great courage. Then we moved into actions, because we thought, we’ve got all these signatories, what are we going to do with them?” In 2016, the Irish government set up the Citizens’ Assembly, a body of randomly chosen members of the public, to discuss issues such as abortion and climate change; out of it came women’s stories about how the eighth amendment had impacted them. “That had a huge effect on people, and we saw that was how to reach people – with true stories,” says Maher. The same year, the Artists’ Campaign created A Day of Testimonies, in which women’s stories were read at a theatre. “The arts at its best allows discussion, allows people to experience something, look at it, listen to it, consider it for their own selves,” says Brennan. “It opens places that haven’t been open for a long time. That was our experience about the debate about abortion – it had not been public. Art helped to bring it out in a different way.” EVA International will include recordings of 12 testimonies, as well as a film programme Brennan is putting together. (The 12-week arts programme also takes in big themes such as technology and national identity.) Their banners will be shown in an exhibition after the procession, and the campaign archive – letters, press cuttings – will also be on display. People can come along and shred pages with symbolic number eights. “It’s a live campaign, right there,” says Maher. The banners were painted and embroidered by Maher and some of the other artists involved in the campaign, including Rachel Fallon, Áine Phillips and Breda Mayock. One is based on the painting David and Goliath by Orazio Gentileschi, kept in the National Gallery of Ireland, and shows a young woman slaying a dragon; another alludes to Piero della Francesca’s Renaissance image of the Madonna – the artists’ version has her dress covered with an eye motif. “We’re very aware of the power of imagery,” says Maher. “When you reclaim imagery, you take the power back. We’re also aware of them being beautiful objects, and our intent was that they would be gathered in a national collection and nobody could say that we didn’t fight for our rights.” I meet Fallon later. She is wearing an apron she has made, in linen and pink silk satin, with the motto: “To ensure hope is our role”. Six aprons will be part of the procession, decorated with military mottos that can be read when the apron is unfolded and pulled up to the chest. It was important, she says, that the banners be positive. “I think visuals are really important to people and it does change how you see something. If it’s not aggressive, it leaves an opening to talk rather than presenting something as a dogmatic fact. As a counterbalance to these at times horrific photos the anti-choice side like to show, [we] try to create a visual culture that is more hopeful.” Work by other Irish artists in EVA also speaks to the debate about reproductive rights. Take the images of Madonna and child by the Irish modernist painter Mainie Jellett, who worked in the 1920s and 30s. “Her work is fascinating,” says EVA’s curator Inti Guerrero, “not only because of modernism, but because you can see all the tensions and struggles that are linked to how to negotiate being modern and advanced and at the same time being highly Catholic and religious.” Activist, theatre director and writer Grace Dyas will be showing her 2017 performance work Not at Home. Made with Emma Fraser, it includes video footage of a journey from Ireland to a UK abortion clinic in Liverpool, and a performance of stories women submitted to the artists. “It’s about seeing that journey,” says Dyas. “We have all had friends or family members who have travelled or considered travelling. So many women in Ireland have had this experience, and we felt their voices weren’t being heard.” Dyas says: “What [the country is] basically saying is, ‘Yes, you can have an abortion, but not at home.’ We wanted to ask women: what are the consequences? Some of the things that came back were really shocking.” One woman told them she had forgotten she wasn’t meant to eat or drink anything before the procedure, and had a cup of tea at the airport; she couldn’t come back for a termination another day and so went through it without anaesthetic. Another woman bled all over the bathmat at a B&amp;B in Manchester. “The reality of people’s experiences transcends polemical debating language,” says Dyas. “Art can show the humanity and help people find the nuance in their own opinions.” The mood among the artists I speak to is hopeful, but wary. “It’s a world movement,” says Fallon. “In the same way all eyes, especially in the rightwing Christian groups in America, are looking at how things will pan out here, I think we’ve also taken in a lot from women’s groups around the world. Nobody could have imagined #MeToo.” Brennan and Maher have been fighting for change for 35 years. It does feel different now, they say. “The Catholic church has lost its power,” says Maher. “They really pulled a big one in 1983 from the altar. What has happened since then is a big change.” Nonetheless, Maher doesn’t underestimate the power of the other side, “or the power of leftover Catholicism in the deepest recesses of the psyche”. Brennan adds: “Or the fear of women’s bodies”. Across the bridge, at a former condensed-milk factory, a monument by the Croatian artist Sanja Iveković is being constructed. Rendered in gilt, nine metres in the air, it dazzles against a constantly changing Limerick sky. It was first shown in Luxembourg in 2001, a replica of the city’s war memorial, but in Iveković’s version the figure is pregnant. The original inscriptions to the heroes of the first world war were changed to words including “whore, bitch, Madonna, virgin”. Changing the inscription “related to the violence that occurs within institutionalised misogyny,” says Guerrero. “It created this radical public statue.” Several years on, in a different country, and within the context of the referendum, it now relates to “how pregnancy is heavily politicised ... the body of a pregnant woman belongs always to the larger society and not to the freedom of the individual. The work asks why is it that historically we disallow women to own their body and let the collective decide?” EVA International, Limerick, runs from 14 April to 8 July. The street procession by Artists’ Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment will take place on Friday 13 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
