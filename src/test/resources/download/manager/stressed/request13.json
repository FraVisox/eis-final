It’s 10pm at Flying Kites, a school in rural Kenya, and a handful of orphaned students who don’t have homes to go to are sleeping in the bedroom just behind where we’re sitting. Wawerũ has taken a long pause in her story. She smoothes the wrinkles on her skirt and rubs her shins, which are covered in thick purple scars – some slashes are so raised they look like slugs warming themselves by the fire. “What do you mean you had to cut the umbilical cord yourself?” I ask, and we’re both laughing again, like two women recounting a crazy night out. Except we’re not. We’re talking about Wawerũ giving birth to her first child alone on a dirt floor in Njabini, a small village in the foothills of Kenya’s Aberdare mountains. And I probably shouldn’t be laughing, but Wawerũ is an incredible storyteller and very funny. “And then I nursed the baby and made chai. You just do what you have to!” she says, leaning back against the wall, and I am in awe. Ten years ago, I started working in Njabini – and for the past decade I’ve split my time between there and Boston. The older I get, the harder it is to adjust to the back and forth. I find myself stumbling into the disorientating gap of privilege and poverty with increased clumsiness. I messed up. When I found out I was pregnant, I thought about Wawerũ and all the women I knew in rural Kenya who had similar stories to her and I idolised them in a way that romanticised their poverty and nearly cost me my life. After years of working in development, it still surprises me how naive I was. We were back in Boston, and planned to stay there for the pregnancy, which, to begin with, proceeded as normal. My husband, Mike, quickly bought into America’s tendency to scare every pregnant woman into buying all the things. It seemed like he had downloaded every app and ordered every book. Small bottles of thick red juice called Prenatal Revive suddenly showed up in our fridge (revolting) and a tub of something from Burt’s Bees called Belly Butter appeared on my bathroom sink. But I vehemently rejected what I felt was the commodification of the pregnant woman’s body and I made reference to all of my friends in rural Kenya who had done fine without it. Whenever he asked me what my plan for something was, I wanted to answer truthfully: “Mike. My plan is just to hold on for dear life while my body does what it was made to do, just as all women have done, since the beginning of time.” Women give birth all the time without making a big deal of it. I saw no reason that it wouldn’t be exactly the same for me. Our first doctor’s appointment was with a sweet nurse. She advised me not to travel to rural Kenya and I rolled my eyes. She asked me how I’d been feeling and I said I’d been feeling sick and that the week prior, I’d experienced an episode of pains. She smiled reassuringly. I didn’t make demands for second opinions. I didn’t scour WedMD. I reminded myself: “Leila, this is older than you. Much older than you. There is nothing for you to control or achieve here.” On the way to our second prenatal appointment, I felt a sharp pain. The closer we drove to the doctor’s office, the worse it got. I rolled down the window, peeled off my sweater and began to breathe intensely. I don’t remember much after telling Mike that I was going to pass out, but I turned white and slumped over. He screamed my name and drove at full speed to the emergency room, one hand on my inert body, straight through a red light, arriving at the doors of the ER screaming for help. Within minutes, I had IVs in both arms, bags of blood being pumped into me so quickly that some spilled on to the white floor, and a doctor saying, “Leila, stay with me. Leila.” I heard him command someone across the room to arrange a helicopter for us. “I don’t want a helicopter,” I whimpered through the oxygen mask to a woman standing over me. “Why? It will be fun,” she said unconvincingly, her gaze not moving from the screen above my head, “Are you afraid of flying?” “No, I’m afraid of dying,” I thought, as I caught a glimpse of Mike’s expression in the corner of the room. Boston Medflight sent a critical care team to airlift me from a big hospital in the suburbs to a bigger hospital in the centre of the city. It took 14 minutes. Within seconds of the wheels of my stretcher hitting the floor, I was greeted by a team of scrubbed-up surgeons. I thought about rural Kenya for a brief moment. I now had more doctors around me than most of our neighbours there will have access to in their lifetime. Hours after surgery, I woke in a dark hospital room; my shoulders were throbbing. Mike was in the chair next to me. “Your fallopian tube ruptured, he said. “Your vitals plummeted and you lost litres of blood. The ER team saved your life.” I drifted back to sleep, nurses and doctors coming in through the night to check on me, machines beeping and muted conversations in the hallway, a deep feeling of fortune washing over me. Not fortune in the sense that I had truly grasped social inequalities or was humbled by my winning birth lottery ticket – in the much less profound, much more selfish sense: I could have easily been in Kenya and I would have certainly died. The next morning, my surgeon came to see me. She told me ruptured ectopic pregnancies were a life-threatening medical emergency, and a leading cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester. She explained why I wasn’t staying on the maternity ward. “They don’t put you there, in case, well… it might be hard to hear a baby crying.” I know I am supposed to feel sad, but I somehow can’t get past this stark advantage glaring down at me like the fluorescent hospital lights. I’m alive. I get to live because of where I live. A woman in a developing country who doesn’t have access to prenatal care and gives birth alone is brave. And she is oppressed. Pregnancy is often lethal. For every Wawerũ, there are millions of courageous women who don’t live to make chai, to tell their story. Approximately every two minutes a woman dies from (overwhelmingly preventable) complications during pregnancy and childbirth and – while the US certainly has a long way to go in terms of maternal mortality – 99% of these deaths take place in the developing world, where a woman will leaves behind an average of four orphaned children. I’ve worked with orphaned children for years, but today, it’s their mothers who take root in my heart. The profound access I have to medicine isn’t something to take or leave, it’s a basic human right that should be afforded to all expectant mothers and isn’t. For sure there are lots of variables that would have changed my outcome. If I had been a poor woman in a rich country, or a rich person in a poor country, or if Mike had tried to bring me to the clinic instead of the emergency room, or if we hadn’t had a car. It’s less about geography and more about disparity – and this is the most glaring difference between my life in Boston and my work in Kenya. When the nurse brought in the paperwork for me to leave the hospital, I lifted my arm and held out my hospital ID bracelet for her to see. It read, Diana Critical, DOB 1.3.1930. “That’s not my name or my birthday,” I said. “I know,” she sympathised, “there wasn’t really time for any of that.” Driving home, I was struck by a sense of panic by every mile I was putting between myself and the hospital. Looking in the rearview mirror and realising: “I don’t want to be five miles from the hospital. I don’t want to be six miles from the hospital”. Three days before I had been so fearless, somehow so sure of my right to go wherever I wanted and get whatever I needed – which is embarrassing to admit, as someone who spends so much time in the poorest parts of the world. I suppose this is the subtle difference between having healthcare, and needing healthcare. The difference between me, and Diana Critical. To support maternal health, everymothercounts.org or pih.org.

Specific advance evidence of a terror plot threatening UK interests is not legally necessary before launching pre-emptive drone strikes against suspects overseas, the attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, explained earlier this year. The surge in improvised jihadi attacks this summer inspired by Islamic State videos that are broadcast across the internet is likely to have heightened the security services’ interest in Jones and the danger she posed. Nicknamed “the white widow” after her husband, Junaid Hussain, was killed in a 2015 US drone strike, she was an active Isis recruiter and propagandist who urged her followers to carry out attacks in the UK. Her killing raises more acutely the question of whether the UK is operating a kill-list of priority targets. The reported death of her 12-year-old son, Jojo, alongside her also raises concerns about the legality of the attack because he would be classified as a non-combatant. The latest drone strike was carried out by the CIA using US military hardware, but the closeness of US-UK cooperation in previous Predator drone attacks in Syria make any denial of advance knowledge by British officials implausible. British drone pilots operate Reaper and Predator drones out of RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire and Creech US air force base in Nevada. The US and UK have also shared intelligence in past Syria drone strikes. The first drone strikes against British Isis militants Reyaad Khan, Ruhul Amin and Junaid Hussain were carried out by both US and RAF drones. The killing of Mohammed Emwazi, the Isis executioner known as Jihadi John, later that year was a joint operation. David Cameron, the then prime minister, said Britain had been working “hand in glove, round the clock” with the US to track down and target Emwazi. Anticipating that there would be future drone killings of UK citizens in Syria, the attorney general gave a speech in January that set out the legal justification for such attacks. One of the key requirements for exercising self-defence under international law, he said, is that the threat must be imminent. Wright denied that the threshold for self-defence was being watered down, but he told the International Institute for Strategic Studies: “In a world where a small number of committed plotters may be seeking to inspire, enable and direct attacks around the world, and indeed have a proven track record of doing so, we will not always know where and when an attack will take place, or the precise nature of the attack. “But where the evidence supports an assessment that an attack is imminent it cannot be right that a state is prevented from meeting its first duty of protecting its citizens without nailing down the specific target and timing of an attack. Apart from anything else, our enemies will not always have fixed plans. They are often opportunists.” The government has advanced two separate justifications for carrying out drone strikes in Syria: as part of the UN-sanctioned collective coalition defending Iraq; and as self-defence of Britain in the face of imminent threats of attack by Isis and the supporters it inspires online. The organisation Rights Watch UK is challenging the government’s refusal to reveal the precise legal advice justifying the targeted killings of British jihadis abroad in the UK courts. Before a hearing in July, Yasmine Ahmed, the executive director of Rights Watch, said such drone strikes were “a sweeping expansion of the circumstances in which the government claims they can lawfully use force overseas”.“By shielding their legal justification from public view the government are depriving parliament and the public of the opportunity to have informed debate about where and when its government can engage in the premeditated killings of individuals, including British nationals abroad,” she said. Judgment is awaited in the case. Daniel Carey, a solicitor at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn who is involved in the legal challenge, said on Thursday: “The self-defence basis [of the legal justification] opens up the possibility of kill-lists, formal or informal. “The question of legality is most starkly thrown up by the death of her [Sally Jones’s] child, if he was killed. The big issue is the requirement under international humanitarian law that any threat should be imminent.” The attorney general’s interpretation of that issue, he said, was controversial. “If the UK is getting the US to do its dirty work, that does not absolve [ministers] from responsibility for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/06/queensland-tree-clearing-wipes-out-federal-emissions-gains","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T04:49:20Z","webTitle":"Queensland tree clearing wipes out federal emissions gains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/queensland-tree-clearing-wipes-out-federal-emissions-gains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/06/queensland-tree-clearing-wipes-out-federal-emissions-gains","fields":{"headline":"Queensland tree clearing wipes out federal emissions gains","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Accelerating rates of tree clearing in Queensland are wiping out any cuts to greenhouse gas emissions the federal government has made through its $2.55bn Direct Action fund, according to the latest data released by the Queensland government. The results also point again to apparent holes in the federal government’s greenhouse gas accounting, as its official figures maintain that land clearing in Queensland is reducing, and that changes in land use across the whole country are cutting emissions rather than adding to them. About 40% of the clearing in the state identified in the latest figures occurred in catchments that drain water into the Great Barrier Reef, which will increase pollution affecting the struggling coral, sparking further calls for the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, to use his powers under federal law to stop some of the clearing. On Thursday the Queensland government released figures showing 395,000 hectares of bush had been cleared in 2015-16, according to its statewide landcover and tree study (Slats). That was up a third compared with the previous year and almost 50% compared with two years earlier. The state environment minister, Steven Miles, said the clearing in one year in Queensland alone caused 45m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The centrepiece of the federal government’s Direct Action policy on climate change is its $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, under which it pays companies to pollute less. In the last auction of the ERF, the government paid an average of $11.82 for each tonne of carbon abated, meaning the emissions from Queensland’s land clearing cancelled out more than half a billion dollars of abatement paid for by the taxpayer – a fifth of the total fund in one year. “Deforestation has a major impact on climate change,” said Lyndon Schneiders, national director of the Wilderness Society. “Ending deforestation would be a fast, cheap and effective way to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.” Meanwhile, the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory, which is the country’s official source of climate change accounting, continues to find that across the whole country, changes in land use – which includes land clearing – amount to a carbon sink rather than a source. In the latest federal government figures, for the year to March 2017, changes in land use are counted as an abatement of 0.1% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The report on the figures says Queensland’s land sector emissions have been “reducing over time”. Changes in the way the federal government measures greenhouse gas emissions have led to revisions of historical reports, with significant amounts of emissions disappearing. Explanations given for the revisions do not fully explain the reduced emissions. The environment department said in a statement Queensland data was used to prepare the national figures and informed the national inventories. “Each year, we update land clearing estimates based on latest satellite data. Where applicable, we also revise estimates to reflect improvements in remote sensing and estimation methods,” a spokesperson said. The large amount of clearing occurring in the Great Barrier Reef catchments has led to renewed calls for Frydenberg to use his powers under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to stop some of the clearing. Frydenberg has previously stated that clearing activities require approval under the act if they “have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance under federal environment law”. He told the ABC in July the government had powers to enforce those laws and would continue to do so. But a WWF report from July found 99.2% of properties where land had been cleared that appeared to need approval under the act, had failed to gain it. The only time the federal government forced a property owner to gain approval, it led to fighting within the federal Coalition. “The amount of clearing in reef catchments should be ringing alarm bells with minister Frydenberg,” said Martin Taylor, a conservation scientist at WWF-Australia. “When the Queensland parliament rejected tougher laws the commonwealth was the last line of defence. Minister Frydenberg’s department has the power under the EPBC Act to rein this in. But the EPBC protections only work if they’re used and that’s not happening,” Taylor said. Frydenberg’s office did not respond to questions about the matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/06/australias-firearms-amnesty-collects-more-than-50000-guns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T02:09:54Z","webTitle":"Australia’s firearms amnesty collects more than 50,000 guns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/06/australias-firearms-amnesty-collects-more-than-50000-guns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/06/australias-firearms-amnesty-collects-more-than-50000-guns","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s firearms amnesty collects more than 50,000 guns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 50,000 firearms will be destroyed after being handed in during the three-month national firearms amnesty. The final figures, released on Friday, showed that the number of surrendered firearms doubled in the final month of the amnesty from 25,999 to 51,461 by 30 September. Almost half were surrendered in New South Wales, which received 24,965 firearms despite collecting a further 67,323 in three other gun amnesties since the first national one in 1996. Queensland collected 16,000 firearms, after collecting and destroying 4,835 in two earlier state-based amnesties, while Victoria received 3,654. South Australia received 2,648 firearms, significantly less than the 5,472 collected during a state-based amnesty that began in December 2015 and ended just before the national amnesty began. SA had collected and destroyed 13,252 firearms between the end of the first national amnesty in 1996 and the start of this year’s. Western Australia and Tasmania, which had already announced their figures, received 1,242 and 1,924 firearms respectively. The Australian Capital Territory collected 709, and the Northern Territory received 322. There are still an estimated 260,000 unregistered guns not accounted for, Malcolm Turnbull said. Speaking to the media alongside Australian Federal Police commissioner Andrew Colvin and justice minister Michael Keenan in Sydney, the prime minister said it was “vitally important” that Australia maintain its gun control laws, which were introduced following the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. “We have seen the shocking tragedy in Las Vegas,” Turnbull said. “The killer there had a collection of semi-automatic weapons which a person in his position would simply not be able to acquire in Australia. We have strict gun control laws, but we don’t take anything for granted, we’re not complacent about it.” The shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday resulted in the deaths of 58 people, making it the most deadly mass shooting in modern US history. An audit of firearms legislation in Australia found that no state or territory was fully compliant with the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), negotiated through the council of Australian governments in the weeks following the Port Arthur massacre, and warned that Australia’s much-lauded gun control laws were at risk of being eroded. The report, released by Gun Control Australia on Thursday, found that no state and territory had enacted in full all 10 resolutions of the NFA, which had no power except as an agreed set of principles. The NFA was reviewed and updated last year. Turnbull said the amnesty, which was announced as part of that review, would help keep Australians safe. “Every single one of those 51,000 guns could have been used in a crime where Australians could be killed,” he said. “Now they can’t. They’ve been collected and they will now be destroyed.” He dismissed the opposition’s suggestion that the gun amnesty be extended, saying its success was because it was open only for a defined period."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/what-new-morsel-of-liberty-can-be-traded-for-the-fantasy-of-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T01:06:05Z","webTitle":"What new morsel of liberty can be traded for the fantasy of safety? | Richard Ackland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/what-new-morsel-of-liberty-can-be-traded-for-the-fantasy-of-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/what-new-morsel-of-liberty-can-be-traded-for-the-fantasy-of-safety","fields":{"headline":"What new morsel of liberty can be traded for the fantasy of safety?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"By now Australia and Australians should be feeling amazingly safe. The latest assortment of anti-terror measures was scripted to assure all and sundry that safety is the key motivation. Face surveillance measures, 14-day detention without charge and a clamp down on instructional manuals and terror-related hoaxes are the latest measures “to keep Australians safe”. There’s hardly a need for a seatbelt in this flight of fancy. In pitching his new measures the prime minister used the word “safe” eight times in an interview on Wednesday with the ABC’s Sabra Lane. It’s also sprinkled liberally through every other statement he has made on the topic. He has outdone Tony Abbott’s 2015 effort where the word was used seven times when the then PM outlined a spate of new security measures. In a letter to Liberal supporters on Wednesday, the prime minister elided the Las Vegas shootings with his anti-terrrorism measures: “The tragedy in Las Vegas is a reminder that we must be relentless in our efforts to protect Australians in crowded places so that we can go about our lives safe from harm ...” It wasn’t so long ago that Peter Dutton claimed that his prospective portfolio of home affairs would keep us “safe” – which reminds us to question, will Dutton have oversight of these latest measures? Premiers Daniel Andrews and Gladys Berejiklian at Thursday’s Coag meeting also signed onto the safety slogan. In 2003 the Howard government was keeping us safe with fridge magnets and anti-terror emergency recommendations (spare car keys, sunscreen, a torch, first-aid kit). Unfortunately, improvement to our safety is something that cannot be guaranteed. It is politicians who are keen to make themselves safe by forever ramping up measures that not-so quietly chip at the foundations of freedom, democracy, civil rights, the whole bag of tricks that were once such comforting creatures of our specialness. Making it an offence to hoax or have a terror guide book sounds pretty lame, but a nationally coordinated, real time facial recognition capacity is a new dimension with no certainty at this point who will have access to the database. Yet, for every advance in high-tech capacity to track terror-related activity there is an available analogue response. If people don’t want to be facially identified at a sporting event or a shopping centre they are quite capable to turning up in a wig with false nose and glasses. There’s even the frustrating possibility that people without driving licences or passports will fall outside the mass recognition net, just as some people who are up to no good avoid communicating on mobile phones or the internet. So what’s next? What new morsel of liberty can be traded for the fantasy of safety? Maybe the security agencies could persuade the government that all citizens, and even non-citizens, should be implanted with a chip that tracks and controls. This tiny implant might even anticipate wishes, desires and expectations and relay them to the Department of Home Affairs. As Google and Facebook have led the way with the capacity for intuitive anticipation, a personal chip could do even better. The device might be called the Safety Synchroniser, or SS for short. As the prime minister says, surveillance capacity exists already but it is now being coordinated more effectively, just as metadata retention organises what already is available to be retained. In the name of safety and fighting terror we can go on trading away our independence, our liberties, our identity, until nothing is left. The process of keeping us safe is infinite. The post 9/11 Howard-era measures included beefing-up powers and resources for intelligence agencies, the introduction of control orders, penalties for advocating terrorism, the greater use of conspiracy charges, and Asio’s extended holding and questioning capability. In 2015 Tony Abbott came up with further measures to ban terrorist organisations, to prosecute foreign fighters, to clamp down on the funding of terrorism and the suspension of passports – part of his mission in dealing with Daesh or, as the then prime minister called it, “the Death Cult”. Since then we’ve had metadata retention, the capacity to remove people’s citizenship, street bollards and now facial ID. Not always are these measures effective. For instance, at the behest of the NSW police in 2016 the state government introduced laws that were designed to make it easier to restrict the movement of criminals, and even people who weren’t criminals. In introducing the legislation for serious crime prevention orders the police minister Troy Grant said, “We make no apologies for improving community safety”. A year after the law came into effect the minister admitted to parliament that no serious crime prevention orders have been made. The measures were more in the nature of political chest beating than an effective attempt to secure community safety. What would be more worthwhile is a coordinated move to tighten the national firearms agreement, which Coalition governments have progressively undermined. Premiers and prime ministers are talking out of both sides of their mouth when they beat the terror drum yet conspicuously fail to make us safe from more guns. Possibly another way of protecting the community without the constant erosion of liberties and the trampling of the rule of law is to avoid slavishly following the United States into Middle East adventures. A bill or charter of rights also is well overdue, particularly in the context where there is currently no countervailing protection against the state’s incursion into traditional freedoms. There is a desperate need for strong mechanisms whereby the security of the nation can be balanced with the protection of liberty.

Dust down the red and white jester’s hat. Root out the gumshield, the crumpled Yekaterinburg metro map. And prepare to head once more into that strangely gruelling territory between bruised and fearful cynicism and the eternal quiver of tournament hope. England have booked their place at the World Cup in Russia after surely the most meandering, flaccid qualification victory yet devised by any England team. Slovenia were beaten by Harry Kane’s goal but make no mistake – this was both a dreadful game of football and a numbing spectacle for those loyal supporters still willing to drag themselves out on a Thursday night to enter the vast money-rinsing concrete cauldron of the Wembley entertainment complex. Victory may have sealed qualification, but it also deflated further any realistic expectations of what might happen when England get there. This should be of great concern to the Football Association. There are only so many times even England fans will be prepared to pay £40 for the pleasure of throwing paper aeroplanes at the pitch, which brought the loudest cheers of the night right up until Kane’s finish in stoppage time. At the end England’s players gathered in the centre circle and wandered around applauding the empty red plastic seats and the backs of people queuing to leave while the PA burbled gamely about the prestige friendlies to come. As an image of England football 2017, and the slow, gilded death for what was once football’s most compelling theatre, it is probably quite hard to beat. England were at least terrible in a grimly fascinating way. Gone are the days when a poor England team sent it long, seeking out the head of some game forward battering ram. Here they were terrible in the new style, passing to each other but setting out with two lumbering central midfield wardrobes shielding a defence threatened only by its own misplaced passes. In the opening hour they produced a performance so lacking in purpose and precision it was like watching a piece of performance art, a 45-minute Warhol-style short film called Wembley Angst No94. England did improve after the hour mark but by then they had a lot of ground to make up from a standing start as the game congealed early on into another game just like the other games. Jordan Henderson had the ball quite a lot, worrying about from side to side, always looking back into the yonic safety of his defence. Midway through the half England produced a stunningly terrible free-kick routine, working the ball very slowly backwards and finally teeing it up for Henderson to perform a spectacular falling-over air-kick on the edge of the area. Grimly, Slovenia cleared. Only Marcus Rashford seemed really interested in trying to run forward quickly. Raheem Sterling ran quite a lot. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain played like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. And that was pretty much that for the most soft-pedalled minor chord moment of qualification imaginable, given a spark of life at the death by Kane’s opportunism. What now then? One thing is clear. England does not expect. It has been more than a decade since the national team had the luxury of travelling in a state of doomed optimism, the mood ever more stricken since that golden, foolish summer of 2006 when the world was still young, when Crouchie did the robot with Prince William, and when the idea of some grand Premier League talent-legacy waiting to be spent died for good on the fields of Stuttgart, Cologne and Gelsenkirchen. The challenge now for Gareth Southgate is not to try to reach the World Cup final. It is to produce a team that people actually want to watch. This has been a deathly qualification, with only 16 goals scored and a feeling of having spent endless hours watching England’s furrowed and fearful back five play a variety of keep-ball. From here it seems absolutely clear Southgate needs to take a chance, to chuck out the Dan Ashworth handbook of mind-bogglingly dull and outmoded possession football, to accept that playing with adventure, life, pace, and risky attacking vim might revive not just the dwindling England brand but his own managerial career. In their current guise, watching England is like watching a 12-round undercard split decision wrestle-off between a pair of ponderous 15st taxi drivers, the craft-free double defensive midfield bolt the managerial equivalent of tucking both your shirt and your vest into your underpants. What is the point of playing this way? From here to next summer every moment of Southgate’s time should be devoted to trying to wring the most out of what he does have, a spritz of genuine forward talent in Kane, Dele Alli and Rashford. He needs a midfielder who can pass. And he needs to trust his defence to carry the ball forward. Success for this team would involve simply playing with a little freedom, exploring their own limits and refusing to leave the competition until they have at least been beaten by a demonstrably superior team. Score some goals. Produce at least one performance that lets everyone feel giddy and stupid and deluded for four days in June. There is a wider issue here about international football itself. When the away fans in Malta last month sang “we’re fucking shit” they weren’t angry or incensed or spoiling for a fight. They were taking the mickey out of the whole thing: England, us, them, the enduring disjunct between a domestic league of such screeching urgency and a national team who have withered in its shadow. Take note, Gareth. It is when they stop booing you really want to start worrying. For now England will travel with hope, as ever. But not much of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/05/england-qualified-world-cup-how-to-buy-tickets","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T21:55:44Z","webTitle":"England have qualified for the World Cup – here’s how to get your tickets for Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/05/england-qualified-world-cup-how-to-buy-tickets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/05/england-qualified-world-cup-how-to-buy-tickets","fields":{"headline":"England have qualified for the World Cup – here’s how to get your tickets for Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When can people begin buying World Cup tickets? The process has already started – on 14 September to be precise. That was when Fifa opened its first “sales phase”. People who want to apply for tickets must register to do so on Fifa’s official website and then go through an online application process. A random draw will then take place to decide successful applicants, the entry deadline for which is 11am on 12 October. There will then be a first come, first served sale between 16-18 November before a second sales phase opens on 5 December – four days after the World Cup draw has taken place in Moscow. Again, a random draw will take place, followed by a first come, first served sale lasting between 13 March and 3 April 2018. And finally, if there any tickets remaining, they will be sold in a last-minute sales phase, which will be on a first come, first served basis, between 18 April and 15 July 2018. Again, all purchases must be made via Fifa’s website. What types of tickets are available? There are four categories – individual match tickets, venue specific ticket series (VST), team specific ticket series (TST) and supporter tickets (ST)/conditional supporter tickets (CST). Individual match tickets are for specific fixtures (group, last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, third-place play-off, final) and can be purchased in sale phases 1 and 2, as well as the last-minute sales phase. The VSTs can be purchased during sale phases 1 and 2 and provides the purchaser with tickets for all group, round of 16 and third place play-off matches played at a specific World Cup venue, of which there are 12. Tickets for the opening match – which takes place at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday 14 June – as well as those for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final are not included in the VSTs packages. TSTs allow purchases to obtain tickets to watch a specific team, and there are two categories: TST3, comprising tickets for that team’s three group matches, and TST7, comprising tickets for that team’s group matches and, should they progress, every knockout fixture, including the final. The benefit of TST7 is that even if the team in question are knocked out during the tournament, the purchaser still maintains access for the remaining fixtures. So, for instance, if someone buys an England TST7 and Gareth Southgate’s side are knocked out in the last 16, that person can still attend a quarter‑final, semi-final, play‑off match, as well as the final, which takes place at the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday 15 July. If, however, the purchaser decides he/she wants a refund on the basis their team have failed to progress, they can obtain one minus an administration fee of $10 (£8) or the equivalent in Russian rubles. TSTs can be purchased during the sale phase 1 only. STs and CSTs are again team-specific tickets but allow the purchaser to buy tickets for just the group matches (STs) or for just the knockout matches, including the final (CSTs). If someone purchases a CST but the team in question fails to progress from their group, it immediately becomes invalid and a refund will be paid minus a handling charge equivalent to $10 per person, up to a maximum of $40, or the equivalent in rubles. STs and CSTs can be purchased during the random draw in sale phase 2 only. How much do tickets cost? There are four price categories for every round (opening match, group matches, round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, third place play-off, final), with Category 1 tickets the most expensive and Category 4 the cheapest and only available to Russian residents. So, for instance, a Category 1 ticket for the opening match costs 33,000 roubles (£436), while a Category 4 ticket for the same fixture costs 3,200 roubles (£42), while for the final a Category 1 ticket costs 66,000 roubles (£872), while a Category 4 ticket costs 7,040 roubles (£93). The prices are same whether the tickets are purchased individually or part of a package (VST, TST, ST, CST). People purchasing tickets from outside Russia can do so only by using a Visa credit/debit card (Visa is an official World Cup partner) or via an international bank transfer using a ticket application form that must be downloaded from Fifa’s website. Will it be safe to travel to Russia next summer? Given there is still eight months to go until the start of the World Cup it is impossible to say for sure, but the unstable political climate – namely Russia’s involvement in conflicts in Ukraine and Syria – as well as threats of hooliganism and the country’s lack of legal protections for members of minority groups, such as the LGBT community, have understandably raised concerns. What’s for sure is that Russia’s government is determined for the tournament to pass by smoothly, and if the lack of trouble during Liverpool and Manchester United’s recent Champions League matches in Moscow is anything to go by, sufficient security and stewarding measures will be taken to ensure spectators can attend matches during the tournament safely and comfortably. The lifting of visa restrictions will also make the process of entering the country much easier, and cheaper, than normal. To be on the safe side, travellers to Russia next summer are recommended to travel in groups and/or travel with tour organisers who have an intimate knowledge of the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/06/usa-panama-preview-world-cup-qualifier","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Angst on overdrive as USA meet Panama with World Cup hopes in balance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/06/usa-panama-preview-world-cup-qualifier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/06/usa-panama-preview-world-cup-qualifier","fields":{"headline":"Angst on overdrive as USA meet Panama with World Cup hopes in balance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bruce Arena took his place at the top table and smiled. “This is a pretty big game,” said the United States coach, referencing the packed media throng which put the tiny interview room at the Orlando City stadium close to bursting point. Arena was right. Friday night’s meeting with Panama is huge. Scratch that. It’s absolutely massive. Smiles will be replaced with frowns and grimaces once the first whistle sounds. For all the confident strides the game in North America has taken in the last decade or so, for the national team not to appear at the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 would be tantamount to disaster. If MLS wants to attain the dream of becoming an elite league, the US needs must compete on the grandest stages. The national team must always be in the rudest of health. There’s no shop window like the World Cup. Sitting at home next summer watching the action in Russia unfold on TV would be beyond painful for everyone with a vested interest in the growth of the game on these shores. The angst, however, is totally understandable. Arena’s team take on the rugged, defensively astute Los Canaleros coming off the back of a dispiriting home defeat to Costa Rica at the start of September and a less than inspirational 1-1 draw in Honduras four days later. Yes, their destiny remains crucially in their own hands. A win here and then a similar outcome next week against a Trinidad and Tobago side who occupy bottom spot in the Concacaf hexagonal would see those worries melt away. An inability to get all three points, however, and the headaches will return. The often brain melting ‘what if’ conversation has been the talk of the town. A Panama win – it would be a first on American soil – would seal the third automatic qualification spot and send Hernan Dario Gomez’s side to the World Cup finals for the first ever time. Indeed, if you think this is an important match for the US, put yourself in the shoes of a soccer fan in Panama City tonight. Maybe that’s why the Colombian has dodged press conferences this week, much to the chagrin of an excitable, expectant Panamanian media who are praying their so-called golden generation can finally make that final step without the accompanying heartbreak which has soured recent attempts. A 3-2 defeat to Jürgen Klinsmann’s side four years ago scuppered their hopes in the final qualifying game. Anything less than three points would leave the US sweating in fourth and the unappetizing prospect of a potential two legged play-off match against either Syria, who play their home matches in Malaysia, or Australia. Honduras, who are also on nine points with the US, play a Costa Rican side who will qualify in second place behind unassailable group leaders Mexico if they get at least a point, also remain in the mix. Their final game is against the Mexicans who should be on cruise control, although their goal difference of minus-7 could prove problematic. There are myriad possibilities yet relying on other results is never a good look. The US, for all the money spent in bringing in Klinsmann and building a system which should see them challenging the leading nations, shouldn’t be in this precarious position. The significance, and potential ramifications, aren’t lost on the man who memorably led the US to the World Cup last eight in 2002. “We continue to grow the game in this country,” said Arena who wants to see his side grab the initiative from the off. “The game in the US is at its highest point in its history, with a growing domestic league, very competitive national team in a region that continues to grow as well. It’s important that we continue to qualify for World Cups. I don’t how you actually quantify that, but it’s certainly very important.” With such high stakes, it promises to be intense. Orlando boasts some of the most fanatical fans in MLS. Arena and his team need them to rise to the occasion. Panama are miserly at the back – just five goals conceded from the last eight qualifiers illustrates a real sense of organization, cohesiveness and solidity. For the US to succeed, that resolute defense will need to be broken down by a team lacking creativity of the highest order. Just 12 goals – including six in one game against Honduras – have come during this hexagonal stage. The precocious talent of Christian Pulisic will be relied upon heavily and after kicking him all over the park in Panama last March, the visitors are acutely aware of the Borussia Dortmund forward’s prowess. “I won’t change my attacking style just because how other teams are treating me,” said the 19-year-old. “[His treatment in Panama] was to be expected. None of these teams are going to give it to us easy. If we can get an early goal, that would be perfect.” While there will be many more days in the sun for young Pulisic, Arena’s legacy is on the line. For all his MLS titles and successes with the national team, missing out on the World Cup for the first time since 1986 would forever stain his copybook. The 66-year-old was the safe, if uninspired, choice to replace Klinsmann last year. He inherited a team bereft of confidence and direction yet 11 months back in the hots eat is long enough for excuses to fall on deaf ears. A mistrust of his own defense, a penchant for chopping and changing his goalkeepers and the absence of serious attacking verve have exposed problems which give the likes of Panama a reason to believe. Bringing in Bob Bradley, the former US coach and current incumbent of new MLS side LAFC, to training this week in the hope of adding some wisdom points to a man who knows something extra is needed to stave off disaster. “We know what’s at stake,” added Pulisic. “We are ready and focused.” They will need to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T08:01:54Z","webTitle":"How Syria's White Helmets became victims of an online propaganda machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories","fields":{"headline":"How Syria's White Helmets became victims of an online propaganda machine","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Syrian volunteer rescue workers known as the White Helmets have become the target of an extraordinary disinformation campaign that positions them as an al-Qaida-linked terrorist organisation. The Guardian has uncovered how this counter-narrative is propagated online by a network of anti-imperialist activists, conspiracy theorists and trolls with the support of the Russian government (which provides military support to the Syrian regime). The White Helmets, officially known as the Syria Civil Defence, is a humanitarian organisation made up of 3,400 volunteers – former teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters – who rush to pull people from the rubble when bombs rain down on Syrian civilians. They’ve been credited with saving thousands of civilians during the country’s continuing civil war. They have also exposed, through first-hand video footage, war crimes including a chemical attack in April. Their work was the subject of an Oscar-winning Netflix documentary and the recipient of two Nobel peace prize nominations. Despite this positive international recognition, there’s a counter-narrative pushed by a vocal network of individuals who write for alternative news sites countering the “MSM agenda”. Their views align with the positions of Syria and Russia and attract an enormous online audience, amplified by high-profile alt-right personalities, appearances on Russian state TV and an army of Twitter bots. The way the Russian propaganda machine has targeted the White Helmets is a neat case study in the prevailing information wars. It exposes just how rumours, conspiracy theories and half-truths bubble to the top of YouTube, Google and Twitter search algorithms. “This is the heart of Russian propaganda. In the old days they would try and portray the Soviet Union as a model society. Now it’s about confusing every issue with so many narratives that people can’t recognise the truth when they see it,” said David Patrikarakos, author of War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the 21st Century. Hybrid warfare The campaign to discredit the White Helmets started at the same time as Russia staged a military intervention in Syria in September 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad’s army with airstrikes bombarding opposition-held areas. Almost immediately, Russian state media such as RT and Sputnik started falsely claiming that Isis was the only target and throwing doubt on the bombings of infrastructure and civilian sites. The same propaganda machine scooped up fringe anti-American activists, bloggers and researchers who believe the White Helmets are terrorists, giving them a platform on state TV and amplifying their articles through social media. There is no evidence to suggest that these activists and bloggers are knowingly spreading disinformation, although the stories are often thinly sourced. Scott Lucas, professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, describes the overall campaign as “agitation propaganda” but said that some of its participants don’t realise they are being used as pawns. “The most effective propaganda is when you find someone who believes it then give them support – you don’t create them from scratch,” he added. Why the White Helmets? The White Helmets play two roles within Syria. The first is their rescue work: providing an ambulance service, fire service and search and rescue in conflict areas where infrastructure has been decimated. The second role is the documentation of what is taking place within the country via handheld and helmet cameras. “This is the thing that has annoyed not just the Assad regime and Russian authorities but a lot of the propagandists who work in their orbit,” said Amnesty International’s Kristyan Benedict, a crisis response manager who specialises in Syria. Their footage has helped organisations like Amnesty and the Syria Justice and Accountability Center corroborate testimony they receive from people in Syria via phone, Skype and WhatsApp. It allows them to check the aftermath of airstrikes to see whether civilians were targeted and whether there was any military presence or checkpoints. “That’s really been damaging to the war narrative of Syria and Russia,” said Benedict. It was the White Helmets’ footage that documented the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun in April, which killed at least 83 people, a third of them children. UN war crimes investigators later concluded the attack was carried out by the Syrian regime against its own people. Russian state media and a network of supportive alternative news sites continue to cast doubt on investigators’ findings, describing it as “illogical” and “deliberately staged” by militants. The alt-right site Infowars repeated the conspiracy theory, describing the attack as staged by the White Helmets, who were described as an “al-Qaida affiliated group funded by George Soros”. The White Helmets have never received funding from George Soros or any of his foundations. Some of the most vocal sceptics of the UN’s investigation include the blogger Vanessa Beeley, the daughter of a former British diplomat who visited Syria for the first time in July 2016; a University of Sydney senior lecturer, Timothy Anderson, who described the April chemical attack as a “hoax”; and Eva Bartlett, a Canadian writer and activist who said the White Helmets staged rescues using recycled victims – a claim that’s been debunked by Snopes and Channel 4 News. “They are basically excusing the inexcusable,” said Lucas. “They have a range of websites that will publish whatever nonsense and Russia Today will have them on TV,” he added. The Russian strategy has been very successful at shaping the online conversation about the White Helmets. By gaming the social media algorithms with a flood of content, boosted by bots, sock puppet accounts and a network of agitators, propagandists are able to create a “manufactured consensus” that gives legitimacy to fringe views. Even Russia’s official channels, such as its UK embassy Twitter accounts, post memes discrediting the organisation. “If you scroll through tweets about the White Helmets, pretty much every other conversation is equating them with Isis, calling them terrorists. It looks like they are the bad guys,” said Sam Woolley, who studies computational propaganda at the University of Oxford. “It’s all part of an effort to delegitimise western efforts to stabilise Syria,” he said. His colleague Samantha Bradshaw adds: “The more confusion there is, the easier it is to manipulate people.” The research that shows the link The Guardian spoke to several researchers studying the spread of disinformation and propaganda online who have found evidence of a targeted Russian influence campaign against the White Helmets. Fil Menczer, a computer science professor at Indiana University, has developed a tool called Hoaxy to chart the spread of misinformation online. Searching for “White Helmets” reveals a handful of sources generated hundreds of stories about the organisation. “It’s like a factory,” he said. The same handful of people are quoted as “experts” in articles that are repackaged and interlinked to create a body of content whose conspiracy claims gain a semblance of legitimacy. The analytics firm Graphika has spent years analysing a range of Russian disinformation campaigns including those around the Macron leaks and the Russian doping scandal. In research commissioned by the human rights group the Syria Campaign, it found that the patterns in the online network of the 14,000 Twitter users talking about the White Helmets looked “very similar” and included many known pro-Kremlin troll accounts, some of which were closed down as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the US election. Other accounts appeared to generate more than 150 tweets per day (more than 70 is seen by scholars studying bots as suspicious). Graphika also found evidence of coordination of timing and messaging around significant events in the news cycle relating to the White Helmets. Separately, both Graphika and Menczer’s Hoaxy tool identify Beeley, the British blogger, as among the most influential disseminators of content about the White Helmets. Their findings also correlate with work done by Kate Starbird from the University of Washington in Seattle, who asserts that Beeley and the alternative news site 21st Century Wire have dominated the Twitter conversation about White Helmets over the last few months, along with Sputnik and RT.com. Beeley frequently criticises the White Helmets in her role as editor of the website 21st Century Wire, set up by Patrick Henningsen, who is also a former editor at Infowars.com. In 2016, Beeley had a two-hour meeting with Assad in Damascus as part of a US Peace Council delegation, which she described on Facebook as her “proudest moment”. She was also invited to Moscow to report on the “dirty war in Syria”; there, she met senior Russian officials including the deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, and Maria Zakharova, director of information and press at Russia’s foreign ministry. The mannequin challenge To understand the propaganda machine in action, you only have to look at what happened when the White Helmets posted their version of the mannequin challenge, a viral internet video trend where people would film themselves frozen mid-action. The rescue group filmed themselves in a staged rescue and shared the video on social media with the hashtag #MannequinChallenge. The video, posted in November 2016 by the Revolutionary Forces of Syria Media Office, was immediately stripped of its context and reshared as evidence that the organisation uses “crisis actors” in staged rescues designed to make the Russian and Syrian armies look bad. One Twitter user, retweeted hundreds of times, stated: “Unbelievable! Must watch video showing White Helmets fakery.” RT reported on the incident, including some of the tweets, and cited Beeley as an independent researcher asserting that the video fuelled suspicion around the “already questionable credibility” of the organisation. The following day Beeley wrote a story on 21st Century Wire in which she argued that the video caused “widespread doubt, even among diehard supporters, as to the veracity of their much edited slick video reports”. The White Helmets later issued an apology, saying they had hoped the viral video would create a connection between the horror or Syria and the outside world, but acknowledged it was an “error of judgement”.. “It was a stupid thing to do,” said Eliot Higgins, founder of the investigative reporting collective Bellingcat, “but it was then completely misused by people who have an agenda.” A year on and the White Helmets’ mannequin challenge video is still widely circulated as evidence that they stage rescues. There have, however, been isolated rogue actors within the White Helmets who are used to discredit the entire group. One former White Helmet was fired after he was filmed assisting armed militants in disposing of the mutilated corpses of pro-Assad fighters, and others have been photographed with guns despite marketing themselves as unarmed. There is also footage of White Helmets taking a body away from an execution carried out by rebel militants, which critics claim shows they are “assisting” executions. “These are isolated incidents at the volunteer level – there has never been any kind of incident involving anyone in the leadership,” added Saleh, the White Helmets leader, looking down at his phone as he received a breaking news notification about a British politician resigning over sexual harassment allegations. “No one is saying that the government of the UK is a predatory organisation just because of this one incident.” Meanwhile, Beeley’s influence continues. In April 2017, she gave a talk at a conference alongside ministers in Assad’s cabinet (who spoke via video conference) titled “White Helmets: Fact or Fantasy?” Her briefing paper and slides on the topic were then submitted to the UN security council and UN general assembly by the Russian government as “evidence” against the White Helmets. “These leaked documents offer cast-iron proof that the Russian government is doing what it can to elevate Vanessa Beeley as a key player in its propaganda campaign,” said James Sadri, executive director of the Syria Campaign. “A blogger for a 9/11 truther website who only visited Syria for the first time last year should not be taken seriously as an impartial expert on the conflict.” The Guardian contacted Beeley several times asking for comment and she declined to respond to specific queries, saying that the questions put to her were “a disgrace” containing “no relevant facts and are reminiscent of a McCarthyite interrogation”. The Guardian also contacted Eva Bartlett, who said she had “no interest in participating in your quite evidently already-decided ‘story’ (an odd term for a journalist to use for an article)”. Shortly after the requests for comment, Beeley appeared on a 40-minute-long YouTube programme in which she discussed the emailed requests for comment and criticised the Guardian’s coverage of Syria, alleging “faux reporting” based on footage provided by “al-Qaida affiliates” the White Helmets. Beeley said that the “majority consensus” was that the White Helmets were a fraudulent terrorist organisation. • This article was amended on 21 December 2017.

It would, though, have been churlish to deny their management, players and supporters their epic celebration. They were perfectly entitled to cherish these delirious moments. The very fact second place in Group F is in Scotland’s hands with one fixture to go represents an incredible turnaround. Another win, in Slovenia on Sunday, would complete Gordon Strachan’s redemption and catapult Scotland towards a play‑off berth. It is their most meaningful fixture in a decade. How Strachan’s men huffed and puffed against 10-man Slovakia. A combination of the woodwork and outstanding goalkeeping denied the hosts until the most ugly of own goals, the veteran Martin Skrtel put under sufficient pressured by Chris Martin to deflect an Ikechi Anya cross into his own net. Hampden Park erupted as Skrtel, on the occasion of his 92nd cap, sunk to his knees. There was a minute of regulation time to play. “I genuinely thought we would score, regardless of when that was,” Strachan said. “At no time did it feel really stressful. I could see they had everything under control. They had a real belief in what they were trying to do. “We have been building up to a performance like that. They deserve a performance and result like that. How many times have we had bad luck written all over it? It wasn’t about luck tonight, it was a great goalkeeper, the crossbar and eventually getting one in.” A pre-match mistake would have been the affording of undue attention to Scotland’s aspirations. Slovakia, who swatted them aside in Trnava last year, arrived here with high hopes of their own. With a fixture against Malta to come on Sunday, Slovakia knew any reward at all from this meeting should be sufficient to all-but secure a play-off berth. Given what was at stake, Scotland’s bright opening was understandable rather than worthy of high praise. A terrific Andy Robertson cross from the left flank found no takers before a penalty claim that further intensified a gripping atmosphere. Kieran Tierney felt he was bundled over illegally by Robert Mak but the award of a spot-kick would have been highly contentious. Scotland’s early superiority came within a superb Martin Dubravka save of being rewarded. This was to prove a theme. Christophe Berra connected with a Leigh Griffiths cross at the back post, with the defender’s net-bound header clawed away by the keeper. Slovakia’s relief was soon to turn to anger; if illegitimately so. Mak had already been booked for a poor challenge on James Forrest before an act of blatant simulation in the penalty area reduced Slovakia to 10 men after 23 minutes. Slovakia complained bitterly about the issuing of a second yellow card when the fury would have been better directed at the midfielder. Slovakia had been unambitious even before the loss of one of their main creative forces, which made their subsequent attacking rather surprising. Intricate buildup work between Stanislav Lobotka and Adam Nemec resulted in the former being denied by Craig Gordon. Moments later, Marek Hamsik was primed for a clear shot from 18 yards before Darren Fletcher provided a necessary intervention. Back came Scotland, Griffiths this time testing Dubravka with a curling effort. It was bizarre that a breathless, fluent first-half did not yield any goals. A ragged opening to the second period would have been of concern to Strachan on the simple basis that Scotland did not create a clear-cut chance despite territorial dominance. Slovakia threatened to punish that bluntness in a swift counter attack, with Gordon saving well from the marauding Jan Gregus. Scotland’s response was to deploy a two-man forward line, with Martin introduced from the bench. There was nearly an instant dividend, Griffiths stinging the palms of Dubravka with a 20-yard-drive. Earlier discord from Scotland supporters relating to Martin had been doused by a late and crucial winning goal here against Slovenia, at a time when qualification hopes were hanging by a thread. Strachan was seeking repeat salvation. He came within the crossbar’s width of getting it, Martin having produced a fabulous strike from long distance. That bar prevented Scotland again, this time from a Griffiths free-kick. Angst was still being displayed regarding that by the time James Morrison’s strike from six yards was saved by Dubravka. Scotland were now camped in Slovakia’s half, seeking the goal their battle-weary following so audibly yearned. The problem was, two decades of failure meant those fans also knew the alternative ending all too well. This time, they need not have worried. Scotland want to ride the crest of this wave all the way to Ljubljana."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/05/canada-prison-escapees-caught-escape-room","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T19:03:53Z","webTitle":"Prison escapees caught at Canadian escape room interactive game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/canada-prison-escapees-caught-escape-room","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/05/canada-prison-escapees-caught-escape-room","fields":{"headline":"Prison escapees caught at Canadian escape room interactive game","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"They scaled the tall barbed wire fence and escaped without trace into the industrial park surrounding the prison in Edmonton, Canada. But within 24 hours, the two fugitives – perhaps keen to again try their luck – were found by police in a nearby “escape room” interactive game. The two women, Kelsie Laine Marie Mast, 23, and Samantha Faye Toope, 20, were discovered missing from the women’s correctional facility on Monday night during an inmate count. Police soon issued a public warning, describing them as violent offenders with a history of weapons offences. The following day, as police across the city searched for the women, the pair wandered into the escape room, where customers are locked in a room and must solve a variety of puzzles and challenges to get out. “They said they were from out of town, and weren’t familiar with escape rooms and asked if they could see one,” said Rebecca Liaw of SideQuests Adventures. She and her husband Jonathan, who co-own the business, were working that night along with another staff member who was in a back room. “They weren’t doing anything stereotypically suspicious – they weren’t looking over their shoulder or being nervous or antsy. Nothing at all to let us know that something was not normal,” she said. Liaw took the two women down a hallway to show them one of the rooms. As the women were plying Liaw with questions, police were quietly making their way to the facility, tipped off by a citizen who had recognised the two women. “It was a really normal conversation until I look up over their shoulder and find the hallway full of five police officers,” said Liaw. “It was shocking. I’m sure I was midsentence when the police announced that they were arresting them.” The pair were swiftly handcuffed and escorted out of the building, said Liaw. Police said the two women were later returned to the custody of Canada’s correctional services. “It’s all kinds of ironic,” said Liaw. “How, after escaping from a prison, did they end up here at our escape room? And, wow, they’re definitely not escaping from here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/05/doctors-praise-plan-for-organ-donor-presumed-consent-in-england","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T18:42:00Z","webTitle":"Doctors praise plan for organ donor presumed consent in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/05/doctors-praise-plan-for-organ-donor-presumed-consent-in-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/05/doctors-praise-plan-for-organ-donor-presumed-consent-in-england","fields":{"headline":"Doctors praise plan for organ donor presumed consent in England","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Transplant doctors and health charities have praised Theresa May’s decision to change how organ donation works in England in an attempt to provide more hearts, kidneys and livers for patients in need. The prime minister announced plans to move to a system of presumed consent – meaning everyone is presumed to agree to the removal and reuse of body parts after their death unless they opt out – in her speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Wednesday. She said change was needed because 500 people died last year while waiting in vain for a replacement heart, lungs, kidney or liver. With 6,500 patients on the organ transplant waiting list, “our ability to help people who need transplants is limited by the number of organ donors that come forward,” May said. Roberto Cacciola, a kidney transplant specialist at Barts Health NHS trust in London, said: “As a transplant surgeon I’m delighted with and excited by this initiative because there’s a chronic need for more organs and therefore for more donors to come forward. “We’ve been waiting a long time for this to happen. I have 400 patients on my waiting list for a kidney, of which I manage to transplant 120 a year. I would do more if more kidneys were available. I hope that in future I will be able to do more.” According to NHS Blood and Transplant, the agency responsible for boosting donation rates, there are more than 50,000 people alive today in the UK who would have died if they had not undergone an organ transplant. Of those, 36,300 received a kidney, 9,800 a liver, 3,900 either a heart, lungs or both, and 1,900 a replacement pancreas. Last year 4,753 people – the highest number ever – received an organ. The number of recipients has risen by 20% over the past five years. The number of people who have signed the NHS organ donor register, signalling their willingness to have their organs harvested after their death, has risen by 4.9 million over the same period and now stands at 23.6 million, also a record high. Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, said: “The government has done the right thing and made a vital step towards increasing donations and transplantation, which is fantastic news for the thousands of people currently waiting for a kidney transplant.” The proposed switch to presumed consent, which will be subject to a public consultation, could prove “truly transformational”, Loud said. “With one person dying every day in the UK whilst waiting for a kidney transplant, this change cannot come soon enough.” Wales introduced presumed consent in December 2015 and has seen organ retrieval rates rise as a result. Scotland and Northern Ireland have both expressed interest in following suit. Gordon Brown, the last Labour prime minister, wanted to bring in the same system in 2008, but he did not pursue the plan after a taskforce he set up to investigate the practicalities of doing so advised against it. Although many doctors backed the move, others were concerned hat it could cause tension in the relationship between doctors providing end-of-life care and patients and their relatives. Brown abandoned the plan after the taskforce concluded that “such a system has the potential to undermine the concept of donation as a gift, to erode trust in NHS professionals and the government and negatively impact on organ donation numbers”. The taskforce added: “Furthermore, it would be challenging and costly to implement successfully. Most compelling of all, we found no convincing evidence that it would deliver significant increases in the number of donated organs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/08/the-golden-dragon-review-opera-passion-power-politics-v-and-a","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:00:34Z","webTitle":"The Golden Dragon; Opera: Passion, Power and Politics – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/08/the-golden-dragon-review-opera-passion-power-politics-v-and-a","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/08/the-golden-dragon-review-opera-passion-power-politics-v-and-a","fields":{"headline":"The Golden Dragon; Opera: Passion, Power and Politics – review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At first sight a jaunty skit on life in a Chinese restaurant – table 11 wants a No 6 with peanut sauce – The Golden Dragon unfurls into a harrowing tale of immigration and its consequences. It could hardly be more topical. The Hungarian composer-conductor Peter Eötvös (born 1944) began work on this 90-minute piece in 2013. The refugee issue had suddenly escalated. (Theresa May, then home secretary, memorably announced a bill that would “create a really hostile environment for illegal migrants”.) By the time of its UK premiere by Music Theatre Wales in Buxton last year, the crisis dominated European politics. This chamber opera, with a cast of five and a 16-strong instrumental ensemble, goes to the heart of the matter. Now MTW is taking it on tour, culminating in a performance at Hackney Empire on 31 October. The nimble, compact production by the company’s co-founder, Michael McCarthy, is superbly conducted by Geoffrey Paterson and expertly performed by all. Music and text, kaleidoscopic and fast-moving, mix realism and fairytale, humour and horror. Think of a Salman Rushdie short story with a magic carpet thrown in. The score’s use of different styles, from jazzy to spiky to declamatory to lyrical, informally charts Eötvös’s own journey as a composer. He began by writing film and stage music, then spent rigorous years as a Stockhausen disciple in the late 1960s. Now his approach is inclusive and eclectic, as witnessed in his operas Angels in America (2004) or Love and Other Demons (2008, commissioned by Glyndebourne). The libretto is from a play by Roland Schimmelpfennig (b1967), a leading German playwright whose Brechtian-style plays have been seen here at the Royal Court. A young Chinese man (The Little One, poignantly sung by Llio Evans) has bad toothache. Given his illegal status, he cannot seek medical help. His kitchen colleagues perform a grotesque act of excision with much blood and fatal consequences. As the main story splinters into others, the cast take on many roles. This opera, as all involved make clear, is about any time, any place. The context may be pan-Asian but no one is cast as a racial stereotype in any respect. Given that the opera has raised some controversy, it’s worth noting that this production was hugely popular at the Tongyeong international music festival, South Korea. The company is now in discussions with the Hong Kong arts festival too. Lucy Schaufer switches from Old Cook to Granddaughter to Ant with aplomb, as does Andrew Mackenzie-Wicks in a similarly polarised range of parts. Two “air stewardesses” – gamely played by Daniel Norman and Johnny Herford, examining their nails and waving their shiny handbags to the manner born – are at dinner after a long-haul flight. The decayed tooth flies through the air and lands, miraculously and revoltingly, in the soup. The music becomes more haunting as the work progresses through its 22 short scenes. Sharp edges – especially created by the percussion, full of rattles and ratchets and chopping sounds – soften into melancholy, woodwind-dominated elegy. Short lines of text, every word audible, yield to tiny arias. The work ends with The Little One’s body being thrown into the river as he sings of his death and his journey into the afterlife. This “Homecoming” aria will be performed live on 12 November in the Chinese galleries of the V&amp;A as part of its Opera: Passion, Power and Politics exhibition, which opened a fortnight ago to enthusiastic reviews. It’s an ambitious show, made in collaboration with the Royal Opera House, with plenty to see and enjoy, from Mozart’s piano to a miniature portrait of the castrato Farinelli to a Verdi manuscript. A dazzling clip of Shostakovich playing a few moments of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk on the piano is worth the ticket price (though it is available on YouTube). The exhibition demands a good deal from the visitor, with lots to read and listen to and look at – no bad thing, but inevitably it struggles with the “book on the wall” problem of many themed exhibitions. Costumes, objects, scores, instruments show the context of opera from 17th-century Venice to the present, with the focus on seven operatic premieres in seven cities. The huge open space of the new Sainsbury Gallery has been divided accordingly, with a whiz through some contemporary operas – short clips shown on large screens – as a finale. Inevitably this device leads to compromises: Monteverdi’s Poppea (premiered in Venice) rather than the earlier Orfeo (premiered in Mantua); Wagner’s Tannhäuser, first seen in an earlier version in Dresden but here used to illustrate Paris. Strauss’s Salome is presented more as social phenomenon than daring, ingenious work of art. Puccini, an entry point for so many opera-lovers, is all but omitted. The contents and displays of each of these rooms would be a wonderful contextual asset in a theatre about to perform one of the operas in question. As a method of narrative, it may leave your head spinning, not helped by all the shouty blackboard slogans (“sexuality”, “personal struggle”, “morality”). Headphones, obligatory if you want to hear any music, track where you are standing but shuffle exhaustingly from aria to aria if you move too fast (more guidance, or floor markings, would have been helpful). Hesitant at perhaps not being the obvious target, I went with three others, operatically informed but not expert, who had a similarly bemused response. The approach, as the three Ps of the show’s title tell you, is cultural history rather than music – understandable given the purpose and resources of the V&amp;A, but a lost opportunity. See it as an enjoyable plate of hors d’oeuvres. It cannot convey the substance of the real thing.

And that Google Maps thinks it’s a lighthouse. As reported by Fairfax Media this week, improperly placed GPS pins, such as one in the sleepy suburb of Dargan in New South Wales, can take hundreds of visitors to the wrong streets. In Dargan, users looking for spectacular vistas of the Blue Mountains were directed to a residential cul-de-sac. In Victoria, those searching for Aireys Inlet on the Great Ocean Road, without putting in more specific details, were directed to Gilliver’s driveway. “Where the pin is dropped on Google Maps, it is essentially on our property,” he says. “Aireys Inlet is pretty much at the start of the Great Ocean Road and our town is an iconic town in the sense that it has a lighthouse. It’s one of only four or five towns along the road with one. Tourists regularly come down our property looking for all sorts of things. People go looking for the lighthouse and end up coming down our driveway.” At weekends, Gilliver sees about five visitors a day idling down his street in a confused state. “At first we found it funny. It’s not a huge inconvenience. They stop at the driveway, look in. We probably get one each day that actually drives down the driveway.” Because his house is less visible from the road than the other properties, curious visitors sometimes venture down his driveway in the hope that something of interest lie at the end. In Dargan, locals have had to construct a sign telling visitors to search for Katoomba, or more specific destinations, instead of just typing in the region. Mark O’Charrigan, the owner of the Hatter’s Hideout lodge in Dargan, says he comes across confused visitors every week. “Where Google is actually directing them to is a road just near my place. I know all the people near the end of that road ... I built most of their houses. It’s creating a huge problem down there.” He says the number of accidental visitors is placing stress on the facilities of what is a very small residential street. “There’s absolutely no facilities for them whatsoever. No water or toilets or anything like that. Some of the neighbours near the end of that road put out a garbage bin for the amount of garbage people are throwing there. “Some people can get fairly upset that they didn’t end up where they thought they were and they need to go on another 40-minute drive to get there.” In April, Michael McElwee, of Darwin, was left similarly aggrieved after Google Maps listed his home as a pizza shop – confusing it with a pop-up restaurant that was sometimes set up in a nearby park. “I don’t know how many people have turned up at my house thinking it was a pizza place,” he told the ABC. “My daughter has been approached by people wanting to know what time we open.” While the pin in Dargan was moved after Google was contacted by Fairfax Media, nothing has been done in Aireys Inlet, Gilliver says. “We have in the past gotten in contact with Google Maps who said they would fix it but they haven’t. “We both work during the day, but we don’t want a fence around our property. We kind of wonder how many people come down our driveway when we’re not there.” A Google spokeswoman said the maps data came from a wide range of sources, including third parties and public contributions, and they were investigating the pin placement in Aireys Inlet. “We recognise that there may be occasional inaccuracies that could arise from any of those sources,” she said. “[In Dargan] we didn’t get it quite right and we have now fixed it. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to local residents and visitors.” O’Charrigan says the problem is common in the area and has worsened recently. “The last 12 months it’s accelerated hugely. It’s been on Google Maps incorrectly for quite a number of years, but for some reason the usage of Google Maps has changed. “Google Maps are picking up a lot of stuff off old paper maps, and in the mountains here a lot of those roads were not actually constructed. “When I was in Ireland last year, there’s multiple towns, districts, town lands and parish lands, with the same name. If you just type them into Google, they can take you anywhere. I might use my phone but I’ll have a paper map with me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/women-made-of-stone-lets-fix-how-we-memorialise-female-achievement","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T23:23:39Z","webTitle":"Monumental women: let's fix how we memorialise female achievement | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/women-made-of-stone-lets-fix-how-we-memorialise-female-achievement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/women-made-of-stone-lets-fix-how-we-memorialise-female-achievement","fields":{"headline":"Monumental women: let's fix how we memorialise female achievement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the wake of Charlottesville, there’s a statue battlefront that’s opened up in culture wars, and its trenches spread across the west. In Australia this week, it was journalist Tracey Spicer firing salvos at the omissions of our local legacy monuments. “In this country, there are more statues of animals than there are of real Australian women,” was her blunt announcement in Fairfax, revealing only 3% of public statues in Australia honour real-life, non-royal women. The majority of state-sanctioned monuments are – as if we need to be reminded – dedicated to the achievements of white men. The gender bias phenomenon in memorialisation is, of course, hardly new – the stats not endemic to Australia. In America, writes Spicer, they call the lack of monuments to women the “marble ceiling”, but the tradition of gendered forgetting spreads far beyond both American borders and what’s merely carved in stone. The disremembered legacies of women’s contributions to public life, literature, art and all other spheres of human endeavour extend far beyond the pre-emptive suppression of women’s genius considered by Virginia Woolf when she speculated on the fate of “Shakespeare’s sister”. It’s only been a project of very recent history to gather the fragmented histories of women who overcame attempts at their limitation – Sappho, Artemisia Gentileschi, Aphra Behn, Camille Claudel, Zora Neale Hurston, Fran Ross, Clarice Beckett, Bessie Rawlings, Ada and Lena Austin and the thousands of other greats erased from view – some for decades, some for centuries – as male preferences determined the priorities of remembrance. It’s a phenomenon of which I’ve been made mindful this week, having watched a preview of Sari Braithwaite’s short documentary, Paper Trails, which records the decline of the late Anne Deveson. Deveson was a journalist, an Australian broadcast pioneer, a brilliant writer, an activist, a feminist leader, a survivor of family violence and a mental health advocate, her face and voice recognisable to decades of Australians. The film was shot as her personal archives were prepared for donation to the National Library, in the months that the Alzheimer’s disease that had felled her mother and grandmother before her came to claim her, too. Deveson’s remarkable daughter, novelist Georgia Blain, succumbed to a brain tumour the same week as her mother died, in December, 2016. Braithwaite’s film, which will be broadcast on ABC TV’s Compass in Mental Health Week, is a moving tribute, but as the generations of our world-changing, second-wave feminist foremothers face the inevitable onset of old age and mortality, what constitutes adequate recognition for the magnitude of their social contribution – and what will be structurally, politically, materially required to preserve their legacies – is a question too important to the ongoing feminist project for us to deprioritise or ignore. There is a role for the dead among the living. Public art and national memorials are ever the “ornaments of the state” – with the role of representing the priorities of the state to itself, as well as to its citizen audience. The present failure of state and federal governments to apply a gender lens to the effect of budget decisions, to address the economic inequities that beset women and to even consider the different needs of women’s health and aged care should not surprise in a nation where real-life women comprise a mere 3% of our monumental landscape and habitual paucity among what is seen to be important. Indeed, the process of women’s cultural vanishing often begins before we’re even dead. Our ageing faces tend to fade from the screens in front of us as media tradition reaffirms a preference for aesthetics of feminine beauty that were defined for us by the kind of middle-aged men who bang and marry teenage girls. “Scientists at Duke University’s Center for Metamaterials and Integrated Plasmonics are close to perfecting an invisibility cloak,” wrote a columnist for Salon in 2013, “I want to give them a tip: If you want to make a person invisible, just put them in the shoes of an over-fifty woman and abracadabra, watch them disappear.” The cultural message of obsolescence is transmitted to the workplace. Jane Caro has observed that when women turn 50, “their ability to remain employed becomes shaky” and because women continue to dominate the low-paid occupations, older women who lose their jobs face nothing short of “disaster”. Such is the reason women over 55 are the fastest growing demographic of the Australian homeless. Is change possible? Yes, but change only results from deliberate projects, symbolic and structural. Vogue Italia’s decision this month to dedicate its issue to women over 60 is an interesting gesture, so is Maybelline recruiting Elon Musk’s mother, Maye, as a Covergirl. The challenge remains to remember women visually for more reasons than the visual. Following her death, Anne Deveson was eulogised by both Turnbull and Shorten in parliament, and there was a public memorial service for her last February. With her life’s work archived in Canberra and interest in her achievements rekindled by the documentary, my hope is that movement builds towards even more tangible, visible acknowledgement of her work. One can think of many memorialised in bronze or stone, with far less impressive achievements. Paper Trails airs on ABC’s Compass Saturday October 14 as part of Mental As week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/americans-guns-nra-las-vegas-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T05:00:44Z","webTitle":"Why Americans won’t give up their guns | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/americans-guns-nra-las-vegas-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/americans-guns-nra-las-vegas-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Why Americans won’t give up their guns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Around 3.30am on 23 November 2013 a stray bullet shattered the window of an apartment in Indianapolis where a couple watched television while their two-month-old baby slept. The man called 911, with panic in his voice. “I need to get out of here,” he told the dispatcher. “Can you get a car so I can get out of here?” “I think there’s several officers already over there,” the dispatcher replied, calmly. The 911 recordings reveal the man breathing heavily as he talks to his partner. “Put the stuff in the baby bag. Find it tomorrow. We’ll carry it to a hotel.” He urges the dispatcher to hurry up and rescue them until she loses her patience. “They’ll be there as soon as they can, all right?” she says. “As. Soon. As. They. Can. OK? Just stay inside your apartment. Do not go out. We’ll get an officer to you.” Four months later, in the same city, the country’s main gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, held its annual convention with the slogan “Stand and Fight”. In a speech in equal measure demagogic and apocalyptic, the CEO, Wayne LaPierre, evoked a nation in peril and demise. “There are terrorists and home invaders and drug cartels and carjackers and knockout gamers and rapers, haters, campus killers, airport killers … I ask you: do you trust the government to protect you? We are on our own … The things we care about most are changing … It’s why more and more Americans are buying firearms and ammunition.” Sunday’s horrific incident in Las Vegas was the 273rd mass shooting in America this year. There’s been another since then, in Miami, where four people were shot while attending a vigil to mourn a 30-year-old woman who was shot dead in her car last week. The enduring question of why America continues to maintain such lax gun laws when such atrocities are so commonplace can in no small part be answered by this frightened man’s call and LaPierre’s dystopian response. The man’s fear and LaPierre’s fearmongering are intimately connected. That connection goes beyond the weapon itself, and the piecemeal laws that might control it, to some of the country’s most cherished myths and pervasive pathologies. When the national narrative is a story of conquering, dominating, force and power, an atavistic attachment to the gun can have more pull than a rational case against it. In a society that fetishises self-reliance, the gun speaks to rugged individualism – each person should be responsible for saving themselves. In a political culture that favours small government, the gun stands as a counterpoint to a lumbering and inefficient state – defend yourself, because by the time the police get there you’ll be dead. It underpins a certain sense of masculinity and homestead – a real man should be able to protect his family and home. The dispatcher told him to sit and wait; the NRA told him to stand and fight. These claims for the gun are of course nonsense. Most people who are killed by guns kill themselves. People who have a gun in the house are far more likely to be shot dead than those who don’t. If more guns really made you safer, America would be one of the safest places in the world. As it is seven children or teenagers are shot dead on average every day. Once a week a toddler injures someone with a gun. It would be easy to blame all of this on the NRA. The gun lobby has been central to stonewalling even the most basic commonsense reforms. Its capacity to lobby and fund politicians, locally and nationally, is unparalleled. It is because of the NRA that people on the no-fly list can still buy guns and there is no government funding for research into how to prevent gun deaths. Yet while the NRA should not be underestimated, its role should not be exaggerated either. Even as it wins (or blocks) votes in Congress a consistent majority of Americans polled this year believe gun laws should be more strict, that it’s too easy to buy a gun and that if more people carried guns America would be less safe. When it comes to supporting background checks for all gun buyers there is near-unanimity (94%). The NRA has far more power in the polity than influence outside it. But it has been able to tap into many of the core themes of the broader American narrative in a way that gun-control advocates have not. There is nothing inevitable about this. When a gunman shot children in Dunblane in 1996 Britain tightened its gun laws; when a shooter ran amok in Port Arthur that same year Australia did the same. That’s what mature and responsive democracies do. But in America, appeals to freedom, masculinity, small government and individualism, even when they are flawed, have more purchase than arguments for background checks and weapons bans, even when those arguments are right. The problem goes all the way to the top. With the largest military in the world by far, raw power was a central tenet of American foreign policy before Trump promised to unleash “fire and fury” on Kim Jong-un. When accused of abdicating America’s role on the world stage, Barack Obama (who had a “kill list”) responded like a mafia don. “Well, Muammar Gaddafi probably does not agree with that assessment,” he said. “Or at least if he was around, he wouldn’t agree with that assessment.” At home the gun is invoked as a cornerstone of America’s founding story and a safeguard against tyranny. “It’s about independence and freedom,” David Britt, a gun owner, explained to me at the NRA convention in 2012. “When you have a democratic system and an honourable people then you trust your citizens … In Europe they cede their rights and freedoms to their governments. But we think government should be subservient to us.” These myths are, of course, partial. In a nation that became possible through genocide and slavery, among other things, the gun was central to a particular notion of racial power. If gun enthusiasts were seriously concerned about state tyranny they would have been marching alongside Black Lives Matter demonstrators protesting police shootings and calling for the mass armament of poor, black neighbourhoods. That’s not the kind of tyranny they object to. But the myths are also powerful. What the gun lobby lacks in breadth of support it makes up for in depth of commitment. In 2013 – after the Sandy Hook shootings – gun advocates were far more likely to have contributed money to a pro-gun group or contacted a public official about guns than those who support gun control. Gun-control advocates, for the most part, want to change laws. Gun-rights advocates, by and large, believe they are preserving “essential truths” that make the country what it is. They have proved themselves more motivated because long after those distressing scenes from Vegas are a distant memory, these myths will remain vivid. Americans need new gun laws. But in order to get them they will have to start telling themselves a new story about the country it is, has been and wants to be. Their lives depend on it. • Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/05/patrick-harmon-utah-police-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T20:01:30Z","webTitle":"Video shows Utah police fatally shooting man from behind as he fled","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/patrick-harmon-utah-police-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/patrick-harmon-utah-police-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Video shows Utah police fatally shooting man from behind as he fled","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police in Utah fatally shot a man from behind while he was running away from officers, according to newly released footage, which has sparked accusations of racial profiling and a “brutal execution”. Prosecutors in Salt Lake City have said officers were justified in killing Patrick Harmon, 50, who was pulled over for riding a bicycle without a light and who attempted to flee when police tried to arrest him. Police are not facing charges despite the fact that the body-camera footage captured officer Clinton Fox shouting “I’ll fucking shoot you!” from a distance before he fired three bullets into Harmon, who was running in the opposite direction. “They just murdered him flat out,” Alisha Shaw, Harmon’s niece, told the Guardian on Thursday after watching the footage. “They are lying. There is no way they were threatened by anything. He was only trying to get away.” Civil rights activists said the killing of Harmon was the latest example of police brutality and a prejudiced criminal justice system in the US, where officers kill black men at disproportionately high rates. Data has shown that across the country, black citizens and people of color are stopped by police and targeted for low-level offenses at higher rates than white residents, and some reports have suggested that police stop and cite black cyclists for minor infractions with much greater frequency than others. Salt Lake officials have claimed that the killing of Harmon was legal because the officers feared for their lives, even though the video, released to local media, revealed that Harmon was not advancing toward them. Another officer said he fired his Taser at the same time that Fox shot Harmon. The footage showed the officers handcuffing Harmon as he lay on the ground face-down, groaning in pain. The district attorney’s office claimed that Harmon said “I’ll cut you” and turned and faced officers with a knife as he was running. The video, however, raises questions about the narrative. Harmon cannot be heard making that threat and was running away from the officer, not facing him, when he was killed. “He was scared. All he did was run,” said Adriane Harmon, another niece, who was sobbing after watching the footage for the first time Thursday. “It hurts … They said ‘I’m going to kill you’ and they shot him three times. He’s just moaning on the ground.” At the start of the video, Harmon appeared tearful and exasperated about police attempting to arrest him. According to prosecutors, officer Kris Smith pulled him over because he saw him “ride his bicycle across all six road lanes and a median” and he didn’t have a “required red rear tail light”. The officer said he wanted to “discuss the situation” with Harmon. The policeman eventually called for backup and determined that Harmon had an outstanding warrant for aggravated assault, according to prosecutors. Harmon appeared “emotional and distraught” and told police that he was trying to take care of his warrant, Fox testified. Salt Lake City has previously received national praise for its “de-escalation” training, aimed at encouraging officers to communicate with people and limit confrontation and use of lethal force. The department even gives out “de-escalation awards” to recognize officers who rely on these tactics. The death of Harmon is another reminder, activists said, that progressive policies do not stop officers from unjustly killing black Americans who do not pose a threat. “That officer disregarded his de-escalation training,” said Lex Scott, a local Black Lives Matter organizer. “It’s just brutal. How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?” Police declined to answer questions about the case, but the chief, Mike Brown, said in a statement: “We trust the process and support the decision from district attorney Sim Gill. I believe our officers have the training and judgement and ability to make split-second decisions in dynamic situations.” Gill added in a statement: “Officer Fox reasonably believed deadly force was necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to himself and/or others and therefore his use of deadly force was ‘justified’.” Antoinette Harmon, a 54-year-old sister, said the family grew up in St Louis, Missouri, but later moved to Utah, where they often experienced racism and prejudice. The family hadn’t seen Patrick Harmon for several years since a funeral for one of his brothers – a death that hit him hard, said Antoinette. She said her brother may have been struggling with mental illness, and the family believes he may have been homeless at one point. “The police are going to stick together no matter if it’s wrong or right,” she added. “They don’t care about black lives.” Police are rarely charged and almost never convicted for use of force in the US, where the law generally allows officers to use lethal force if they claim that they perceived a threat. “He was just being profiled,” said Shaw. “Why do we have to fight so hard for justice? All we want is to be treated equal as a black person instead of being profiled and looked at as if we were a threat.” Antionette said her brother was “goofy and fun to be around” and helped her raise her children. “He did everything he could. He was like a protector. He made sure that nobody hurt us.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-operation-conifer-protecting-the-citizen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T18:54:06Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Operation Conifer: protecting the citizen | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-operation-conifer-protecting-the-citizen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-operation-conifer-protecting-the-citizen","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Operation Conifer: protecting the citizen","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sir Edward Heath’s friends are angry that allegations against the former prime minister, who died in 2005, were investigated even though they could never be tested in court. They believe the police have caused a clear injustice: whatever the upshot, his reputation was bound to be tarnished for ever unless the investigation concluded that there was absolutely no case to answer. Today the summary results of the two-year, million-pound Wiltshire police inquiry, Operation Conifer, were published. Of more than a hundred allegations investigated, seven remained that would have meant interview under caution about allegations of rape and sexual assault – were it not obviously impossible 12 years after Heath’s death. On the heels of disastrous investigations of other public figures, including the former home secretary Sir Leon Brittan and the former defence chief Lord Bramall, this case may have dealt a blow to the credibility of the whole fight against child sexual abuse. Yet there is a good defence of the decision to investigate, and it must be heard. It rests on the Human Rights Act, which exists to protect individuals in their dealings with official power. The supreme court is due to rule whether the police are always obliged to investigate allegations of serious crime, after the appeal court upheld the argument that the greater the power of the agency of the state, the stronger the duty to investigate allegations made against it. So the police investigation into allegations against Edward Heath was not a futile attempt to bring a dead man to justice, but an important exercise in upholding the right of the citizen. This may be scant comfort to Heath’s friends. But it is an important principle. The bad feeling surrounding the Wiltshire inquiry has come dangerously close to wrecking even the slight progress made towards understanding the extent and trying to mitigate the damage of decades of institutional child sex abuse. The decision to launch, from outside the Salisbury house where Heath had lived and died, an appeal for “victims” of the former Conservative politician to come forward, has rightly been condemned. Today, the chief constable, Mike Veale, finally acknowledged it a mistake that tainted the investigation by implying the presumption of guilt. The investigation was further undermined by a highly critical judge-led inquiry into the Metropolitan police investigation into allegations against Brittan and Lord Bramall, accused of being members of a ring of paedophiles. The judge concluded that the claims were entirely unfounded, and that the police had made a terrible misjudgment in pursuing them. This is the nightmare that is at the heart of the huge attempt to learn the lessons of institutional child sex abuse. On the one hand, there are many hundreds of people whose lives have been disfigured, and often worse, by the childhood experience of abuse, denial and cover-up. There are also abusers who have never been brought to justice. On the other, there are familiar faces who have been accused but were entirely innocent. Add to this trust-sapping mix the difficulty of finding credible witnesses among survivors who are often left vulnerable by their childhood experience, and the persistent charge that there has been some kind of establishment cover-up, and it is indeed a poisonous stew. Wiltshire has pursued its investigations with care. It ought to mark the start of the real work. The prize – a system that has the widest public confidence in its ability to protect children and punish abusers – is worth fighting for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/alexandra-shulman-vogue-editor-edward-enninful-attack-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"Alexandra Shulman’s cheap shot at her successor is a sad fall from grace | Yasmin Jones-Henry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/alexandra-shulman-vogue-editor-edward-enninful-attack-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/alexandra-shulman-vogue-editor-edward-enninful-attack-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Alexandra Shulman’s cheap shot at her successor is a sad fall from grace","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Being a fashion journalist and loyal Vogue reader, when I saw that former editor Alexandra Shulman had written a piece headlined “What makes a great magazine editor?”, I couldn’t wait to read it. Assuming she would be reflecting on her career, I was hoping for thoughts on why Vogue had entirely missed the e-commerce boat. Perhaps advice on how to read future trends. Or maybe the lessons she had learned about the need to adapt and evolve in fashion. Instead there was a bitter polemic criticising a new generation of editors who were “less magazine journalists and more celebrities or fashion personalities with substantial social media followings”. With what is clearly a parting shot at her successor, Edward Enninful, Shulman has damaged her legacy by reminding the world of her own failure. I was born in 1992, the year Shulman was appointed editor-in-chief of British Vogue. I am also one of the few, loyal millennials who hung on her every word. I have collected every issue of British Vogue since March 2004. In other words, I was a fan. And I didn’t buy it just for the pictures. World-class literary criticism and enlightening history of art pieces often peppered the pages amid the fashion features. I absorbed it all. Former classmates can confirm that my copy of Vogue was as important to me as my textbooks. So to see a journalist I once held in such high esteem revert to such base tactics has left me somewhat saddened. So why? Why take a swipe at a man who has only been in the role for two months? Why betray the remaining members of her former staff, who had clearly confided in her about their nervousness surrounding their jobs? Her critique of Enninful’s editorial credibility, his black book of celebrity friends, who include Kate Moss, and popularity with millennials exposed many of her own shortcomings. As a teenager, I often found myself defending Vogue to my peers against accusations that it was out of touch, irrelevant, stuck-up and very white. Some of those charges were true. During Shulman’s 25-year reign, out of 306 covers, only 11 featured women of colour. Of those, six featured supermodel Naomi Campbell. The remaining five were of celebrities such as Beyoncé and Rihanna. It is no wonder that in August a photograph of Shulman’s Vogue team, published in the September edition (her final issue), went viral after Naomi Campbell reposted it on Instagram, publicly announcing her hopes under Enninful’s leadership for a more diverse team. Her frustration was shared by many. With reposts from other famous models, and celebrities around the world – it seemed as if the audience on social media that Shulman mentions in her article agreed with Campbell’s criticism. And they weren’t all woke millenials. Tracee Ellis Ross and Stefano Gabbana were among those who sided with Campbell. “Magazines are a business” Shulman wrote, yet she will always be remembered as the editor who was in charge when Vogue missed the internet. The digitisation of magazines, click-through ads, interactive apps and the advent of e-commerce –it all happened on her watch, but somewhere else. Vogue had the readers, the subscribers and advertisers. So how did Natalie Massenet, a Condé Nast alum and former colleague of Shulman, slip through their fingers only to found the multibillion-pound luxury e-commerce empire Net-a-Porter? That is a mistake that Condé Nast will not wish to make again. The price of failing to adapt, failing to evolve, failing to incorporate diversity, failing to accept that times have changed, is enough to make any publisher revise their stance. By bringing in an editor who is not the son of an aristocrat or a relative of a well-known editor, but a Ghanaian immigrant who has forged his name working with cool brands from an early age, building an enviable fanbase that is both multicultural and dynamic – it would appear that Shulman’s former employers got the message loud and clear. Radical changes were necessary to stem the decay. So what if his contributing editors didn’t go to boarding school? New beauty editor at large, Pat McGrath, is a pioneering make-up artist. The veteran supermodels Campbell and Moss have a perspective on the fashion world that no other magazine can contend with. Unlike Shulman, Enninful is widely acknowledged as being a consistent force for good in the fight for diversity in fashion. A stylist under Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani when the legendary all black edition, featuring only black models, became one of the most successful selling covers internationally to date. So what does make a great magazine editor? Someone with the humility to accept when their time is up. Someone brave enough to admit their mistakes – preventing the next generation from making more of the same. Shulman should have simply waited for the end result of Enninful’s revolution before issuing a public statement. Any negative press in the lead-up to Enninful’s first edition as new editor could harm Vogue’s reputation. What great magazine editor would want that? • Yasmin Jones-Henry is a journalist and the editor of workinfashion.me"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/05/wales-aaron-ramsey-georgia-chris-coleman-russia-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T21:30:34Z","webTitle":"Wales look to Aaron Ramsey for inspiration in crunch visit to Georgia | Stuart James","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/05/wales-aaron-ramsey-georgia-chris-coleman-russia-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/05/wales-aaron-ramsey-georgia-chris-coleman-russia-2018","fields":{"headline":"Wales look to Aaron Ramsey for inspiration in crunch visit to Georgia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As Chris Coleman talked about his team’s World Cup hopes being “on a knife-edge” and described an awkward game in Georgia as “all or nothing” for his players, the Wales manager reflected on the mounting pressure that goes with the territory at this stage of a qualification campaign and said he would not want it any other way. Wales, with two matches remaining, are right in the mix for a place at the World Cup finals – something that has not been said since 1993, when Paul Bodin’s penalty thudded against a crossbar in a qualifier against Romania at the Cardiff Arms Park. From slow starts to false dawns and meaningless matches, the disappointments have been numerous for Wales over the years, which is why Coleman wants his players to relish the make-or-break scenario facing them against Georgia on Friday night and the Republic of Ireland on Monday. The challenge has been made all the harder without Gareth Bale, who misses both games with a calf injury, yet Coleman refused to dwell on that setback. He said the gameplan remains unchanged without their talisman and pointed to the fact Wales have had to line up without one of Bale, Joe Allen or Aaron Ramsey in six of their qualifying matches as evidence they can cope. “There are no excuses from us,” Coleman said. “It’s not woe is me. We’re good enough and we’re in a very good position.” The stakes could not be higher for Wales. They are second in Group D, four points adrift of Serbia, and one ahead of Ireland, with a two-leg play-off next month looking like providing the most realistic path to Russia 2018 for Wales or the Republic of Ireland. “It is on a knife-edge and we have all been there before,” Coleman said, alluding to the successful qualification campaign for Euro 2016. “We are in with a great shout and the pressure and spotlight is welcomed by me, I promise you. “Any manager will tell you that you try to stay away from all that. I welcome it. It’s great because I’m always used to ‘there’s nothing on it’ [fixtures]. We get a couple of good results at the end of the campaign and everybody gets excited and the next campaign ‘Wallop’ … after three games we’re out of it. That’s not the case now. It’s the second campaign, we’ve kept the ball rolling and we’re in with a shout. The next game it’s all or nothing and that’s what we’ve always wanted.” With Bale absent, Wales will look to Ramsey for inspiration, just as they did in Serbia in June, when the Arsenal midfielder thrived on the extra responsibility. Ramsey was outstanding that night and will hope to deliver a similar performance in Tbilisi, where he will win his 50th cap. “If he’s anywhere near his best we’ve got a chance of having a positive result,” said Coleman, who insisted he would have no qualms about starting Liverpool’s Ben Woodburn or Ethan Ampadu of Chelsea, both of whom are 17 years old. Ramsey is one of seven Wales players on a yellow card, which is far from ideal given Wales are in a position where they can ill-afford to lose anyone to suspension for the Ireland game. Coleman, however, is not thinking beyond Georgia and expects his players to do likewise. “If you are on a yellow and need to take another, so be it. We just have to go and get a performance and a result,” he said. “We can’t go into it thinking about the consequences for other games afterwards. If there’s ever a sign of that from us, we never produce a performance.” It promises to be a tricky assignment. Georgia are ranked 103rd in the world, 90 places below Wales, and were seeded sixth in Group D, yet those facts and figures are a little misleading when it comes to what Coleman and his players will be up against. Ireland were held to a 1-1 draw here last month, when Georgia looked the more accomplished team, and Wales were fortunate to escape with a point from their home game in September last year. “Of all the games in this campaign the one we could have lost was home to Georgia,” Coleman said. “They’re a very good team. They’ve got imagination, they create chances and they play risk football. That’s very difficult to play against, as we saw in Cardiff, and when the Republic played them. “They’re not afraid of anybody. They’ll take it to anybody. If we have any thoughts of hanging on, then we’ll lose the game. We have to go on the front foot. There’ll be times when we have to defend in numbers – it’s international football. But when the opportunity presents itself, we have to go for it.” Georgia (4-2-3-1, probable): Makaridze; Kakabadze, Kverkvelia, Kashia, Navalovski; Gvilia, Jigauri; Merebashvili, Kazaishvili, Chanturia; Kvilitaia.

Sir Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, who organised the event, said: “We have to acknowledge there are unethical and illegal working practices in the industry, which are preventing retailers from buying more locally. “This is not just an issue for Leicester, but a national one. However, in Leicester we want to make sure that we have the highest standards of employment; that workers are properly paid, well trained and work in safe environments. We want to support our factories to be the best they can and to set an example that others can follow.” The meeting comes after management at Asos and New Look, which manufacture in Leicester, said they would like to increase the amount of goods they make in the UK but had been put off by concerns about the exploitation of workers. Former New Look boss Anders Kristiansen has described the situation as “a ticking timebomb”. A damning 2015 report revealed endemic exploitation inside the East Midlands garment industry. According to researchers at the University of Leicester, up to 90% of those working in the sector were being paid £3 an hour – less than half the legal minimum wage. The Leicestershire area has the second highest concentration of textile manufacturing in the UK, with 1,500 businesses employing about 10,000 people.

A study of UK buyouts and merger deals involving foreign firms showed that the value of purchases of British-owned businesses fell in the first nine months of the year to its lowest level since 2010. The internal study by the consultancy EY, seen by the Guardian, found that the value of deals so far this year was roughly two-thirds of the average reported over the last seven years. British firms are awash with cash after three years of bumper profits. The combination of strong balance sheets and the low pound was expected to make them the target of foreigns takeovers or mergers that involve selling a large portion of their business to foreign buyers. But EY said the lack of interest in buying UK firms “suggests a possible fall in confidence” as the UK’s economic prospects have become clouded in uncertainty. Mark Gregory, EY’s chief UK economist, said the UK was missing out on a global trend for an increasing number of mergers and buyouts, with firms in the eurozone experiencing a surge of cross-border activity in the last year. He said: “The fall in the value of foreign mergers and acquisitions of UK companies suggests a possible fall in confidence about the UK’s economic prospects. “There was a surge in foreign activity to $100bn in the two quarters after the referendum on EU membership, probably driven by the change in value of sterling, but this fell dramatically in the first quarter of 2017 to $6bn and total activity in 2017 to date is only just over $50bn.” Each year, hundreds of foreign firms buy stakes in UK businesses or purchase a company outright to boost their presence in Britain or benefit from specialist technology and expertise. The mobile phone chipmaker Arm Holdings was bought last year by Japan’s SoftBank for £24.3bn in a move that was seen by government ministers as a vote of confidence in the UK economy after the referendum. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, welcomed figures in the summer that showed the UK attracted more than 2,200 new inward investment projects in 2016-17, a record number. But the statistics published by the Department for International Trade (DIT) revealed new jobs created by foreign investment fell by 9% last year and the number of foreign-controlled companies reporting that they expanded revenues also fell. The department said 75,226 jobs were created in 2016/17, down from 82,650 in 2015/16. The number of firms that reported growing fell from 821 to 782. EY said large deals such as the Arm Holdings buyout made the figures volatile, but a slump in activity was visible this year. Gregory said British businesses had responded to the uncertainty created by the Brexit talks by buying foreign companies, though this had tailed off in recent months. He said the aim was to make themselves less reliant on the UK should it begin to suffer a slowdown when talks between London and Brussels conclude in 2019. UK businesses were also buying domestic rivals, pushing figures for domestic takeovers to $59bn, the highest value since 2010. “The increased value of domestic activity appears to paint a different picture to the slowing international activity, but it is actually consistent with the implied fall in confidence suggested by the international activity,” Gregory said. “What we are observing is increased defensive activity in the domestic market with businesses using M&amp;A to generate revenue or operating synergies through buying scale and reducing competition.” He said many of the deals were large companies hoovering up smaller rivals’ new skills and technology as an alternative to R&amp;D. The UK’s GDP growth slowed this year to rank as the lowest in the G7. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) expects the UK growth rate to slip further next year, keeping it at the bottom of the growth league. EY said its study, which covers deals worth more than $100m and excludes property deals, was a “a good guide to corporate sentiment” and Britain’s relative attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment. “The UK M&amp;A market recovered slowly after the financial crisis but announced deal values recovered to post-crash highs in 2014 and 2015. The market slowed in 2016 and this trend has continued in 2017 with deal values and volumes well below those of 2015,” it added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/10/alt-city-guide-cambridge-bars-clubs-food-drink-music-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"The alt city guide to Cambridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/10/alt-city-guide-cambridge-bars-clubs-food-drink-music-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/10/alt-city-guide-cambridge-bars-clubs-food-drink-music-culture","fields":{"headline":"The alt city guide to Cambridge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You might imagine that in a university city as renowned as Cambridge, the student population is pivotal to its cultural life. “Not remotely,” says Cambridge-based arts journalist, Harry Sword: “It’s bizarre; they live a closeted existence. Cambridge University is a boiler room in terms of the amount of work they’re given, and they have sophisticated entertainment networks in each college so it’s a very self-contained world. “People forget that over 100,000 people were born and live here, regardless of the university,” Swords adds. From the independent enclave of Mill Road to the annual (sponsor-free) Strawberry Fair music festival, a dedicated minority of those locals work doggedly to maintain the city’s bohemian edge. In 2010, Cambridge was dubbed “clone town” due to its large concentration of chain businesses but on the fringes of the city centre – where rents are less ruinous – its DIY collectives plough on. Tight-knit, frequently interlinked groups – such as experimental music promoters Bad Timing and Crushing Death &amp; Grief – and the artist-run space Aid &amp; Abet are, says Donna Lynas, director of Wysing Arts Centre, “Making things happen in ad hoc social spaces where people can just get on and do things.” On the wider music-front, Cambridge’s love of drum’n’bass endures, most visibly at veteran night, Warning, and it has produced a stream of notable hip-hop and d’n’b artists, including Dirty Dike and Commix. Simon Baker, who runs the Green Mind gig promotion agency – which brings touring guitar bands to Cambridge – says the indie, folk and rock scene is thriving: “It’s the healthiest I’ve known it in 20-odd years.” Compiling the Soundcloud playlist for this feature, Baker struggled to limit himself to just 40(!) tracks. MUSIC The Portland Arms “Legendary in Cambridge,” declares Harry Sword, who writes about music for the Quietus and Vice. “It’s a traditional pub that has kept its regulars but it’s also a successful venue and supportive of everything from folk and indie or live hip-hop to weird electronic stuff.” It has been this way for decades, too. “The Soft Boys did a live album there in the 1970s,” says Green Mind’s Simon Baker, although the days when the separate rear venue space was “small and sweaty, a bit stuck together with gaffer-tape” are gone. In 2012, it was modernised and extended to a 200 capacity. Now it even has air-con. • 129 Chesterton Road, theportlandarms.co.uk CB2 “It’s a bistro-cafe but it has a basement room that holds about 50, where you’ll find a lot of folk and experimental music,” says Baker. “Also the Golden Hind pub has an upstairs room that Cambridge Folk Club use (ticketed gigs, Fridays); they’ve had people like Boo Hewerdine play there.” • 5-7 Norfolk Street, cb2bistro.com Blue Moon This student-friendly pub (“It’s near Anglia Ruskin University and they tend to go out more,” says Baker), is a craft beer hub: expect to find Magic Rock, Moor and Wild Beer brews on tap. The event space hosts art, poetry, comedy and underground music nights: from psych rock or queer punk gigs to DJs spinning out-there electro. “Lots of experimental stuff happens there. If you get 50 people in, you’ve got a busy room,” says Baker. • 2 Norfolk Street, cambridge.pub The Corner House This “oasis in the middle of a retail park,” as Baker describes it, is “primarily a pub but it does loads of live music, including punk and local bands stuff. Jo [Tomkins] who runs it has been in bands and she really takes care of it. It’s a great little space.” • 231 Newmarket Road, cornerhousepubcambridge.com Relevant Record Cafe “It’s somewhere to have a coffee and buy vinyl,” says Wysing Arts Centre’s Donna Lynas, “but then it also has various grassroots events running.” These include DJ nights – spanning genres from ambient to leftfield hip-hop – and gigs that tend to be jazz or folk. There has been the odd outbreak of gnarly garage-punk, too. Baker also recommends monitoring the Unitarian Church and St Philips on Mill Road, which are used for gigs: “I’ve done acoustic stuff at the Unitarian, like Sivu and, years ago, Omar Souleyman played there.” • 260 Mill Road, relevantrecordcafe.co.uk DRINK Thirsty “Essentially, it’s an off-licence – it used to be a Threshers – with a bit of seating,” says Alex Rushmer, the Cambridge-based chef and 2010 Masterchef finalist. “The co-owner, Sam Owens, has a four-tap growler system for refills of mainly UK craft beers and an amazing selection of small-producer wines. There’s a different food truck at Thirsty every night, and Sam also runs a beer garden, Thirsty Riverside at Cambridge Museum of Technology [winter season starts 27 October], where there’s loads going on from DJs to open-air cinema.” • Beer from £7 a litre, 46 Chesterton Road, wearethirsty.co.uk 196 “This bar is on Mill Road, which is where lots of independents have opened because it’s cheaper. Its cocktails are amazing,” says Vicky Fenton, who runs a mobile bar, the Spirited Mare, and the annual Wild Wood Disco (30 June 2018). “It’s small, so the windows get all steamed up and it’s not often I leave without a wobble in my step. Last time, I was on negronis but I’m adventurous here because everything on its hand-written menu is interesting.” • Cocktails from £6.95, 196 Mill Road, 196bar.com Pint Shop An Edwardian-style, 23-tap craft beer and gin palace, Pint Shop also serves cracking bar snacks (chips and curry sauce, scotch eggs etc, from £3.50) and, in its restaurant, ace small-plates such as fried squid with saffron aioli and charcoal-grilled flatbread kebabs. “It’s a city centre favourite and the covered beer garden is cosy in winter,” says Heidi White, founder of foodPark, a collective of food trucks that serves lunch in various Cambridge locations weekly. “I’m into Pint Shop’s brewery collaborations, such as the dry-hopped pils, Appalachian Green, created with Marble Beers, and new gins are always being added.” • Pint from £3.60, 10 Peas Hill, pintshop.co.uk Calverley’s Brewery Tap For those who like their beer with a side order of industrial grit, Calverley’s opens its 12-beer brew-tap each weekend (down by the railway tracks off Mill Road), with local food trucks swinging by to line stomachs. “The recent cranberry sour was excellent with Wood Fired Food Co’s spicy salami pizza,” says White, who in summer runs foodPark’s popular night market. • Open Thursday and Friday evening and all day Saturday, pint from £3.50, 23A Hooper Street, @BrewerySam Hot Numbers Hot Numbers roasts its own beans which, at two Cambridge stores, underpin the city’s best flat whites and single-origin pour-over coffees – served alongside wines from Thirsty and craft beers from the Bacchanalia bottle shop. The Gwydir Street store also hosts jazz gigs, vinyl-listening sessions and, says White, serves an A1 brunch menu: “It’s rare to find a good brunch in Cambridge served weekdays and, as well the usual avo on toast (£5.90), it does exciting dishes such as kimchi and feta eggs with a great gochujang (red chili paste) tomato sauce (£8.90).” • Coffee from £2.20, Dales Brewery, Gwydir Street, hotnumberscoffee.co.uk FOOD Steak &amp; Honour “FoodPark was a game-changer,” says Rushmer of the Cambridge street food event series, which incubated burger dons Steak &amp; Honour.

Today, this social enterprise comprises three venues that cover all bases in music, dance, theatre, spoken word and comedy. The Junction is a favourite, says Simon Baker, with big acts looking for somewhere to warm-up for large tours. • Clifton Way, junction.co.uk Wysing Arts Centre This rural campus nine miles west of Cambridge is many things: artists’ studios, gallery space, community cafe, recording studio and label (Wysing Polyphonic). It also commissions work, which is often developed on-site, as part of its artist residency programme, and shown globally. Wysing is currently home to Andromedan Sad Girl, an immersive installation of sculptures and wall paintings evoking a “lost pre-symbolic civilisation”. “I tend to go there for the annual electronic music festival,” says Harry Sword. “It’s strange because the grounds are interesting and it’s a peaceful place in which to experience challenging music.

The former deputy prime minister has admitted it is “odd” for him to encourage voters to join a political party other than his own, but he believes that Brexit is a “time of national emergency” and requires greater pressure on the two main parties. Clegg’s intervention has angered at least one senior Lib Dem, who said Clegg should think about the good of the party instead of book sales. The party source said: “Nick is not helping at a time when we could do with some message discipline.” In extracts from his new book, How To Stop Brexit, due to be published next week, Clegg has called for those worried about Brexit to “make your voice heard” by joining the Labour or Conservative party. In the book, he says: “How, you may ask, is it possible to influence a political party? “How can you make your views known to Jeremy Corbyn? “Here’s how: join the Labour party and make your voice heard.” He continues: “At a time of national emergency, and for as long as parliament is dominated by Labour and Conservative MPs, it is undoubtedly true that what happens within the two larger establishment parties is of the greatest importance. “So if you can’t stomach joining the Labour party, if you are ideologically inclined in a Conservative direction in any event and if you also believe that Brexit is the issue of our times, then joining the Conservatives is another route to make your views felt.” More than 80% of voters backed either Labour or the Tories in the general election in June, the biggest proportion since 1970, as smaller parties such as the Lib Dems and Ukip were squeezed out. Clegg lost his Sheffield Hallam seat to Labour’s Jared O’Mara. A Lib Dem spokesman said Clegg was making a wider point about the importance of Brexit but remained committed to the Lib Dems under Vince Cable. “Pro-Europeans across the political spectrum should get involved and make their voices heard. The Liberal Democrats are the only party offering people an exit from Brexit. “Nick is a card-carrying Liberal Democrat and of course wants people to join the party – he is making a wider point that pro-Europeans of all political stripes need to stand up and be counted,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/05/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-industry-response","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T01:38:52Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein: bombshell allegations hint at dark side to Hollywood kingmaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/05/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-industry-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/05/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations-film-industry-response","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein: bombshell allegations hint at dark side to Hollywood kingmaker","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Meryl Streep referred to him as God while accepting a Golden Globe. Quentin Tarantino compared their working relationship to a “22-year marriage”. He hosted a star-packed fundraiser for Hillary Clinton and hired Malia Obama as an intern. But Harvey Weinstein’s position as one of the most enduring members of Hollywood’s elite is in jeopardy after a blistering article in the New York Times accusing the movie producer of “decades of sexual harassment”. Weinstein responded with an apologetic statement which, it later turned out, misquoted a lyric from Jay Z’s 4:44 song. “I’m not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children,” Weinstein said, wrongly ascribing the lyric to the rapper. “The same is true for me.” Rumors of abrasive behavior have followed the 65-year-old throughout his career. But the New York Times article, which rested on testimonies from female assistants, ex-colleagues and high-profile actors who portrayed Weinstein as having used his power to coerce women into satisfying his sexual urges. It hinted at an even darker side to the man who many see as one of the modern fathers of the independent movie scene. Despite Weinstein’s public display of contrition, acknowledging his behavior with colleagues had “caused a lot of pain”, his lawyers are pushing back forcefully against the claims and say they are preparing a lawsuit. One of his lawyers, Lisa Bloom, said the movie producer “denies many of the accusations as patently false”, while another, Charles Harder, declared the report “saturated with false and defamatory statements”. While rumblings of the bombshell allegations emerged earlier this week, the accusations began back in 2015, when hearsay over Weinstein’s behavior crossed over into something more concrete. A 22-year-old model, Ambra Battilana, formally accused him of groping her in his office. The Manhattan district attorney decided not to pursue the case and Weinstein maintained his innocence. But the episode hinted at a flip side to the glamorous image cultivated by a man known for championing independent film-makers, befriending starlets and helping them all to win a bounty of Oscars. Weinstein became one of the few producers to be deemed a star in his own right, booking talkshow spots and nabbing interviews with top publications. He wasn’t just interested in mere surface success, though, he wanted the substance to go with it and built a career on often fascinatingly audacious films that appealed to both audiences and critics. In the late 1970s, he started Miramax, a distribution company with his brother, Bob Weinstein. The following decade saw the two bring films such as Errol Morris’s death-row documentary The Thin Blue Line to art-house cinemas and it was in 1989 that they finally broke out with Steven Soderbergh’s Sex, Lies and Videotape, a film that turned the company into the most successful independent studio in America. It was the start of a string of indie hits that eventually attracted the attention of Disney who offered them $80m for ownership of the company in 1993. The deal initially led to even bigger successes, from Clerks to Pulp Fiction, and in 1997, they won their first best-picture Oscar for The English Patient. Weinstein became a fixture at the Academy Awards, with Shakespeare in Love and Chicago also winning alongside nominations for many other films. “The only reason we did it was because the studios dominated the industry, so we said, ‘OK, how do you be a maverick?’” he said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. “I’m sure I’m not loved by the Academy establishment, but so be it. Those movies that win, like Moonlight, are a result of some of the work that we did.” But as Weinstein’s profile grew, so did stories of conflict behind the scenes. He gained a reputation as a difficult control freak, known as “Harvey Scissorhands” for his often brutal edits. “I’m not cutting for fun,” he once said in a New Yorker interview. “I’m cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies.” In 2002, he fell out with Frida director Julie Taymor after they disagreed over the results of a test screening. “You are the most arrogant person I have ever met,” he reportedly said to her. “Go market the fucking film yourself!” In 2008, leaked emails between Weinstein and The Reader director Stephen Daldry revealed a rushed, tense film-making process. “I cannot be party to a process that strips me of my ability to make my work good,” Daldry reportedly wrote. “That is not something you can require of me ... I have to call a halt to this process, this arguing over a date, and simply say that there is a line I will not cross, and this is it.” The director James Gray had numerous run-ins with Weinstein, most recently when the two disagreed over the 2013 drama The Immigrant, starring Marion Cotillard. Despite positive reviews when it premiered at Cannes, it was belatedly given a small release and is yet to be seen in the UK. “Harvey burying the movie was a very self-destructive act, which was basically an extension of the rejection of him,” Gray told the Telegraph. “It violated his narcissistic principles. When you don’t do exactly what he wants, it doesn’t matter that it’s in his self-interest to protect the film – he doesn’t see it that way.” Mark Lipsky, who worked as an executive at Miramax, referred to Harvey, and his brother Bob, as “two of the most unrepentant bullies I’d ever met.” (A longtime Weinstein employee, Meryl Poster, later dismissed the accusation, accusing Lipsky of “a history of being bitter over the years since he’s parted from the company” – although she did concede that Harvey had a “history of bad temper”.) Harvey himself addressed his reputation in an interview with New York magazine in 2004. “You know, for years I used to read about myself,” he said. “They’d say, ‘He has a temper’ or ‘He’s a bully’ or something like that, and it always bothered me. You know, I always felt guilty about it. Somebody said, ‘The flower bill that is written by Harvey could have’ – you know what I mean – ‘because he needs so many apologies, could fund a small nation.’” The damning effect of angering film-makers can also be seen in his filmography. After the Weinsteins left Miramax to launch The Weinstein Company, successes have been less frequent. Their most recent films included box-office disappointments Leap, Tulip Fever, 3 Generations, Gold and The Founder, while their forthcoming Benedict Cumberbatch drama, The Current War, received negative reviews at this year’s Toronto film festival. Still, his so-called flower bill has often remained under-reported because the artists that Harvey has fallen out with have usually been independent film-makers. Big-name stars have tended to gravitate toward Weinstein and his films, even if that relationship is now on shaky ground. In the New York Times article outlining allegations of sexual harassment, the actor Ashley Judd reminisces about an interaction in his hotel room when, she alleges, he tried to massage her and then ask her to watch him take a shower. It also details a 1997 settlement with Scream’s star Rose McGowan after an “incident” in a hotel room. The response to the New York Times report has been swift and damning in the court of public opinion. Lena Dunham praised the “brave” women who have spoken out, while the producer Keith Calder, who dealt with Weinstein on his 2006 horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, referred to him as “the worst person in the film business”. CNN’s anchor Jake Tapper quoted an unnamed producer friend who, he said, was “shocked” that it had taken so long for such an exposé to come out. Senator Patrick Leahy was the first politician to give away any money donated by Weinstein towards his campaign for re-election. And the difficulties for Weinstein appear far from over. Ronan Farrow is rumored to be working on a “lengthy” piece for the New Yorker that has been in production for over a year. Weinstein has announced a leave of absence from his company, but it is unclear how this will affect his upcoming slate of politically charged films such as Michael Moore’s Donald Trump documentary and a pro-gun control drama with Meryl Streep. Last year, Weinstein started funding a private foundation to help champion LGBT rights, women’s rights and the increased visibility of female directors within Hollywood, something that he now hopes will help rehabilitate his image. “While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year,” he said in his statement. “It will be named after my mom and I won’t disappoint her.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/08/trump-not-surprised-by-sexual-harassment-allegations-against-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T01:58:37Z","webTitle":"Trump 'not surprised' by sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/trump-not-surprised-by-sexual-harassment-allegations-against-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/08/trump-not-surprised-by-sexual-harassment-allegations-against-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Trump 'not surprised' by sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"President Donald Trump, whose presidential campaign was rocked a year ago by the release of a recording in which he boasted about groping women, has said he was not surprised by sexual harassment allegations against media mogul Harvey Weinstein. “I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time. I’m not at all surprised to see it,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday. The Oscar-winning movie producer said he was taking a leave of absence from his company and seeking therapy after the New York Times reported he had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who made allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact. In an initial statement, Weinstein, who has not faced criminal charges, apologized for the “pain” he had caused. He and his attorneys, however, have said he denies “many” of the allegations, none of which have been independently confirmed by the Guardian. Trump faced resounding criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike after the release of a 2005 recording from NBC’s Access Hollywood in which he talked in vulgar terms about grabbing women by the genitals and trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman. The recording was released a year ago. Asked about that by a reporter on Saturday, Trump said: “That’s just locker room.” As a candidate, Trump at one point brushed off the recording as “locker room banter” but also apologized for making the remarks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/07/holland-belarus-sweden-luxembourg-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T21:45:38Z","webTitle":"Holland see off Belarus but need miracle after Sweden’s rout of Luxembourg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/07/holland-belarus-sweden-luxembourg-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/07/holland-belarus-sweden-luxembourg-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Holland see off Belarus but need miracle after Sweden’s rout of Luxembourg","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Holland’s chances of reaching the World Cup finals are almost certainly over, with Saturday night’s results meaning Dick Advocaat’s team need to beat Sweden by seven goals on Tuesday to reach the play-offs, while Bosnia-Herzegovina’s dramatic 4-3 home defeat by Belgium in Sarajevo had implications well beyond their hopes of finishing second in Group H. The Dutch won 3-1 in Belarus in Group A but look set to miss out on their second major tournament in a row because of their inferior goal difference. Sweden’s 8-0 thrashing of Luxembourg in Solna gives them a goal-difference superiority over Holland of 12 goals and they have also scored more, so would advance if goal difference was level. The Al Ain striker Marcus Berg scored four times and the captain Andreas Granqvist converted a penalty in each half in the Swedes’ biggest victory since 1938. In Barysaw, the Brighton midfielder Davy Pröpper put Holland ahead against Belarus on 24 minutes but the defender Maksim Valadzko levelled 10 minutes into the second half. With time running out, Holland took the lead again through a penalty from Arjen Robben on 84 minutes before Memphis Depay made it 3-1 with a free-kick in stoppage time. France remain top of Group A by one point after Blaise Matuidi’s early goal proved enough to secure a 1-0 victory away to Bulgaria. The Juventus midfielder lashed home an angled finish after three minutes in Sofia, which leaves Les Bleus with their fate in their own hands for the visit of Belarus on Tuesday. The worst runners-up from the nine European groups, based on a table excluding results against the bottom-placed sides in each section, miss out on a play-off place. Bosnia – who had started this week’s programme in the last qualifying spot – have now been replaced in second spot in Group H by Greece, with a 2-1 win in Cyprus. But the Greeks’ final game is against last-placed Gibraltar, so they cannot improve on a record of 13 points from the relevant matches and a goal difference of plus four, setting a low benchmark. Bosnia’s defeat immediately sent Italy through to the play-offs and Denmark, like Northern Ireland, now need a single point from their final match. Greece’s poor goal difference also means Sweden are through as long as they avoid the seven-goal defeat to Holland that would cost them second place in their own section. Scotland will now qualify for the play-offs if they win their final game on Sunday, while should either Wales or the Republic of Ireland win Monday’s match in Cardiff then they will have done enough. Group B leaders Switzerland moved a step closer to Russia after a 5-2 win over Hungary in Basel made it nine straight qualification wins. With Portugal having won 2-0 away to Andorra the Swiss now need only a point from their trip to Lisbon – but if the hosts can secure victory, they would claim top spot. Nigeria became the first side from Africa to qualify, thanks to a 1-0 home win against Zambia. Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi scored with 17 minutes left in Uyo to establish a six-point advantage over the losers, who remain second in Group B, with one round of matches to go. South Africa boosted their chances in perhaps the most contentious group in all continents, beating Burkina Faso 3-1. South Africa have still to play Senegal twice, because the referee of the original game was found guilty of match-fixing and a replay was ordered. Senegal now top Group D after winning 2-0 in Cape Verde. With no play-offs for African teams, the final matches take place next month, but Egypt will qualify on Sunday if they win at home to Congo. Morocco will go to Ivory Coast next month needing a draw to deny their hosts, after a 3-0 win against Gabon took them top of Group C. On Friday, the USA overran Panama 4-0 in Orlando to move into the last automatic spot, but Tropical Storm Nate forced a 24-hour delay in the game between Costa Rica and Honduras. Los Ticos needed just a draw in Saturday night’s game but Honduras went ahead in the second half. Six minutes of added time were played, however, and Costa Rica equalised through Kendall Waston to seal their finals spot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/07/scotland-gordon-strachan-world-cup-qualifier-slovenia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T22:03:00Z","webTitle":"Scotland’s bumpy road to salvation reaches end game in Slovenia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/07/scotland-gordon-strachan-world-cup-qualifier-slovenia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/07/scotland-gordon-strachan-world-cup-qualifier-slovenia","fields":{"headline":"Scotland’s bumpy road to salvation reaches end game in Slovenia","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Scotland’s World Cup qualifying campaign has been epitomised by fine margins to such an extent that they will the relish the clear-cut nature of its conclusion. The scenario is simple: a win for Gordon Strachan’s team in Slovenia will secure second place in Group F. Bosnia’s defeat by Belgium on Saturday means a play-off berth would thereby be guaranteed. Given the stark Scottish failures of recent qualifying attempts even that represents commendable progress. A last-minute equaliser against Lithuania last October, while barely celebrated at the time, provided an indicator of things to come. Scotland’s World Cup dreams could have been dashed in March before the substitute Chris Martin – earlier booed on to the Hampden field – notched an 88th-minute winner to down Slovenia. The subsequent visit of England to Glasgow was defined by late madness; Scotland edged ahead with free-kicks from Leigh Griffiths before Harry Kane punished multiple concentration lapses during stoppage time. Martin Skrtel’s own goal, such a huge moment in Group F, arrived in the dying embers of Scotland hosting Slovakia on Thursday. The recurring theme perhaps means nobody should expect a straightforward game in Ljubljana on Sunday. Strachan, rightly, draws inspiration from it all. “It shows we have a fitness level,” said Strachan on Saturday evening. “People talk about mental strength but I could put you guys out there and I know you’d try as hard as you could to get a victory for Scotland. But you couldn’t do it because you are not fit enough. “You’d give it your best but you’d be knackered after 20 minutes. So you have to have the physical strength to keep the mental strength going. Our players have shown they have that in their locker. The fans know we have it in our locker as well.” This is a position Strachan would have gladly accepted before a ball was kicked in the group. “I think so, yeah,” he added. “I think we all agreed at the start of the group that, with what England have got, second place would be a smashing achievement. It’ll be another long and nervous night, I think.” Strachan’s own position and popularity has of course been intrinsically linked to the recurring moments of salvation. The Scotland manager has been elevated from being only seconds away from holding an untenable post to the present, where he could be a national icon. Since Craig Brown led the Scots to France in 1998 – their last finals appearance – Berti Vogts, Walter Smith, Alex McLeish, George Burley and Craig Levein have sampled varying degrees of painful failure to the point where the job came with the asterisk of a health warning. It was widely assumed Strachan would call time on his tenure at the conclusion of this campaign. Such an upturn in fortunes has, however, triggered debate over whether the Scottish FA should move heaven and earth to retain the former Celtic manager, whatever Sunday’s outcome for Scotland. The man himself is calm, with his players apparently the same. “I just think there is the right balance about them and I really don’t see a difference in them,” he said. Strachan remains single-minded over issues of selection. There was a shoulder shrug from the 60-year-old last weekend when it emerged Newcastle United’s Matt Ritchie was unwilling to take his named place in the Scotland squad because of unhappiness at a lack of playing time. While this probably reflects far more poorly on Ritchie than his international manager, Strachan has never offered platitudes to, or chased, players. There was also the earlier and unorthodox decision to field Kieran Tierney, Celtic’s outstanding left-back, on the right side of defence so as to accommodate both he and Andy Robertson. A makeshift back four that also includes Charlie Mulgrew, plying his trade in League One, has not conceded in three games. If there is any area of pre-match concern for Strachan in Slovenia – the carefree nature of the hosts aside – it could be the potential for play-off suspensions. Scotland’s improved form has coincided with the deployment of Griffiths as a regular starter. Should the striker be booked in Ljubljana and Scotland earn the knockout spot they crave, Griffiths would miss the first leg of a play-off. “That is something I’ll have a conversation with him about,” Strachan said. “I’ll need to have a word. His performances of late have been terrific. I just thought he was magnificent the other night. “His part in the goal was unbelievable. We had talked to them about pushing themselves that little bit more than you think you can. Then you see the way he stretched to get to the ball just to toepoke it through to Ikechi Anya. That toe poke won us the game. “That’s the difference at this level. People talk about systems and tactics but when it came down to it, what won us that game? Leigh Griffiths turning, stretching even though he might get hurt and toepokes it. That’s what made the difference.” Slovenia, who were dismal in that Hampden match seven months ago, will not be underestimated by confident visitors. “They have a fantastic record here and they’ll want to keep that going,” said Strachan. “They’ll probably be thinking they should be in second place just now if it hadn’t been for some last-minute goals.” Slovenia’s aspirations have been blunted by the loss of two experienced midfielders, Valter Birsa and Rene Krhin, to suspension. They have not, though, conceded a home goal throughout this campaign. “The expectations are the same for every other game,” insisted Srecko Katanec, Slovania’s outgoing head coach. “We’re well prepared and the atmosphere in the team is good. I’m not surprised by Scotland’s good form.” It is an illustration of that revival that a sizeable Scottish support has travelled more in expectation than hope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/08/martin-oneill-wales-republic-ireland-world-cup-qualifier","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Martin O’Neill’s odd gumption could be key to beating Wales in Cardiff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/08/martin-oneill-wales-republic-ireland-world-cup-qualifier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/08/martin-oneill-wales-republic-ireland-world-cup-qualifier","fields":{"headline":"Martin O’Neill’s odd gumption could be key to beating Wales in Cardiff","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If Bear Grylls ever decides to stop making TV shows, perhaps Martin O’Neill could replace him. The Northern Irishman might not be able to tell viewers which plants to eat or how to make a bivouac from turtle faeces – in fact, his methods might remain unclear throughout the entire series – but he would probably survive and thrive, nonetheless. It is a rare and fascinating quality that O’Neill has, some kind of gumption that means he and anyone he leads regularly finds a way to prevail in awkward environments, including messes of their own creation. He appears to revel in doom-or-glory scenarios. Which is why Monday’s World Cup qualification showdown between the Republic of Ireland and Wales in Cardiff is right up his street. There is no danger of him playing down the significance of the match to his players. “It’s a really great game to have,” he says. “I’ve been involved in a few – including a couple of European Cup wins – and I’ve got to tell you, this is big. I keep telling the players that it’s absolutely fantastic to be involved in a World Cup, dealing with great nations. With a bit of luck you could be in the same group as someone like Messi. It’s fantastic. I tell the players: ‘This is it, so don’t die wondering. Go for it!’” The Republic’s best performances during O’Neill’s four years in charge have come in matches where they had no choice but to win. They have jumped from disappointments to memorable triumphs by beating Germany in October 2015, overcoming Bosnia-Herzegovina in a play-off to reach Euro 2016 and then progressing to the knockout stage of that tournament by pulling out a victory over Italy. Not only has O’Neill been able to inspire his players to rise to those occasions, he has made some big and slightly surprising decisions for them, and been vindicated. Against the world champions he handed a first competitive appearance to goalkeeper Darren Randolph, and against Italy he did the same for the centre-back Shane Duffy. He suggests he could spring a similar surprise or two for the clash in Cardiff. “In big matches we have taken a lot of risks with people,” he says. “We may have to do it again.” Perhaps the biggest decision he has to make relates to his strike force, in particular Shane Long. Getting the win they need will entail scoring at least one goal and Long has not done that since February. The Southampton player has produced special moments in the past and continues to do a lot of valuable work stretching opposing defences but his finishing has been so shoddy in recent months that he looks drained of confidence, especially after missing three clear chances in the win over Moldova on Friday. Will Long be dropped for the Wales game and replaced by someone less experienced but in better form, such as Preston’s Sean Maguire? “I’ll have to think about it,” says O’Neill. “Centre-forwards get great confidence from scoring goals and he [Long] has missed a couple of chances. I’ll have a look at it and see how he is. It would have been nice if one of those chances had gone in because it would have been a big boost for him.” The manager knows Ireland can ill-afford to be wasteful in Wales. “To win we will need a couple of things,” he says. “One, in an intense atmosphere like that, you have to play with your head and with a great deal of intensity. The two sometimes don’t marry. And if we have some chances, we have to take them, be more clinical. As simple as that. Because if you keep spurning chances, you’re not going to win a football match.” There are other big calls O’Neill must make in the attacking sector. James McClean and Robbie Brady seem certain to return to the side after being suspended for the game against Moldova, with Callum O’Dowda likely to drop back to the bench despite his excellent display in that match. But will Wes Hoolahan also make way? O’Neill’s reluctance to pick the 35-year-old regularly, especially for away matches, vexes most Irish fans, who have noted that whenever Ireland have produced incisive moves in recent years, Hoolahan has tended to be at the heart of them. Without the Norwich schemer Ireland have often been bereft of creativity. One example was the defeat against Scotland at Celtic Park in the qualifiers for Euro 2016. “That became like a league game as much as anything else,” recalls O’Neill. “And this [against Wales] might turn out to be exactly the same, I don’t know.” Monday’s match threatens to be even more feisty if the bad blood that infected the countries’ meeting in Dublin in March has curdled. How much animosity lingers from that will soon be seen. What is already clear is that Ireland are not rushing to commiserate with Wales over the absence of Gareth Bale, who has been ruled out with a calf injury. “Gareth Bale is a top-class player and Wales will feel that he is a loss to them in the same way I feel Seamus Coleman has been a big loss to us,” says O’Neill. “If you go through all the games we’ve played both in this and the Euro 2016 campaign, we’ve had to battle through with players that are important to us missing. So try to put it into some sort of context. I’m sure Wales will feel they’d have a better chance of winning if he was playing but that’s the nature of the game.” The nature of Monday’s game could be gripping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/07/wales-chris-coleman-republic-of-ireland-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T21:30:32Z","webTitle":"Wales’s Chris Coleman braced for ‘hell of a game’ against Ireland in pivotal match","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/07/wales-chris-coleman-republic-of-ireland-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/07/wales-chris-coleman-republic-of-ireland-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Wales’s Chris Coleman braced for ‘hell of a game’ against Ireland in pivotal match","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Chris Coleman expects a physical game against the Republic of Ireland but is adamant that the bitter fall-out from the goalless draw in Dublin in March, when Seamus Coleman suffered a broken leg following a reckless challenge from Neil Taylor, will not affect Wales’s approach to Monday’s pivotal World Cup qualifier. With Wales and Ireland both in with a chance of qualifying for the finals automatically after Serbia lost against Austria on Friday, the stakes could not be higher for what promises to be a highly charged occasion. Wales are second in Group D, one point ahead of Ireland, and the fractious nature of their meeting at the Aviva Stadium adds to the tension around what is in effect a winner-takes-all encounter. Taylor was sent off for his wild tackle in Dublin and Ireland felt that Gareth Bale was also fortunate to escape a red card in a game short of quality but high on incident. Coleman was forced to defend his players in a spiky press conference that strayed into strange territory at times and prompted the Wales manager to say at one stage: “Your boys weren’t coming off with halos on their heads.” For Coleman, however, the tempestuous nature of that match seven months ago belongs to the past. The Wales manager said that everyone in his squad was upset by what happened to the Ireland captain, but he also made it clear that he had no intention of bringing up the incident with his players during their preparation for the match. “After the game in Dublin, Neil Taylor was absolutely devastated, as we all were,” the Wales manager said. “Seamus Coleman’s such a good player and you never want to see that happen. But what happened afterwards in terms of the media and the press conference, I can’t control that. If they [the Irish press] want to ask those type of questions that’s up to them. “All I can control is my own group, the players and my staff – that’s what I concentrate on and that’s what we’ll do in this game. There won’t be any mention of the unfortunate incident, we’re just going to get on with our game-plan and make sure we’re 100% focused on doing what we’re good at. “It’s the last game of the campaign, all or nothing for both teams. So even without the unfortunate incident in Dublin with Tayls and Seamus, this was always going to be a game where there will be two teams locking horns. There will be lots of contact in the game, it will be physical, with good players there as well. There will be chances at either end and there won’t be much in it.” While a point could be enough for Wales to secure a play-off place, the Republic need to win. That Wales have lost once in 21 qualifiers and not suffered a defeat on home soil in a competitive match for more than four years suggests the odds are stacked heavily in their favour, yet Coleman is taking nothing for granted and anticipates “a hell of a game”. “We’ve got to make sure we continue on the same path and we have the same hunger and desire as we’ve always had,” he said. “There’s no excuse, saying: ‘But haven’t we done so well, we’re ranked here, we’ve been to a semi-final, so it’s OK.’ It’s not OK. It can never be OK. “Every game we go into, we look at it as our last one and make the most of it. That’s down to the players’ mentality as well. If they don’t buy into it, I’m dead in the water anyway. But they’ve been great.” Bale remains sidelined with the calf injury that ruled him out of Friday’s gritty 1-0 victory in Georgia – the first time Wales have won a game without him for four years – but the Real Madrid forward will be contributing in Cardiff in another way. “Gareth will be there. James Collins will be there, I imagine Jazz Richards will be, too – that’s ‘Together Stronger’,” said Coleman, referring to the national team’s slogan. “I never demanded them to come. That’s them saying: ‘We’re going to be there and make sure we support the boys.’ And we’re going to need it. “It’s going to be a hell of a game on Monday. The Republic will be ready for it, so we’re going to need all the help we can get.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/07/more-than-100-arrests-in-anti-putin-protests-across-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T18:09:03Z","webTitle":"More than 260 arrests in anti-Putin protests across Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/07/more-than-100-arrests-in-anti-putin-protests-across-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/07/more-than-100-arrests-in-anti-putin-protests-across-russia","fields":{"headline":"More than 260 arrests in anti-Putin protests across Russia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than 260 people have been detained across Russia as jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s supporters staged protest rallies on Vladimir Putin’s 65th birthday. Dozens were arrested in Putin’s hometown of St Petersburg, Russia’s second biggest city. One woman had her leg broken when riot police dispersed hundreds of protesters chanting “Putin is a thief!” in the centre of the city, according to Russian media. Blood could be seen pouring down the head of another woman detained by police in footage posted to social media. The protest in St Petersburg was just one of more than 80 anti-Putin rallies that took place across Russia on Saturday, after Navalny was sentenced to 20 days in prison on Monday for organising “unsanctioned public rallies.” This was the third time Navalny, a 41-year-old anti-corruption lawyer who wants to stand against Putin at next year’s presidential elections, has been jailed since March. In a message dictated from prison, Navalny urged his supporters to demand that the Kremlin allow genuine political competition. Russia’s government-controlled election committee says the opposition leader is barred from running at next March’s elections because of a previous conviction for fraud. Navalny says the charges were trumped up to prevent him challenging Putin for the presidency. In Moscow, about 1,000 protesters braved riot police and driving rain to gather at Pushkin Square before marching towards the Kremlin, where they were blocked by lines of police. Demonstrator numbers were significantly down on similar anti-Putin rallies held in March and June. “Down with the tsar!” chanted the crowd, in a mocking reference to Putin, who has now ruled Russia for almost 18 years. Others urged Putin to retire. One man held a brightly-decorated box labelled “Pension”. “I’m here today to stand up for my rights,” said Yevgeny Тarasov, a 19-year-old student. “I want to live in a country where there are fair elections.” Andrey Zvyagintsev, Russia’s Oscar-nominated film director, was one of a number of Russian cultural figures to criticise the Kremlin ahead of the rallies. “What are you afraid of? An open political battle?” Zvyagintsev said, in an online video. “It’s revolting to observe this show.” Putin has not yet confirmed that he will seek a new six-year term of office next year, but many analysts expect him to announce his candidacy next month or in early December. Although police clamped down hard on the protest in St Petersburg, they were far less heavy-handed in Moscow than at previous opposition events in the Russian capital. Just three people were detained, according to OVD-Info, a website that monitors arrests at opposition rallies. More than 1,000 people, including dozens of schoolchildren, had been arrested at the two previous protest rallies organised by Navalny in Moscow this year. On Saturday, the total number of arrests across the country was more than 260. In Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-biggest city, 24 people were detained at a demonstration that was also attended by Yevgeny Roizman, the city’s opposition-friendly mayor. Navalny, a pro-democracy politician with undisguised nationalist views, has won a substantial following in Russia with his investigations into government corruption. He first emerged as a prominent opposition figure during the massive anti-Putin protests that rocked Moscow in 2011-2012. The opposition leader’s campaign staff came under heavy pressure ahead of Saturday’s rallies. Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s chief-of-staff, was jailed for 20 days on Thursday for posting two tweets about the protests. “Do you understand the charges?” the judge asked. “I understand you have no conscience,” said Volkov, whose heavily pregnant wife is due to give birth at any time. In Rostov-on-Don, a city in Russia’s south, a senior police official threatened a member of Navalny’s campaign team. “I’ll fucking do you, and you’ll remember me for a long time,” the police official said, according to a telephone conversation posted online by campaign staff. The Kremlin said Putin spent his birthday making telephone calls to world leaders and heading a scheduled meeting with members of Russia’s security council."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/07/london-irish-leicester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T16:37:27Z","webTitle":"Leicester sneak past London Irish as Jonny May keeps on scoring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/07/london-irish-leicester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/07/london-irish-leicester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leicester sneak past London Irish as Jonny May keeps on scoring","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A tale of two wingers, as Alex Lewington earned what may prove a valuable point indeed for London Irish, all the while Jonny May continues to make his case to Eddie Jones. It was still a fifth straight defeat for Irish – again, a horribly sluggish start proving costly – but Lewington’s last-gasp try, allied to Tommy Bell’s deadeye kicking, at least boosts morale with a two-week break for Europe on the horizon. Up until then it could have hardly gone closer to script for both sides – May continuing his fine try-scoring record for the Tigers and Irish once more being taught the harsh lesson that slow starts will be punished in the Premiership. May was at his elastic best throughout and he now has six tries in six Tigers appearances, while George Ford’s partnership with Matt Toomua gets better by the week – the Australian particularly impressive here. “I think [Jonny] is easily the best left winger in England,” said Leicester’s head coach, Matt O’Connor. “I’d certainly pick him. To be fair, I could have scored that try, a little bit of credit needs to go to Matty and George as well. But he’s a threat, defensively he’s good, he’s committed, he finishes and creates opportunities, and that’s what we want. He’ll be really close to Test selection.” Irish can take solace in the fact that they are getting closer to a second win of the season, having failed to earn anything from their five matches since beating Harlequins on the opening weekend. “I’m proud of the boys; they’ve got massive hearts and they’re all fighters,” said the London Irish director of rugby, Nick Kennedy. “They will fight until the 83rd minute and are ending very strong, but we need to stop giving ourselves these mountains to climb.” Leicester will, however, wonder how they were not out of sight by half-time. They had their first try after just three minutes – London Irish again conceding with the opening whistle still ringing in their ears – and, with a bit more composure in the Exiles’ 22, Leicester might have had the bonus point by the break. Nick Malouf scored the opener, a simple finish after Sam Harrison had darted up the middle. Ford added two penalties before the break but there were occasions when the England fly-half had so much space he appeared to not know what to do with it. Gareth Owen impressed on his Leicester debut, while May and Mathew Tait also made good yards with ball in hand, but, in truth, Irish – who missed 14 tackles in the first half – allowed them to. Somewhat tarnishing his excellent start, however, Owen was sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle on Greig Tonks, allowing Bell to score Irish’s first points. Considering Irish have been outscored by their opponents in the six first halves this season by more than 100 points, but are in the black after the interval, there was reason for hope among the home ranks. It seemed all but extinguished, however, when Will Evans, impressive on his first appearance of the season, ghosted past Aseli Tikoirotuma for the Tigers’ second try. Ford converted before a second Bell penalty, but Blair Cowan’s converted try brought Irish back to within eight. There was little subtlety to it, just as in the first half they battered away at the Leicester defence, but Malouf’s poor tackle allowed the Scotland back-row the space to score. May finally had the try his efforts warranted shortly after the hour, cruising over after Toomua’s delightful long pass, but Irish came again through David Paice after Ollie Hoskins burst up the middle. The deficit was eight points with 10 minutes to go – Irish desperately seeking the losing bonus point, Leicester a fourth try – but it was Lewington, the former Tigers winger and Irish’s brightest light this season, who had the final say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/07/chelsea-liverpool-womens-super-league-maren-mjelde","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T15:25:41Z","webTitle":"Chelsea’s strength in reserve shows as Maren Mjelde strike sinks Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/07/chelsea-liverpool-womens-super-league-maren-mjelde","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/07/chelsea-liverpool-womens-super-league-maren-mjelde","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea’s strength in reserve shows as Maren Mjelde strike sinks Liverpool","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"With Chelsea having gained six points and scored 12 goals from two games, the arrival of Liverpool offered a more taxing challenge, a chance for the Spring Series champions to show just how strong their Women’s Super League title credentials are. They did not disappoint in this misleadingly narrow 1-0 win. In a dominant possession-heavy performance Maren Mjelde scored their sole goal in the 13th minute with a powerful strike from the left into the far corner of Siobhan Chamberlain’s goal. It was not quite the rout of previous weeks though. With an eye on Wednesday’s trip to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, Emma Hayes made six changes to Chelsea’s starting XI. In what was perhaps an indication of her priorities this season, and the strength of her squad, Maria Thorisdottir, Fran Kirby, Hannah Blundell and Drew Spence all dropped to the bench. Ramona Bachmann and Hedvig Lindahl sat out the match altogether after the south London’s side’s impressive 1-0 home win over the German team. This was Chelsea’s third competitive game at their new Kingsmeadow home – Chelsea purchased the site from AFC Wimbledon as the Dons prepare to move back to their traditional patch. Passengers emerging from Norbiton station are greeted by players’ images on the ticket barriers. A little stream of fans, some in Chelsea kits, trickled to the ground an hour before kick-off, while a clutch of AFC Wimbledon fans milled around the entrance. The benefits of owning the stadium are evident. Chelsea Ladies branding is everywhere and crowd sizes have benefited from the move. Average WSL1 attendances in the 2016 season were 1,128; on Saturday, 2,116 made the three occupied stands at Kingsmeadow feel like a decidedly healthy attendance. The slickness of Chelsea’s branding is married with a non-league atmosphere. A groundsman wiggles the sprinklers to quickly wet more grass before kick-off, the scoreboard gets stuck on seven minutes (for four minutes), and ballgirls stroll along the edge of the pitch clutching trays of chips smothered in ketchup. It is a relaxed, family atmosphere mingled with the usual deep-voiced Chelsea chants. The accessibility and increased profile of England stars, and the crop of other internationals, post-Euro 2017, are a clear draw to the kids queuing up for signatures. For Liverpool, a result here was always going to be an uphill task; they had lost their previous five meetings with the Blues. With confidence knocked a little after their 3-0 defeat by Reading, which followed their 2-0 WSL1 season opening win against Everton, coming to south London was a test of character. Scott Rogers made two changes to the XI that lost so comprehensively to Reading, with the Scottish midfielder Caroline Weir relegated to the bench in favour of Kate Longhurst and Beth England ineligible to play as she is on loan from Chelsea. Yet Liverpool could take a lot of positives from this defeat. It was a backs-to-the-wall performance for almost the entire 90 minutes, with Jess Clarke forced to chase shadows up front against a Chelsea defence that is yet to concede. The brightest chances for Liverpool came from an ever-impressive Alex Greenwood and if they lacked a threat up front, they made up for it at the back. Holding the fearsome Chelsea attack at bay for much of the game, the England goalkeeper Chamberlain was forced into a number of fine saves that kept a turnaround possible. Chelsea’s midweek players looked a little tired as the clock ticked down but the fresh legs that sat out Wednesday slotted into the side well and caused all sorts of trouble down the wings. The USA forward Crystal Dunn, making her first start this season, ran rings round Laura Coombs on the right, while Karen Carney looked dangerous whenever given the chance to cross from the left or cut in and run at goal. The Chelsea manager, Hayes, called the win “another great coaching performance” after similar comments following the Bayern victory, and the captain, Katie Chapman, said “it was important to keep concentrated” in a game they dominated so heavily but failed to build on the opening goal. A clean sheet, a win against an outside title contender, and squad players performing when called upon, will be a huge boost for a side already brimming with confidence as they prepare for the trip to Munich. Sunday’s action Arsenal’s frustrating start to the Women’s Super League season continued as they came from behind to salvage a draw against Bristol City. Lauren Hemp, the England Under-17 captain, opened the scoring before Danielle van de Donk rescued a point for Arsenal, who trail leaders Chelsea by five points after just three matches. Both teams came close to a winner, with Jordan Nobbs and Chloe Arthur striking the woodwork for Arsenal and City respectively. The Vixens took a surprise lead after half an hour at Meadow Park, after Jessica Samuelsson failed to deal with Millie Turner’s throw-in down the left flank. After seizing possession, Hemp drove inside before unleashing a superb, curling effort at goal and beyond Sari van Veenendaal, the Arsenal goalkeeper. Five minutes after the interval, Van de Donk pulled Arsenal level. After being afforded time and space inside the box, the Dutch midfielder powered home from an acute angle, past the hapless Sophie Baggaley. Elsewhere, Emily Westwood rescued a point for Birmingham City, who fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Reading, while Sunderland recorded their second victory of the season, with Keira Ramshaw scoring the only goal of the game at Yeovil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/07/outrageous-good-fortune-smiles-once-again-on-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"Outrageous good fortune smiles once again on Theresa May | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/outrageous-good-fortune-smiles-once-again-on-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/outrageous-good-fortune-smiles-once-again-on-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Outrageous good fortune smiles once again on Theresa May","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Theresa May is a very lucky politician. Yes, really. Her career has been kissed with outrageous fortune. She was promoted to home secretary in the coalition government because Nick Clegg turned down the job and George Osborne – here’s a lovely irony – told David Cameron that it would serve them to have a dispensable woman. She lucked into being prime minister because she was the only candidate left standing when all her rivals ate each other in an orgy of Tory cannibalism. Then she wiped out her majority with a snap election that she didn’t have to call, but her colleagues hesitated to punish that debacle in the traditional way because they feared that bad could be followed by worse. Good fortune smiled on her again at the Tory conference in Manchester. Whatever impression you may have got from media coverage of her speech, the accidental prime minister got lucky again. That luck came in three parts. The prankster who managed to get to the conference stage to present her with a mock P45. Her voice creaking, croaking and then cracking up altogether. Letters dropping off the slogan behind her was the final indignity of the most presentationally calamitous conference speech anyone can recall. For the most exquisitely apposite metaphor for what has happened to her premiership, you couldn’t beat the spectacle of Mrs May gulping water as the stage set fell apart. Yet I contend that she was rather lucky. She was fortunate because everyone focused on the presentational disasters rather than the content of the speech. This was devoid of what her demoralised party required from their leader. She answered the demand for a transformative vision that revived their prospects with a tired idea about the “British Dream”, a tangle of confused arguments and uninspiring, small-bore policy announcements. Discussing her position with Tory MPs of many different factions and flavours, a word that comes up a lot is “unsustainable”. They know that they need a renewing reboot as a party and they know that she can’t do it. Even if she had the ideas, she doesn’t have the authority. Even if she had the authority, she doesn’t have the ideas. At the same time, most of them can’t see a safe route of escape from what one of their number calls this “deep and dark hole that we are in”. Grant Shapps has an idea. If she won’t jump, she will have to be putsched. The former party chairman has been roundly abused by other Tories for collecting names of MPs willing to tell her to go, but if it wasn’t him trying to organise an assassination, it would be someone else. “Shapps is not the cause of this,” remarks one of his colleagues. “He’s the symptom of it.” To trigger a vote of no confidence, Mr Shapps has to persuade 47 other Tory MPs to join him in demanding one. There are multiples of that number who have heads in hands about what is happening to their party. Yet Mr Shapps is struggling to turn the despair among his colleagues into action to remedy it. One reason that Tory MPs continue to dither is their terror of being plunged into a vicious and chaotic civil war. This fear runs through even those Conservative MPs who think Mrs May should have been gone the day after the election. “It is in the interests of the party and the country that she does go, but the dangers of forcing her out are very serious,” argues a former cabinet minister. “Pictures of her leaving Number 10 in tears would be absolutely toxic for us.” An especially diabolical scenario occurs to some of them. Mrs May could fight a confidence vote and narrowly win it. She would then be glued in place, but with her authority even more shredded. Plots to remove her are also stalling on the lack of consensus about the succession. Boris Johnson would probably do well if his name went before the Tory membership, but first he’d have to get into the final two and that is decided by Conservative MPs. The foreign secretary has many enemies burning with a determination to stop that happening. In Manchester, cabinet ministers were almost queuing up to tell me that his disruptive and attention-seeking behaviour had become intolerable. Some more or less openly suggested that he should be sacked. Amber Rudd had a good conference. She did herself no harm when she was seen urging her cabinet colleagues to their feet to give covering applause while Mrs May tried to recover her voice. The home secretary would very much like to be prime minister, but she also and correctly calculates that the time is not ripe. Her slender majority in Hastings and Rye might be a solvable difficulty, but only if she could be switched into a safer seat, a hazardous parachute jump. Another handicap is that she would be seen as the candidate of a Cameronian restoration. Her biggest problem is that she was a prominent Remainer and the ultimate selectorate, the membership of the Tory party, is extremely Brexity. So when Ms Rudd says she wants Mrs May to stay put at Number 10, the home secretary is being sincere and serving her own ambitions because she needs a contest to happen the other side of Brexit. Philip Hammond has been touted as a “safe pair of hands”. As once was Mrs May and look where that landed the Tory party. Having had recent experience of an election flop because they chose a leader who couldn’t do retail politics, it would be quite the gamble for the Tories to replace Mrs May with a man whose Treasury officials have given him the ironically intended nickname of “Box Office”. There is one senior cabinet member who would be best suited by an early vacancy. That is David Davis. He is a Brexiter who has demonstrated sufficient pragmatism that he might attract backing from some Tory Remainers. He does well in polls of activists. Unlike Boris, he does not provoke his cabinet colleagues to spit his name with venom. Time is his enemy. If there is to be a successful conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, then they will involve compromises that many Tories will find painful. Mr Davis will be the public face of concessions to the EU that will enrage sections of his party. He needs a contest before that happens and yet he cannot give the slightest impression that he is scheming to supplant the prime minister. “David won’t do anything proactive. He’ll take no part in anything,” says one of his allies with a note of regret. “He likes her and she brought him back into cabinet.” One manifestation of Tory desperation is the experimentation with some wilder ideas. Given how unpopular they are with younger generations, it is not self-evident that they will find the answer to their problems in a Bentley-driving Old Etonian, whose attitudes on issues of personal freedom were becoming dated in the 1950s. Jacob Rees-Mogg drawled to one conference fringe meeting: “I’m sorry to say I was young once. I wasn’t very good at it, but I was technically a youth.” Whatever he says, of course he wants to be leader. I heard him commend Jeremy Corbyn as an example of how far you can go by being “authentic” and having “clear principles”. Even the dimmest Tory activist present could deduce the conclusion he wanted them to draw. His fellow MPs would be highly unlikely to let him get into the final stage of a leadership contest, but the swooning over “the Mogg” by Tory activists does illustrate what more moderate Conservatives are up against. Liberal Tories are yearning to get Ruth Davidson into the mix. The leader of the Scottish Tories is funny, a fighter and she can make Tory arguments in attractive ways. Her speech was a rare moment of fizz at a torpid conference. The biggest barrier to Ms Davidson getting to Number 10, I often hear it said, is that she sits in the wrong parliament. Actually, there are bigger ones. Her friends will agree that it is an interesting question whether Conservative members, the bulk of whom are Brexit-hungry English pensioners, are ready to be led by a kick-boxing lesbian from Scotland who was a passionate campaigner for Remain. She has done an impressive job reviving the Tories in Scotland, but she has never wielded any power. She is an effervescent opposition leader; she is utterly unproved as a leader in government. So the alternatives to Mrs May who are ready don’t look right and those that might be right aren’t ready. Many covet the crown, but none seems able or willing to strike for the throne. That leaves one other way out of this grisly stalemate, which would be for Mrs May to be guided to her own conclusion that she needs to go. Some Tory MPs speculate that Philip May might “do a Denis”. Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister after her husband told her “give it up, love”. Those who know their Tory history will recall that this happened only after Mrs Thatcher had failed to win convincingly when challenged by Michael Heseltine and then been told her time was up by most of the cabinet. There is no sign of a Heseltine in the contemporary Tory party and the cabinet aren’t ready to act.

It was not the only rule she broke that day. Women students at Banaras Hindu University are not supposed to protest. Many are made to sign a contract that spells this out explicitly. Men are not required to sign anything of the kind. Nor, at many hostels on campus, are women served meat, permitted to speak on the phone after 10pm, or allowed out in the evenings when their male counterparts still roam the tree-lined campus on sputtering two-wheelers or cram into the library to study. So it was especially shocking – and unprecedented in the university’s 100-year history – when Choubey led 200 women through the gates of their college to join hundreds of others assembled outside Lanka gate, the campus’s bustling entrance. “Nobody ever misses a curfew,” she says, pulling a scarlet shawl around her shoulders. “That’s something very big for us. But we were so agitated, because these things keep happening to us.” The day before, an undergraduate student walking home from her department said she had been sexually assaulted by two men on a motorbike. Campus security guards had been sitting in plastic chairs about 20 metres away but did nothing, the woman said. She told others that the warden at her college had dismissed the incident, telling her: “They just touched you. They didn’t do anything serious.” “These comments were a spark on already burning logs,” says Dhriti Dharana, a psychology student living at the same college as the alleged victim. “We thought, to hell with everything. We’re going to protest.” The days of demonstrations that followed have brought one of India’s most prestigious and conservative universities to its knees. Its vice-chancellor is on indefinite leave. The head of security resigned. Colleges were emptied of students – “evacuated”, one said – days earlier than a scheduled holiday after footage of police using batons against young women went viral, drawing national condemnation. Banaras Hindu University, sprawling across hundreds of hectares in the holy city of Varanasi, is an unlikely site for a rebellion. Many of the women on the bikes that ply its quiet, lushly vegetated roads wear modest traditional clothing and gamchas, cotton towels, over their faces. Until this year women and men took segregated classes in the university’s large and renowned arts and social science departments. The university is a magnet for the brightest students from impoverished regions such as Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, often the first in their families to attend college, eager for a foothold in the Indian middle class. Students laugh when asked if anyone drinks on campus. “Only in secret,” says Dharana, grinning. “We take a birthday cake down the Ganga [Ganges] ghats. That’s how we party.” In part, this conservatism reflects many of the students’ own values. But it is also rigorously enforced. “It is scary, very scary, to be a woman here,” says Choubey, 21. “Eve-teasing” – a south Asian euphemism for sexual harassment – is rampant on campus, she says. “It happens to everyone. Boys go about on their bikes and they touch your dupatta [shawl], they grab your clothes, they speak shit about you, they abuse you in slang language.” One popular form of harassment is for men to label a woman “bhabhi”, or brother’s wife. “It means the girl has been set up with a guy in their group,” Choubey says. “The girl is the property of that guy. So every time his friends see me around, they call him and say, bhabhi was here, bhabhi was with another guy. And then the guy I was with gets beaten up.” She can instantly recall the last time she was harassed. “A few days ago,” she says. “I was going through the campus. It was 7pm. I was with a friend and two guys came by on a bike and called me a prostitute. There is no girl who hasn’t faced this problem on campus.” Inside their residential hostels, women students see a different side of the patriarchy – the one claiming to protect them. Starkly divergent rules for men’s and women’s hostels are a fact of life at many Indian universities. Such discrimination has sparked a national protest movement called Pinjra Tod – “Break the Cage” – as well as a supreme court challenge. At Mineshi Mishra’s college, women are banned from talking on the phone late at night. “In my first year my phone was taken away because I was talking to a friend. It was 11pm,” says the slight psychology student, peering hard over her square glasses. “They shamed me for it. They started asking me personal questions publicly. Like, the name and number of the person I was speaking to. What kind of relationship I had with him. It was weird. It was very embarrassing.” When reports that a student had been sexually assaulted on 21 September began to spread, Dharana, 23, said women were angry, but did not initially plan to protest. “Every girl at the university has been Eve-teased, molested, from the second she stepped on campus,” she says. It was when they heard the security guards and hostel staff had failed to act – and worse, apparently shrugged off the incident – that the campus ignited. “These people are supposed to look after us, but they are against us,” Dharana says. “That is what erupted this thing.” By the second night of protests, more than 1,000 people had massed outside Lanka gate and the vice-chancellor’s residence, most of them students, and a majority of them women. The vice-chancellor, Girish Chandra Tripathi, has claimed he was trying to meet with students to contain the unrest when people started throwing petrol bombs and stones. (The students say their protests were peaceful and any violence was perpetrated by outsiders.) At some point, the khaki-clad police elected to charge the crowd several times with batons, corralling the students into their colleges and shutting the gates, injuring several in the process. By the next day, footage of male police officers striking young women was being broadcast across the Indian media. The outrage was fanned by a series of car-crash interviews by Tripathi in the following days, in which he denied any problem with sexual harassment on campus, defended the baton charge against “criminals”, and told the Indian Express: “If we are going to listen to every demand of every girl, we won’t be able to run the university.” The difficulties faced by Indian women – amply illustrated by evidence of their diminishing contribution to the workforce, lagging literacy rates, and the frequency with which they are murdered as infants – have become part of the global narrative about the country since the 2012 rape and murder of a Delhi physiotherapy student. Less well known are myriad examples, especially since the Delhi attack, of women in India asserting their right to worship, loiter, divorce or live free from violence. “Women are speaking up, young girls are speaking up, they are protesting,” says Professor Reicha Tanwar, from the Women’s Studies Research Centre at Kurukshetra University. “They know that sexual violence is against the law – earlier they were not even aware.” Since last month’s protests, Banaras Hindu University has appointed a new head of security – the first woman to hold the job. She has promised to relax women’s curfews and restrictions on food, alcohol and clothing. Mishra and other students welcome the appointment, but caution: “What we are fighting for is not complete.” Those two nights of rebellion will not eradicate sexual harassment from the university, nor the gauntlet of taunts, stares and worse that Indian women face outside its gates. The women are back inside their hostels by 8pm each night. But inside their minds, Mishra says, something has shifted. “We stayed sitting out there despite the curfew timings,” she says. “We did not go back to our hostels. The fear which was inside our heads – that broke up. And that was the best thing about the movement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/07/enable-arc-khalid-abdullah-decision-retire-return-to-track-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T14:58:43Z","webTitle":"Will Enable race again next year?

Brilliant filly puts owner on the spot","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Any moment now, the future of horse racing’s latest superstar may be decided. Khalid Abdullah, owner of last Sunday’s devastating Arc winner, Enable, is expected to open a conversation this weekend with his racing manager, Lord Grimthorpe, on the question of whether she will stay in training next year or be retired for her second life as a broodmare. There is no question which outcome most racing fans are hoping for: it is only chin-stroking purists who derive as much excitement from contemplating the progeny of great horses as from seeing those great horses race themselves. But an owner-breeder such as Prince Khalid is in a different position, having built up a world-beating bloodstock operation over several decades. When Enable eventually moves across Newmarket from John Gosden’s stable to the Saudi prince’s stud, Juddmonte, she will not disappear for her owner as she will for the rest of us, but will instead take her place as part of an enormous family tree of talented thoroughbreds, the cultivation of which has been a major part of his life. Grimthorpe says Enable is “fourth-generation Juddmonte-bred”, which adds to the satisfaction of her new superstar status. It also casts light on the interesting decision by her owner to send her to be trained by Gosden. When she joined him early last year, Gosden had just won the Arc with Golden Horn and he had also been the trainer of her sire, Nathaniel, the King George winner of 2011. But the Chantilly-based André Fabre, who receives lots of Abdullah’s horses, had trained Enable’s mother, Concentric, and also her mother, Apogee, as well as most of their offspring for the same owner. Enable could easily have been sent to him and in view of his familiarity with the family it is perhaps surprising that she was not. She could have given Fabre his eighth Arc success and saved French runners from being whitewashed on Arc day. On such things the fate of nations hang. Enable arrived at Gosden’s yard in January 2016 looking “rather tall, somewhat gangly” in Grimthorpe’s words, though he adds that she “always had a nice frame”. Gosden goes further, stressing the impressive “heart room” he saw in the horse. “You don’t often see the ribcage as well developed as that,” the trainer said. Having spent almost the full year growing into that frame, Enable was finally ready for her racecourse debut in late November, at a time when the racing world was focused almost entirely on jump racing. In perhaps the most low-key race open to her, she collected £2,911 for an easy success at Newcastle on a dreich Monday lunchtime. “She looks capable of going on to better things,” recorded the Racing Post, drily. There was no wringing of hands when Enable suffered her only defeat, on her first run of 2017, at Newbury. She was a fair third over a distance short of the mile and a half that now suits her so well. The main aim had been to sharpen her up for the Cheshire Oaks. “There’s no doubt if you ran her a mile and a quarter now against those horses, you’d have a different outcome,” Grimthorpe says. The Chester race in May, in which she beat Aidan O’Brien’s Alluringly, was where we began to see the real Enable. Gosden recalls a slightly stunned Ryan Moore getting off the runner-up and telling him: “I made a move at your filly and she went again. She didn’t quicken once, she did it twice.” Even so, punters allowed her to start at 6-1 for the Oaks the following month. Grimthorpe does not complain about those odds – “a sensible price for what she’d done” – but, after shooting past the stands with five lengths in hand over Rhododendron, Enable was sure to be taken more seriously: a strong favourite for her subsequent wins in the Irish Oaks, Ascot’s King George, the Yorkshire Oaks and the Arc. The only serious bump in the road has been the broken shoulder sustained by Enable’s jockey, Frankie Dettori, in mid-June, from which he was by no means recovered when he rode her in Ireland the following month. Gosden remembers the jockey being “held together by sticky tape” but being very clear that he would give the ride up to nobody. Along the way, Enable has been known for her ability to recover quickly from her racecourse exertions, which may have something to do with her self-restraint on the gallops. “Even to this day, she never shows you her full hand at home,” says the jockey Rab Havlin, who rides her in most of her work. “That’s probably why she’s been able to keep on the boil for the whole year. The boss is a master with them type of fillies, he knows when to step back. And sometimes we’ll be like, she’ll need another bit of work … No, no. He knows and who are we to argue with him? He’s been proved right time after time.” Some felt she had a hard race at York, where she led throughout and was driven for much of the straight. Gosden felt she was merely a bit bored and did not share the widespread concern that her busy year might compromise her chance at Chantilly. “The month before the Arc was not pleasant for any of us,” he said. “The weight of expectation was so great. Fingers were going to be pointed at us if anything went wrong.” Havlin said: “You want 10 eyes when you ride her, you’re looking for stones, you’re looking for anything, you can’t take your eyes off the ground.” But Gosden’s greatest worry before the Arc “was getting boxed in from that low draw. That’s why I walked the whole track with Frankie beforehand. We set out a whole plan, which he then executed. What you don’t want is to be on the rail behind one of Aidan’s and then have another one come up on your outside. In that situation, they have every right to hold you in and then you’re stuck behind a pacemaker who will get tired and you go back through the field with him. It happened to us with So Mi Dar in the Prix de l’Opera last year.” But Dettori’s skill ensured a clear run and, having won by daylight once more, Enable is rated 134 by Timeform, the equal of Treve and a couple of points behind the very best fillies of the past half-century, Allez France, Habibti and Black Caviar. Will her owner be satisfied with that or will he want her to press on next year and perhaps establish herself as their superior? There are encouraging signs for those who wish to see more of her. She has bounced back from the French race so quickly that she was “bucking and squealing” on Friday, Gosden said. It is still less than a year since she made her racecourse debut and her trainer clearly feels there should be more to come from her as a four-year-old, though he has too much tact to make an obvious push for a particular decision from the owner. No such brakes are in place on social media or the press and not since the days of Frankel, in the same ownership, has the public been so free with its advice about a high-profile Flat racer. “I’m more than well aware of everybody saying: ‘You’ve got to do this and that’,” Grimthorpe said this week with just a soupçon of exasperation. “But entirely it’s Prince Khalid’s decision. The first thing is the horse and her wellbeing, how she is after the race. You don’t want to say, she stays in training and then suddenly something comes up. “She’s fine, don’t get me wrong, she’s come out of the race well but you just have to let these things settle a little bit for a week. And then we can sit down, discuss a possible plan which I can put up to Prince Khalid and if he likes that idea, he’ll make his decision with all the right facts in front of him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/09/england-australia-ashes-steven-smith-ben-stokes-one-sided","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T11:01:17Z","webTitle":"No Ben Stokes, no contest for confident Australia in one-sided Ashes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/09/england-australia-ashes-steven-smith-ben-stokes-one-sided","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/09/england-australia-ashes-steven-smith-ben-stokes-one-sided","fields":{"headline":"No Ben Stokes, no contest for confident Australia in one-sided Ashes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It wouldn’t be the Ashes without hype in the lead-up. This time, we’re away early. Two weeks to go before the women’s series, then another month until the men’s, and we’re already well into the conversation after Ben Stokes was arrested by Bristol police and was made unavailable by the England and Wales Cricket Board. The all-rounder will not be on the first plane to the southern side of the globe, though he hasn’t been entirely ruled out from catching another. Just between you and me, a handful of my fellow Australians may have indulged in a moment of schadenfreude after this news came through. And a bit more when he was replaced in the squad by Steven Finn, who celebrated his last trip to Australia by forgetting how to bowl. Mostly, though, the mood is disappointment. While true partisans might be relieved at England missing a key player, the average enthusiast wants the world’s best players in the biggest contests. It’s far more appealing than a turnstile of demoralised county chancers. Which, hubris or no, is what England’s touring party makes us anticipate. In a beautiful balancing of national views, the BBC’s Jonathan Agnew called it “one of the weakest squads I’ve seen” and the ABC’s Jim Maxwell said it was “one of the poorest English batting line-ups I have ever seen to come to Australia”. Building a Test order out of James Vince, Dawid Malan, Mark Stoneman and Gary Ballance is like trying to make dinner out of the tins at the back of the pantry. If Australia’s fast bowlers stay fit, England’s task on bouncy pitches will be immense. That’s said with some trepidation, given a warm breeze has often been enough to twang a paceman’s hamstring. James Pattinson’s vertebrae have already ruined the fantasy of the Four Horsemen of the Yorkerlypse, but Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are currently intact. The underrated Jackson Bird is in the wings and Peter Siddle is on the comeback trail. Much has been made of Moeen Ali’s bowling form and his aggressive opponents may give him a chance. But he will have to defy the history that makes Australia a graveyard for visiting off-spinners. For the home side, Nathan Lyon’s spin record in these conditions is at elite level. He will not have forgotten the blows he struck on England’s last visit, nor his recent series-defining efforts in Bangladesh. In contrast to England, Australia’s batting is mostly set. David Warner has made 14 of his 20 Test centuries on Australian decks. Steve Smith makes them anywhere but averages 75 at home. Usman Khawaja has plundered runs at first drop in the past two southern seasons. Like twin halves of a British referendum, Matt Renshaw has a willingness to leave and to remain; he is calm beyond his years, and starts the series at his native Gabba. Peter Handscomb has proved a ready‑made player. With the top five sorted, uncertainty below is of less concern. The wicketkeeper, Matthew Wade, has struggled with the bat and may be replaced. Hilton Cartwright is a chance for No6, as per the modern Australian habit of picking a nominal all-rounder whose bowling is so pointless that the captain never uses it, yet who fails to give the reassurance of a specialist batsman. Glenn Maxwell deserves that spot, after a fine century in the cauldron of Ranchi in March, but merit doesn’t count for much against Greg Chappell’s hunches. Alternatively, a few first-class games before Brisbane could throw up another candidate. The mood, then, is quietly confident. Far more so than in 2013, when England had just sealed its own home Ashes 3-0, and looked an even balance of ingredients against a salad of greenhorns and has-beens. Graeme Swann still had a right arm, Alastair Cook still had the captaincy, Jonathan Trott still had a career and Kevin Pietersen still had the tolerance of his team-mates. We didn’t know that Smith was about to flourish into the world’s most prolific century-maker. We didn’t know Shane Watson would come blazingly good or Ryan Harris’s body would hold together or Brad Haddin would roll one of the game’s great hot streaks. Most of all, we didn’t know Johnson would summon a primal swamp-thing from his deepest core and unleash it, fangs and mud, on an unsuspecting cast of Englishmen who might as well have been written by Gilbert and Sullivan. That should remind us that Ashes can spring surprises. But at this stage, England Women are the far better shout, still riding the elation of seizing a World Cup with two thrilling games back to back. The day before the sold-out final at Lord’s, every member of Mark Robinson’s team was beaming and relaxed. As a group they’re harmonious. They’ve hit upon a formula, and now is their time. Meanwhile, Australia are short a captain and the best player in the women’s game. The injured Meg Lanning is unmatchable with the bat and a second tier that is yet to consistently deliver will have to step up. If Stokes’s absence has swung his team low, Lanning’s is England’s best chance for a winter high."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/08/michael-danby-refuses-to-apologise-for-ad-attacking-abcs-sophie-mcneill","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T00:18:17Z","webTitle":"Michael Danby refuses to apologise for ad attacking ABC's Sophie McNeill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/08/michael-danby-refuses-to-apologise-for-ad-attacking-abcs-sophie-mcneill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/08/michael-danby-refuses-to-apologise-for-ad-attacking-abcs-sophie-mcneill","fields":{"headline":"Michael Danby refuses to apologise for ad attacking ABC's Sophie McNeill","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The federal Labor MP Michael Danby has refused to apologise for using taxpayer dollars to fund an advertisement in the Australian Jewish News accusing ABC Middle East correspondent Sophie McNeill of being biased in her reporting of Jews and Palestinians. But he has promised not to publish any more ads about McNeill, conceding he had been pulled into line by Labor leader Bill Shorten. Danby dismissed reports that senior Labor figures were planning to dump him in the preselection process before the next election because they were fed up with his behaviour, issuing a not-so-subtle warning to colleagues that he has held the seat of Melbourne Ports for many years and he intends to keep it. It comes after the ABC’s director of news, Gaven Morris, wrote to Shorten, calling on the Labor leader to curb Danby’s attack on McNeill. During a Sky News interview on Sunday, Danby said he didn’t see anything wrong with his ad, and he was “only doing his job” by reflecting the views of a large section of the Jewish community in his electorate that were concerned about fair and balanced coverage from the Middle East. He said Shorten had spoken to him about the ad, and he understood where his party leader stood on the matter. “I won’t be doing ads on the Jerusalem correspondent of the ABC in the future,” he said. “I don’t resile at all from the content of my criticism [of McNeill] ... but if people think it was made in an unsubtle way, if my friend Bill Shorten thought it was a problem, I think he’s been a great national leader, I support him, I think he’s going to win the next election, and it’s not something that I want to have a big fight with an old friend [about],” he said. Asked about reports that “senior Labor figures” were expecting him to announce he was leaving federal politics at the next election, with warnings he might face a preselection challenge if he doesn’t leave, Danby said it was interesting that no one had put their names to the threat and he didn’t believe there was an internal move to dump him. “I’ve won Melbourne Ports seven times,” he said. “It’s a very difficult seat, and I think that record speaks for itself. “I’m pretty good at counting, and I’ve got a lot of support amongst the branch membership and a lot of support among that other constituency in the Labor party, the unions in Victoria, so I’m not concerned about that. Danby suffered a 2.18% swing against him at the 2016 election, beating Liberal candidate Owen Guest by just 2,337 votes on a two-party preferred basis. He received 22,897 first-preference votes, compared to Guest’s 35,533 first preference votes, but he was able to beat Guest with preferences, taking his two-party preferred vote count to 43,572 (compared to Guest’s 41,236). The Greens candidate Steph Hodgins-May won 20,179 first-preference votes The party is confident it can beat Danby at the next election. In July, the former Middle East correspondent for the Australian John Lyons revealed that pro-Israel advocacy groups in Australia targeted McNeill, fellow ABC correspondent Peter Cave and himself. Lyons said he was subjected to consistent pressure from the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council while based in Jerusalem forfor six years. In his Middle East memoir, Balcony Over Jerusalem, Lyons said there was a campaign against McNeill before she set foot in the Middle East."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/07/danny-mcguire-fairytale-finish-leeds-grand-final-rugby-super-league","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T21:28:18Z","webTitle":"Danny McGuire proud of ‘fairytale finish’ before Leeds departure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/07/danny-mcguire-fairytale-finish-leeds-grand-final-rugby-super-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/07/danny-mcguire-fairytale-finish-leeds-grand-final-rugby-super-league","fields":{"headline":"Danny McGuire proud of ‘fairytale finish’ before Leeds departure","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Danny McGuire reiterated the time was right to leave Leeds after finishing his near two-decade association with his hometown club with another Grand Final success and the Harry Sunderland Trophy. For only the second time in Grand Final history, a single player pooled each and every one of the votes for the man-of-the-match award, following in the footsteps of his Leeds team-mate Rob Burrow, who achieved that feat in 2011. McGuire was sensational as Leeds won the Grand Final for the eighth time in only 14 seasons, comfortably beating Castleford 24-6 in his 424th and final game for the Rhinos. He will now embark on a new challenge with Hull Kingston Rovers in 2018, and the half-back was delighted to end his time with Leeds with the title. “It’s a fairytale,” he said. “I went to bed on Friday night and dreamed of the fairytale finish. A new challenge will be good for me but I was determined my Leeds career would finish on a positive note, and it couldn’t have gone any better. I said it was the right thing for the club and myself and I stick by it.” McGuire’s final game for Leeds evoked memories of 2015, when the club’s long-serving trio of Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai also left the club with a Grand Final win. Their coach, Brian McDermott, admitted the challenge was not to replace McGuire in 2018 but to evolve without him. “It’s the same as when Kevin and JP retired, you don’t replace them, you adapt,” he said. For Castleford, the post-match discussion surrounding their first Grand Final appearance revolved around Zak Hardaker, the England international who was dropped 48 hours before kick-off for a breach of club rules. Their coach, Daryl Powell, admitted the details of the player’s indiscretions – which are understood to have ruled out his chances of a place in England’s World Cup squad – will be made public shortly. “It was a big disruption,” he said. “It’s nothing to do with me but you’ll all be made aware of it pretty quickly, I think.” Powell was left to rue a slew of handling errors by the Tigers. “We saved our very worst till last,” Powell said. “We just created too many errors and credit to Leeds, they deserved to win. We just made unforced errors, mistakes and dropping the ball is so hugely disappointing. You have to wait a long time before we can straighten it up but it is what it is.” Bulls make history in women’s Grand Final Bradford Bulls became the first winners of the Women’s Super League Grand Final after they beat their West Yorkshire rivals Featherstone 36-6. Played at the Manchester Regional Arena as a curtain-raiser for the men’s Grand Final at Old Trafford, the Bulls were far too good for Featherstone as they ended their domestic season unbeaten, adding the league to their Challenge Cup success. Led by the outstanding Lois Forsell, tries from Kirsty Moroney and Forsell herself put Bradford ahead and, while Georgia Roche replied for Featherstone, that was as good as it got for them. Charlotte Booth scored to open up a commanding lead before half-time and second-half tries from Claire Garner, who also kicked four goals, Amy Hardcastle, Charlene Henegan and Haylie Hields rounded off the victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/07/tory-party-reshuffle-conservative-cabinet-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T04:33:46Z","webTitle":"Axe old guard to make way for young stars, senior Tories tell May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/07/tory-party-reshuffle-conservative-cabinet-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/07/tory-party-reshuffle-conservative-cabinet-may","fields":{"headline":"Axe old guard to make way for young stars, senior Tories tell May","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Theresa May must appoint a new generation of MPs to top jobs to breathe new life into the Conservative party and rescue her premiership, donors, ministers and grandees have warned. Senior Tory figures told the Observer that while May has no long-term future as prime minister, she can secure a legacy of “restarting the party” by going ahead with a bold but risky ministerial clear-out in the next few weeks. The plan is being widely supported by figures opposed to a Boris Johnson takeover. They believe May can deprive the foreign secretary of No 10 by staying in post for now and placing a talented pool of younger MPs in the shop window. The prime minister is being pressed to trigger the shake-up immediately after the latest round of Brexit talks with EU leaders later this month. Downing Street said any suggestions of an imminent reshuffle were “speculation”. Party whips have informed the prime minister’s office that there is significant support for the move. It comes in the wake of an attempt by former Tory chairman, Grant Shapps, to garner support for May’s removal. The reshuffle plan mirrors the actions of former leader Michael Howard, who used a shake-up after an election defeat to hand big jobs to George Osborne and David Cameron. It comes as an Opinium poll for the Observer suggests the Conservatives are seen as more divided than Labour for the first time since Jeremy Corbyn’s shock Labour leadership win. Almost half (47%) think the Tories are divided, up from 40% before the conferences, while 42% think Labour is split, down from 48%. While many mainstream Tory MPs sympathised with the circumstances of May’s calamitous conference speech, they were alarmed by the lack of ideas and energy coming from the party’s most senior figures. Others were concerned by “Labour-lite” policies on council housing and an energy price cap. However, a major reshuffle is risky, with some fearing those sacked will help agitate for May’s early removal. Allies of Johnson are confident he will not be sacked or moved, believing his interventions on Brexit have made him impossible to shift. One major Tory backer said that an immediate change of leadership was “the last thing” most Conservatives wanted. “If we can get some time to find a completely new candidate like we did with Cameron, that would easily be the most sensible way to restart the party,” they said. “She desperately needs a reshuffle to get some exposure to the public on who they are. The recent intakes have been quite good.” A senior minister also said May should “be quite brutal” in her reshuffle, moving out several of the old guard including the foreign secretary. “She is in the strongest position she’ll ever be in to get rid of him,” they said. A former cabinet minister added: “In two weeks’ time we have an important European Council meeting. Perhaps immediately after that she needs to have a proper reshuffle and promote the young bloods, bring them forward to see what they are like. It shows confidence.” Lord Heseltine, deputy prime minister to John Major, publicly urged May to “go down fighting” and waste no time in appointing a new generation of MPs, despite the dangers. “We have a relatively short window until the next election – I think two years,” he said. “The idea that Mrs May can lead us through Brexit and have a new leader in time for the next election is fanciful. She should create the opportunity for the party to choose not just a different singer, but a different song. “If she took my advice, she would go for it – but she would couple it with a determination to govern and take her chance in the forum of public opinion –with an education policy that dealt with failing schools, a housing policy that built new communities and a devolution policy that empowered the whole of the country.” Among the modernisers looking for a likely new leader there is admiration for Amber Rudd, the home secretary, but also lingering doubts about her ability to lead when she has such a precariously small majority in her Hastings and Rye seat. Johnson and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, are seen as the most likely leaders should May go early. Some of their supporters are urging them to come to an agreement. “The best thing they could do is come to an accommodation between themselves,” said one. While whips are confident that Shapps does not have the support of the 48 Tory MPs required to trigger a leadership contest, May’s tenure is still far from safe. She now faces delicate EU talks, a difficult budget and a cabinet clash over Britain’s future EU relationship – any of which could hasten her departure. “To be frank, it’s nothing to do with the conference,” said one former cabinet minister. “Everyone after the election was very unhappy. The major exercise then was limping through to recess, which she did and everyone behaved well. The conference was the relaunch that wasn’t. “Anyone can have a bad cold and have bits of lettering falling off the stage behind them, but it’s the fact that the party’s directionless. The content was extremely poor and Labour-lite. Really, she needs to consider her position.” John Major was scathing about those agitating for a change in Tory leadership behind the scenes. Writing in the Daily Mail , he said he was “saddened to see the news dominated by those who have been driven by their own personal agenda”, adding “their conduct has undermined their own party, their own prime minister, and their own government”. “The country has had enough of the self-absorbed and, frankly, disloyal behaviour we have witnessed over recent weeks,” he said. “It is time for the individuals concerned – both in parliament and in government – to focus their minds instead on the needs of the British people, rather than on their own personal ambition.” Alongside his appeal for unity, Sir John called for radical action on May’s social justice agenda to “win back hearts and minds” or risk the prospect of “neo-Marxist” Jeremy Corbyn taking office. Last night, two Conservative MEPs who voted to block progress in Britain’s Brexit talks were stripped of the party’s whip. Julie Girling, who represents South West England and Gibraltar, and Richard Ashworth, the MEP for South East England, were suspended after supporting a resolution in Strasbourg to block Brexit talks moving forward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/07/bath-worcester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T16:33:16Z","webTitle":"Bath cruise to victory over Worcester despite Freddie Burns red card","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/07/bath-worcester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/07/bath-worcester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Bath cruise to victory over Worcester despite Freddie Burns red card","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Todd Blackadder had no complaints over Freddie Burns’s red card after watching his Bath side record a bonus-point success. Burns was sent off for a tip tackle on the Warriors winger Josh Adams in the second half, but luckily for the fly-half, Bath were already four tries to the good by then. Tries from Jonathan Joseph, two from Aled Brew and one by Ben Tapuai did the damage for the home side to send them into Europe with four Premiership wins from six. “It was definitely a red card and I’ve got no complaints about the decision. As soon as you take a player above the horizontal, you leave the decision in the hands of the referee,” the Bath coach said. “There was nothing intentional in Freddie’s actions and there’s no way he’s meant to hurt anyone but I can’t argue with him being sent off.” Blackadder was delighted with his team’s performance and also had reassuring words on the health of Tapuai. The centre was the game’s stand-out performer, setting up Brew’s first and scoring one of his own before the break, but he was carried off late on after suffering a sickening blow to the head from a knee at a ruck. There was a lengthy delay while he was treated. Tapuai is expected to be out for several weeks but his long-term well-being is not in danger. “Ben is up and speaking and he’s coherent, which is great news,” Blackadder said. Bath always looked like winning but they did not have things all their own way as Worcester scored tries through Dean Hammond and Jamie Shillcock. This was Worcester’s sixth straight league defeat. They had their moments but they simply must play for the whole game rather than in fits and bursts if they are to avoid relegation. Joseph’s sensational effort put Bath ahead, Tapuai picking the ball up after his midfield partner’s kick was charged down and returning the ball to the England man. Joseph did the rest and Brew’s first of the day and Tapuai’s try – which followed an impressive Zach Mercer carry – put Bath in control. Hammond’s flying effort and a Shillcock penalty accounted for Worcester’s points. Shillcock dived over on the resumption and his team stayed in the game. But finally Bath got their crucial fourth try, Burn’s long pass finding Brew who dived over in the corner. Burns converted but the flow of the game then fell apart. Burns was rightfully dismissed for upending Adams and then followed Tapuai’s worrying departure. His replacement, Josh Lewis, eventually confirmed Bath’s success with a late penalty. Blackadder said: “Jonathan [Joseph] hyper-extended his elbow but he’s OK. Worcester did a great job disrupting our exits and we pride ourselves on those. But I couldn’t be prouder of the team and we showed how far we’ve come. If you’d offered me four wins out of six at this stage before the season, I’d have bitten your hand off.” The Worcester head coach, Carl Hogg, said: “We’d like more points and to have won some games, but you can’t fault our endeavour. We just need to be more clinical and we are not going to panic. This group is still buoyant.” Burns’s red card means he will likely serve a three-match ban and Rhys Priestland’s inflamed patellar tendon gives Blackadder a fly-half dilemma."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/07/cyrus-vance-donations-donald-ivanka-trump-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T22:08:37Z","webTitle":"Manhattan DA ignores questions regarding concern over donations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/cyrus-vance-donations-donald-ivanka-trump-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/cyrus-vance-donations-donald-ivanka-trump-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Manhattan DA ignores questions regarding concern over donations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R Vance Jr, refused on Saturday to answer questions about contributions to his re-election campaign and decisions to quash a fraud investigation involving Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr and not to prosecute the movie producer Harvey Weinstein over an alleged groping incident. Vance, who will be up for re-election in November, was a speaker at a pro-gun control event in Union Square in New York City, held in the aftermath of the Las Vegas mass shooting. Asked about the campaign contributions, he offered no comment and swiftly left the event. On Wednesday, ProPublica, WNYC and the New Yorker reported that between 2010 and 2012, prosecutors attempted to build a case against the two Trump siblings for allegedly “misleading prospective buyers of units in the Trump SoHo, a hotel and condo development”. Before meeting Vance about the case in May 2012, the report said, Donald Trump’s attorney Marc Kasowitz donated $25,000 to the DA’s re-election campaign. Vance returned the donation, according to what he said was standard practice when a donor has a case before his office. Three months later, the case was dropped. Vance told the three media outlets that was the “right call”, as he “did not at the time believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed”. Subsequent donations to Vance’s campaign by Kasowitz and organised through him, and in excess of $50,000, were accepted. Speaking to ProPublica, WNYC and the New Yorker, Vance said he would return that money. He also said Kasowitz “had no influence, and his contributions had no influence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case”. On Thursday, the International Business Times (IBT) reported that David Boies, a prominent defense attorney who has represented Weinstein’s company, though was not doing so at the time of the alleged groping incident, donated $10,000 in 2015. The donation was made after Vance’s office decided not to prosecute in the case of Ambra Battilana, an Italian model who alleged Weinstein groped her and put his hand up her skirt. Weinstein was this week the subject of a New York Times report that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment, which the 65-year-old producer has disputed. In Union Square on Saturday a spokeswoman, Joan Vollero, said: “There was not a single donation from Weinstein to Cy Vance, and nor a single donation from his attorney on the criminal matter to Cy Vance.” In a statement emailed to the Guardian later, Vollero described the IBT story as “completely false”. A spokesman for Boies’ law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, said in a statement to the IBT: “David Boies has been a supporter of the District Attorney since long before 2015, including before he was first elected, and has never spoken to him about Harvey Weinstein.” Regarding the Trump SoHo case, Vollero said in her emailed statement: “This was a two-year investigation that never produced sufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution. During the investigation, the luxury apartment purchasers reversed course and took the position that the sellers had not committed any crime against them. No outside attorney influenced any decision in this matter.” The event in Union Square was organised as an attempt to pressure the House speaker, Paul Ryan, not to allow votes on bills designed to expand concealed carry rights and eliminate restrictions on silencers. Another speaker, the Democratic New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, told the Guardian she was optimistic both pieces of legislation would be rejected. “The outrage from the American people over this incident is so overwhelming,” she said of the Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were killed and nearly 500 injured. “It’s the worst modern massacre of innocent people enjoying a festival. “These guns should not be permitted, this booster that turns a gun into a machine gun should be outlawed. If they pass a silencer bill, they’ll be able to kill even more people. We need to be thinking about how to save lives.” Maloney said DA Vance and other New York law enforcement officials were “apoplectic” over the concealed carry proposals that would “allow the country’s loosest gun laws to prevail in the most populous city in the country”. “That will just make life more dangerous,” she said, adding: “More people will die.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/07/rise-in-violent-attacks-by-patients-on-nhs-mental-health-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:00:34Z","webTitle":"Rise in violent attacks by patients on NHS mental health staff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/07/rise-in-violent-attacks-by-patients-on-nhs-mental-health-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/07/rise-in-violent-attacks-by-patients-on-nhs-mental-health-staff","fields":{"headline":"Rise in violent attacks by patients on NHS mental health staff","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Two out of five NHS mental health workers have been abused or attacked by a patient over the past year as services have become overstretched because of staff shortages, a new report has revealed. Staff have been kicked, punched and headbutted, while some had a patient try to strangle them, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people working in mental healthcare. In a catalogue of incidents one worker was repeatedly punched to the floor, another suffered a broken nose while others were bitten and spat at. In all, 42% of those surveyed by the trade union Unison had experienced some form of aggression or violence in the previous 12 months. Some staff said that being on the receiving end of such behaviour “goes with the job”. One said: “On a daily basis I would say that patients are verbally aggressive. Rather than being an unusual occurrence I now consider this almost a default position for a large number of patients.” Another described “being punched and spat at when supporting patients with their personal care, or unexpected physical abuse from patients that are confused and worked up”. A third of the nurses and other mental health staff surveyed believe that violent incidents have become more common over the past 12 months, and 87% blame staff shortages. Some staff said that the delays patients can face in accessing treatment can make them very frustrated. “Severe staff shortages mean fewer mental health nurses to deal with a rising number of users with complex needs,” said Sara Gorton, Unison’s head of health. “As a result many staff are having to work alone, making violent attacks more likely.” The number of mental health nurses in the NHS has fallen by more than 10% since 2010. Separate findings, uncovered by the BBC radio programme 5 Live Investigates – to be broadcast on Sunday – show that attacks on mental health staff have risen by about a quarter over the past five years. Freedom of information requests to NHS bodies across the UK show that the number of incidents rose from 33,620 in 2012-13 to 42,692 in 2016-17, although the increase was only seen in England. Attacks include a healthcare assistant working in mental healthcare being stabbed to death and another worker having part of their thumb bitten off. Mental health patients assaulted other patients more than 17,000 times last year, the figures also reveal. Unison’s findings, based on responses last month, paint a picture of an overstretched workforce struggling to deliver high-quality care to vulnerable patients under increasingly difficult circumstances. Two-thirds (68%) of mental health staff feel that more and more people with mental health conditions end up having a crisis before they receive help because there are too few staff, beds and services outside of hospitals and long waiting lists for care. Cuts to mental health budgets have shrunk the amount of care that is available and patients are not as well monitored as before, staff say. That has led to “patients in inappropriate settings for their needs due to bed shortages”, a “lack of services to offer patients” and “a lack of resources and increased workloads leading to less oversight of clients”. Six in 10 staff said they were unable to provide proper care because they did not have enough time. Three-quarters feel stressed at least once a week because and 36% say they feel stressed every day. One in five (22%) had taken sick leave over the past year as a result of stress and burnout. Many regularly work unpaid overtime. Half of staff believe their own mental wellbeing is not looked after by their employer. Unison’s report, called Struggling to Cope, notes: “Given the recruitment and retention problems within mental health and the wider NHS, this is something that must be addressed urgently if the health service is to hold on to knowledgeable, well-trained staff, and encourage new recruits.” Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “These are truly shocking findings. We are aware that services are under huge pressure and that patients are not getting the help they need quickly enough. It is essential that we expand the workforce with properly trained staff so that care can be provided that is safe for everyone.” The Department of Health said: “It’s completely unacceptable for NHS staff to face violence or aggression at work. All incidents should be reported and we expect the NHS to work with the police to seek the strongest possible action.” Ministers recently pledged to boost the NHS mental health workforce in England by 21,000 by 2021 to help cope with rising demand and ensure patients are looked after properly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/07/theresa-may-political-courage-observer-view","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T20:31:31Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Theresa May and the need for political courage | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/theresa-may-political-courage-observer-view","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/theresa-may-political-courage-observer-view","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Theresa May and the need for political courage","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A cloud of political paralysis has enveloped Theresa May’s government since her majority was eroded in June’s general election. She has found herself a hostage to the warring factions within her party, with all the formal power that comes with being prime minister, but none of the authority required to use it. Her disastrous speech to the Conservative conference in Manchester last week risks deepening this toxic inertia. To the delegates, the personal tragedy will have been most immediately apparent. It was extraordinarily bad luck to be accosted by a protester and stymied by a nasty cough, all against the background of a set that literally fell apart in front of the nation’s eyes. In this modern age of leadership, it not only serves as a metaphor for her shrinking authority, it eats away at it further. But beyond the personal tragedy there lurks a national tragedy. Britain has perhaps never been more in need of an authoritative prime minister willing to provide brave leadership and take tough decisions. We face a set of pressing economic and social challenges, none of which can be resolved by a government in suspended motion, racked by internal divisions. The most pressing of these is Brexit. The clock is ticking; Britain must agree a transition deal to avoid falling off an economically disastrous cliff edge in March 2019. Yet so far, May has steered a course designed not to secure Britain the best outcome, but to hold her split party together. While she adopted more conciliatory language in her Florence speech, she continued with the illusion that Britain need not make tough choices. It has become increasingly clear this weekend that the EU is willing to play hard ball; Germany, backed by others, looks set to insist on Britain providing more clarity on how it will honour its financial commitments before it is even willing to agree a transition deal on the terms suggested by May. Yet European leaders reading reports from Manchester will understand the reality that, as it stands, May does not seem able to garner the authority she needs to make an offer sufficiently generous to unblock the talks. Beyond Brexit, there are other profound challenges. New data published last week shows Britain’s productivity fell in the last year, meaning output per worker is no higher now than it was before the financial crisis, an unprecedented stagnation. This bodes terribly for wage growth and Britain’s global competitiveness and will expose a huge gap in the public finances, putting pressure on the chancellor before his autumn budget. Yet there are no answers on offer in response to the core problem: businesses relying too heavily on low-skilled, low-paid labour and failing to invest in productivity-boosting technology. The stark intergenerational divide is another dimension of Britain’s poor economic health. Young people struggling to get on the housing ladder have found their wages most affected by the financial crisis, while affluent baby boomers have enjoyed huge windfall gains from spiralling house prices and final salary pension schemes the younger generation could only dream of. In the NHS, a winter crisis looms large as a result of underfunding and the scaling back of the social care system. Warnings have emanated from across the political spectrum about the imminent disaster that will unfold if universal credit is rolled out as planned, but to no avail. All of this requires a prime minister willing to take brave decisions that will inevitably create winners and losers, not just in her party but in the country. She may never now lead her party into the next general election or be able to claim she won a majority, but she is not completely without agency. She still has the authority to set the tone for what follows her, if only she has the courage to seize it. She must listen to the counsel from those urging her to refresh her government by promoting the newer generation of MPs in her party, easing out those tarnished by decades of civil war over Europe. It would be good for the country, giving her the space she needs to set the right tone on Brexit, by putting a realistic offer to Europe to progress trade talks. It might earn her the right to use the forthcoming budget to do more on housing, to address the NHS funding gap and halt further tax cuts in order to boost the generosity of universal credit. But it could also be good for her party: the Conservatives face long-term decline unless they can reverse their fortunes with younger voters. This will not happen without new faces and ideas. Fifteen months into her premiership, it is clear political bravery is not in the prime minister’s DNA. She is far more comfortable following the risk-averse path. But if there were ever a time to take a political gamble, it is now. Unless she can inject some authority into her leadership, her party’s generations-long internecine conflict over Europe will keep Britain suspended in this damaging political stasis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/08/superbugs-antibiotics-tuberculosis-health","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Act now to tame the superbugs that are killing 700,000 a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/08/superbugs-antibiotics-tuberculosis-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/08/superbugs-antibiotics-tuberculosis-health","fields":{"headline":"Act now to tame the superbugs that are killing 700,000 a year","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The UN general assembly recognised drug-resistant infections last year as one of the greatest threats facing humanity. And in May, G20 leaders called for national action plans by the end of 2018 – plans set in train by the World Health Organisation in 2015. But we have already lost momentum. Commitments are the first step, but nothing will be achieved if we don’t translate them into action. Analysis by Wellcome and the UN Foundation shows, encouragingly, that 151 of 195 countries are developing a plan. However, only half address the threat across human and animal health and the environment, and only one in five commit to reducing antibiotic use, improving hygiene and preserving antibiotics of last resort. Most tellingly, only 5% are adequately funded and monitored by the governments responsible for them. And we still suffer from too few new antibiotics in development. CARB-X is a new partnership supporting 18 new potential treatments, but progress is still slow. If we want our grandchildren to benefit from antibiotics, as we have, we need more investment. Meanwhile, the superbugs are progressing rapidly. Since the UN declaration, they have killed about 700,000 people worldwide. In Nevada in 2016, a 70-year-old woman died after breaking her leg, which later became infected with a superbug resistant to 26 antibiotics. In South Africa, multidrug-resistant TB is spreading. In the UK, untreatable strains of gonorrhoea are on the rise. Politicians and scientists have an urgent role to play but they cannot solve the problem alone. Tackling drug-resistant infection is everyone’s business. The threat transcends that of HIV, TB and cancer. To achieve real progress, those already suffering from untreatable infections need a voice. So far they have been too quiet. That is why Wellcome, with the UN Foundation, UK, Thai and Ghanaian governments, is hosting a global call to action in Berlin this week. We have to make our response to this global threat move faster and with more focus. As we do so, we must also put our energy into the other great challenge with regard to antibiotics: access. Around 385,000 babies will be born today across the globe. Almost half (45%) of the 5.9 million global deaths of children under five each year are babies younger than 28 days old. Those first weeks of life are incredibly fragile, and infants born into the world’s poorest communities are at greatest risk – although advances in global health have led, in the 25 years to 2015, to death rates in neonates dropping from 5.1 million to 2.7 million a year. Antibiotics could save so many more. Globally, one in 10 newborns dies from pneumonia or sepsis, deaths preventable with better access to existing antibiotics and better control of the spread of drug-resistant infections. In recent years, warnings of antibiotic resistance, improper and overuse of antibiotics and the dire need for new treatments have become familiar. But what has often been missing from this rhetoric is a focus on improving access to antibiotics to all who need them. This complex mixture of better prescribing twinned with better access is complicated and requires nations to act in a way which fits their needs. To stop superbugs undermining modern medicine, to prevent lives being lost through lack of access to effective medicines, we must work together. We cannot afford to delay. Ed Whiting is director of policy and chief of staff at the Wellcome Trust This article was amended on 12 October 2017 to remove a confusion over neonatal mortality. It originally said that globally, almost half of newborns would die before they reached 28 days. This was incorrect. To clarify: each year, almost half (45%) of the 5.9 million global deaths of children under five are babies younger than 28 days old."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/07/imperial-war-museum-holocaust-memorial-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T20:30:31Z","webTitle":"Imperial War Museum in clash over planned Holocaust memorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/07/imperial-war-museum-holocaust-memorial-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/07/imperial-war-museum-holocaust-memorial-london","fields":{"headline":"Imperial War Museum in clash over planned Holocaust memorial","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Plans to erect a national Holocaust memorial next to parliament have become embroiled in controversy, only weeks before the winning design is due to be announced. The £50m memorial and education centre, initiated in 2013 by David Cameron when he was prime minister, has attracted some of the biggest names in art and architecture, including Norman Foster, Daniel Libeskind, Anish Kapoor and Rachel Whiteread. A jury to select the winning entry has met and an announcement from the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation is expected this month. But in an extraordinary intervention, the Imperial War Museum (IWM) is calling for the plan for an educational complex below the memorial to be reconsidered because it will compete with its own new Holocaust centre, opening in 2020, less than a mile away. Meanwhile, people who live near the memorial’s site – Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the houses of parliament and on the banks of the Thames – are stepping up objections to the proposal. They say it would mean the loss of much-valued green space, increase pollution and traffic, and require a heavy security presence. IWM, which has been the national museum for the Holocaust since 2000, has welcomed the memorial, but has raised concerns about the inclusion of an education centre. It says it is likely to replicate its own advanced plans for a £33.5m “digitally enabled learning and events suite”, and the public should be offered one facility, rather than competing educational resources.Last month Prince William visited the museum to discuss its plans for new galleries and meet Holocaust survivors in his role as president of the War Museum Foundation. According to IWM, more than 600,000 people visit its Holocaust exhibition each year, including 25,000 schoolchildren and teachers. Its new and expanded galleries will include new survivor testimonies, objects and original material and will present the Holocaust narrative within the wider context of the second world war. Diane Lees, the museum’s director-general, said: “Our ground-breaking new galleries and digitally enabled learning suite will allow us to transform the way we present the second world war and the Holocaust and, through our new narrative, enable visitors to engage with events that may be less well understood and known to them.” She added: “We urge the reconsideration of the creation of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation’s learning centre at Victoria Tower Gardens, [which is] less than a mile away from us, as it will very much divide the public offer on learning about the Holocaust.” Sir Trevor Pears of the Pears Foundation, which supports Holocaust education in the UK, also welcomed the memorial plan. “It is bold in its vision, and addresses some real concerns expressed by survivors, educators and heritage professionals,” he said. But, he added, the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation “must not miss the opportunity to work in partnership with existing provision ... if it is to succeed in its mission”. Duplication of effort and resources should be avoided. The memorial foundation said its centre would be complementary to the war museum’s offering. Sir Peter Bazalgette, chair of the memorial foundation, said: “Standing in the shadow of our parliament, the new Holocaust memorial and learning centre will become an internationally recognised symbol against hatred. Its learning centre will use the stories of the Holocaust to explore antisemitism, extremism, Islamophobia, homophobia and other forms of hatred and prejudice in society today.” He added: “As IWM has previously agreed, the learning centre and the war museum galleries have different remits, with distinct yet complementary objectives. We see no reason why the two cannot continue to work together.” His view that the two educational centres were complementary was echoed by Sajid Javid, the communities and local government secretary. However, local residents have also raised concerns about the new centre. Barbara Weiss, an architect whose company is based near the gardens, said the proposal was “completely contrary” to London’s ambition to protect its green spaces. “The designs are deceptive. They show a very idealistic and abstract view that doesn’t correspond to reality,” she said. Emergency staircases, service access and signage were absent from the drawings and models.The memorial’s backers “seem determined not to listen” to the local objections, she added. “There is a worry this will become a ‘Disneyworld’ Holocaust event, in a superficial, bling way. It seems it has to have a ‘wow’ factor, it has to be a ‘new attraction’. As someone who is half-Jewish and married to a Jew, I find that distasteful.” Another local campaigner, Lucy Peck, said Victoria Tower Gardens was heavily used by residents and office workers, “who sit peacefully and watch activity on the river. It’s a surprisingly tranquil little London park that we don’t want to lose. And people might not feel comfortable taking their sandwiches into the park and sitting on top of a Holocaust memorial.” People were concerned that security, already heavy around parliament, may need to be stepped up to protect a vulnerable site. “If locals were to be searched every time they enter the park, it would become unusable,” said Peck. The memorial fund said its plan would be developed in consultation with the local community, and the park would remain accessible to the public. “The competition design brief was clear that the memorial should be visible and prominent but preserve as much as possible of the park’s open space,” said a spokesperson. A full planning application would allow the views of local residents and other interested parties to be considered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/12/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T09:00:36Z","webTitle":"Wild World Cup qualifiers, the Heineken Cup's humble start and Las Vegas heroes | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/12/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/12/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips","fields":{"headline":"Wild World Cup qualifiers, the Heineken Cup's humble start and Las Vegas heroes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) The climax of the World Cup qualifiers were as good as they have been in around two decades.

People dressed in white gathered in both cities on Saturday under the slogan “Shall we talk?” in a message to Spain’s political leaders. Organisers of the rallies had asked people to not bring any flags, neither Spanish nor Catalan, and to wear white clothing. Miquel Iceta, the leader of the Catalan arm of the Spanish Socialist party, said: “We have to find a new way forward. It’s the moment to listen to the people who are asking for the problem to be solved through an agreement, and without precipitated and unilateral decisions.” In Madrid they gathered in a plaza outside the city hall and called for dialogue to end the crisis. Yurena Diaz, a 36-year-old doctor, said she was demonstrating “so that there would be dialogue before we lose ourselves, so they they try and sit down and talk”. She said: “There is a lot more tension and violence. Each time it gets worse. Such violence makes you afraid. It has generated a lot of fear and that’s dangerous.” A rival rally was also held nearby in Madrid’s central Plaza de Colón, where thousands waving Spanish flags joined a “patriotic” march organised by activists to defend the unity of Spain and protest against Catalan independence. Joaquin Penas, an off-duty soldier with a Spanish flag draped round his shoulders, said the crisis had “reached a turning point and we need to get actively involved in the defence of Spain’s values as a nation”. If Catalonia were to declare independence “it would be like cutting off an arm”, he added, saying there was a lot of concern about the government’s perceived lack of action to resolve the crisis. “I don’t have much confidence in the government. It is not a very proactive government … [Mariano] Rajoy is anything but a leader. To be honest, he’s awful.” About 5,000 people dressed in white filled Sant Jaume Square in front of Barcelona city hall, municipal police said. Some waved white handkerchiefs, but there were no flags. Ruben Vidal, a 41-year-old DJ, said: “You can’t expect Catalonia to remain in Spain just based on fear.” He added that politicians should “talk or resign”. Tentative signs have emerged that both sides may be trying to defuse the crisis after Madrid apologised on Friday to Catalans injured by police trying to stop people voting in the outlawed independence referendum last Sunday. However, Catalan leaders have not backed down from plans to declare independence, possibly next week, after the result of the referendum in which 90% backed independence on a 43% turnout. Many who support Spanish unity did not vote in the poll. “There has to be a commitment to dialogue,” said Jordi Cuixart, the president of one of the grassroots groups driving Catalonia’s separatist movement. “We will continue to demand a commitment that the referendum law be fulfiled.” Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, has vowed to block independence and rejected calls for mediation. The Catalan government minister Santi Vila, a close ally of the regional president, Carles Puigdemont, said his side might consider a “ceasefire” in the dispute. Puigdemont had been due to appear at the regional parliament on Monday but has postponed it by a day, in an apparent attempt to gain time and ease tensions. Spain’s constitutional court has ordered the suspension of the Monday session. If Catalonia does declare independence, Spain could suspend the region’s existing autonomous status and impose direct rule from Madrid. Businesses and the government have kept up economic pressure on Catalonia, with several big companies, including the banks Sabadell and Caixa, announcing plans to shift their headquarters to other parts of Spain. Madrid passed a measure on Friday making it easier for businesses to move their legal bases from one region to another."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/08/harvey-weinstein-fall-of-hollywood-player-once-called-god","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:04:34Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein: fall of Hollywood player they once called ‘God’ | Observer profile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/08/harvey-weinstein-fall-of-hollywood-player-once-called-god","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/08/harvey-weinstein-fall-of-hollywood-player-once-called-god","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein: fall of Hollywood player they once called ‘God’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On the day before news officially broke of alleged sexual harassment stretching back decades, Harvey Weinstein, the 65-year-old movie mogul, offered this comment: “The story sounds so good I want to buy the movie rights.” In its blend of the glib, the acquisitive and plain braggadocio, it seemed an incredible response to a potentially career-ending exposé. Yet those familiar with the man Meryl Streep called “God” at the 2012 Golden Globes, know that he’s defined by an attitude of infallibility. In 2000, having allegedly assaulted a young reporter at a crowded party, Weinstein is said to have screamed: “It’s good I’m the fucking sheriff of this fucking lawless piece-of-shit town.” (Though several photographers were present, no images surfaced.) With more than 300 Oscar nominations to his name, he is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood,– a formidable, even unrivalled mix of art, celebrity, politics, money and power. The New York Times story, the result of a far-reaching investigation by two female reporters, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, includes allegations of sexual harrassment and unwanted physical contact and reveals eight previously undisclosed settlements. A statement from Weinstein’s lawyer called the New York Times story “saturated with false and defamatory statements” and Weinstein is suing the paper. Among the women who spoke on the record to the New York Times is actress Ashley Judd, who commented: “I said no a lot of ways, a lot of times. Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.” The implication that Weinstein’s misconduct was known in Hollywood and beyond has been widely echoed. In 2015, journalist Jennifer Senior denounced what she called “a despicable open secret”. Last week, Claudia Eller, co-editor in chief of Variety magazine, tweeted her congratulations to the New York Times, calling this “the story we’ve all been trying to get for decades”, while writer Rebecca Traister published a piece beginning: “I have been having conversations about Harvey Weinstein’s history of sexual harassment for more than 17 years.” The lack of surprise greeting the story is not, however, entirely attributable to Weinstein himself, but to the culture in which the word of a young woman tends not to be believed over the word of an older, much more powerful man. Within Hollywood, the casting couch remains a place of dubious transaction. In 2010, a website called Pajiba ran a post titled “Harvey’s Girls”, those starlets whose “instant fame […] comes seemingly out of nowhere and without any justification in terms of resumé or skill set”. But the climate may be changing. Traister, writing in New York magazine, noted that “recent years have seen scores of women, finding strength and some kind of power in numbers, come forward and tell their stories about Bill Cosby, Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, Donald Trump. In all of those cases, as in this case, the history of allegations has been an almost wholly open secret, sometimes even having been reported in major outlets, and yet somehow ignored, allowed to pass, unconsidered. But now our consciousness has been raised.” Unlike the men mentioned above, Weinstein has long presented himself as a supporter of women within liberal Hollywood. He was a major donor to both Obama and Clinton and last year hosted a fundraiser for the latter at his home. Recently, he was instrumental in endowing a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. The phenomenon of a predatory, powerful man evading censure for years is clearly not a partisan issue. Weinstein’s statement to the New York Times included a defensive apology of sorts: “I came of age in the 60s and 70s, when all the rules about behaviour and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.” America’s Civil Rights Act, which under Title VII defines sexual harassment as a criminal act, was passed in 1964. “Culture” and “law”, then, are not always coterminous; perhaps unwittingly, Weinstein demonstrated that what is legally outlawed can remain socially acceptable. He added: “I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office – or out of it. To anyone.” The actress Rose McGowan is among the eight women with whom Weinstein reportedly reached confidential settlements and on Thursday, McGowan tweeted: “Women fight on. And to the men out there, stand up. We need you as allies.” (In her case, the $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” but “to avoid litigation and buy peace”. ) McGovan’s sentiments echo a tweet from earlier this year. In linking to a news story about Bill O’Reilly’s firing due to sexual harassment claims, civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom wrote: “When women speak our truth the old order shatters. We slayed the dragon. Never forget this is what we’re capable of.” Bloom, who has represented women accusing Bill O’Reilly of sexual misconduct, is now working with the accused: she called Weinstein, her client, “an old dinosaur learning new ways”. Bloom’s mother is Gloria Allred, the attorney famous for representing many of Cosby’s accusers. Bloom told the New York Post in July: “It was just second nature to me that, of course; you have to fight for the underdog”. That term could in no way be applied to Weinstein, whose power is such that journalists have struggled to persuade his associates to speak on the record. Rebecca Traister wrote last week that “Harvey could spin – or suppress – anything; there were so many journalists on his payroll… ” Notably, Bloom’s statement, as with her client’s, included mention of a future project: “And as we work together on a project bringing my book to the screen… ” This is Suspicion Nation, a planned miniseries that Weinstein is financing. How did Weinstein, born into an unremarkable family in Queens, reach this stature? He amassed power through his knack for seizing cheap arthouse films and engineering them into the commercially viable mainstream, a formula that not only gave us a pantheon of cultural touchstones – Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting, Gangs of New York – but also helped independent cinema itself become a going concern. His career began in 1979 when Weinstein set up a distribution company with his younger brother, Bob. The two of them conducted operations from a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan and it took almost a decade for them to strike a hit. That was Sex, Lies, and Videotape, the 1989 independent drama that also made Steven Soderbergh’s name. Soon, Miramax, named for their parents Miriam and Max, became a key player in the industry and by 2005, Weinstein left to form the Weinstein Company. Yet his extraordinary cultural force, one recognised in accolades including an honorary CBE from the Queen and the Légion d’honneur from the French consulate, has arguably waned. His last Oscar winning film was The Artist in 2011. His most recent movie, Tulip Fever, has been deemed a critical disaster. James Ivory once said: “He is a bully who feels that if he screams and yells and punishes you enough, he is going to get his way […] He’s both a genius and an asshole and unfortunately those things seem to go together.” We are now familiar with the way in which unrepentant bad behaviour can register as “colourful” rather than reprehensible. Trump, who was exposed as having bragged about sexually assaulting women, nevertheless won the election. Weinstein’s physical and verbal aggression has been well documented yet has tended to be met with indifference. He has frequently been described as “larger than life” and has blamed a glucose imbalance for his tirades. Weinstein’s statement last week included this sentence: “I want a second chance in the community but I know I’ve got work to do to earn it.” Those who take Cosby and co as bellwethers might be reminded of a line from F Scott Fitzgerald: “There are no second acts in American lives.” Then again, others may look to the president, he of the line “grab them by the pussy”, as an indicator of Weinstein’s professional durability. THE WEINSTEIN FILE Born On 19 March 1952, in Queens, New York, the son of Miriam and Max Weinstein, a diamond cutter. Best of times 1999 brings Weinstein Oscars success with best picture for Shakespeare in Love, starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes. Worst of times On 5 October 2017, the New York Times publishes a story detailing a series of allegations of sexual harassment. What he says “You’ll get 15 people to say I’m a genius and 15 people to say I’m an asshole.” What others say “…his eyes also spot zeitgeist long before it comes over the hill. Which is why a city full of incandescent fabulousness pivots around a man who looks like nothing so much as a bean-bag chair with legs.” Journalist David Carr in a profile in New York magazine"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/07/new-york-terrorist-plots-thwarted-by-undercover-fbi-agent","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T11:12:21Z","webTitle":"New York terrorist plots thwarted by undercover FBI agent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/new-york-terrorist-plots-thwarted-by-undercover-fbi-agent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/07/new-york-terrorist-plots-thwarted-by-undercover-fbi-agent","fields":{"headline":"New York terrorist plots thwarted by undercover FBI agent","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Plots by three alleged Islamic State supporters to carry out terrorist attacks around New York City, including at concert venues, subway stations and Times Square, were foiled in the summer of 2016, a US court has heard. Terrorism charges against the three men accused of plotting the attacks were unsealed by a federal court in the city on Friday. The plots were thwarted by an undercover FBI agent who was posing as an Islamist extremist and communicating with the trio via a messenger app. One of the defendants, Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, was arrested after travelling from Canada to New Jersey in May 2016 to carry out the attacks, authorities said. According to criminal complaints, Bahnasawy, 19, told the undercover agent that “[t]hese Americans need an attack”, and he wanted to “create the next 9/11”. He sent the agent an image of Times Square and said: “We seriously need to car bomb times square. Look at these crowds of people!” In another message, he said he wanted to “shoot up concerts cuz they kill a lot people … We just walk in with guns in our hands. That’s how Paris guys did it,” the papers said in an apparent reference to the 2015 attack on the Bataclan concert hall in the French capital that killed 89 people. Bahnasawy pleaded guilty in October 2016, but the case was sealed while the investigation continued. His attorney, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment on Friday. The other men are Talha Haroon, who was arrested in Pakistan, and Russell Salic, who was arrested in the Philippines, where he is a citizen. Both are awaiting extradition to the US. Haroon, who was introduced to the agent by Bahnasawy, was planning to travel to the US to allegedly help him with the attacks. In messages, he told the agent that the subway was a perfect target; that they should shoot as many passengers on the train as possible, including women and children; and that “when we run out of bullets we let the vests go off”. Salic, who is a doctor and is accused of sending money to help fund the planned attacks, was also arrested in the Philippines for his alleged involvement in kidnappings and beheadings blamed on pro-Isis militants, a Philippine official said. The chief state counsel, Ricardo Paras, told the Associated Press that a Manila court was considering an extradition request from the US government. Even if the court approves the request, the Department of Justice in Manila needs to decide whether Salic will face charges in the Philippines first or be allowed to be flown to the US to answer the terrorism financing allegations there, Paras said. “The US can also request for a temporary surrender of Salic to its custody, but it’s in our options to require him to face criminal complaints here first,” Paras said. A US Department of Justice statement said: “Communicating through internet messaging applications, these three men allegedly plotted to conduct bombings and shootings in heavily populated areas of New York City during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in 2016, all in the name of Isis.” The men face possible terms of life in prison on charges including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/08/nearly-70-of-australians-oppose-government-loan-for-adani-mine-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T22:18:51Z","webTitle":"Nearly 70% of Australians oppose government loan for Adani mine – poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/08/nearly-70-of-australians-oppose-government-loan-for-adani-mine-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/08/nearly-70-of-australians-oppose-government-loan-for-adani-mine-poll","fields":{"headline":"Nearly 70% of Australians oppose government loan for Adani mine – poll","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Polling released on Sunday shows Australians are mostly opposed to Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, and even more strongly opposed to it getting any government assistance. The ReachTel poll, commissioned by The Australia Institute, also shows Australians think a loan to Adani from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility would damage the country’s reputation – a fact that if “likely” to be true, would make the loan unlawful. Asked simply whether they support or oppose the construction of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, about 50% more respondents were opposed to it than supported it. Of the 1,421 respondents 30% said they supported the mine, while 44% opposed it. However, 26% of respondents to the survey conducted in late September said they weren’t sure. Just 16% said they supported a taxpayer loan to assist construction of the mine, with 68% opposing it. On Saturday, the Guardian reported on a larger poll conducted more recently, showing 55.6% opposed to the mine. In the poll released today on Sunday, a clear majority of people – 58% – said they thought such a loan would damage the government’s reputation. Naif’s investment mandate says it “has a responsibility to act in a way that is not likely to cause damage to the Australian government’s reputation”. Other agencies, such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, operate under almost identical conditions. In July, Oliver Yates, who was the chief executive of the CEFC since its inception in 2012 until May this year, told the Guardian that the Naif loan should never have progressed past the initial inspection by the Naif board, since it did not pass the reputation test. If the loan is likely to cause reputationdamage, it would be unlawful. Just over half the respondents from Sunday’s poll said they would support a new rule that prevented Naif, or other similar agencies, supporting mining projects in Australia – while only 24% opposed such a rule. However, contrary to the apparent wishes of the public, and in the face of private banks increasingly being unwilling to back coalmines, the Turnbull government last month overturned a rule that had been in place for several years stopping another government agency – the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation – from loaning money to mining operations. “This polling shows not just that taxpayer subsidies for Adani are deeply unpopular, but that more Australians oppose than support the mine going ahead, regardless of subsidies,” said the deputy director of the Australia Institute, Ebony Bennett. “The strong support or opposition, a better indicator of an issue being a vote-changer, shows just 8% strongly support while 23% strongly oppose the mine,” she said. “Politicians – both state and federal – have spent a lot of time and political capital promoting Adani and the mine, but the campaign has backfired, with opposition strengthening. “Previous Australia Institute polling in shows opposition to subsidies has grown to 68%, up from 64% in May 2017.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/06/fbi-black-identity-extremists-racial-profiling","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T11:59:08Z","webTitle":"FBI terrorism unit says 'black identity extremists' pose a violent threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/06/fbi-black-identity-extremists-racial-profiling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/06/fbi-black-identity-extremists-racial-profiling","fields":{"headline":"FBI terrorism unit says 'black identity extremists' pose a violent threat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US government has declared “black identity extremists” a violent threat, according to a leaked report from the FBI’s counter-terrorism division. The assessment, obtained by Foreign Policy, has raised fears about federal authorities racially profiling activists and aggressively prosecuting civil rights protesters. The report, dated August 2017 and compiled by the Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit, said: “The FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence.” Incidents of “alleged police abuse” have “continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement”. The FBI’s dedicated surveillance of black activists follows a long history of the US government aggressively monitoring protest movements and working to disrupt civil rights groups, but the scrutiny of African Americans by a domestic terrorism unit was particularly alarming to some free speech campaigners. “When we talk about enemies of the state and terrorists, with that comes an automatic stripping of those people’s rights to speak and protest,” said Mohammad Tajsar, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. “It marginalizes what are legitimate voices within the political debate that are calling for racial and economic justice.” The document has emerged at a time of growing concerns about Donald Trump’s links to the far right and white nationalists, and increasing anxieties about his administration’s efforts to further criminalize communities of color and shield police from scrutiny. Anti-Trump protesters and Black Lives Matter activists have continued to face harsh prosecutions and close federal monitoring. The FBI did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on Friday, but defended its tracking of “black identity extremists” in a statement to Foreign Policy, claiming the “FBI cannot initiate an investigation based solely on an individual’s race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of First Amendment rights”. The FBI’s report noted specific cases of recent violence against police, most notably Micah Johnson, a 25-year-old shooter in Dallas who killed five officers and said he was targeting white people and law enforcement. Black Lives Matter – a movement protesting the disproportionate killings of black citizens by police in the US – had no ties to Johnson or other targeted killings of police and has condemned those shootings. The number of police officers killed on the job also remains a fraction of the number of citizens killed by officers each year, and statistics suggest that more white offenders than black offenders kill officers. The new FBI report said “BIE violence” peaked in the 1960s and 1970s “in response to changing socioeconomic attitudes and treatment of blacks”, adding that possible indicators today for “BIEs posing a violent threat to law enforcement” include “violent anti-white rhetoric” and “attempts to acquire illegal weapons or explosives”. BIE appears to be a very new term within law enforcement, Foreign Policy noted. Elsa Waithe, a comedian and activist with Black Lives Matter, said she feared the FBI’s classification could deter people from joining protests and further “criminalize anyone who is already in the movement”. She noted that she often wears a “black power” button and could easily see the FBI labeling her as a threat as a result: “The term ‘black identity extremist’ is so vague on purpose … If I wanted to do a picnic for black folks, is this now some sort of terrorist activity?” But law enforcement threats would not discourage her, she said. “This changes nothing. For some people, this means we fight harder.” Some reports have suggested that the Trump administration has also pushed to focus counter-terrorism efforts solely on Islamist extremism and no longer target white supremacist groups. The president further faced significant backlash in August for saying there were “very fine people” on both sides of a neo-Nazi rally where a civil rights activist was killed by an alleged white nationalist. The FBI document seemed to be aligned with far-right figures who have increasingly called Black Lives Matter a terrorist group, some comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan, noted Tajsar. DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter activist, likened the “black identity extremist” monitoring to the FBI’s highly controversial domestic counterintelligence program known as Cointelpro, which was used to target political groups and activists like the NAACP, Martin Luther King Jr, socialist and communist groups and anti-war protesters. “We knew that we were likely being watched,” said Mckesson, who has spoken out about being monitored by the US government and FBI. “This is confirmation that the work of social justice continues to threaten those in power.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2017/oct/05/which-is-the-best-desktop-pc-photo-editing-adobe-lightroom","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T14:48:24Z","webTitle":"Which is the best desktop PC for photo editing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/oct/05/which-is-the-best-desktop-pc-photo-editing-adobe-lightroom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2017/oct/05/which-is-the-best-desktop-pc-photo-editing-adobe-lightroom","fields":{"headline":"Which is the best desktop PC for photo editing?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I saw your response to a question about a laptop for a photography student and noted the suggestion that a desktop would be a better option in terms of actual capability, not to mention the ergonomic advantages you’ve mentioned in previous articles. What specification would you recommend for someone with a mid-range DSLR using Adobe Lightroom for RAW files, but only as a hobby? Although I think I probably could build my own PC, I’m not sure I want the additional faff and the risk that some components just won’t talk to each other properly. On my last desktop, built with a friend, I had never-ending problems with the graphics card, which were only fixed once I replaced it. Looking around, I found a PC on Chillblast’s website that seems to tick all the boxes, but I’m concerned it may be over the top for my needs. Paul When I wrote about the best laptop for photo editing a month ago, several readers asked for advice on desktops. As you already know, you want the fastest processor, the most memory, and the fastest hard drives and SSDs that you can afford. The problem is balancing the different requirements. However, buying or building a desktop PC to run Adobe Lightroom is not the same as buying one for general-purpose use. General purpose computing rarely stresses today’s processors. It’s often better to spend your money on more memory, a fast SSD, and a high-quality screen and keyboard. Designing for Lightroom Unfortunately, Lightroom is still mostly dependent on the power of the processor, so it’s best to go for a quad-core Intel Core i7, if possible. There’s currently no great advantage to having more than four cores, though such chips will benchmark faster because they can turbo-boost two cores to higher clock speeds. Memory is the next most important thing: 16GB is OK, but more is better, and pros want 32GB or more. Of course, it depends on what you do, and how quickly you need to do it. You can run Lightroom in 8GB, but you will start to run into problems when combining HDR images and so on. Lightroom also likes fast disk drives, so it helps to have an SSD. RAW files take up a lot of space, but big SSDs are expensive. The compromise is to run the program from an affordable SSD while having a big traditional hard drive to store images. Finally, there’s the graphics card. This is the dark side of Lightroom. The first five versions didn’t use graphics card acceleration. LR6 only uses it in the Develop module, and then only with the right combination of graphics card and driver. Generally it’s best to pick an Nvidia GeForce card for Adobe software (look for Cuda cores), but – with one exception – it’s not worth spending a lot of money on one at the moment. If this changes with LR7 or LR8, you can upgrade the card later. The exception? A fast graphics card is important if you are using Lightroom on a high resolution 4K or 5K monitor showing, perhaps, 3840 × 2160 pixels. If you’re using a 1920 x 1080 screen, it doesn’t really matter. Either way, read Adobe’s GPU troubleshooting and FAQ page. You will note that the most common solution to crashes, freezes and slowdowns is to disable the GPU. Which CPU? It really depends how much you want to spend, bearing in mind that you must have a 64-bit processor and a 64-bit operating system. Today, the quad-core Core i7-7700 is the best value. Intel sells faster chips with more cores, but they are much more expensive. However, the quad-core i5-7600 and i5-7500 are cheaper but not much slower. Either would be fine for hobbyist use, where time isn’t money. AMD’s Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500 also look very competitive, but these are new chips, and Adobe has been optimizing for the Core range. There are Lightroom benchmark results at, for example, Puget Systems and Hardware.fr. These should give you a good idea of the relative speeds. Notebookcheck’s Comparison of Mobile Processors (CPU Benchmarks) is also useful. Hello, Skylake Intel has just launched a new range of Core i9 (Skylake-X) desktop processors, but prices start at $999. However, it has also added 4.3GHz Core i7-7740X ($339) and 4GHz Core i5-7640X ($242) processors. Like the i9 chips, these need a new LGA266 socket on the motherboard and X299 support chips. All the main motherboard manufacturers – Asus, Gigabyte, Micro-Star International (MSI) and ASRock – are shipping new designs, but it may be a while before they appear in mainstream towers. However, Chillblast is offering a new Core i7-7800X in its Fusion video/photo editing PC for £1,699.99. The new motherboards are more expensive and may not be worth the marginal increase in speed. The advantage, as Puget Systems points out, is that you can upgrade to an 8-core i7-7820X in the future. Note that all these chips run hot. The TDP (thermal design power) of the i7-7740X and the i5-7640X is 112W, so they will work best in a big tower case. For comparison, most current laptop chips run at 5W to 17W, and still get throttled when they overheat. Buy or build? The main desktop PC suppliers are Dell, HP and Lenovo. Part of their appeal is that they offer on-site next-day support, which is important for business users. It also means there’s a supply of ex-corporate and refurbished machines at low prices. Sadly, you also won’t get a recent processor or the customisation options that come with buying a new system. As you have found, there are also some smaller British companies that assemble PCs to order, and Chillblast is a great example. See my earlier answer, Should I buy my next desktop PC from a UK company? Finally, you could build your own PC with the assistance of PC Part Picker, though I can’t see a Lightroom-oriented build. Well, Greg7579 has specced a High-End Photo Editing Rig for £3,974.51, though that does include £1,174.94 for a 32in Asus monitor. Possible options Your suggested Chillblast machine looks pretty suitable for Lightroom. It has a Core i7-7700K, 16GB of memory, a GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card, a 250GB Samsung 960 EVO SSD, two 1TB hard drives, Blu-ray and Windows 10 Home for £1,449.99. However, I don’t see the point of having RAID hard drives. It would be better to spend any extra money on more memory. Instead, you could switch to Chillblast’s Prestige 7700i. Configured like your original but with a single 3TB hard drive and a 500W power supply, the price drops to £1,295.45. A Dell XPS 8920 tower with a Core i7-7700, 16GB of memory (expandable to 64GB), 256GB M.2 SSD, 2TB hard drive, GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of memory, DVD, Windows 10 Pro and one year of on-site service comes to £1,342.80. You can have up to four years of on-site service, at extra cost. Extra memory is sold separately, or you could buy from an alternative source, such as Crucial. A similar Lenovo ThinkCentre M710T with 24GB of memory (expandable to 64GB), GeForce GT730 graphics, 1TB hard drive, 256GB M.2 SSD, DVD and card reader would cost £1,254.79, including three years of on-site service. However, the power supply is only 210W. You could save £177.60 by dropping the M710T to a Core i5-7500 and £93.60 by dropping the memory to 16GB, bringing the total price to less than £1,000. You could also forgo the M.2 storage card (£141.60) and install a 240GB SSD with a SATA drive interface for around £80. Remember that, with a desktop, you can always give it a speed bump after a couple of years by adding memory, a new hard drive and a faster graphics card. This also spreads the cost.

Officers from the Argentinian national gendarmarie attacked the encampment on 1 August, in an attempt dislodge a group of activists who had occupied part of an enormous swath of land owned by the clothing empire Benetton, but also claimed by the region’s Mapuche people. Witnesses saw Maldonado flee to the side of the frozen Chubut river – then turn back and surrender to the baton-wielding officers. Since that day, more than two months ago, the 28-year-old backpacker has not been seen or heard of. His disappearance has dominated nightly TV news, prompted a string of angry street protests – and revived bitter memories of Argentina’s 1976-83 military dictatorship, when 30,000 people were forcibly disappeared after being seized by security forces. But it has also sparked a political firestorm before midterm elections on 22 October. Photos of Maldonado’s bearded, handsome face have been reproduced endlessly on social media above the simple question: “Where is Santiago Maldonado?” At a huge demonstration in Buenos Aires on Sunday, Maldonado’s brother Germán addressed the crowd flanked by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo – the human rights campaigners who braved the dictatorship in their battle for justice. “What is happening with human rights in this society is shameful,” he said. “We are stepping backwards in time.” The disappearance has put pressure on the centre-right government of President Mauricio Macri, which has repeatedly tried to downplay the crimes of Argentina’s dictatorship. The case has been adopted as a rallying cry by Macri’s main political opponent, the former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is competing for a senate seat in the October vote – and who is widely thought to be eyeing a return to the presidency in 2019. But Maldonado, a fine arts graduate and tattoo artist, was not a political figure, a third brother, Sergio, told the Guardian. “My brother’s not an activist, he’s a nomad, he writes poetry,” he said. Santiago spent the last seven years crisscrossing Argentina with little but a backpack, and arrived at the remote Mapuche camp at the end of July. The landscape around Pu Lof is a heart-stopping, barren wilderness where the endless plains of the Patagonian steppe are framed by the majestic Andes mountains. But the area has become the setting for a long-running dispute between Benetton, the Italian clothing retailer, which owns 2.2m acres of land, and the Mapuche indigenous people, who claim a small part of the territory as their own. Argentinian security forces have repeatedly faced accusations of excessive force during clashes with the protesters, who have staged land invasions and blocked roads. When gendarmes in riot gear attacked the Pu Lof protest camp on 1 August, the indigenous activists dived into the Chubut river to escape the officers, but Maldonado hesitated at the edge of its cold waters. “My brother can’t swim so he probably thought, ‘I’m white, I haven’t done anything,’ and gave himself up,” said Sergio. According to Mapuche witnesses, Maldonado was heard telling the officers: “Please stop hitting me, I already surrendered.” Since then, there has been no trace of him. Rather than investigate the officers involved, Argentina’s security minister, Patricia Bullrich, at first tried to cast suspicion on the protesters, suggesting in congress that Maldonado had been knifed by a Mapuche activist. In turn, Fernández has repeatedly criticised the government for its handling of the case, accusing the government and sympathetic media of a cover-up. Officials have said that the case is being investigated as a forced disappearance, but human rights activists are scathing in their assessment of the official response. “The government did everything wrong,” said Mariela Belski, the head of Amnesty International in Argentina. “The gendarmes should never have been allowed to investigate the scene.” José Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement that the Argentinian government should prioritize the investigation. “When someone goes missing, no matter under which circumstances, time is of the essence. This is all the more important when the person may have been forcibly disappeared by security forces,” he wrote. But the case has also been seized on by Argentina’s far right, who have drawn a parallel between the current struggle for the rights of indigenous people and the activities of the leftwing guerrilla groups that were crushed during the dictatorship. Alfredo Astiz, a formal naval officer who is already serving a life sentence for crimes including the murder of two French nuns, shocked the country with a statement in court this week in which he described the Mapuche protesters as a “secessionist movement” seeking to carve up the country. “The war against terrorism can’t be won. It is a war without time,” said Astiz, who is currently being tried on a string of charges related to other crimes committed at the notorious Esma naval unit, where about 5,000 dissidents were held and tortured. Meanwhile, the Maldonado family has not received any phone call or public expression of concern from Macri or any other high-ranking government official, while the judicial investigation into his case has not produced any discernible leads. “The mistreatment of the family by the government is astonishing,” said Belski, of Amnesty Argentina. “That doesn’t mean that the family hasn’t been used politically, but that is ultimately irrelevant. What we have here is a missing person who must be found.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/09/auto-enrolment-pension-for-nanny-carer","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Auto-enrolment means you must now set up a pension for your nanny or carer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/09/auto-enrolment-pension-for-nanny-carer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/09/auto-enrolment-pension-for-nanny-carer","fields":{"headline":"Auto-enrolment means you must now set up a pension for your nanny or carer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was five years ago this month that the government kicked off a huge shakeup of retirement saving to get millions more people paying into a pension. So far, “automatic enrolment” is looking like a big success – but the phasing-in period is now officially over, with new rules taking effect last weekend that will impact people who set up a new business, take on a nanny or pay for a carer. Auto-enrolment went live on 1 October 2012 and requires all employers to automatically enrol eligible workers into a workplace pension where both the worker and their employer pay some money in. To date, more than 8.5 million people have been enrolled, many of whom will never have saved in a pension before. Workers can “opt out”, ie, say no to being put into the pension scheme. But they can’t do so until after they have been enrolled. Big companies such as supermarkets were the first to sign up to the regime, but more recently the focus has switched to the millions of small and “micro” employers. As the Pensions Regulator puts it: “If you employ just one person, then you are an employer and have ‘duties’ under pensions law.” Of course, many of the smallest employers don’t think of themselves as such – they are individuals who just happen to have someone who works for them. That includes families who employ a nanny and people who employ a personal care assistant to help them with their day-to-day needs (if you pay for a personal care assistant using your own money, or money provided by your local authority or the NHS, you are judged to be an employer). Under the rules, many of these “employers” will have to set up a pension plan for their nanny/carer, and pay into it. Employers must automatically enrol any employee who, on the date the law applies to them, is at least 22 years old but below state pension age; earns more than a minimum amount (currently £10,000 a year, the same as £833 a month or £192 a week); and is not in a workplace pension scheme. Some nannies and personal care assistants won’t meet these criteria because they don’t earn enough. Up until now, employers have typically been given advance notice of the date when their auto-enrolment duties come into effect. This was known as their “staging date” and gave people time to get their ducks in a row. Previously, many employers received an official letter 12 months before their staging date. But on 1 October, so-called “instant pension duties” took effect, and no more staging dates are being issued. Instead, anyone who starts up a new business or takes on a nanny/carer etc will have a legal duty to put an eligible employee straight into a workplace pension as soon as they employ him or her. In other words, they will have to provide a “staff pension plan” right from the start. This will be a daunting prospect for many. However, the Pensions Regulator has launched an online set of information and tools for those employing staff for the first time. There are a number of payroll companies out there offering to help people comply with their pension duties and deal with the admin, in return for a fee. Nannytax is one such firm – it describes itself as the UK’s leading nanny payroll provider. A spokeswoman for the company says its employer clients have reacted in different ways to being brought into the new pensions regime. While some see this as another cost they have to shell out for, others view it as “a really good thing” that their nanny is being encouraged to save for their retirement in this way. One thing that’s not clear is what impact next year’s increase to pension contributions (see below) will have. Elliott Silk at investment company Sanlam UK says: “The rise from 2% to 5% coming into force in April 2018 will be a steep one felt by workers all across the country – the government, employers and wider industry need to prepare those who are likely to be affected by the increase, otherwise many people will be in for a big shock when they check their pay packet in April. We are encouraging employers to get the message out there early and provide financial education to their staff, highlighting the importance of saving and thinking beyond the minimum.” What exactly will it cost you? So, if you employ a nanny or personal care assistant, how much might you – and they – have to pay into their pension? The answer is potentially quite a lot. By 2019-20 it could be £500-£600 a year each. Under automatic enrolment, the total minimum amount paid in is currently 2% of qualifying earnings – typically made up of 0.8% from the worker, 1% from their employer and 0.2% in tax relief from the government. However, in April next year this will rise to 5% (typically 2.4% from the worker, 2% from their employer and 0.6% in tax relief); and in April 2019 the total minimum contribution will ratchet upwards again to 8% – typically 4% from the worker, 3% from their employer and 1% in tax relief. Just to complicate matters further, these percentages don’t apply to all of an individual worker’s salary, only to their “qualifying earnings”. This is what they earn over a minimum amount, currently £5,876 a year, and up to a maximum amount, currently £45,000 a year. Let’s take the example of a nanny on a net wage of £350 a week. This translates into a gross wage (ie, before deductions) of £21,932 a year. According to Nannytax, which crunched the numbers for us, the employer contribution would be £160 a year (£3.09 a week), while the nanny’s would be £128 a year (£2.47 a week). But these contributions will leap to £321 (£6.18 a week) and £385 (£7.42 a week) respectively in April next year; and from April 2019 onwards the employer will be coughing up £482 a year (£9.27 a week), while the nanny hands over £642 a year (£12.36 a week). Though don’t forget that the tax relief will also increase, too. Nannytax points out that the lower earnings threshold changes at the start of every tax year, and we don’t yet know what it will be in April 2018 and April 2019, so it has to use the current £5,876 figure for the calculations. There is a calculator on the firm’s website that people employing a nanny can use to work out their pension costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/oct/05/anne-wiazemsky-actor-france-jean-luc-godard","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T14:27:47Z","webTitle":"Anne Wiazemsky: a haunting, humane star who helped France discover itself","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/05/anne-wiazemsky-actor-france-jean-luc-godard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/oct/05/anne-wiazemsky-actor-france-jean-luc-godard","fields":{"headline":"Anne Wiazemsky: a haunting, humane star who helped France discover itself","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s an uncomfortable irony that, after her life has ended, Anne Wiazemsky risks being seen as a bystander in her own story. In Michel Hazanavicius’s enjoyable but somewhat facetious new film Redoubtable, Wiazemsky, played by Stacy Martin, is depicted as a wry observer in her marriage to Jean-Luc Godard – the straight woman to his tormented clown. In reality, even if she had never acted again after her debut – Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar, which she appeared in at the age of 18 – Wiazemsky would have been remembered as an intensely haunting screen presence. As Godard’s wife and star, she went on to share with him the turbulent adventure of France’s political self-questioning in the late 60s, but it would be a disservice to portray her merely as a key supporting player in the convoluted epic that was Godard’s life. As well as chalking up several important screen roles over three decades, Wiazemsky triumphantly created a new career, becoming a successful novelist – her 1993 work Canines won the prestigious Prix Goncourt des Lycéens. She was also a memoirist, spinning quasi-novelistic texts from her own experience. She wrote two quizzical, dispassionate books about her relationship with Godard, Une Année Studieuse (A Studious Year, 2012) and Un An après (One Year Later, 2015), the latter substantially forming the basis of Redoubtable. It’s only a shame that what’s lost in Hazanavicius’s film is a sense of the inner experience – the exhilaration, the confusion, the exasperation – that Wiazemsky conveys so candidly in her honed, highly classical prose style. Wiazemsky’s screen debut could not have been more momentous: Au Hasard Balthazar is one of the most affecting and austere of French masterpieces. Wiazemsky plays a young woman living in the countryside, who has a difficult relationship with a Parisian suitor, and a symbolically charged one with Balthazar, the donkey that emerges as a transcendental martyr figure. Bresson famously required actors to show as little expression as possible, but Wiazemsky’s humanity emerges powerfully. The fragility suggested by her face, which has the calm radiance of a medieval saint, contrasts with the intensity of her gaze. Together they project an admixture of compassion, repressed desire and that elusive note of moral seriousness that is the base note to Bresson’s work. Godard first cast her in La Chinoise (1967), as a member of a student cell grappling with Maoist political theory: beneath her earnestness we sense Wiazemsky coolly relishing the role, as if knowing that she embodies the worst nightmare of her parents’ generation. She also thrived working with such European screen provocateurs as Marco Ferreri (The Seed of Man, 1968), while her haunted demeanour gave an eerie edge to the savage, obscurely mystical world of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s hyper-subversive Theorem (1968). Wiazemsky continued to act on screen until the late 80s, then directed a number of TV documentaries. She also co-wrote the screenplay of Claire Denis’s 1994 TV film US Go Home, a 60s-set story of a teenage girl living in the Paris suburbs and anxious to lose her virginity. The subject couldn’t be further than Wiazemsky’s experience of growing up privileged and in the glare of media attention, but it’s a film in which you feel that, however elusively, Wiazemsky gives us another angle on her own adolescence in a time of radical personal and social change. •This article was amended on 6 October to correct the name of the prize awarded to Canines, which was the result of an editing error."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2017/oct/05/guardian-win-at-the-2017-uk-theatre-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T12:53:29Z","webTitle":"Guardian theatre critic wins at the 2017 UK Theatre awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/oct/05/guardian-win-at-the-2017-uk-theatre-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2017/oct/05/guardian-win-at-the-2017-uk-theatre-awards","fields":{"headline":"Guardian theatre critic wins at the 2017 UK Theatre awards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Guardian theatre critic Lyn Gardner, who has covered theatre around the UK for the Guardian since 1993, is to receive an award for “outstanding contribution to British theatre” at the 2017 UK Theatre Awards.

There are more than 12,000 boys and girls in the system but the opportunities for young players to be selected for clubs’ first teams have diminished as most overlook their young graduates, and instead buy from overseas. Though young players are often supported inside the system, the impact of being “let go” after being immersed in a club for several years can be devastating. Academic research from Teesside university found in 2015 that 55% of players in the study were suffering “clinical levels of psychological distress” 21 days after being released. Dr David Blakelock, who conducted the study and who was himself a youth footballer at professional clubs, maintains the academy experience can narrow young boys’ perspectives into an “athletic identity,” in which they see themselves almost wholly as footballers, so they can suffer “a loss of self-worth and confidence” when that is taken away.

Prince Charles said it had taken years for the enormity of the problem to emerge, but promised to make it a key priority of his campaigning, alongside rainforests. But he also confessed to mounting despair over how little has been achieved in his four decades of environmental campaigning, fearing we are “no longer a rational civilisation” but are driven by economic ideology. He pointedly chose not to mention President Trump, who has denied climate change, but warned: “If the unprecedented ferocity of recent catastrophic hurricanes is not the supreme wake-up call that it needs to be, to address the vast and accumulating threat of climate change and ocean warming, then we – let alone the global insurance and financial sectors – can surely no longer consider ourselves part of a rational, sensible civilisation.” He blamed “some strange, ideological urge to test the world to destruction”. The prince, who has long been a campaigner on rainforests, told a marine conference that oceans were now a twin passion for him. “While we should be relieved that the health of the ocean is now understood, alongside rainforests, to be one of the essential prerequisites for our physical and economic survival, I wonder if the ocean’s fragility is yet truly grasped and how susceptible it is to the impacts of our economic activities … We must never mistake [the oceans] for a new frontier for endless economic exploitation.” At the Our Ocean conference, the EU also announced plans to devote more than €550m to protecting the health of oceans, with more than 30 initiatives including efforts to combat piracy and illegal fishing, a satellite monitoring system, and a new plastics strategy for the bloc. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said: “The sea is a global common. We all have a responsibility to preserve it as a treasure and avoid that it turns into a threat. The EU believes that a globalised world needs a more cooperative global governance. It is impossible to imagine global governance without a cooperative oceans governance.” Mogherini hoped that other countries would come forward with funding to bring the total to more than €1bn. Karmenu Vella, the Maltese EU environment commissioner, said: “The EU has been a driving force behind the truly global effort [to protect marine life]. We have EU commitments on ocean governance, illegal fishing and the Arctic.” One new EU initiative is to establish the first marine-protected area in the Adriatic. About 90% of fish stocks in the Mediterranean are currently over-exploited. Another initiative announced at the conference to reduce the impact of plastic pollution was the consumer goods group Procter and Gamble’s plan to produce a new Fairy Liquid bottle made entirely of recycled plastic, including some retrieved from the ocean. Sky announced it would remove all single-use plastic products from its operations and supply chains by 2020. The company will also invest £25m in a fund for startups and other businesses working on technology to solve the plastic problem. In the Pacific, the small island of Niue, with the help of National Geographic and the UN development programme, is creating a marine-protected area covering approximately 127,000 sq km, more than 40% of its sea area. The island, a self-governing community in free association with New Zealand, is one of the world’s biggest raised coral atolls. Chile is creating two new reserves, one around the Juan Fernández archipelago and another around Cape Horn, covering more than 1m sq km, bringing to 29% the amount of its seas surface area covered by reserves where fishing and extractive activities are banned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/05/lance-armstrong-usps-lawsuit-government","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"It's time for the government to get off Lance Armstrong's back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/05/lance-armstrong-usps-lawsuit-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/05/lance-armstrong-usps-lawsuit-government","fields":{"headline":"It's time for the government to get off Lance Armstrong's back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At what point will society’s fury against Lance Armstrong be satisfied? Will it be when Armstrong has to sell his remaining luxury items, including his houses in Aspen and Austin? Or will it be when Armstrong has to hand over most of his earthly possessions not to the people he truly wronged – such as Greg LeMond or Frankie and Betsy Andreu – but to former teammate/fellow doper Floyd Landis and the US Postal Service, both of whom profited handsomely from association with the cancer patient-turned-Tour de France megastar-turned-pariah? The latter is a possible outcome of a federal suit that goes to trial next year (in September, the trial was delayed from November to May, giving Armstrong’s legal team more time but also prolonging his agony), in which the federal government is seeking damages for false claims – specifically, Armstrong and his team claiming to be drug-free – and Landis would profit as a “whistleblower” who initiated the suit. For the moment, Armstrong is still living well. An Outside magazine profile last month found Armstrong enjoying himself at the center of a thriving social circle in Aspen, playing golf and recording podcasts while enjoying family time. But Armstrong also has lost a lot of friends and a lot of money. By Outside’s accounting, the lawsuit could take most of the rest of his holdings. At this point, much of Armstrong’s life is literally unreal. Officially, he never won the Tour de France. On the Tour’s official site, the years 1999-2005 have been whitewashed, with no official winner listed. Each year explains the gaps in the record with one simple sentence: “Armstrong disqualified for doping.” Or, in years with multiple infractions: “Armstrong, Leipheimer, Van de Velde, Hincapie disqualified for doping.” The history being told in court also will be somewhere between amusingly incomplete and outright dishonest. In legal terms, the suit is a ‘qui tam’ case, in which a whistleblower alleges someone has violated the False Claims Act by making false claims against the government. In this case, the government is involved because the US Postal Service sponsored Armstrong and his team through many of his now-erased Tour victories. If the government acts upon the case and wins, the whistleblower is entitled to a share of the recovered money. In a false claims case, awards are tripled, so the whistleblower can get quite a chunk of cash. The original complaint, filed in June 2010, gives Landis’ account of doping within the US Postal Service team by Armstrong and many teammates, including Landis himself. The case languished for a couple of years with no government action. But after Armstrong sat for a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey and confessed his misdeeds in January 2013, the government jumped in with gusto, even successfully objecting to Landis’ attempt to settle with parties that the government had not been pursuing. (The government relented this summer.) The lawsuit features lawyers scrambling to keep anyone from saying in court all the things the rest of us already know. Armstrong’s team wants to keep out the 2012 US Anti-Doping Agency report detailing all his misdeeds, along with testimony from LeMond and Betsy Andreu. The other side doesn’t want the court to hear much about Landis losing his own Tour de France win in 2006 after flunking a drug test or that the US Postal Service earned more than $100m in global exposure by sponsoring Armstrong’s team, according to their own research. Armstrong’s lawyers have been hammering the last point, noting that the powers that be were well aware of doping problems in cycling and merrily went along for the ride anyway. “Although the government now pretends to be aggrieved by these allegations, its actions at the time are far more telling: Did it immediately fire the Postal Service Team?” Armstrong’s lawyers wrote in July 2013. “Did it suspend the team pending an investigation? Did it refer the matter to its phalanx of lawyers and investigators at the Department of Justice for review? It did not. Rather than exercise its right to terminate the sponsorship agreement, it instead renewed its contract to sponsor the team. The rationale behind the government’s decision is obvious. Armstrong had recently won the 2000 Tour de France. The government wanted a winner and all the publicity, exposure, and acclaim that goes along with being his sponsor. “It got exactly what it bargained for.” The fact that the government is seeking damages from a situation in which, by all available accounting, they profited isn’t just ironic. It may hurt the case against Armstrong. US District Judge Christopher Cooper – perhaps a little more sympathetic to Armstrong than was Robert Wilkins, who presided over the case before his elevation to the Court of Appeals – seems skeptical that the government is entitled to everything it’s asking. “The government may attempt to prove that the positive benefits of the sponsorship were reduced – or even eliminated altogether – by the negative publicity that accompanied the subsequent investigation and disclosure of Armstrong’s doping,” Cooper wrote in a February opinion denying Armstrong’s motion to dismiss. “But it is not entitled to the return of all of its money, tripled no less, simply because it never would have sponsored a ‘doping’ team.” But Cooper allowed the case to proceed because the dollar figures in question are so difficult to pin down: “Ultimately, however, the Court concludes that the monetary amount of the benefits USPS received is not sufficiently quantifiable to keep any reasonable juror from finding that the agency suffered a net loss on the sponsorship, especially if one considers the adverse effect on the Postal Service’s revenues and brand value that may have resulted from the negative publicity surrounding the subsequent investigations of Armstrong’s doping and his widely publicized confession. Determination of damages must therefore be left to a jury.” So the government’s case hinges upon the notion that the US Postal Service brand suffered by association with Armstrong. Are people really opting to send packages via FedEx simply because the USPS spent so much money to promote itself via a cyclist who went a little too fast? Then we hit the elephant in the courtroom – another big fact Armstrong’s accusers don’t want aired in court: Everyone else was doing it. Indeed, LeMond worries that, even with advances in drug testing, the world’s top cyclists may still be doing it. So while we argue from a legal point of view, the other aspect of this is the practical point of view in which we know confessed dopers are still regarded as Tour de France winners. Bjarne Riis is still listed as the 1996 champion even after admitting he was doping through the mid-90s, and 1997 champion Jan Ullrich refused to return Olympic medals on the grounds that he was simply keeping up with his pharmaceutically enhanced rivals. The 1998 Tour was rendered ridiculous by retroactive tests and confessions. The next seven years were the Armstrong years, in which organizers essentially gave up on the notion of finding a “clean” rider worthy of inheriting the championships Armstrong vacated. The next year, 2006, Landis won and lost the yellow jersey. In 2007, Michael Rasmussen was leading the Tour when his own team kicked him out of the race over a drug testing dispute. He later confessed to extensive doping. Alberto Contador was stripped of his 2010 win. Most of these cyclists are living in relative peace today. Some are commentators on cycling broadcasts. Some have business interests in cycling. They’re generally not being hounded over their years of participating in a performance-enhanced peloton. So what exactly is the point here? To demonstrate that Armstrong isn’t a role model? Hasn’t that been done? Or is simply that we don’t know when to stop?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-ethical-project-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"OFM Awards 2017: Best Ethical Food Project – the runners-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-ethical-project-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-ethical-project-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"OFM Awards 2017: Best Ethical Food Project – the runners-up","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"London Farmdrop “From farmer to your door within 19 hours” is the promise of this innovative online service which connects customers with outstanding producers in their area, who get paid 75% of the retail price.

With two adjacent restaurants in Hereford and one in Worcester, they were regional runners-up for the Ethical and Cheap Eats prizes last year, and now the company finally has an OFM Awards trophy, for The Bookshop’s splendid Sunday lunches. “Sunday lunch is one of those meals people look forward to the most, but so often it’s disappointing,” says Dorian Kirk, 29, who founded A Rule of Tum with his brother Edwin, 31, and their friend Jon Stead, whom Edwin met working at the local Pizza Hut. “Restaurants get away with offering as little as possible: frozen chantenay carrots and peas, veg that’s completely out of season,” adds Dorian. “But it doesn’t take much. Just source good quality meat and organic veg, and make your own gravy. The gravy is the most important thing. If you do it properly it takes all week.” All three grew up locally, but after catering college Dorian set off to learn the trade, first to Cambridge and then London, where he relaunched Café Below, on Cheapside in the City, and the Colonel Fawcett, in Camden. The latter won the Best Sunday Lunch award in 2014, a year after Dorian had returned to bring a few of his London ways to Hereford. The influence of the capital’s restaurant trends is clear at The Bookshop. First there’s the name, testament to the building’s previous incarnation as a charity bookshop. Books still line the back wall of the dining room. Then there’s the exposed brickwork along one wall, the result of laborious chipping. Most importantly, there’s the short, lovingly created menu: steaks from Thursday to Saturday, and roasts on the Sunday. Between those and the Burger Shop next door, their first restaurant which they opened in 2014 [“‘Very Good’ with a gold star and a tick,” said Jay Rayner], few parts of the “cow or two” they get through each week are wasted. At heart, A Rule of Tum want to remind both locals and visitors of the joy of the local produce. As well as the beef named after the town, celebrated by a huge iron bull in the market square, the surrounding valleys produce enviable vegetables, cheeses and drinks. Their meat comes from Farmer Tom Jones, a Hereford local who supplies Moro, St John, the Clove Club and Black Axe Mangal. The town’s sleepy scene meant A Rule of Tum could steal a march on the publicity front. “Nobody else was on Facebook, so for about 18 months we had a completely captive audience and hit everyone we wanted [with an ad] for about a tenner,” says Stead. He handles marketing and publicity, while Edwin deals with front of house and Dorian focuses on the food. “There were always people interested in this kind of food, but thanks to social media they can talk to each other. Now all the other restaurants have cottoned on,” he adds, slightly ruefully. Other hip newcomers have arrived in their wake, too. The Hereford Beer House stocks more than 230 beers. The Beefy Boys, near the market, sell American-style burgers and craft beers. A Rule of Tum has also begun a small Hereford food festival. Not everything they tried worked. Older diners still wanted a knife and fork to eat burgers. A “pig’s head croquette” served with the pork Sunday roast proved unpalatable, so had to be renamed “pig’s cheek croquette”. These quibbles aside, the three men seem happy. They enviously eye Bristol’s thriving food scene, and, in time, a fourth site there might be on the cards. But for now they are content to make sure the three existing restaurants are doing what they’re meant to do: show the world what their town is capable of. “Four years ago nothing was happening in Hereford,” says Dorian. “It’s about 10 years behind London, I reckon. We want to put it on the map. We want people to reconnect with the area, and what it has to offer. The more good restaurants we have here, the more it will become a destination.” aruleoftum.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/05/uks-new-supreme-court-chief-calls-for-clarity-on-ecj-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T11:40:00Z","webTitle":"UK's new supreme court chief calls for clarity on ECJ after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/05/uks-new-supreme-court-chief-calls-for-clarity-on-ecj-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/05/uks-new-supreme-court-chief-calls-for-clarity-on-ecj-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK's new supreme court chief calls for clarity on ECJ after Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Parliament should give judges “as much clarity as possible” in setting out the UK’s relationship to the European Union’s court of justice after Brexit, the new president of the supreme court has urged. Appearing at her first press conference as head of the UK’s highest court, Brenda Hale called on MPs to give sufficient guidance so that judges knew how far they should “take into account” future judgments from the Luxembourg court. As the first woman to head the supreme court, Lady Hale denied that she was a “judicial activist” or that judgments would be shaped by the gender composition of the bench. She also said that government cuts to legal aid had probably been a “false economy” and expressed support for “no-fault divorce”. Hale, 72, succeeded David Neuberger as president of the supreme court this month. Of the 12 justices on the bench, two are women. Her deputy is Jonathan Mance. In an opening statement, the two senior justices pledged to “continue improving the way in which we communicate the importance of the rule of law to the public”. Having heard cases last summer in Edinburgh, Lord Mance said, the court would sit for the first time in Belfast next spring. Hardline Brexiters have urged the government to remove the UK from the jurisdiction of the European Union’s highest court, the European court of justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg as soon as possible and make the UK supreme court “supreme”. Asked about what the future relationship should be between the UK’s supreme court and the ECJ, Lady Hale said: “We hope that the European Union Withdrawal Act will tell us what we should be doing … saying how much we should be taking into account [judgments from the ECJ]. We would like to be told because then we will get on and do it. “We will do what parliament tells us to do. We would like parliament to give us as much clarity as possible.” Her views reinforce concerns expressed by her predecessor, Lord Neuberger, about the need for clear legislative guidance on the weight that should be attached to judgments from Luxembourg after Brexit. She accepted that in the past ECJ judgments had not always been clear legally. There had been one occasion when she and fellow judges had had to go back to Luxembourg to ask the EU judges what they had meant, she recalled. Hale has been accused by some critics of being a “judicial activist”, in the sense of making new law through ground-breaking judgments. “I don’t think I accept the label ‘judicial activist’,” she said. “It means so many different things … All judges have to be active in the sense of working out the answer [to disputed claims in court].” She has previously implied that having more women on the supreme court might deliver a different sort of justice, but at the press conference she insisted there was no “single woman’s viewpoint” on legal matters, although having a second woman on the supreme court might “change slightly the type of conversation at lunchtime”. In her opening remarks, Hale recalled a saying by the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, that there was “a special place in hell” for women who pull up the drawbridge once they have succeeded in obtaining high office. She hoped she had avoided that fate, she said, now that a second woman, Jill Black, has been appointed as a supreme court justice. “I just hope it won’t take another 13 years before a third, fourth, fifth and sixth woman are appointed,” she added. On no-fault divorce, which reformers are urging the government to adopt, Hale said she had not changed her position since supporting it when she was a member of the Law Commission about 20 years ago. The Ministry of Justice is reviewing the impact of deep cuts to legal aid introduced by the 2012 Legal Aid and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo). The president of the supreme court said they had probably been “a false economy”. Early legal advice, she said, could help resolve many legal problems. Referring to newspaper attacks on the judiciary following the article 50 high court judgment last year, in which judges were condemned as “enemies of the people”, Hale observed: “The press are free to write and say what they wish to write and say. But [they should consider] how dangerous it may be to the rule of law – and that’s the glue which holds society together – if unjustified criticism gets out of hand.” Asked whether she would intervene publicly, she added: “I would wish to do so if it was appropriate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/06/playboy-hugh-hefner-literature-amy-grace-loyd","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T12:00:52Z","webTitle":"Nabokov on one page, nudes on the next: a Playboy literary editor reveals all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/06/playboy-hugh-hefner-literature-amy-grace-loyd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/06/playboy-hugh-hefner-literature-amy-grace-loyd","fields":{"headline":"Nabokov on one page, nudes on the next: a Playboy literary editor reveals all","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am not the only woman who worked at Playboy and kept her clothes on. When I was hired as literary editor in 2005, Hugh Hefner’s basic recipe for the monthly had not changed much since the 1950s: insistent juxtapositions of high and low culture, the ingredients, as he wrote in his 1953 inaugural editorial, for “a quiet discussion on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex” at a cocktail party. Its DNA was spliced from Esquire’s, where Hefner worked as a young man; but the nudity gave it a daring few magazines had. By the time I arrived it was at once chaste, compared with what was on offer online, and sterile, given to an overabundance of models with big breast implants and big hair. The daring had to be found elsewhere. My task, or so I told myself, was to locate it in the fiction and literary pieces. You can’t be a grown woman in the US without understanding the importance of subversion. Not long after I was hired at Playboy, I ran into a former colleague from a famously highbrow magazine and told her about my new post, and she said tenderly: “Well, erotic fiction has its place, too, doesn’t it?” She had forgotten or no longer cared to know that Playboy, from its inception, published the likes of Ray Bradbury, Arthur Conan Doyle and Alberto Moravia, and soon Bernard Malamud, Vladimir Nabokov, Kurt Vonnegut, Hunter S Thompson and John Updike. Then, during the celebrated Alice K Turner’s long tenure as literary editor, more Updike, Robert Coover, TC Boyle, Haruki Murakami; and women, too, women I would invite to write for the magazine again after an absence of some years: Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates and Jane Smiley. Hefner’s is a complicated legacy: enticing men from the domestic landscape, offering up bachelorhood in America as ideal and destination, meant that women had to adapt and did, and claim their own part in, and right to, the sexual revolution, however tumultuous that transition. It’s no wonder that I experienced some resistance and concern when approaching writers and their agents. One of my first assignments was to commission a series of essays about Nabokov’s Lolita, evergreen in its own controversy, for the novel’s 50th anniversary. I went after it with a near religious zeal, eager to prove it was possible to connect Playboy’s past and present in ways that dignified it. In addition to essays by Donna Tartt and John Banville, I invited Azar Nafisi, author of Reading Lolita in Tehran, to contribute. When Nafisi expressed some queasiness about publishing in Playboy, especially given her experiences in Iran, where the oppression of women had become a reflex, I tried to convey to her that the magazine in 2005 was fighting different battles from those it took on decades ago. Unlike other national magazines that still published literary work and especially fiction, it was popular in non-urban areas as much as urban, on military bases and fraternities, and so was uniquely positioned to win converts to the cause of reading and of writing. We editors told ourselves the naked women were merely carnival barkers: they got an audience into the tent, but we kept them with the content. For my part that couldn’t be accomplished without female writers’ work printed alongside those trademark Playboy nudes. We published AS Byatt on the sensuality of John Donne’s poetry, an excerpt from Lydia Davis’s translation of Madame Bovary, Atwood on comics and more short stories by Oates, Maile Meloy and Michelle Richmond. We ran work by Stephen King, Junot Díaz, Walter Mosley, Sherman Alexie and triumphantly a novel in four parts by Denis Johnson, at 10,000 words per instalment – unheard of then to give fiction so much space, impossible now. We could pay well, and the money overcame scruples and the admittedly anachronistic quality of the Playboy brand, with its ageing, Viagra-addled avatar. When I pursued work by Salman Rushdie, for instance, his agent quoted me at $10 a word. Our coffers weren’t that deep, and I’m sure the agent knew that, but I couldn’t be affronted for long. The ads for sex toys, the off-colour cartoons, Ms January and Ms July: these required a sense of humour, some irony, cynicism. Not a thin skin. We were nominated for an American Society of Magazine Editors award for fiction for the first time in 17 years after my first year at the magazine. When Playboy’s cover flashed up on the screen as part of the presentation, flesh and cleavage in the offing, there were giggles. Insiders told us we could never win, and we didn’t. In that room of industry insiders, editors, journalists, we were a joke. But now, years later, Playboy having fallen even further from whatever relevance it once had in our culture, with Donald Trump in office and anti-intellectualism a kind of national contagion, I miss those trenches we dug and fought from. Well into his late 80s, Hefner looked at every layout, headline and subhead, and if he no longer read every word, he made sure we followed a recipe he recognised. Until I left in late 2011, I was working for an ideal, not the man. Because by simply putting out a magazine every month that thrived on such strange and jarring juxtapositions, that aimed to answer at once to carnality and intellectual curiosity, silliness and sophistication, we were upsetting the norms, and complacency, our own included. We were subversives, a little suspect, a little uncomfortable, and I, for one, continue to be proud of that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/05/anne-wiazemsky-french-actor-novelist-and-muse-to-jean-luc-godard-dies-aged-70","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T12:02:16Z","webTitle":"Anne Wiazemsky, French actor, novelist and muse to Jean-Luc Godard, dies aged 70","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/05/anne-wiazemsky-french-actor-novelist-and-muse-to-jean-luc-godard-dies-aged-70","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/05/anne-wiazemsky-french-actor-novelist-and-muse-to-jean-luc-godard-dies-aged-70","fields":{"headline":"Anne Wiazemsky, French actor, novelist and muse to Jean-Luc Godard, dies aged 70","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Anne Wiazemsky, the actor best known for her appearances in films of the French Nouvelle Vague and marriage to director Jean-Luc Godard, has died aged 70 after a battle with cancer. “Anne died this morning. She had been very sick,” her brother Pierre told AFP. Born in Berlin in 1947, Wiazemsky was the granddaughter of novelist and Nobel literature laureate François Mauriac. At 18, she made her debut in Robert Bresson’s celebrated 1966 film Au Hasard Balthazar, about a farm girl’s relationship with her pet donkey. During the film’s production Bresson became obsessed with Wiazemsky, regularly propositioning her on set. “At first, he would content himself by holding my arm, or stroking my cheek. But then came the disagreeable moment when he would try to kiss me ... I would push him away and he wouldn’t insist, but he looked so unhappy that I always felt guilty,” she recalls in her memoir Jeune Fille. A year later Wiazemsky met Godard, at the time at the height of his fame, and appeared in his 1967 film La Chinoise, a tale of Maoist revolutionaries living in Paris. The pair married during the film’s production, and Wiazemsky went on to appear in other Godard films, including black comedy Weekend and One Plus One, an agitprop collage that featured scenes of the Rolling Stones recording Sympathy for the Devil interspersed with documentary footage of revolutionary insurrection. Yet, as Godard became more immersed in the social uprising in France and elsewhere in 1968, the marriage became strained. “The further it went on, the more our paths diverged,” she told AFP in an interview earlier this year. The pair divorced in 1979. Wiazemsky continued to perform in films, most notably alongside Terence Stamp in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Italian arthouse work Theorem. The film was banned for obscenity in Italy in 1968 for its story of a mysterious stranger who seduces a whole family. In her later years Wiazemsky published more than a dozen novels, including 2015’s Un an après, about her relationship with Godard. The book became the basis for Michel Hazanavicius’s Redoubtable, and one of Wiazemsky’s last public appearances was at the film’s premiere at the Cannes film festival in May. According to Hazanavicius, Wiazemsky was reluctant to allow him to adapt her book but relented when he said that the film would be funny. “She said, ‘I think it was a funny relationship and a funny time,’” Hazanavicius recalled. This article was amended on 5 October to correct an error in the standfirst that stated that Wiazemsky and Godard were married for two years. They were in fact married for 12 years"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-independent-retailer-the-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"OFM Awards 2017: Best Independent Retailer – the runners-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-independent-retailer-the-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-independent-retailer-the-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"OFM Awards 2017: Best Independent Retailer – the runners-up","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"London Vallebona Stefano Vallebona’s best-quality Italian products – olive oil, wild boar prosciutto, bottarga from his native Sardinia – in one well-stocked cafe-shop. 55-59 Weir Rd, SW19 8UG; 020 8944 5665 Prohibition Wines Muswell Hill vintner specialising in wines from Spain and North America, with an emphasis on small producers. 34 Fortis Green Rd, N10 3HN; 020 8444 4804 Turner and George Exceptional butcher, supplying specialist cuts since 2013. 399 St John St, EC1V 4LD; 020 7837 1781 East Macarons and More, Norwich Tim Kinnaird’s boutique offers delicate, multi-coloured macarons as well as brownies and elaborate cakes. 11 Royal Arcade, NR2 1NQ; 01603 624756 Thirsty, Cambridge Opened in 2015, this English-French booze shop sets out to demystify wine and craft beer and “get your juices flowing”. 46 Chesterton Rd, CB4 1EN; 01223 464436 Gog Magog Hills Farm Shop, Cambridge The butchery is a point of pride at this family farm shop, established in the 1970s but expanded in the past decade.

Recently, however, I was charged £3,075 for more than 200 calls to overseas premium rate numbers over a four-day period. My provider, Focus Group, was unaware of the charges until I contacted it. It placed a bar on all international calls and premium rate numbers, but advised me that a further £8,282 had been racked up in the previous 11 days. Pennine supplies my actual telephone systems, and it and Focus are blaming each other. Pennine says Focus should have noticed the large call rates, which were occurring at night and were out of character, while Focus says Pennine should have offered a more secure system. In the meantime, I am left with a bill for around £12,000 that I can’t afford to pay. LMN, Blackburn, Lancashire It sounds as though you have fallen victim to a type of fraud whereby criminals hack into corporate telephone systems and install software that automatically calls premium rate numbers run by fellow gang members. It’s one of the most lucrative scams in the UK, costing companies an estimated £1.5bn a year. Ordinarily, you would expect your provider to flag up any unusual activity on your phone lines. Focus, however, says that as a reseller of services it only receives information about customer usage from carriers periodically. “We rely on the alerts provided to us by the carriers, as they are the only ones with ‘real-time’ information about the calls that customers are making,” says a spokesperson. Its terms and conditions advise customers to have secure passwords on their phone systems to prevent scams, and warn that they are liable for any fraudulent charges. Security is also something you might think your hardware provider would take care of. Pennine tells me that it changes all passwords from manufacturers’ settings when installing. “If we maintain the system, we retain those passwords and take responsibility for system integrity in relation to them,” says a spokesperson. “We cannot comment on an individual client; however, there have been no reported instances where passwords we are responsible for have been compromised.” According to Ombudsman Services, both providers have questions to answer about how such a large bill accrued without anyone noticing. “If we were to investigate a complaint about the company that installed equipment, we would consider whether they changed the password to one that could easily be guessed, or allowed it to fall into the wrong hands,” says a spokesperson. As for Focus, it says: “We would want to know what promises the provider made to the customer about monitoring their usage, and whether any usage limits had been discussed.” You had to wait eight weeks before you were allowed to refer the complaint to the ombudsman and, in that time, Focus relented a little. It issued you with a credit note for £9,180, leaving you to pay £3,059. Exhausted by weeks of wrangling, you accepted this without invoking the ombudsman.

The name is a problem, for starters. In almost every Indo-European language, one of the words for the disease relates to low temperature, yet experiments have shown that low temperature neither increases the likelihood of catching a cold, nor the severity of symptoms. Then there is the “common” part, which seems to imply that there is a single, indiscriminate pathogen at large. In reality, more than 200 viruses provoke cold-like illness, each one deploying its own peculiar chemical and genetic strategy to evade the body’s defences. It is hard to think of another disease that inspires the same level of collective resignation. The common cold slinks through homes and schools, towns and cities, making people miserable for a few days without warranting much afterthought. Adults suffer an average of between two and four colds each year, and children up to 10, and we have come to accept this as an inevitable part of life. Public understanding remains a jumble of folklore and false assumption. In 1984, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison decided to investigate one of the best-known ways of catching a cold. They infected volunteers with a cold virus and instructed them to kiss healthy test subjects on the mouth for at least one minute. (The instruction for participants was to use whichever technique was “most natural”.) Sixteen healthy volunteers were kissed by people with colds. The result: just one confirmed infection. The most common beliefs about how to treat the disease have turned out to be false. Dubious efficacy has done little to deter humankind from formulating remedies. The Ebers Papyrus, a medical document from ancient Egypt dated to 1550BC, advises a cold sufferer to recite an incantation, “in association with the administration of milk of one who has borne a male child, and fragrant gum”. In 1924, US President Calvin Coolidge sat down in an airtight chlorine chamber and inhaled the pungent, noxious gas for almost an hour on the advice of his physicians, who were certain that his cold would be cured quickly. (It wasn’t.) Today, “winter remedy” sales in the UK reach £300m each year, though most over-the-counter products have not actually been proven to work. Some contain paracetamol, an effective analgesic, but the dosage is often sub-optimal. Taking vitamin C in regular doses does little to ward off disease. Hot toddies, medicated tissues and immune system “boosts” of echinacea or ginger are ineffective. Antibiotics do nothing for colds. The only failsafe means of avoiding a cold is to live in complete isolation from the rest of humanity. Although modern science has changed the way medicine is practised in almost every field, it has so far failed to produce any radically new treatments for colds. The difficulty is that while all colds feel much the same, from a biological perspective the only common feature of the various viruses that cause colds is that they have adapted to enter and damage the cells that line the respiratory tract. Otherwise, they belong to quite different categories of organisms, each with a distinct way of infecting our cells. This makes a catch-all treatment extremely tricky to formulate. Scientists today identify seven virus families that cause the majority of colds: rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and, finally, metapneumovirus, which was first isolated in 2001. Each has a branch of sub-viruses, known as serotypes, of which there are about 200. Rhinovirus, the smallest cold pathogen by size, is by far the most prevalent, causing up to three-quarters of colds in adults. To vanquish the cold we will need to tackle all of these different families of virus at some stage. But, for now, rhinovirus is the biggest player. Scientists first attempted to make a rhinovirus vaccine in the 1950s. They used a reliable method, pioneered by French biologist Louis Pasteur in the 1880s, in which a small amount of virus is introduced to a host in order to provoke a defensive immunological reaction that then protects the body from subsequent infection. Even so, those who had been vaccinated caught colds just as easily as those who had not. Over the next decade, as the techniques for isolating cold viruses were refined, it became clear that there were many more rhinoviruses than first predicted. Researchers realised it would not be possible to make a vaccine in the traditional way. Producing dozens of single-serotype vaccines, each one targeting a different strain, would be impractical. The consensus that a rhinovirus vaccine was not possible deepened. The last human clinical trial took place in 1975. Then, in January last year, an editorial appeared in the Expert Review of Vaccines that once again raised the prospect of a vaccine. The article was co-authored by a group of the world’s leading respiratory disease specialists based at Imperial College London. It was worded cautiously, yet the claim it made was striking. “Perhaps the quest for an RV [rhinovirus] vaccine has been dismissed as too difficult or even impossible,” it said, “but new developments suggest that it may be feasible to generate a significant breadth of immune protection.” The scientists were claiming to be on the way to solving a riddle that has stumped virologists for decades. One virologist told me it was as if a door that had been closed for many, many years had been re-opened. Part of the Imperial scientists’ motivation was the notion that since we now have vaccines for many of the most dangerous viruses (measles, polio, yellow fever, cholera, influenza, and so on), it is time to tackle the disease that afflicts us most often. “Rhinovirus is by far the most common cause of illness,” says Sebastian Johnston, a professor at Imperial and one of the authors of the editorial. “Look at what people spend on ineffective over-the-counter medications. If you had a safe and effective treatment, you’d take it.” I asked Johnston if he was optimistic. He pointed out that because their studies so far have only been in mice, they are not sure that the vaccine will work in humans. “The data is limited,” he says. “But it’s encouraging.” It was not the resounding triumphalism that I was expecting, but then cold scientists learned long ago to be careful about making grand proclamations. Theirs is an undertaking that, more than anything, has been defined by consistent disappointment. * * * The first scientist to try and fail to make a rhinovirus vaccine was also the first scientist to distinguish it from the jumble of other cold viruses. In 1953, an epidemiologist called Winston Price was working at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore when a group of nurses in his department came down with a mild fever, a cough, sore throat and runny nose – symptoms that suggested the flu. Price took nasal washings from the nurses and grew their virus in a cell culture. What he found was too small to be influenza virus. In a 1957 paper, “The isolation of a new virus associated with respiratory clinical disease in humans”, Price initially named his discovery “JH virus”, after his employer. Price decided to try to develop a vaccine using a bit of dead rhinovirus. When the immune system encounters an invading virus – even a dead or weakened virus – it sets out to expel it. One defence is the production of antibodies, small proteins that hang around in the blood system long after the virus is gone. If the virus is encountered a second time, the antibodies will swiftly recognise it and raise the alarm, giving the immune system the upper hand. At first, Price was encouraged. In a trial that involved several hundred people, those vaccinated with JH virus had eight times fewer colds than the unvaccinated. Newspapers across the US wanted to know: had the common cold been cured? “The telephone by my bed kept ringing until 3 o’clock in the morning,” Price told the New York Times in November 1957. The celebration would be short-lived. Though Price’s vaccine was effective against his particular “JH” rhinovirus strain, in subsequent experiments it did nothing. This indicated that more than one rhinovirus was out there. By the late 1960s, dozens of rhinoviruses had been discovered. Even in the alien menagerie of respiratory disease, this level of variation in one species was unusual; there are just three or four influenza viruses circulating at any one time. Scientists at the University of Virginia decided to try a different tactic. Instead of inoculating patients with a single strain of rhinovirus, they combined 10 different serotypes in one injection. But after this, too, failed to shield participants from infection, they were out of ideas. As hope for a vaccine receded, scientists began investigating other ways to combat colds. From 1946 until it closed in 1990, most research into respiratory viruses in the UK was undertaken at the Common Cold Unit (CCU), a facility backed by the Medical Research Council that occupied a former wartime military hospital in the countryside near Salisbury. In its four decades of operation, some 20,000 volunteers passed through the doors of the CCU, many to be willingly infected with cold virus in the name of scientific progress. An early experiment at the CCU involved a group of volunteers being made to take a bath and then to stand dripping wet and shivering in a corridor for 30 minutes. After they were allowed to get dressed, they had to wear wet socks for several hours. Despite a drop in body temperature, the group did not get any more colds than a control group of volunteers who had been kept cosy. The CCU began focusing on cold treatments in the 1960s and 70s, when research into a substance produced by the human body called interferon was gaining momentum. Interferons are proteins that are secreted by cells when they are attacked by a virus. They act as messengers, alerting nearby cells to the invader. These cells in turn produce an antiviral protein that inhibits, or interferes with, the virus’s ability to spread, hence the name. In 1972, researchers at the CCU decided to investigate whether interferon could be used as a treatment for colds. They infected 32 volunteers with rhinovirus and then sprayed either interferon or placebo up their noses. Of the 16 given a placebo, 13 came down with colds. But of the 16 given interferon, only three got ill. The findings, published in The Lancet, made the front page of the New York Times (below a story on Watergate). A rush of interferon research got underway. But, once again, the excitement was premature. A review by the CCU in the 1980s uncovered a fatal flaw: interferon only worked when it was given to the patient at the same time as the virus. But in real life – that is, outside the lab – a rhinovirus enters the nose between eight and 48 hours before the onset of cold symptoms. By the time you feel a cold coming on, it is already too late. As the 20th century drew to a close, attempts to find a cure grew more desperate. At the CCU, molecules that were found in traditional Chinese medicine, Japanese tea and oranges were all seriously interrogated. In 1990, the CCU closed. The centre had done much to advance our understanding of the virology of the cold, yet it had also exposed the enormity of the task of defeating it. In the 1990s, as many virologists focused on HIV and Aids, research into the cold tailed off. “Common acute respiratory infections were seen as less important compared with this threat of a worldwide, lethal plague,” writes David Tyrrell, the former director of the CCU, in his 2002 book Cold Wars. A cure seemed more remote than ever. * * * Sebastian Johnston’s lab is on the third floor of the School of Medicine, part of Imperial College’s St Mary’s Hospital campus in Paddington, west London. Opened in 1851, the original hospital building is red-brick, with high ceilings, arched colonnades and turrets, but numerous extensions, each progressively more box-like, now hem it in. A round blue plaque on the facade states that Sir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955) discovered penicillin in a second-storey room. Entry to a recreation of Fleming’s lab is £4. Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine and an asthma specialist, is 58 and bespectacled, with a mop of grey curls that form a peak on his forehead. As a PhD student in 1989, he was dispatched to the CCU, not long before it closed down, to study virus detection methods. “I spent six months there,” Johnston said. “It was a strange place, basically a bunch of nissen huts connected by wooden runways, with lots of rabbits.” For his PhD on asthma, Johnston developed a technique called polymerase chain reaction, which magnifies DNA so that viruses can be identified more precisely. To his amazement, Johnston discovered that viruses were behind 85% of asthma attacks in children; about half of those were rhinoviruses. Previously, most studies had detected viruses in fewer than 20% of asthma attacks. Johnston went on to find that rhinovirus also exacerbates symptoms in 95% of cases of smoker’s cough (formally known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD). It wasn’t until the 1990s that scientists fighting rhinovirus properly understood what they were up against. By that time, electron microscopy had advanced and it was possible to see the organism up close. For a pathogen so spectacularly good at infecting our nasal passages – the “rhin” of the name is from the Greek for “nose” – rhinoviruses are astonishingly simple, being little more than strands of ribonucleic acid (RNA) surrounded by a shell: “a piece of bad news wrapped in a protein coat”, as the Nobel Prize-winning biologist Peter Medawar once observed. Under an electron microscope, they are spherical with a shaggy surface like the bobble on a knitted hat. Though all the rhinoviruses are pretty much the same internally, a subtle alteration to the pattern of proteins on their outer shell means that, to the immune system, they all look different. It’s a cloak-and-dagger strategy, and the reason why early vaccines such as Winston Price’s failed. Antibodies produced for one rhinovirus serotype do not detect the rest. Until recently, it was believed that there were around 100 different strains, and these were grouped into the “A” and “B” families. Then, in 2007, a new cache of viruses was discovered, the “C” group, making the total more like 160. In 2003, Johnston, who was then working at Imperial, contacted Jeffrey Almond, a former professor of virology at Reading University who had been recently appointed as head of vaccine development at the pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. The company was already manufacturing a jab for influenza and was interested in tackling the common cold. Having bumped into Johnston at academic conferences, Almond felt that their ambitions were aligned. “I said: ‘Let’s think about whether we can do something dramatic,’” Almond told me. “Let’s think about how we can make a vaccine against rhino.” For doctors, vaccines are preferable to drugs because they shield the host from invasive organisms before they cause any damage. For pharmaceutical companies, vaccines are significantly less attractive. Not only do they take years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, even if that process is successful – which it often isn’t – it can still be hard to make much money. Vaccines are usually injections administered on a single occasion, while drugs are taken for prolonged periods. And people don’t want to pay much for vaccines. “Everybody wants vaccines for pennies rather than pounds because you get them when you’re healthy,” Almond said. “Nobody wants to pay anything when they’re healthy. It’s like car insurance, right? But when you’re sick you will empty your wallet, whatever it takes.” Still, Almond thought there might be a commercial case for a rhinovirus vaccine. Totting up the days off school and work, plus the secondary infections such as sinusitis that require supplementary treatment and even hospitalisation, rhinovirus places a huge burden on health systems. Last year, in the UK, coughs and colds accounted for almost a quarter of the total number of days lost to sickness, about 34m. In the US, a survey carried out in 2002 calculated that each cold experienced by an adult causes an average loss of 8.7 working hours, while a further 1.2 hours are lost attending to cold-ridden children, making the total cost of lost productivity almost $25bn (£19bn) each year. Almond convinced his bosses that, if it were possible to make one, a rhinovirus vaccination would be financially viable. “Our back-of-the-envelope calculations on what we could charge, and what the numbers of sales could be, mean that it’s likely to be quite profitable and quite interesting for a company to develop,” Almond says. Reviewing the approaches taken in the 1960s and 70s, Almond and Johnston dismissed the idea of a mega-vaccine of all the 160 rhinovirus serotypes, believing it would be too heavy, too complex and too expensive to make. They wondered instead if there was a tiny part of the structure of viruses that is identical, or “conserved”, across the entire species that could form the basis of what is called a subunit vaccine, an approach that has had success with hepatitis B and the human papilloma virus, or HPV. After comparing the genetic sequences of the different rhinovirus serotypes, the researchers honed in on a particular protein on the virus shell that seemed to recur across many of the serotypes. They took a piece of the conserved shell from a single rhinovirus, number 16, and mixed it with an adjuvant – a stimulus that mimics the danger signals that trigger an immune response – and injected it into mice as a vaccine. The hope was that the immune system would be jolted into recognising the shell protein as an invasive pathogen, conferring immunity against the entire rhinovirus family. In petri dishes, the scientists mixed the immunised mouse blood with three other rhinovirus serotypes, numbers 1, 14 and 29. An immunological response to rhinovirus 1 was likely because its genetic sequence is similar to 16, but serotypes 14 and 29 are unalike. The mice’s white blood cells responded vigorously against all three strains. “Seeing responses against those two [different serotypes] was very encouraging,” Johnston said. This gave hope that the vaccine might protect against the full gamut of rhinoviruses. The scientists gathered a group of respiratory medicine specialists to review the findings. The reviewers agreed that the results looked promising. But just as the scientists were ready to take the vaccine forward, there was a setback at Sanofi. “There was a change of direction, a change of guys at the top,” Almond said. “I took early retirement for different reasons. My boss retired as well.” In 2013, the new management decided that the company’s priorities were elsewhere, handing back to Imperial College the patent that protects the vaccine idea from being developed by other groups. Imperial did not have the resources to develop the vaccine without outside investment. For Johnston, it was frustrating – years of research and toil in the lab had seemed to be finally yielding results. But there was little he could do. The vaccine was shelved. * * * Across the Atlantic, as Imperial began to search for new backers, Martin Moore, a paediatrician at Emory University in Atlanta, was working on a rival approach to the same problem. A specialist in children’s respiratory disease, for the past three years Moore has been working on a solution so straightforward that when he presented the results of his paper, published in Nature Communications last year, his colleagues struggled to accept them. “But if I pushed them, I couldn’t get a good reason for that other than, just: it hadn’t been done before,” he says. Moore first resolved to do something about the common cold in 2014, while on holiday with his family in Florida. Shortly after they had arrived, his son, then a toddler, came down with a cold. “He wanted me to hold him day and night,” Moore said. The pair hunkered down in the hotel room watching movies while the rest of the family went to the beach. “It was frustrating because, as a virologist, we can go into the lab and slice and dice these viruses. But what are we really doing about them?” Moore reviewed the papers from the 1960s and 70s that described the early attempts at a vaccine. He saw that the scientists had demonstrated that if they took one rhinovirus, killed it and then injected it, it would protect people against that same strain. “People actually made decent vaccines against rhinovirus in the 1960s,” Moore told me. What scientists did not account for at the time was that there were so many different serotypes. But where the scientists of the past had seen defeat, Moore saw promise. Why not simply make a vaccine made up of all the rhinoviruses? There was nothing to suggest that it would not work. The problem was not with the science, but with logistics. “I thought, the only thing between us and doing this is manufacturing and economics.” Moore secured funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and applied for samples of the different serotypes from the Centers for Disease Control and the American Type Culture Collection, a biological material repository headquartered in Virginia. He stopped short of calling in all 160 serotypes, reasoning that 50 would be enough to support his hypothesis. After developing the vaccine, composed of these 50 serotypes, Moore tested it on a number of rhesus macaque monkeys. When their blood was later mixed with viruses in petri dishes, there was a strong antibody response to 49 of the 50 serotypes. It was not possible to see whether the vaccinated monkeys themselves would be protected from colds, since human rhinoviruses do not infect monkeys. But the ability to induce antibodies in monkey blood does correlate with protection in people. “Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but I never had a doubt that it would produce antibodies,” Moore told me. “Our paper was about showing it can be done.” There is still a long way to go before Moore’s dream becomes reality. For the vaccine to be tested in a clinical trial, it will need to be made under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions – regulations that companies must adhere to for licensing. Under these regulations, substances need to be kept separate to avoid cross-contamination – a substantial challenge for a vaccine that potentially encompasses 160 serotypes (currently, the largest number of serotypes in a single vaccine, for pneumonia, is 23). For a manufacturing model, Moore is looking to the polio vaccine, since polio and rhinovirus are biologically related. The scale of production would be many times greater, but the basic processes would be alike. In May, Moore’s start-up, Meissa Vaccines, received a $225,000 (£170,000) grant from the NIH for work on rhinovirus. He is taking leave from academia to work on the vaccines. * * * At this point in time, perhaps the biggest barrier to us curing the common cold is commercial. Researchers at universities can only go so far; the most generous grants from bodies such as the UK Medical Research Council are around £2m. It falls to pharmaceutical companies to carry out development beyond the initial proof of concept. “You’re looking at 10-15 years’ work, minimum, with teams of people, and you’re going to spend $1bn (£760m) at least,” Almond told me. Successes have been rare, and there have been spectacular flops. Last year, shares in US firm Novavax fell by 83% after its vaccine for RSV, one of the virus families responsible for colds, failed in a late-stage clinical trial. While it is less common than rhinovirus, RSV can cause great harm and even death in those with weakened immunity, including infants and the elderly. An effective vaccine presented an estimated $1bn opportunity for Novavax in the US alone. Before the results came through, chief executive Stanley Erck said it could be “the largest-selling vaccine in the history of vaccines”. But in the phase III trial of elderly patients, it did little to protect against infection. In the hours after the news broke, Novavax share prices fell from $8.34 to $1.40. Episodes such as this have made pharmaceutical companies wary. Today, vaccines constitute less than 5% of the overall pharmaceutical market, and development is consolidated in a handful of companies: Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson, among a few other smaller players. After the $1bn or so spent on development, there are also manufacturing and distribution costs to consider. There needs to be a return on the initial investment. “You sure as hell can’t do it if there’s not a market at the end, you’re wasting the company’s money, and if you do that too often, you’ll bankrupt the company,” Almond says. “There isn’t a conspiracy out there that says, ‘Let’s not do vaccines so people can get ill and we charge them a lot’, nothing like that. It genuinely isn’t easy.” In August, I called Sebastian Johnston to see if there was any news on his vaccine. He told me that he had just received confirmation of further funding from Apollo Therapeutics, a startup backed by AstraZeneca, GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson. This would allow his lab to test the vaccine on more strains of rhinovirus. Johnston believes that if the vaccine proves to be protective against, say, 20 serotypes, there is a good chance it will protect against all the rhinoviruses. Beginning in October, the research should take about a year and a half. “At that point, I think we’ll be at a stage where we’ll be able to go to major vaccine companies.” If the vaccine were to make it through the clinical trials, and was approved by regulators, it would first be rolled out to high-risk groups – those with asthma and COPD, and perhaps the elderly, as the flu jab is in the UK – and then to the rest of the population. In time, as the proportion of vaccinated individuals reach a critical mass, the viruses would cease to circulate because the chain of infection will be broken – a phenomenon called herd immunity. From where we are today, this scenario is still distant: about 80% of drugs that make it into clinical trials because they worked in mice do not go on to work in humans. Still, for the first time in decades there are now major pharmaceutical companies with rhinovirus vaccine programmes, as well as smaller university research groups like Johnston’s which, through different approaches, are all pursuing the same goal of a cure. Once again, Johnston said, “people are starting to believe it may be possible.” Illustrations by Nathalie Lees • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 10 October 2017.

Since the summer, at least six hospital trusts and two ambulance services have been dealing with allegations of bullying. Two chief executives have been forced out for failing to hit the A&amp;E target. More might follow. Local government is getting another beating over the growing problems around moving older people out of hospital after treatment. The Health Service Journal says the Department of Health is threatening to direct how social care funding is used at councils with the worst records for delaying transfers of care. The bed days lost each month to delayed transfers hover close to 200,000. Most are caused by the NHS, although social care’s total has been growing faster. Hospitals have entire wards of people trying to get home. Lest any chief executives might have forgotten that A&amp;E is a priority, recently appointed chief inspector of hospitals, Prof Ted Baker, has sent everyone a handy guide on what they should be doing. It is important to “know whether each patient has a serious problem”, apparently. More helpfully, Baker also stresses the importance of empathetic leadership and managing staff wellbeing. But does that mean a consultant in A&amp;E who breaches the four-hour wait target after sending exhausted staff home will be supported, or will their chief executive be put in front of the next NHS Improvement firing squad? NHS winters are now barely distinguishable from the summers. Beds once held in reserve are occupied all year. The exceptional has become business as usual. Occupancy rates exceeding 90% – well above the safe operating level – are routine. Experienced nurses employed directly by the hospital are becoming a rarity on some shifts. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, staked his reputation on building a culture of patient safety throughout the NHS. Any progress that can be claimed in the aftermath of the Mid Staffs scandal is now unravelling. It is just as tough in primary care. A record 92 practices shut last year, and around one in eight GP posts are vacant. In community services, the number of district nurses has almost halved in seven years, further impeding the ability of hospitals to get patients home. No wonder there is a morale crisis. While there will be the occasional local victory, the overall picture is of a service that is steadily being degraded. The progress in everything from new models of care to technological innovation cannot outrun the growing difficulties. Each year promises to be tougher than the last. The risk is that as the problems mount, ever more unreasonable demands will further undermine morale and performance. Sacking chief executives won’t help. Riven with insecurity and conflict and overwhelmed by the task of Brexit, the government is attempting to keep the NHS in the shadows of political debate, sustained with improbable plans for more doctors and nurses and a bonanza from flogging spare land. That will not be enough. If the government fails to put in place significant additional funding, starting with next month’s autumn statement, it risks having to deal with an NHS crisis just as the shockwaves from Brexit are hitting the economy. It can deal with the problem now or later, but it cannot avoid it. Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

It is not some magic talking looking glass, but an engraved compact-sized mirror designed by a friend and stuck to the back of her smartphone. Two of the three mantras are wearing away, leaving only “you are clever”. “It’s the most important one, anyway,” says the businesswoman tasked with reinventing Weight Watchers for the digital age, where weight loss apps and Insta-fuelled phenomenons like clean eating are in the ascendancy. “My first Weight Watchers meeting was when I was 14 years old on Long Island, and I went there with my mother,” says Grossman, who has returned 46 years later to run the company. “I’d gained that adolescent weight and wanted to try out for cheerleading … I lost the weight, tried out and made the cheerleading team.” Grossman’s business credentials (she appeared in the Forbes list of the world’s 100 most powerful women after turning around the Home Shopping Network cable channel) and her immaculate blonde coiffure resulted in the New York Times billing her as the second coming of Jean Nidetch, the Brooklyn-born entrepreneur who founded Weight Watchers in the early 1960s. When we meet, Grossman looks more like a cast member of Sex and the City, with a leopardskin jacket and purple bejewelled Louboutins. Grossman arrived at Weight Watchers in July, picking up the baton from Oprah Winfrey, whose purchase of a 10% stake in 2015 triggered a dramatic reappraisal of the brand at a time when it was losing thousands of members. Before Winfrey’s involvement, the writing looked to be on the wall for the 54-year-old brand, with shares changing hands for less than $4 (£3), down from $86 in 2011. But Winfrey’s patronage is helping the company bounce back, with nearly two years of sales growth now under its belt. In its most recent quarterly sales update, subscriber numbers had surged by 20% to 3.5 million, with the firm growing in both the US and the UK, which account for 70% of its sales. “She’s human,” says Grossman of Winfrey’s much-publicised battle with her own weight. And she argues that the fortunes of the company are not tied to the billionaire’s waistline. “Oprah’s involvement is not just about losing weight ... she is a visionary businesswoman. She has had an influence globally on how people are thinking about the brand.” Thanks largely to Winfrey, Weight Watchers shares have regained more than half the value they had lost, making the company worth $2.9bn. But Grossman is tasked with a bigger reinvention as the diet business morphs into the “health and wellness” industry. “The term ‘dieting’ has some negative associations with consumers, because for some people it reminds them of unsuccessful attempts to lose weight,” says Emma Gubisch, an analyst at Leatherhead Food Research. “It also has the connotation that it is something you do for a short time until you’ve achieved your aim, and then you stop or go back to your old lifestyle.” Weight Watchers had been losing members for years as people turned to calorie-counting apps and fitness trackers. The brand, whose recent UK faces have included the actor Patsy Kensit and MasterChef’s Gregg Wallace, had begun to feel dated as new stars emerged, such as Joe Wicks, whose Lean in 15 books are now the biggest-selling diet titles of all time. Grossman says Weight Watchers failed to invest enough in marketing and technology, but insists its holistic package of food plans, advice and community remains powerful in a crowded market where the latest trends include intermittent fasting and the diet drink Skinny Sprinkles. “[Weight Watchers] have been in people’s lives for a long time, so you are not the new shiny penny out there, but you really are the one that works,” says Grossman of the notoriously faddy diet industry. “When people want to lose weight, they get to a point where they are desperate and looking for the new thing that is going to work miracles. But at the end of the day, there is no such thing.” With health and wellness now firmly in vogue, Weight Watchers does not want to be seen as a short-term fix – rather, it is positioning itself as a credo to live by, with its app something users check as frequently as Facebook or Twitter. “We’re looking at the future of experiences and how you personalise it,” says Grossman. “We can inspire people to have healthy habits ... that’s not just about losing 10lbs, but creating a structure you can live within.” The first Weight Watchers cruise, which sailed in May, offers a taste of where the company is headed. The Caribbean trip was a bootcamp designed to shift the pounds, but it took a “wellness” theme, with holidaymakers offered tailored fitness workouts, cooking demonstrations and seminars from experts. “I’ve been 35lbs heavier than I am now and 25lbs thinner than I am now, and both of those times were probably the most miserable times of my life,” says Grossman. “I’m happier now, because it is about being healthy, not weighing yourself.” But the big question is: how is Oprah doing? “She looks great,” reports Grossman. “She was at the Emmys wearing a white jumpsuit – and you have to be confident to do that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/06/georgia-v-wales-world-cup-qualifier-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T18:01:31Z","webTitle":"Georgia 0-1 Wales: World Cup 2018 qualifier – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/06/georgia-v-wales-world-cup-qualifier-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/06/georgia-v-wales-world-cup-qualifier-live","fields":{"headline":"Georgia 0-1 Wales: World Cup 2018 qualifier – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There were some nervy moments, especially in the dying stages, but Wales are delighted as they leave the pitch in Tblisi. It wasn’t an easy game against awkward opponents and there were times when they needed a bit of luck, but a cracking goal from Tom Lawrence means that Wales have a firm grip on second place in Group D now. First place is probably beyond them; Serbia can win the group by beating Austria this evening. But Wales are four points above the Republic of Ireland, who host Moldova in a bit, and can be full of confidence as they turn their thoughts to hosting Martin O’Neill’s side on Monday. That’s all from me. Thanks for reading and emailing about permutations. You can follow the rest of tonight’s action with Gregg Bakowski. Bye. Huge cheers in the away end greet the final whistle. Wales have held on to a huge win, secured by a superb goal from Tom Lawrence. 90 min+1: There will be three added minutes. In the first of those, a brilliant slide-rule pass inside Davies finds Kakabadze in the clear, on the right of the area. Wales have been ripped open. But instead of shooting, he decides to cross and ends up slamming the ball across the face of goal! Wales have lived dangerously in the last 10 minutes. 90 min: Ben Woodburn replaces Tom Lawrence. 89 min: David Khocholava, a big centre-half, has come on for Gvilia in the Robert Huth role. 88 min: Georgia haven’t given up hope yet. Wales are still a bit too open in the middle. But just when Gvilia looks poised to shoot from just inside the area, the ball’s pinched off his toe by Williams, a vital saving challenge. The ball runs loose and Gunter hacks clear in a panic. 86 min: Maybe not. Georgia are drifting. There’s not much of a spark from the home side now. 83 min: Wales have 10 men behind the ball. Are they asking for it? 81 min: Georgia have perked up in the last few minutes. Their threat is increasing, which is perhaps a consequence of Wales pulling back. The visitors are edgy. They know how damaging an equaliser would be and they want to hold what they have. They make their second change. Dave Edwards replace Joe Ledley. 79 min: Georgia pour forward, Wales open in midfield. They’re all over the place and they’re in trouble. Navalovski’s found in oceans of space on the left of the area. He checks back on to his right foot, sizes up the target and shoots. The ball takes a nick off Williams, though, and Hennessey is able to make a crucial save and gather the ball at the second attempt! Hearts were in Welsh mouths there! 76 min: Jambul Jigauri and Davit Shkirtladze replace Kvekveskiri and Kvilitaia respectively. 74 min: Wales make their first change, Hal Robson-Kanu replacing Sam Vokes. The thinking is that Robson-Kanu will start on Monday. 70 min: Lawrence coolly turns a pass inside to Ramsey, cutting the Georgian midfield open and leaving the midfielder to run at the retreating back four. He opens up his body and curls a shot towards the left corner from 20 yards. Loria dives to his left and tries to hold it, but the ball squirms out of his grasp and bounces off Vokes, looking to gobble up the rebound. The ball loops off target, though I think the flag was up for offside against Vokes. 67 min: Ramsey charges through the middle and combines with Vokes, who shuffles the ball back to the midfielder in the area. The ball sits up and Ramsey can’t quite take it with him, forcing him to adjust and backheel it to Davies, who sees his volley charged down by Kverkvelia. 65 min: Wales are deep. Chris Coleman cuts a nervous figure on the touchline. 62 min: Merebashvili’s corner is headed away. Wales aren’t entirely comfortable right now, though. 61 min: An awful pass from Chester gifts possession to Kazaishvili inside Wales’s half. He’s mightily fortunate the Georgian can’t capitalise. He takes too long to work out what he wants to do and Welsh bodies get back. Georgia are encouraged, though, and the dangerous Kakabadze wins a corner with a low cross from the right. 58 min: Wales are after a killer second goal. Allen brilliantly backheels a pass through to Vokes, who’s got space on the left of the area, but he takes too long to sort out his feet and Kakabadze blocks his poked effort. 55 min: Lawrence is booked for catching Kakabadze. 53 min: Lawrence, bursting with confidence after that goal, skips inside from the left, drops a shoulder and tries to find the far corner from 20 yards. The ball bounces not too far wide. 51 min: Now Wales need to be calm. The feeling of relief is immense for them. This is such a precious lead, but don’t be surprised if the nerves continue to jangle as the second half wears on. Georgia have nothing to lose. Apart from, er, the game. What a time and what a way to score your first Wales goal! Tom Lawrence, who had a sighter in the first half, takes a pass with his back to goal, but a clever touch allows him to spin past Kverkvelia and make space for a shot from 25 yards. He strikes it cleanly with his right foot and the ball zooms past Loria and into the right corner! 47 min: Ramsey’s free-kick is poor. Not for the first time. Then, after being astutely found by Allen, his cross is just as bad. 46 min: Wales get the second half underway. Can they get that all-important goal? They need to be clinical. Can they manage it without Gareth Bale? It’s in the balance. Wales have had chances, but they don’t have a goal. The tension rises. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min+1: And one more thing, if Ireland were currently second, they’d be eighth in the standings on 10 points. 45 min: Who loves permutations? “If Wales pick up 4 points from their final two games, they will have 18 points in the group, good for second,” says Grant Miller. “Removing their victories over Moldova, they’d have 12 points. If that were to happen, and if Bosnia lose against Belgium, it would leave Bosnia with a maximum of 11 points in the second-place table, putting Wales in the playoffs.” There, I was right. Sort of. 44 min: The game has lost some flow. Davies’s deep cross out for a throw. 40 min: Ramsey strikes the free-kick straight into the wall. 38 min: Kankava steams into a challenge on Lawrence, taking the midfielder out with a studs-up lunge. He’s lucky not to get a yellow. Lawrence needs some treatment. Kankava, the Georgia captain, apologises to him. 37 min: Georgia launch their first serious attack for a while. Kakabadze finds space on the right and his cross is good. Gvilia rises unchallenged in the middle and looks certain to score, only for his header to bounce just wide of the right post. A lwt-off. 36 min: Allen. Vokes. Lawrence. Shot! Just over the angle of post and bar from the edge of the area! Wales have had chances. 34 min: Gvilia skews a shot wide from 20 yards. “Having spent hours working out the combinations (when I should be w**king) – whilst I’m confident a point would be fine in the bid to finish 2nd in the group, it also pretty much consigns us to be bottom of the 2nd Place teams table even if we do beat Ireland, so wont be enough,” says Ian Truman. “I hope my maths are wrong however.” More importantly, why did you add in the asterisks? 32 min: “Stop digging, a point is no good,” Patrick Rogers says. 30 min: Ramsey ambles down the right, trying to work space for a cross. Eventually he does, wrapping his right foot around the ball and flinging a low centre to the near post. Vokes dashes to the near post, in front of his marker, and his bright flick almost squirms into the far corner. Almost. It goes wide, though. A grimace. Close, but Wales’s search for a breakthrough goes on. 26 min: That said, Bosnia’s next game is at home to Belgium. They could easily lose that. If so, they’d only be able to make 17 points in Group H. 25 min: Okay, maybe a point would be a pretty bad result. Fine. You win. This is open journalism in action. 24 min: “As an Ireland fan I’m wondering if a point really a good result for Wales?” Luke McManus. “Ireland are playing Moldova in Dublin tonight - if we win and Wales draw to Georgia then we are on 16pts and Wales are on 15pts leaving us only needing a draw from the match in Cardiff.” Absolutely, but Wales have home advantage on Monday night. You could even argue that only needing a point at home could work against them. What if it makes them play too safe? 22 min: Kankava turns adroitly in the middle, looks up and sprays a very interesting pass over the centre of the Wales defence. Kazaishvili is bursting forward from midfield, the volume rises, but Williams turns and acrobatically hooks the ball away just in time. Otherwise the Georgian No10 would have been through on goal. Consider that a warning. 19 min: Ramsey’s cross from the right is headed back across goal by Vokes, but no one in a red shirt can make the most of it in the middke. Moments later, Wales hoick another cross into the Georgia area, but Loria claims it. 17 min: Wales knock the thing about themselves, gradually moving up the pitch. The pitch is a little awkward at times, forcing everyone to be sure of their touch. Wales manage to creep into the final third, though, and they look like they’re in business as Vokes finds Allen on the edge of the area. The ball squirts up sharply, but the midfielder manages to hook a ball to the unmarked King on the edge of the area. He watches it drop carefully before aiming a volley towards the far corner. He doesn’t quite catch it properly, hitting it into the ground, and Loria dives to his right to push it to safety. 16 min: Wales enjoy a handy spell of possession, lifting mounting pressure from the hosts. 13 min: Kakabadze wins a corner with a nice piece of skill on the right. Georgia are pushing. They look bright and positive. They want to win this, even though they’ve no chance of qualifying, and they’re capable of pulling it off. Wales need to have their wits about them. 11 min: Navalovski takes a crossfield pass from right to left on his chest before stroking a ball into the middle. The covering Ledley hurriedly puts it behind for a corner. Chester heads it away. 10 min: Wales aren’t going to take unnecessary risks at this point. Their approach is conservative and rightly so. They don’t have to be gung-ho. A point wouldn’t be the worst thing to take back to Cardiff before the visit of Ireland. 7 min: Kakabadze almost scoots on to a pass down the right, but it’s too heavy, the ball running out of play. Georgia exerted some pressure there, but Wales did enough to keep them at arm’s length. It might even have been two arms, that’s how comfortable they looked. 3 min: Lawrence bundles inside from the left, coping well with a bobble, and slides a pass through to Ramsey, who’s made a Ljungberg-esque run in from the right. Ramsey takes the ball in his stride and sets himself for a shot. He’s got a clear sight of goal from 18 yards, but he’s holding his head in his hands after pulling it just wide of the left post. A wonderful chance goes begging. 2 min: King whips a cross into the middle from the right. Loria punches it away. Peep! Off we go! Georgia, all in white, get the game underway, kicking from right to left in the first half. They’re on the attack straight away, but Kvilitaia can’t latch on to a through ball before it runs out of play. Before we begin, a minute’s silence in memory of Shota Maminashvili, a Georgian goalkeeper who recently passed away at the age of 31. It’s impeccably observed. Here come the teams. We’ll have the anthems, then it’ll be time for some football. I watched England last night. This has to be better. If you’re Welsh, what happens if you see this? Joe Ledley is the sole change for Wales. He’s in for Gareth Bale. Georgia: Loria; Kakabadze, Kverkvelia, Kashia, Navalovski; Merebashvili, Kankava, Kvekveskiri, Gvilia, Kazaishvili; Kvilitaia. Subs: Makaridze, Lobjanidze, Khocholava, Kiteishvili, Dvalishvili, Chanturia, Dvali, Hufnagel, Skhirtladze, Aburjania, Jigauri, Kvaskhvadze. Wales: Hennessey; Gunter, Williams, Chester, Davies; King, Allen, Ledley; Ramsey, Lawrence; Vokes. Subs: Maxwell, Taylor, Bradshaw, Brooks, Edwards, Lockyer, Jonathan Williams, Woodburn, Ampadu, Hedges, Robson-Kanu, Ward. Referee: Jesus Gil Manzano (Spain). Hello. If their attempts at reaching a first World Cup finals since 1958 have taught Wales anything, it’s not to get too far ahead of themselves, lest their hopes and dreams come thudding straight back at them like a last-minute Paul Bodin penalty. His team might have been semi-finalists at last year’s Euros, but Chris Coleman doesn’t mind the boredom of taking each game as it comes. Four points from their final two matches in Group D, that’s all Wales need to secure their play-off spot, an exciting thought. But Wales aren’t looking that far forward yet. They aren’t even thinking about what promises to be a dramatic occasion when the Republic of Ireland visit Cardiff on Monday night. Not when they’ve got to confront Georgia in Tblisi first. It won’t be easy for Wales this evening - and not just because they’re missing the injured Gareth Bale, whose absence will be keenly felt even it presents Aaron Ramsey with an opportunity to step up to the plate. As Coleman’s acknowledged, Georgia are better than their Fifa ranking of 103 in the world. “They’ve got imagination, they create chances and they play risk football,” the Wales manager said yesterday, thinking back to that tricky 1-1 home draw with Georgia last year. Ireland have already been held in Tblisi and the threat posed to Welsh qualification hopes by Kakhaber Tskhadadze’s men should not be taken lightly. Falter here and Wales will be newly vulnerable; Ireland, a point back in third place, expect to beat Moldova at home later in the evening. Tense times.

The church bell rang eight or maybe nine; there was a soughing through the limes. Suddenly, I felt a tiny sonic boom and the draught of a bat’s wing close to my ear. It was like a tap on the shoulder, not a shock so much as a greeting but, all the same, a jolting from thoughts about one world into another, where unseen lives almost touch. Bats cut through the orange pool from surprising directions; they were making elliptical orbits that seemed erratic when all I could see was their illuminated strike at flies and moths attracted to a fatal beauty. On Shrewsbury railway station the other morning I watched garden orb weaver spiders centre on their webs around the fluorescent strips above the platforms. They were hunting for insects, too, but had spun reflective gossamer into gardens of light to trap them. Further up the lane there were stars out above tall pines by the priory. Almost invisible bats zipped down the tunnel made by overhanging hazel, and rising above high ground in the east the moon was full. Seen through the shaggy boughs of an old larch or centred between trees like a spider in a web, the moon had the strange allure that moths and bats and wanderers know. Clouds drifted across the lunar dial, and its halo coloured like a bruise. This first full moon in October is the harvest moon, the closest it has been to the autumn equinox in the northern hemisphere since 2009. The next full moon this close to the equinox will be in 2020. Because of the slightly tilted orbit the harvest moon appears brighter, and the nights around it are often calmer. The old rhythms are out of kilter and the harvest has passed; we may need to rename this moon. Above, for a moment before the clouds thickened, the moon spun its own light garden and all who wandered abroad were enthralled.

Until the terrible events of 14 June, Kensington Aldridge academy (KAA) was a pristine £26m school with state-of-the-art facilities and a bold new ethos. Its location at the foot of Grenfell Tower tied its fortunes to the disaster, which left an estimated 80 people dead. Today, the original building is a ghost school. It escaped serious damage and has remained out of bounds since the fire. But KAA’s 960 pupils now have a new home just over a mile away in the neighbouring borough of Hammersmith and Fulham – a temporary school created out of portable, prefabricated buildings in just nine weeks. The new school, known as KAA2, is squeezed into a site on the edge of an area of open land known locally as the Scrubs. There are two other schools within a stone’s throw and Wormwood Scrubs prison is across the nearby park, which houses the Linford Christie outdoor sports centre and a model aircraft runway. More than 200 workers from Portakabin and the construction company Mace worked from dawn till dusk – and right through the night in the final weeks of the project – in order for the school to be ready for pupils on 18 September. Just over a fortnight later, on a windy Thursday morning, KAA2 seems much like any other school. In reception, there are children who feel poorly and want to go home. In the playground, there is the familiar volume of chatter from pupils enjoying their morning break. In the classrooms, there are the usual lessons and assessments and laughter. There are none of the soaring atriums or capacious theatres that are a feature of many modern academies. In the series of Portakabins, there are, however, eight science labs and two design and technology workshops; there’s a food technology room, two music rooms, two IT suites with 30 computers in each, two libraries and two studios (one for drama and one for dance). “It fully replicates the curriculum structure of the original school,” says KAA’s principal, David Benson. “We made a commitment to parents and students about the courses we were going to offer and the quality of the teaching, and we’ve honoured the commitment.” Many in the school community were personally affected by the fire: four KAA pupils and a fifth who had recently left the school died. But the academy reopened just 48 hours later, with pupils receiving lessons for the final weeks of the summer term in two neighbouring schools. More remarkably, even as the fire continued to burn through the tower, 56 KAA students turned up on the morning of 14 June to sit their AS-level maths exam in a hastily rearranged exam hall. “Quite quickly after the fire our instincts were: we need to bring the students together so we can address what’s happened, so we can start to lift their spirits and refocus them on their academic ambitions,” says Benson. The school’s impressive AS-level results were published in August. KAA’s first ever set of national exams, they put the school in the top 10% for “value added”, with students achieving on average a grade higher than national expectations. Last month, at the end of the summer holidays, the whole school was reunited, first with a series of residential courses outside London to give contractors time to complete construction, and finally in their new home. It was an emotional and anxious moment, but Benson and his team are delighted with the new school and the students are settling in well. “It’s the fastest school ever built,” Benson says with pride. “It’s helping the students to move forward and be positive, and move beyond what’s happened.” The building subtly features the same shade of sea green that dominates the palette of colours at the original site; the school motto, “Intrepidus” (undaunted), decorates the walls, and illustrations and quotations echo those at the old building. There are the same wall displays and furniture taken from the original site. “Today, it looks and feels like their school,” says Benson. He hasn’t been back to the old building yet, but other teachers have, to collect equipment and help move furniture. “It was like moving house, but 100 times over,” says Benson. “Staff describe it as being quite emotional being back in.” He misses the original site, which opened in 2014. “It’s a fabulous learning facility. It’s beautiful. It’s bright. It’s open. We are very privileged to have it. We do miss it, but we are going back in a year … Everyone understands that being there at the moment would not be the right thing because it’s so close to the tower. Until the tower has been wrapped and all the outdoor space has been restored, it’s just not suitable for us to be there.” A few parents considered a new start for their children who had lost close friends, but in the end not a single student or member of staff left, and all the new year 7s and sixth formers who had signed up for the school before disaster struck honoured their commitment. Olivia Boyle, a history teacher, had accepted a new job at KAA and was about to leave her old school when she saw the events unfolding at Grenfell Tower. “At first it was a sense of disbelief. Then it was the scale of it, the realisation of the extent and how it impacted on the community.” She never for a moment thought of pulling out and started alongside pupils in the new school last month. “The overwhelming majority of kids were happy to come back to school after the summer,” says Benson. “They were optimistic about the year ahead. They were not talking about the fire. They were talking about normal day-to-day things. The atmosphere in school is upbeat and positive. It’s helped by not being immediately next to the tower.” Therapy and counselling are available from Place2Be and two new full-time, in-house counsellors. “The community will be feeling the impact of Grenfell for a very long time, but it’s not something that should feature in normal conversations in school,” Benson says. To get the school year off to a good start, 800 students went on residential visits around the country – the entire sixth form decamped to two Oxford colleges, Hertford and Queen’s, for a week. A video has been made of the students’ experience, in which they are filmed taking lessons, eating dinner and relaxing in the rather grand surroundings. Many are overwhelmed by the beauty of the place, which seems a million miles from the tragedy of Grenfell Tower. “It’s been like a breath of fresh air,” one teenager enthuses. “It makes you feel smarter,” says another. Back in west London, in an English A-level class studying LP Hartley, Abdullahi Ali, 17, says the experience has inspired him to apply to Oxford to study modern languages. “It was nice to come back together like that. It was a really good way to start the year.” On his temporary school, he says: “I don’t think the building matters. It’s the education and teaching that matter.” Titilayo Bamgbose, the head girl, adds: “Everyone was nervous coming back. It was like coming to a whole new school. Then you start your lessons and it’s all normal.” She admits, however, “I miss my locker.” In a neighbouring classroom, Harry Robbins is studying for A-level geography. “We’ve got just on with things,” he says. “We’re not dwelling on the past. It’s showing that the school has resilience. We’ve come together and pushed forward.” Back at the old site on Silchester Road, the building is intact but the classrooms are empty, as is the school reception, apart from a few packing crates. The playground, where debris fell from the burning tower, is full of activity as forensic teams clad in protective suits continue their investigations. The walls and railings around the area are still decorated with photos of the missing and the dead. There are memorials and posters urging visitors to show respect and not take photographs; there are yellow ribbons and soft toys and an unavoidable sense of enormous sadness. The tower is expected to be finally covered and the area made safe by March next year, but KAA will wait until next September to move back. “It will be good to be home,” says Benson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/oct/06/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-6-october","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T06:55:43Z","webTitle":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 6 October","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/06/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-6-october","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/06/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-6-october","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 6 October","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m not writing my usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

About 7.2 million viewers watched the final episode of the second series on Tuesday night to see a warring ex-couple, two near suicides, a blatant disregard for the Hippocratic oath, and a traumatised teenage son. The BBC1 show has become a bit of a phenomenon, as its creator might have hoped. Long before the first series aired in 2015, he said: “I love popular stuff, those moments when there’s a big drama or a TV show everyone is talking about, because it feels like we have got a community.” Bartlett has spent most of his career writing for the stage. “Because he comes from the theatre, I think he understands collaboration,” says Bertie Carvel, who played Doctor Foster’s cheating husband, Simon Foster. “I’ve really enjoyed that. He really listens to other people’s point of view about storytelling. At the same time, he’s got a very firm grip of his vision. He’s of a fresh set [of writers] who are trying to apply principles they’ve learned in the theatre to making television. He’s obviously really excited about being part of the wider conversation that television can tap into because of its audience. I think with Doctor Foster he’s shown that. He’s writing for a popular audience but then challenging that audience’s expectations.” Bartlett has said there is “potential” for a third series of Doctor Foster. But before that comes an ITV drama, Trauma, about a grieving father and a hospital surgeon he believes should have saved his son. Then there is Press, a BBC drama, about newspapers and ethics. On stage, his play Albion is about to open at the Almeida theatre in London, with previews starting next week. “He’s so prolific,” says Rupert Goold, the Almeida’s artistic director, who is rehearsing the play he thought Bartlett would be unable to deliver. “I kept holding the spot open, going, ‘We have got this slot but you’re not going to have time, you’re doing all these TV shows.’ He said, ‘Probably not, but how long can you hold it open for?’” The play arrived a week before the deadline. This is the third Bartlett play Goold has directed, following Earthquakes in London, and King Charles III (later adapted for TV), about Charles – now king – sparking a constitutional crisis. Goold also commissioned Bartlett to write and direct a modern staging of the Greek tragedy, Medea, which sowed the germ of the idea for Doctor Foster. What marks him out, says Goold, is “he writes brilliantly for women – he writes properly complex, three-dimensional [women], all different ages. And I think he also has this incredible humanism. His plays are really full of heart and soul. A part of that is he never, or very rarely, judges the characters.” Goold says Bartlett is a political playwright, and is “very interested in form”. But what really interests him is “family, probably, like all great writers. I think all three plays I’ve done with him are all really plays about family. He’s become a father since I’ve known him so I think that’s probably shaped it a bit.” Bartlett grew up in Oxfordshire. His mother was a headteacher and his father a psychologist. “I grew up with [my father] saying, ‘Look how that person’s behaving. Do you think there’s a reason behind that?’” Bartlett has said. He went to the private Abingdon school, then to Leeds University where he studied English and theatre studies. “He had such a strong sense of how drama works, practically and structurally, and then how those structures resonate emotionally and politically,” says Bridget Escolme, now a reader in drama at Queen Mary University of London, who taught him at Leeds. “I remember him as a really rare mix of confident and unassuming.” He originally wanted to be a director but switched to writing. After university, he joined the Royal Court theatre in London’s young writers programme. “I remember him being thoughtful and considered, and there was a kind of caution to him in the room,” says Simon Stephens, the playwright who was one of Bartlett’s tutors. “He wasn’t a boastful student – he didn’t swagger in with drafts of his scripts in hand. He sat and listened. I remember conversations with him where at first I’d think this is quite a quiet, shy, intelligent man and then the writing increasingly would have a real verve and swagger.” He remembers them talking about one play Bartlett had written, a fantasy of Prince William who escapes to an island. Young writers at the Royal Court at the time, he says, “would tend to write either plays set in council houses or middle-class comedies of manners. Nobody had ever written about Prince William before, and it was imaginative, deeply funny and formally daring. He has a level of ambition, not in him as a person, but in him as a writer that I find really inspiring.” The playwright Duncan Macmillan was also on the course, and he and Bartlett became good friends. “He was never that interested in responding to trends in new writing or the theatre world,’ he says. “He knew what his interests and obsessions were, and was driven to pursue his very particular agenda.” They were both part of a group of young writers who called themselves The Apathists and put on new plays every month. “It was an opportunity to test our practice and each other’s practice and provoke each other to push our work in different directions and try things out. We had the absolute right to fail and try something out, and god did we fail. And at the same time, some magic really came out of it.” One of them, he says, was Bartlett’s play Contractions, which Macmillan directed for its US premiere in 2013. “I’ve always wondered if he enjoys being a bit of a provocateur,” says Macmillan. Bartlett’s work is never “a typically comforting leftwing piece of propaganda, it was always a little more complicated than that. You get plays like Contractions, about how capitalism bulldozes humanity, which is a far leftwing idea, but then you get other plays which implicate us who politically lean that way. He attacks apathy. No one gets out of his plays unscathed, and that includes himself. Primarily he’s writing about his own attitudes, ideas, weaknesses, strengths.” Bartlett’s first professional play was Not Talking, commissioned for radio in 2006 when he was 25 years old. His first staged play was My Child at the Royal Court in 2007 and from there he was off – within a few years, he’d written numerous plays, including those staged at the National (Earthquakes in London, and 13) and had also moved into television (The Town, a crime drama for ITV in 2012). His work has tackled big themes: climate change, capitalism, state surveillance, the role of the monarchy, and – in the case of his new play Albion – nationalism and a post-Brexit landscape. But don’t call him a state-of-the-nation writer. “That implies my only focus is to dissect the state of us politically and socially,” he has said. “But the state of my emotions is as important to me.” The persona of a writer “can be imbued with all kinds of romantic nonsense”, says Stephens. The picture that emerges of Bartlett is of a well-liked, disciplined writer, not someone beset by demons. “He approaches his work with a careful rigour and a determined patience,” remembers Stephens. “Again, you get this great counterpoint – someone who is taking it seriously and doing the job, but is producing plays which are adventurous and audacious. I think that’s just fucking brilliant.” Potted profile Born October 1980 Career Started at the Royal Court theatre, with My Child (2007). Earthquakes in London was at the National Theatre in 2010, followed by the play 13. In 2011, he was writer in residence at the National. He wrote and directed a version of Medea in 2012. Other plays include Cock, Bull, and Love Love Love. His 2014 play King Charles III won an Olivier award for best new play, and was adapted for TV. His first TV drama was The Town for ITV, followed by Doctor Foster for BBC1 and an episode of Doctor Who. He says “If people are going to spend a night out at the theatre they don’t just want ‘good’ – we can watch box sets for that – they want it to be totally remarkable.” They say “I think that he’s led the way in the last few years in terms of formal invention. He’s throwing down the gauntlet to a lot of playwrights in this country in terms of the way you tell stories.” – James Grieve, director"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/06/indias-under-17s-kick-off-first-ever-football-world-cup-match","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T12:02:44Z","webTitle":"India's under-17s kick off first ever football World Cup match","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/indias-under-17s-kick-off-first-ever-football-world-cup-match","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/06/indias-under-17s-kick-off-first-ever-football-world-cup-match","fields":{"headline":"India's under-17s kick off first ever football World Cup match","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Indian football made history on Friday when its under-17 team lined up against the US in the country’s first football World Cup match. Footballers from the remote north-east, the sons of rickshaw drivers and a player who grew up in “utmost poverty” are part of the national squad for the under-17 World Cup finals, which are being held in six Indian cities. India’s population of 1.2 billion has produced world-beating cricket and hockey teams but never a football side good enough to qualify for the World Cup finals at any level. India’s men’s team is currently ranked 107th in the world. The government has invested 1.2bn rupees (£14m) to renovate stadiums in Delhi, Kolkata, Kochi and other host cities hoping to showcase the country as a venue for major sporting events. India lost to the US 0-3 but the national team’s coach, Portugal’s Luís Norton de Matos, had been careful to temper expectation in the lead up to the game, calling the World Cup debut the “first step for the future” of Indian football. “There is a gap between India and the other teams, say from Europe and South America,” de Matos told local media last month. “So, I don’t think much about the results and chances but I know my players will give their best. I see this World Cup as a step forward for the future ... India can build on this experience.” India’s sporting megastars have rallied around the national team, including the cricket captain, Virat Kohli, who posted a video message to his 18.8 million Twitter followers to “back the blue”. Group matches against Colombia and two-time champions Ghana await the Indian team. Nigeria, which won the last two titles, did not qualify, leaving Brazil, Spain, the US and Mali as favourites. Environmental groups, including Greenpeace India, have warned that air pollution in the six host cities, especially in the capital, Delhi, exceed international safe levels and could affect the health of players. Levels of coarse, PM10 pollutants in Delhi in October can reach around 304 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), more than six times the level the European Union considers safe. In Kochi, where the air is cleanest, levels exceed 50µg/m3. Average levels of the pollutants during the 2008 Beijing Olympics were about 82µg/m3, while Paris took emergency measures, including traffic restrictions, in December last year when levels reached 146µg/m3. Adults are advised to reduce physical exertion when PM10 levels exceed 100µg/m3 to reduce associated health risks including the aggravation of asthma and other respiratory conditions. A 2015 study of the impact of toxic particulate matter on Germany’s Bundesliga players found player performance declined “substantially” when coarse pollutants exceeded EU limits, especially in men over 30. The performances of players under 21 were shown not to be affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/06/chatterbox-the-end","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T08:06:06Z","webTitle":"Chatterbox: The End","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/06/chatterbox-the-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/06/chatterbox-the-end","fields":{"headline":"Chatterbox: The End","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Well, that was fun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/06/someone-like-you-winner-euromillions-jackpot-richer-than-adele","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T08:11:02Z","webTitle":"Someone like you: winner of £168m EuroMillions jackpot will be richer than Adele","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/06/someone-like-you-winner-euromillions-jackpot-richer-than-adele","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/06/someone-like-you-winner-euromillions-jackpot-richer-than-adele","fields":{"headline":"Someone like you: winner of £168m EuroMillions jackpot will be richer than Adele","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A very, very lucky person could be propelled to 671st place on Britain’s rich list – for the price of a £2.50 lottery ticket. At £168m, Friday night’s National Lottery draw is the biggest-ever jackpot to be offered in the UK. A single winner would become richer than the chef Jamie Oliver, the multiple F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton and the singer Adele. The record-breaking prize has accumulated after no player in Europe managed to match all five numbers and two lucky stars in Tuesday’s £167m draw. According to the competition’s rules, the prize fund can go no higher than €190m – £168m at Friday’s exchange rate – where it will remain for four more draws. If nobody matches all seven numbers on the fifth, the prize money will roll down to the next tier of winners where there is at least one winner, most likely those who match five numbers and a single lucky star. But if a single ticket scoops the top prize – at odds of about 140m to one, according to the EuroMillions website – it would create the UK and Europe’s biggest ever winner. Players have been urged to buy their tickets early, with a 200% boost in sales expected for the draw. Camelot estimates that more than 26,000 tickets could be sold every minute in the hour before the draw closes at 7.30pm. “The extraordinary sum would be life-changing whether won by an individual or syndicate, and we have plenty of champagne on ice ready to celebrate,” said Andy Carter, the National Lottery’s senior winners’ adviser. “It would enable them to transform their life, as well as the lives of their friends and family, and we are ready to support them from the moment they claim.” The current record holders are Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, Scotland, who won £161m in 2011.

The federal Greens leader, Richard di Natale, will launch their campaign on Saturday with a speech declaring the state has a democratic deficit because of lobbying and political connections, with “a revolving door between politicians, their staff and the companies that profit from government decisions”. Di Natale will declare that “the rules in Queensland are rigged”. The Greens leader will criticise the practice of political staff from the major parties going on to work as corporate lobbyists, and point out that Adani’s lobbyists in Queensland, Next Level Strategic Services, also “act for property developers, gambling firms and Broadspectrum – the company running Manus and Nauru detention centres”. Federal leaders from all parties have been highly attentive to Queensland in recent months, preparing the ground for when the Labor premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, fires the starting gun. One Nation is likely to be the kingmaker, with neither Labor nor the LNP guaranteed to win the 47 seats required for power in the unicameral parliament. The Greens will also be in fierce competition with Labor for inner Brisbane seats. The Adani project provides a major point of difference between the two parties, and one the Greens will run hard on, as they have done in Melbourne. Di Natale on Saturday will zero in on Labor’s assistance for the project. “Despite Queensland Labor’s election promise not to give any public money to Adani, they ultimately were able to secure a loan from the Queensland government so Adani don’t have to pay coal royalties that would go towards vital public infrastructure, schools and hospitals.” The Greens leader will say the company was assisted in securing support from the state government by lobbyists, who were in frequent contact with the state government in the lead up to the royalties decision. “We still don’t know what is in this contract, because the Palaszczuk government refuses to release it,” the text of Di Natale’s speech says. “But what we do know through Queensland’s lobbyist contact register is that Next Level lobbyists were in contact with the premier’s office and her chief of staff every single day in the lead-up to the royalties announcement.” The Queensland lobbyists contact register shows Next Level had daily contact with senior members of the Queensland government from 25 May to 30 May, when the final decision was made. “We also know that up until that point the premier had had only 10 appointments with lobbyists – six of them were with Adani’s handlers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/07/student-sexual-assault-harassment-survey-not-representative","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Student sexual assault and harassment survey 'not representative'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/07/student-sexual-assault-harassment-survey-not-representative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/07/student-sexual-assault-harassment-survey-not-representative","fields":{"headline":"Student sexual assault and harassment survey 'not representative'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A survey of students’ experiences of sexual assault and harassment commissioned by the Australian Human Rights Commission had too low a response rate to be considered representative of all students, an independent evaluation has found. Experts in survey design agreed, saying that the survey had “failed miserably” in getting a qualitative account of the size of the problem. The survey was conducted in 2016 and formed part of the commission’s Change The Course report, which included submissions from students who had experienced or witnessed sexual assault and harassment, and an evaluation of the complaints procedures at Australian universities. It produced the headline figure that 51% of students were sexually harassed in 2016 and one in 10 female university students had been sexually assaulted in the previous two years. The survey was emailed to a selected sample of up to 10,000 students at each of Australia’s 39 universities, who were invited to complete the survey online. Of those who received the survey, 31,000 responded. A review by Deakin University academic and market research expert David Bednall found that the design of the survey and of the sample group was robust, but the low response rate, which averaged just under 10% across all universities was “less than satisfactory”. “Because of the possibility that the small percentage of people who responded to the survey are more likely to do so because of their observation of or being a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault, great care needs to be taken in projecting the survey numbers to the population of students, especially for males,” Bednall wrote. “The commission should consider just reporting the sample results as they stand and noting that it could be problematic projecting them to the population.” However, Bednall added that his concern about the ability of the survey results to be representative “does not change the fact that in each university across Australia many recent instances of sexual harassment and sexual assault were identified”. “This in itself provides sufficient justification for universities to take action to minimise the risk to its students, as part of their duty of care,” he said. The review was conducted in May, before the release of the AHRC report in August, and was released to Melbourne University law professor Jeremy Gans following a freedom of information request. Gans then made it public. The survey was criticised by sexual assault advocates before the release of the AHRC report for potentially being traumatic for survivors, and the results were subsequently criticised by commentators who felt it had overstated the prevalence of campus sexual assault. Bednall’s analysis found that there was a positive association between men who completed the survey and those who reported experiencing or witnessing sexual assault and harassment, which he said could be interpreted to mean that if those results were projected onto the whole population of male Australian university students they would overestimate the experience of sexual harassment or assault. It found no such association in the responses of female students. The AHRC report included a disclaimer warning that survey results were derived from a group of people who were “motivated to respond” and “may not necessarily be representative of the entire university student population”. It included a specific warning that projections made about the experiences of male students must be interpreted with caution and could overestimate experiences in the male population. Experts in survey design and qualitative research agreed with Bednall’s assessment but were stronger in their criticism, saying the survey could not be relied upon as an accurate representation of the experiences of all university students. Professor Mark Wooden from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, who produces the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, said it would be “very difficult” to place any faith in the accuracy of the figures once they were extrapolated to the broader student population. Any such extrapolations would be “very, very, very dubious”, he said. “If the purpose of this survey was to bring this to the attention of university leaders than I think they have achieved it,” Wooden told Guardian Australia. “But if their goal was to get a qualitative account of the size of the problem, then they have failed miserably.” Wooden said an online survey, distributed with no incentive to encourage people to fill it out apart from their own interest in the problem, was lucky to even get a 10% response rate. He said the low response rate meant the results could not be taken to be representative. “If you want to get a handle on the size of the problem by this survey then you have failed miserably, because it hasn’t done that,” he said. Social researcher Eva Cox agreed the results were not representative, but said anyone arguing over methodology was missing the point. “In a very large survey, a lot of women and a slightly surprisingly high proportion of men have said that they were sexually assaulted,” Cox said. “We can sit around forever arguing about whether the statistics are accurate or inaccurate, but I think the important part of the survey is that a lot of people have said they were sexually assaulted and universities need to do something about it.” Cox said that even if the AHRC report only considered the survey responses as raw figures, they would still be alarmingly high. Unlike Wooden, who said the results could be over-representative, she suggested the survey figures were likely to under-represent experiences of sexual assault or harassment, because victims were often unwilling to report, or might not recognise what happened as abuse or harassment. The AHRC report made a number of recommendations for culture and policy change at universities, all of which were adopted by Universities Australia. One was that a national student survey on sexual assault and sexual harassment be completed every three years to monitor the situation. Cox said that would be a waste of money and that a smaller survey on attitudes toward sexual assault and harassment would serve the same purpose with fewer problems. “It’s a very expensive exercise that does not need to be repeated on that sort of basis,” she said. The AHRC has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/07/nick-xenophon-and-the-political-art-of-keeping-everyone-guessing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T21:44:10Z","webTitle":"Nick Xenophon and the political art of keeping everyone guessing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/07/nick-xenophon-and-the-political-art-of-keeping-everyone-guessing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/07/nick-xenophon-and-the-political-art-of-keeping-everyone-guessing","fields":{"headline":"Nick Xenophon and the political art of keeping everyone guessing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The stuntman. The anti-politician politician. The no-pokies crusader. Mr X. Crossbench whisperer. Senate powerbroker. Nick Xenophon has gone by many names during his two decades in politics. Now, with the announcement he is resigning from the federal Senate to head back to South Australian state politics, Xenophon has taken the first steps towards another potential line to his repertoire – premier. Always an intriguing combination of stunts and the serious, Xenophon launched into politics and straight into a powerbroker position, an assignment he has never given up. He is still standing while those who begrudgingly needed his support have fallen as he continues to wheel and deal with all and sundry, chalking up small wins and wiping away the missed opportunities with the Next Big Thing. Listening to Xenophon speak is like watching a word cloud become sentient. He is always three steps ahead in any conversation, often saying why he can’t talk while still in the midst of greetings. His buzzing phone is so ubiquitous, its silence would be noted. But it has always been this way. Xenophon didn’t so much launch into politics as bend it to suit him, learning the power of personality after dabbling in party politics in university. He eventually leveraged his knowledge of the political sphere to turn Nick Xenophon: the crusader into a platform, standing as an Independent for the South Australian Legislative Council in 1997. He ran promising to cut down on pokies and won just 2.86% of the vote. But thanks to what he would later call an “improbable series” of preference deals, he was boosted over the line and, given the precarious state of the Olsen Liberal government, became an immediate power player. A commercial lawyer by trade, specialising in personal injury, Xenophon knew how to watch for which way the wind was blowing, and how it could help him play the game. But every master must learn somewhere, and for Xenophon, the privatisation of the Electricity Trust of South Australia in 1999 proved a steep learning curve. He voted with two disgruntled Labor MPs, Trevor Crothers and Terry Cameron, to keep the bill alive for a second reading, before voting against the bill itself. But it didn’t matter – Crothers and Cameron voted with the Liberal government for the sale and, as recently as last year, Xenophon was having to clarify his actions. The experience left those in state politics wary of trusting him. Xenophon insisted, and still does, that he is guided by what is best for his constituents and the state at large. No one ever seems to know for sure which way he will jump until the votes are being counted, but they can be sure Xenophon will be at the forefront of the debate, attracted to the cameras as if by a magnet, knowing they hold the key to his continued prosperity. While in the South Australian parliament the first time, Xenophon perfected the art of the stunt, ensuring the first Independent in decades commanded the front pages and a spot in the local news bulletins, in the process winning hearts and minds. In his 11 or so years in the SA legislative council, he paraded a goat to show he was not “kidding around” while a cow was used as a surrogate for state governments’ love of the gambling tax “cash cow”. He also rode a model train to demonstrate the “gravy train” of politicians’ perks. By 2006, despite the frustrations of the major parties, Xenophon had made a career as a political gadfly, winning 20.5% of the vote. The next year, he stood in front of a giraffe at the Adelaide Zoo to announce he was “sticking my neck out” and running for a seat in the federal Senate, walking a mule along Adelaide’s Rundle Mall to represent his stubbornness as the federal election campaign wound down. He won just under 15% of the vote and a seat at the table for the first Rudd government, which needed two Senate crossbenchers to get its legislation through. As Brian Harradine had before him, Xenophon hit the ground running and remained a bugbear to successive governments. The stunts continued but were more low key, a sideshow to governments on tenterhooks wondering which way he would go – there were pajamas in the halls of the Senate during a late night sitting, a set of Australian-made crockery for Parliament House, doormats and cakes to celebrate the government’s birthday and broken promises. But in the backrooms, he helped win protections for whistleblowers, an issue which almost brought him to tears, accountability for the Murray-Darling water plan, and one-off payments for low-income households. He sent the government back to the drawing board on many issues, including data retention and higher education reforms. Wherever a deal went, criticism followed, with “I did my best” becoming almost a mantra. There have been splits within his own camp – both his 2006 state parliament running mate Ann Bressington and, more recently, John Darley have abandoned him. But despite the Canberra grumbles Xenophon continues to win over voters. The Nick Xenophon Team was announced in time for the 2016 election, winning 21.7% of the South Australian vote – slightly down on his vote at the previous election – but with reduced double dissolution quotas, enough for another two Senate candidates to join him, and to win a lower house seat. Earlier this year, the state arm was announced as SA Best. Xenophon’s latest rabbit was to announce he plans to resign from the Senate and run in the state seat of Hartley. Who will take his place depends on the outcome of the high court challenge to his eligibility to have stood in the Senate, given his recent discovery he has dual citizenship. Xenophon has already moved on, announcing his plans without animals, but with plenty of surprise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/only-science-can-solve-the-intriguing-stick-insect-mystery","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T05:56:37Z","webTitle":"Only science can solve the intriguing stick insect mystery | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/only-science-can-solve-the-intriguing-stick-insect-mystery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/only-science-can-solve-the-intriguing-stick-insect-mystery","fields":{"headline":"Only science can solve the intriguing stick insect mystery","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/06/privacy-concerns-voiced-over-photo-database-link-to-real-time-surveillance","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T07:09:26Z","webTitle":"Privacy concerns voiced over photo database link to real-time surveillance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/06/privacy-concerns-voiced-over-photo-database-link-to-real-time-surveillance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/06/privacy-concerns-voiced-over-photo-database-link-to-real-time-surveillance","fields":{"headline":"Privacy concerns voiced over photo database link to real-time surveillance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Queensland’s privacy commissioner has said any proposal to link a national database of photographs to public surveillance in real time could open the door to “more scary surveillance”. The commissioner, Philip Green, praised the federal Attorney General Department’s handling of moves towards a new national regime around access to driver licence data, including photos, which he said would enhance privacy by deterring identity theft. The licence photos held by states will add to a commonwealth pool of images, including from immigration screening, to be accessed by police instantly for automated face-matching in a wide range of criminal investigations. But he warned that public CCTV surveillance using facial recognition, including in sporting venues, veered well beyond the groundwork laid by governments to justify use of a beefed-up national identity database. Linking the database to public surveillance in real time was an unprecedented step demanding a “proper debate” about public appetite for the security “trade-off”, and formal analysis of privacy impacts and other risks. It risked “mass surveillance, screening and predictive policing” where “false positives” from automated facial recognition could have dire consequences. “Unfortunately, based on the surveys I don’t think people will understand the real risks in that false positives or false arrests arena – it will just be when someone’s shot innocently,” he told Guardian Australia. He said crowd surveillance via facial recognition scans to identify suspected terrorists was far from becoming a reality, despite political leaders touting the idea in recent days. The president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Michael Cope, said the usefulness of the licence database to criminal investigations “must be questioned” given records of inaccuracy with facial recognition elsewhere. “In the US the algorithm used to search their equivalent data base has produced false results on 15% of occasions,” Cope said. On Wednesday, Malcolm Turnbull said facial recognition technology matching against driver licences could soon be used in public places such as shopping malls to identify suspected terrorists in real time. “It’s simply a question of using technology, being proactive, not being complacent, relentless in my determination to keep Australians safe,” the prime minister said. Turnbull retreated from this rhetoric on Thursday, when leaders at a Council of Australian Governments meeting agreed on sharing licence data, which police will access in real time to check for identity matches via facial recognition in a wide range of criminal investigations. “It doesn’t involve surveillance, or indeed mass surveillance,” Turnbull said of the agreement. However, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she backed crowd surveillance using facial recognition and the identity database during the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in April. “This is about stopping any prospect of terrorism, and it is ensuring that thousands of people are safe at the games, so I support whatever measures are needed – surveillance and added security,” she said. A proposal, also supported by NSW and Victoria, would allow Australian federal police officers to scan crowds for matches with the national identity database – which includes licences and passport information – if there is a credible threat or after an attack. Cope said the agreement between the states and the commonwealth was “another example of the now familiar process where after each terror incident our governments hack away at our rights to privacy and due process”. “It is inevitable that once this database is created other bureaucrats will want access to it,” he said. Green said the talk of facial scanning in public for terrorists using a national identity database was jumping the gun considerably. “They’ve been in public kite-flying solutions which need proper debate and proper consideration, and getting the balance right between what’s the terrorism threat risk, what’s the trade-off,” Green said. The federal Attorney-General’s Department had made it clear all agencies would conduct privacy impact assessments before any such changes, he said. This had been done for driver licence sharing, but not for “hooking that up in real time to the entire CCTV network”, Green said. This would create the “sort of serious intelligence on everybody” seen in dystopic scenarios in films such as The Circle and Minority Report. “Who’s going to monitor it and what’s the evidence that any of the [terrorist] incidents so far would have ever been solved by that?” Green said. “Frankly, the more power you give police, the more likely it is to be abused at some level. “Another caveat is, do we trust the federal government, given they’ve had about five failures in the last couple of years on delivery of this sort of infrastructure – should we trust them?” The federal and state legislation to enable licence data sharing is yet to be seen. “But we think it will be drafted broadly to allow further development and ‘scope creep’, and the more abhorrent uses of the technology might creep in without much parliamentary scrutiny,” Green said. “That’s the issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/oct/08/business-is-booming-australian-consumers-know-better","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T00:26:49Z","webTitle":"Business is booming?

Australian consumers know better","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Right now there is a growing disconnect between how business and consumers view the economy. It is a gap that will continue to widen as measures of the economy suggest things are on the improve, but wages continue to grow at record low rates. And it is a gap which will have a significant impact on how voters judge the government’s economic achievements at the next election. This month the NAB measure of business conditions hit its highest level since early 2008. In the same month the latest Westpac Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment revealed that “the consumer mood remains downbeat with September marking the tenth consecutive month that pessimists have outnumbered optimists”. For businesses, things are seemingly as good as they have been since the GFC hit, and yet consumers still feel little joy. And this week came proof that this consumer sentiment was not just a “vibe” but was reflected in how they were spending their money. The ABS revealed on Thursday that in August, Australians spent 0.6% less on retail goods and services than they had in July – the biggest one-month fall in spending since March 2013. And we can’t even argue it is just a one-off blip – the annual growth of retail spending is also the lowest it has been for four years. Worst of all it is across the entire country. Every state and territory saw retail spending fall in August. That doesn’t happen very often – the last time it did was in June 2009. And even if we take the view that this is all a statistical flub and we should use the more sober trend figures, things are not good. In August no state or territory saw retail trade grow by more than 0.15% in trend terms. That has never happened before. Everywhere you look, people are closing their wallets – and this at a time when full-time employment is growing stronger than it has for six years and the unemployment rate is as low as it has been since early 2013. The collapse in spending was also across almost all areas – food, household goods, clothing and accessories, cafes, restaurants and takeaways all saw a drop in spending. The only good news was for department stores, but that was of little consequence given in the past year spending in department stores is down 1.4%. The problem is that Australia’s economy is built not on the back of sheep or even from what we dig out of holes, but on household spending. Household consumption makes up about 56% of our entire GDP, and over the past decade spending by households has accounted for a similar proportion of the growth of our economy. By contrast, in the past 10 years net exports have accounted for just 3% of the total growth of the economy. When household spending slows down, so too does the entire the economy. Fortunately, not all consumer spending is on retail trade – it makes up roughly a quarter of all spending by households – but it is a very good indicator of how households are spending. The problem is that much of the other household expenditure, such as on education, health, insurance, rent and utilities, is less driven by choice – you have to pay it. It means if the prices of non-retail items go up, less household income is available to be spent on things you would buy down at the local shopping mall or supermarket. The only way to keep pace is if household income also rises. And that is where these terrible retail figures really hit home. In the past year in Sydney, for example, the price of non-retail items has risen faster than that of retail goods. Childcare in Sydney rose 6%, electricity 10.5%, medical and hospital services 5.2%, transport fares 4.4%, and property rates and charges rose 3.1%. At the same time the average wage of workers in NSW rose just 2.0%. Something has to give, and what is giving at the moment is people’s capacity to spend at the shops. Over time economies change, and what is important also changes. In the past we used to just look at the unemployment rate and pretty much assume that told the whole story. Now, with increased numbers of people working part-time, we know we need to look at other measures such as the underemployment rate, or hours worked. Until the GFC hit the main issue with wages was whether they were growing too fast – whether Australia was becoming uncompetitive, or that the Reserve Bank would need to increase interest rates to calm things down. Most often the release of the quarterly wage figures were used as an excuse for conservative politicians and commentators to suggest the unions were out of control. In the 10 years from 1999 to the end of 2008, private-sector wages grew on average by 3.6%. They have not grown at that pace for five years – and will not get close to that pace any time soon. The May budget predicted wages growth returning to that level only by June 2020 – and even that requires some pretty extraordinary things to occur. Wages growth is now a key indicator of economic health. And while wages continue to grow at such low levels – currently below inflation – households will continue to act logically by spending less at the shops. It also means that other economic news, no matter how “good”, will continue to pale in significance – both economically and politically."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/06/premier-nick-xenophon-bigger-upsets-have-happened-recently","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T05:57:14Z","webTitle":"Premier Nick Xenophon?

Bigger upsets have happened recently","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It doesn’t really matter whether Nick Xenophon has pushed the eject button to outrun a negative verdict by the high court and create a dignified exit for himself, or whether he is genuinely over the peculiarities of the Canberra hothouse and wants to go home to Adelaide. The end result is the same. As the election analyst Antony Green says, South Australia now has a genuine three-cornered contest, with Xenophon’s entry likely guaranteeing that neither the Liberals nor Labor can secure a majority in their own right at the state election next March. In a world where political upset is the order of the day, in a world where Donald Trump can be president, there’s also an outside chance the politician who began his professional political career in Adelaide as an anti-pokies campaigner could crash through the major party lock and emerge as the premier of South Australia. While Xenophon is flatly rejecting talk that he has any grand plan to lead his home state, and insists his sole objective is to emerge with the balance of power, we can watch how his local campaign ramps up as a tangible measure of his ambition. His party’s current game plan is to run candidates in between 12 and 20 lower house seats. If you were a self-styled political outsider with a serious ambition to go for broke in a time of major party disaffection, you would need to field candidates in all 47 seats in the House of Assembly. While the Nick Xenophon Team’s core supporters, the members and backers, are predominantly older people, research undertaken last year indicates the Xenophon group is now a mature political movement, with broad support, polling more or less evenly across age groups. A Lonergan poll of 3,000 South Australian respondents last year found support for NXT at 21% among 18- to 34-year-olds, 25% for 35- to 49-year-olds and 27% for 50- to 64-year-olds. Labor has held government in South Australia since 2002. Before the events of Friday, the Liberal party would have seen next year’s poll as its best chance in some time to crash through and unseat Jay Weatherill. Xenophon’s course correction is a serious blow to that plan. The Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, on Friday ruled out forming a coalition with Xenophon, saying South Australians had seen the “chaos of the federal Senate circus” and didn’t want that sort of carry-on in Adelaide. You can guarantee that both major parties, and Cory Bernardi’s fledgling Australian Conservatives, will train their guns aggressively on Xenophon over the coming months, given the threat he poses. For a genial politician who likes to be liked, this will be a seriously rugged and willing campaign. There are also big questions about how the NXT in Canberra manages the transition into the post-Nick era, and how that affects the capacity of the Turnbull government to progress its legislative program in more or less orderly fashion. Xenophon, being Xenophon, will want to do as he does – career around chaotically and exert influence in both spheres. Letting go, and delegating, isn’t Xenophon’s natural form. But if he’s serious about making a triumphant return to Adelaide, and running a much larger team than he is used to, Xenophon will need to give his Canberra representatives the opportunity to function with some genuine autonomy and agency, as something more than satellites of brand Xenophon. And Malcolm Turnbull will have to deal with the consequences of that transition, however they ultimately play out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/05/fall-in-rail-journeys-raises-questions-for-train-franchise-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T11:00:56Z","webTitle":"Fall in rail journeys raises questions for train franchise firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/05/fall-in-rail-journeys-raises-questions-for-train-franchise-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/05/fall-in-rail-journeys-raises-questions-for-train-franchise-firms","fields":{"headline":"Fall in rail journeys raises questions for train franchise firms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The number of rail passenger journeys in Britain fell in spring this year, after two decades of virtually constant growth since privatisation. Analysts and industry observers said the figures were concerning, while Labour said it raised serious questions about the viability of franchises. Figures from the Office of Rail and Road show that the total number of journeys was 416m from April through to the end of June, a decline of 2.7% compared with the same period last year. Journeys by passengers using season tickets fell by 11% year on year, with many switching to advance purchase tickets. Commuter journeys in London and the south-east fell by 4.5%, including a drop of 8.8% on South West Trains (now South Western Railway), 5.3% on the troubled Govia Thameslink Railway (owner of Southern rail) and 7.4% on Southeastern. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “This substantial fall in rail usage reflects passenger frustration at the cost and inflexibility of the ticketing system and direction of the railway more broadly.” Average fares have risen 27% since 2010, far faster than wages, while another 3.6% rise is due in January. McDonald added: “The decline in patronage, particularly in the south-east, raises serious questions about the government’s rail franchising programme which is based on ever increasing rail patronage. I don’t believe the current model can sustain a downturn.” Industry sources said it called into question the sums paid for recent franchises. One said: “The whole franchising model is predicated on growth. At a time when firms have paid massive premiums, they have got to be worried.” The rail industry has faced the spectre of failing franchises before as two private firms walked away from the east coast mainline between 2007 and 2009, leaving it to the government to run after they failed to meet revenue predictions. Stagecoach, which has run the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise since 2015, has taken a £84m hit and attempted to renegotiate the terms of its deal after passenger growth fell below forecasts. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said of the passenger figures: “This is potentially concerning for operators who have won franchises recently if they have assumed much faster growth.” Abellio promised £3.7bn for the Greater Anglia franchise, which it started less than a year ago. First Group retained the TransPennine Express franchise last year with a bid that analysts said assumed passenger growth of between 13% and 18% a year from its second year, but numbers have so far remained static. In conjunction with MTR, it pledged to pay £2.6bn for the South Western franchise it took over in August. A source close to First Group said the firm was “not spooked” by the regulator’s report, which he said was a small statistical snapshot. Campaigners, who have warned that key workers are being driven out of jobs in cities because of the cost of commuting, said the figures underlined the need for part-time season tickets. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “With the change to people’s working patterns we need to see the introduction of season tickets for part-time workers and improvements to a ticketing system which is far too complex.” He added: “The fall in rail passenger journeys shows that rather than ploughing billions into new road building projects, which only adds more traffic to our already congested roads, the government should give rail the investment it really needs, making it a more attractive and affordable option for passengers.” Some form of part-time season ticketing has been promised by the government as part of newly awarded rail franchises, including on South Western Railway. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which brings together train companies and Network Rail to improve the railway, said: “Despite fluctuations in demand and consumer spending, adjusting for the timing of Easter, the short-term impact of industrial action and current economic uncertainties the overarching trend continues to point to sustained long-term growth.” This article was amended on 9 October 2017.

The Wall Street bank, which employs 6,000 staff in the UK, has been searching for office space in the German financial centre for the last six months as it looks to continue operations across the EU after Brexit. The bank is taking the top eight floors of a new 37-storey block known as Marienturm, which is under construction and expected to be ready for occupation in the third quarter of 2019. It currently has just 200 staff in Frankfurt. “This expanded office space will allow us to grow our operations in Germany to continue serving our clients, as well as provide us with the space to execute on our Brexit contingency plan as needed,” Goldman Sachs said. Richard Gnodde, chief executive of its international arm, has previously said the bank’s plans include hiring extra staff in the remaining 27 EU nations to cope with the extra business which will be channelled through Europe instead of London. The bank did not say what the implication was for jobs in London, but the news came amid warnings that unless a transitional deal can be agreed with the EU before Christmas firms could have to start taking steps to move jobs and business out of London on the assumption there will be a hard Brexit. Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, told an audience of financiers this week that the further away an agreement is from Christmas, the less effective it would be in helping to reassure City firms about the changes they need to cope with the UK’s departure from the EU. He has already asked 400 financial firms which operate in the UK for their Brexit plans and is monitoring their responses. For Goldman Sachs, the UK’s departure from the EU in March 2019 coincides with its scheduled move into a new 10-storey building under construction in London that is intended to replace its three offices in the capital. The bank has the option to take all the floors or sublet space. Gnodde has said previously that job numbers would depend “on the outcome of [the Brexit] negotiations and what we are obliged to do because of them” amid speculation that up to half of its 6,000 London-based roles could go. According to a tally of job announcements kept by the City of London Corporation – the local authority for much of the financial district – Frankfurt is in the lead of all the remaining EU cities in attracting roles. More than 9,750 potential job moves have so far been announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/06/journalists-takes-sides-truth-to-power-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T05:00:44Z","webTitle":"If journalists take sides, who will speak truth to power? | John Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/journalists-takes-sides-truth-to-power-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/journalists-takes-sides-truth-to-power-activists","fields":{"headline":"If journalists take sides, who will speak truth to power?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Since the Labour party conference roared to its triumphant close just over a week ago, a 90-second video has been punted around Twitter and Facebook featuring the indomitable MP-cum-national treasure Dennis Skinner. On YouTube, the clip is headlined “Dennis Skinner schools a journalist”, and the qualities he always brings to his interviews are present and correct: hardened principle, a spirit of fierce defiance, and his own kind of high camp. The man Skinner is talking to evidently wants to indulge a familiar trope, asking whether Labour’s high spending plans reflect a failure to learn the lessons of the past. “No, no, no,” says Skinner – and as Labour people often do these days, he then goes straight back to 1945. “As a matter of fact, do you think it was wrong for Nye Bevan to build the health service, to save your life? Or your relatives’ lives?” He mentions the postwar building of council houses, and says unemployment in the same period ran at 2.2%. “Do you agree with that?” he says. “Answer!” “I’m just here to ask questions,” replies his inquisitor. “You think you’re asking awkward questions,” says Skinner. “So why don’t you understand that you are part of society … It’s time that you understood that you’re not somebody outside the perimeter. You’re involved … But somehow, you people connected to the television [and] media, you think you’re above it all. You’re not! You’re more and more like Trump. You’re vain! Conceited! You believe that no one should argue with you!” God bless Dennis and all that, but after two weeks spent visiting both main parties’ conferences and once again talking to the general public about Brexit, this kind of stuff has started to grate. From the ecstatic noise around Jeremy Corbyn to those slightly desperate Tories who now swoon at Jacob Rees-Mogg, British politics is newly alive with passion and ideological division. The wider world reflects much the same picture: even on high streets in Kent and Greater Manchester, one can sense the same kind of fevered polarisation – so that, as I discovered in Gillingham last week, asking even mild questions about the consequences of Brexit occasionally invites such ripostes as, “You’re a remainer, aintcha?” In that kind of highly charged atmosphere, to be a journalist, looking askance at the drama and divining contradictions and inconsistencies as much as chronicling all the fervour and emotion, is to be hopelessly out of step – and, in some cases, to find oneself at the receiving end of derision and hostility. At the more extreme end of all this sit such demagogues as Putin, Trump, Erdoğan, and the Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán. The latter is now in the habit of associating the media with a “mafia network” supposedly commanded by the financier George Soros – there are, obviously, antisemitic overtones here – and encouraging sympathetic online outlets to accuse journalists of something close to sedition. The essential argument was recently laid out by an outlet called 888.hu: “The international media, with a few exceptions, generally write bad things about the government because a small minority with great media influence does everything to tarnish the reputation of Hungary in front of the world – prestige that has been built over hundreds of years by patriots.” Here, British understatement might get in the way of such rhetorical melodrama, but there are shades of much the same mindset. On the political right, there is the belief that the media are miserablist anti-patriots (or, if you prefer, citizens of nowhere), as highlighted by Liam Fox’s recent claim that the BBC is guilty of reporting Brexit with a tone of “self-defeating pessimism”. On the left, meanwhile, there is an ingrained belief that even self-consciously impartial coverage only thinly conceals the agendas of neoliberalism, and what is known these days as “centrism”, and that the mask regularly drops. The fact that the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg was accompanied to Labour conference by a bodyguard barely needs restating. But even after that had become clear, the dependably unrestrained Corbyn-supporting outlet the Canary reported that the BBC editor was listed as an “invited speaker” at a Conservative fringe meeting, with the headline: “We need to talk about Laura Kuenssberg.” The same, it quickly turned out, was true of my colleague Owen Jones, but that did not seem to get in the way: despite the absence of corroborating facts, the Canary was once again of the opinion it had punched through the “impartial” veneer, revealing the true-blue agenda beneath. What is going on here? Clearly, the idea of journalism as a cover for this or that agenda is hardly new. In many instances, as a quick trip to the newsagents will confirm, the accusation has long been justified. But there again, even in the kind of outlets seen as bywords for propaganda and partisanship, the journalistic impulse is alive and well (if you doubt this, consider the estimable coverage of industrial disputes in the Morning Star). Even partisan commentary can be rooted in the principles of good journalism, so long as it does not ignore uncomfortable facts, blindly offer support to parties or leaders, or distort actuality to score political points. More than that, though, the idea of journalism as a route to the truth is every bit as worthwhile as it ever was. But it is also under threat. In the Facebook age, outlets that value the idea of dispassionate inquiry and dogged research are feeling the pinch, while a great ocean of polemic, often written for nothing and barely interested in the world’s endless complexities, grows ever larger. The polemicists have a symbiotic relationship with the wider political mood, feeding off all the passion and emotion, and then doing their best to ramp everything up. As all that happens, the distinction between activism and journalism becomes dangerously blurred. Even among people fresh out of university, the “in” thing is seemingly to be a pundit rather than a reporter; in the online world, there are rather too many polemicists, and not nearly enough journalists. As evidenced by new media platforms on both left and right, there is a kind of outlet that fits snugly into this new world. It decries supposedly objective stuff as hopelessly biased while claiming that its own overheated polemics shine much brighter light on the truth. Put another way, as the Times columnist Hugo Rifkind recently said, “it’s a defining feature of the Canary/Evolve/Breitbart/Westmonster axis that they cannot comprehend [the] difference between analysis and advocacy … So they think their own advocacy is analysis, and regard the analysis of others as advocacy.” The basic belief, which anyone who has studied postmodernism would understand, is that even the most dispassionate journalists are guilty of bias, and everything ultimately blurs into a cacophony of partisan shouting. As a principled socialist such as Dennis Skinner would surely recognise, this points to a dangerous future: of endless conflict, power not held to account, and vested interests free to run riot. The election of Trump and our collective failure to comprehend the insanities of Brexit suggest we may already be halfway there. So how do we pull back? The answer lies with those much-maligned people outside the perimeter, asking awkward questions, trying to maintain some imperfect balance between opinion and truth, and scribbling into their notepads. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/05/deadliest-mass-shooting-in-modern-us-history-wounded-knee-not-las-vegas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T18:00:55Z","webTitle":"Deadliest mass shooting in modern US history – Wounded Knee, not Las Vegas | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/deadliest-mass-shooting-in-modern-us-history-wounded-knee-not-las-vegas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/deadliest-mass-shooting-in-modern-us-history-wounded-knee-not-las-vegas","fields":{"headline":"Deadliest mass shooting in modern US history – Wounded Knee, not Las Vegas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was shocked to see you assert that the Las Vegas attack is the “deadliest mass shooting in modern US history” (‘We’ll be talking about gun laws’ – Trump, 4 October).

A transformation from small-scale subsistence farms to mechanised, more commercially viable farms is essential, said experts at the Ghana-based African Centre for Economic Transformation, who outlined a bold plan to revolutionise agriculture and fuel economic growth in a report launched Tuesday at an African finance ministers meeting at the World Bank and backed by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. Their recommendations are that governments increase the rights of female farmers and embrace modern technology, such as drones and satellites, and change land tenure systems, if the agricultural sector is going to be transformed to meet the needs of the continent’s population. “With a uniquely diverse climate and more than half the world’s uncultivated arable land, Africa has the natural resources to drive a boom in agriculture that can lift millions out of poverty. But we have not yet created the right economic conditions. This excellent report shows how we can do that – and underlines why we must,” said Annan, Chair of the Africa Progress Panel. The report aims to address the problem of Africa’s increasing dependence on food imported from outside the continent, which is now estimated at $68bn (£51bn) a year, and to address the urgent question of how the world will be able to feed itself with a growing population. Global food demand is forecast to double by 2050, by which time Africa’s population is also predicted to have doubled from its current population of 1.2 billion to 2.5 billion. “We think agriculture can power Africa’s economic transformation,” said Yaw Ansu, the chief economist at Acet and the lead author of the report. “If we increase productivity on farms we immediately increase the incomes and livelihoods of about 60-70% of people. Also we can use agriculture to develop industry that will improve food security in urban areas and use it to make us competitive in terms of manufacturing.” Ansu insisted that this does not mean large, corporate farms. “You can have small- and medium-scale farms using modern technology and run professionally.” African agricultural industries have been hampered by multiple problems, including poor infrastructure, which makes transportation of goods difficult, the fact that large tracts of land are inaccessible due to ongoing conflicts, and a lack of irrigation, which means farming often stops in the dry season. According to the report, only 5.4% of agriculture across Africa is irrigated. Farming in Africa still mostly takes place on small-scale subsistence farms, which are not large enough to make modern farming viable. About 85% of farms in Ghana are under two hectares, and in Uganda 58% are smaller than one hectare. Mechanisation levels in farms across Africa are very low, with the number of tractors in sub-Saharan Africa ranging from 1.3 per sq km in Rwanda to 43 per sq km in South Africa, compared with 128 per sq km in India and 116 per sq km in Brazil. Yields could also be increased by embracing “green revolution” technologies – a combination of improved seeds, fertilisers, irrigation, mechanisation and farm management techniques – and using technology such as drones and satellite. “This is not just an economic argument. The steps needed to transform Africa’s agriculture make excellent social policies too,” said Rosine Coulibaly Sori, finance minister of Burkina Faso. “Eighty percent of African farmers are smallholders and half of those are women. With more secure access to land, they can operate modern farms that produce more, and raise their incomes. These reforms could feed our people and fuel our economies, but we must act quickly.” Agriculture has also been hampered by an ageing farming population. The report warns that the average age of farmers in Africa is estimated to be as high as 60 and there are few signs that young people, who are increasingly educated and unimpressed by the low incomes provided by most farming work, are looking to step in to take over family farms. “If we can introduce a set of reforms and programmes of support and make farming a paying business, then hopefully we can get some younger, educated people into farming and create a new class of medium-scale, modern African farmers,” said Ansu."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/05/bump-stocks-sell-out-across-us-as-ban-looms-after-las-vegas-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T16:32:53Z","webTitle":"Bump stocks sell out across US as ban looms after Las Vegas shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/bump-stocks-sell-out-across-us-as-ban-looms-after-las-vegas-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/bump-stocks-sell-out-across-us-as-ban-looms-after-las-vegas-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Bump stocks sell out across US as ban looms after Las Vegas shooting","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bump stocks are selling out across America as momentum gathers in Congress to ban the rifle modification used by the Las Vegas shooter to obtain catastrophically high rates of fire. The devices are sold out or temporarily unavailable from all the largest gun and ammunition retailers in the US, as fear of an impending ban has sent many gun enthusiasts hoarding. “Will I be able to order sometime soon? I want to get one before there is a push to make them illegal,” one commenter posted on the Facebook page of Bump Fire Systems, one of three major US manufacturers of the devices. The company’s website had been down for more than two days citing “high traffic volume”. “I ordered mines [sic] the night the mass shootings happened. I hope I still get it,” another wrote. “I don’t even have the gun for it, but I want the stock just to have it down the line,” said Pennsylvania gun owner Zack Cernok, according to the New York Times. “I just like the idea of them and want to see how it feels and if it’s worth it – for $100, it’s almost not a bad investment to buy it, try it out and sell it if I don’t like it.” Major online sporting good retailers like Cabelas, Cheaper Than Dirt and Walmart were all sold out of the devices as of Thursday morning. Slide Fire, the first and largest manufacturer of the devices reported on its website that it had “decided to temporarily suspend taking new orders”. The increase in sales mirrors that of guns as a whole after recent mass shootings, as gun enthusiasts respond to usually unfounded fears of imminent gun control legislation by stocking up on their arsenals. Fully automatic firearms, which fire continuously as long as a gun’s trigger remains pressed, are, in virtually all cases, illegal to purchase and own in the US. Semi-automatic weapons, where a shooter must pull the trigger for each successive shot, however are abundant in both handgun and rifle forms. The bump stock devices blur this distinction by using the weapon’s own kickback to “bounce” the gun back and forth against the shooter’s shoulder, while stabilizing their finger against the trigger to achieve multiple trigger pulls in rapid succession. “The Slide Fire simply allows you to shoot as fast as you want to,” said inventor Jeremiah Cottle, while promoting his device in 2011. This action allows bump stocks to replicate the speed of a fully automatic rifle, but because the motion involves essentially shaking the whole firearm they dramatically reduce accuracy. Until now, this has limited their popularity with gun enthusiasts who commonly regard the device as a novelty or a toy. “Complete waste of costly ammunition,” one reviewer said in a post from 2015. “You wouldn’t want to use one in a real self-defense or battle situation. If I want to hear a whole lot of rapid fire bangs, I’ll set off a string of firecrackers.” The NRA, which as a matter of principle objects to virtually any law restricting the ownership of firearms or their accessories, does not allow the bump stock devices to be used at their own firing range, Politico reported Thursday. Stephen Paddock used the devices to devastating effect in his massacre on Sunday night, killing 58 people from his hotel suite window in the Nevada gambling capital. Senior congressional Republicans have suggested they are open to considering legislation banning the devices, despite their usual hard line against any gun control measures. “I own a lot of guns, and as a hunter and sportsman, I think that’s our right as Americans, but I don’t understand the use of this bump stock,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the number two Republican in the Senate, said on Wednesday. ON Thursday morning on MSNBC the House speaker, Paul Ryan, added: “Clearly that’s something we need to look into.” But for now, it remains legal and hard to obtain – creating a scarcity that is driving up the price in secondhand channels. The devices are currently selling for around 200% of retail on the private auction site GunBroker.com."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-readers-recipe-maryam-sham-bakhlava-traybake","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T10:00:27Z","webTitle":"OFM Awards 2017: Best Readers’ Recipe – Maryam Shams' bakhlava traybake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-readers-recipe-maryam-sham-bakhlava-traybake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-readers-recipe-maryam-sham-bakhlava-traybake","fields":{"headline":"OFM Awards 2017: Best Readers’ Recipe – Maryam Shams' bakhlava traybake","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“In 2014 I lost my mum, and I came up with this recipe in her memory.

When feminists who have spent decades challenging sexism, racism, and homophobia are viewed as a risk to the wellbeing of students, something has gone very wrong indeed. Linda Bellos became the most recent feminist whose invitation to speak was withdrawn for raising questions about the direction in which modern-day gender politics is heading. Bellos, who is responsible for establishing Black History Month in Britain, was uninvited by the Beard Society, a “gender and feminist group” within Cambridge University. During her address to Peterhouse College, Bellos told organisers she planned to publicly question “some of the trans politics … which seems to assert the power of those who were previously designated male to tell lesbians, and especially lesbian feminists, what to say and what to think”. In response, a representative of the Beard Society responded: “I’m sorry but we’ve decided not to host you. I too believe in freedom of expression, however Peterhouse is as much a home as it is a college. The welfare of our students in this instance has to come first.” Regardless of your views on gender, Bellos speaking at Cambridge University in no way compromises the welfare of its students. It is ludicrous to claim that someone who has committed her adult life to liberation politics is a risk to the wellbeing of those who listen to her perspective – and deeply insulting. Black, female, Jewish and lesbian feminist, Bellos is not exactly a preacher of hate. In recent years, gender has become an increasingly explosive subject. If anything, it was brave of Bellos to propose to address this schism between queer and feminist principles when so many seasoned activists shy away from the issue. And there is an issue: that women can’t even question queer gender politics without being viewed as suspect highlights an underlying problem with the ideology behind them. Murray Edwards, a single-sex college at Cambridge, has updated its entry policy to include any prospective student “who at the point of application identifies as a woman”. Single-sex colleges exist to redress the imbalance caused by the exclusion of women from universities. A policy based around self-identification is exploitable – a man could take a university place reserved for a woman by falsely claiming to identify as female – which presents a serious problem. These questions are not raised from cruelty or bigotry, but necessity. Women must ask questions about gender politics. For hundreds of years, gender has functioned as a hierarchy that puts men at the top and women at the bottom. Gender is the reason one in three women in this world will experience male violence within her lifetime. Gender roles are the pillars of patriarchy. Therefore, challenging gender is a necessary step towards the liberation of women. Yet many women who do question or challenge the way we are now being encouraged to think about gender – as inherent and apolitical, rather than a socially constructed hierarchy – are shut down and branded Terfs. Terf stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Online, it often it appears alongside violent rhetoric: punch a Terf, stab a Terf, kill a Terf. This language is used to dehumanise women who are critical of gender as part of a political system. Many of the women called Terf are, like Bellos, lesbian. These lesbians are increasingly demonised by the wider LGBT+ community, or ignored in order to avoid the controversy altogether. Repressing these tensions, rather than airing them, only lets the problem grow. Conversations such as the one Bellos would have started, conversations that give breathing space to the difficulties between some lesbians and trans people, are necessary if we are ever to move beyond this painful stalemate. The tension between radical feminists and queer activists stems from two contradictory ways of defining gender. Queer politics positions gender as an innately held identity. The radical feminist understanding is that gender exists as a political system, not an identity. Recognising gender as innately held, a factor that should be enshrined as a protected characteristic, totally contradicts radical feminist principles. The politics of gender is deeply personal, but that isn’t a reason to shy away from exploring it – quite the opposite. Like Bellos, I am a radical feminist. There are women within the movement who have seriously overstepped the mark by directing cruelty towards trans people, which I condemn without hesitation. But, like every other radical feminist I know, I want trans people to live lives that are free from abuse, discrimination, and persecution. Irrespective of the difference in how we conceptualise gender, radical feminists want all trans people to be safe from male violence. And it is overwhelmingly male violence that’s at the root of transphobic abuse – radical feminists believe in naming the agent. Looking at the vitriol directed towards radical feminists, the way in which radical feminist perspectives are treated as poisonous, one could almost be forgiven for imagining that feminist women are responsible for anti-trans violence. However, the overwhelming majority of transphobic attacks are carried out by men. In fact, radical feminism has critiqued and opposed male violence longer and more consistently than any other school of thought. The term “Terf” and the violent rhetoric that often accompanies it only serve to obscure the reality: women and trans people alike are targets of male violence. To make radical feminists the villains is to blame men’s violence on women’s thoughts. Perhaps Bellos’s words would have been challenging. Perhaps what she said to the students of Cambridge would not have been comfortable or easy to hear. But being made to think difficult thoughts is not the same as being harmed.

It’s the least we deserve","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It has become a cliche of the era to say we are getting what we deserve. We get the politicians we deserve, we get the presidents we deserve, we get the world we deserve. Without getting overly L’Oreal advert about it all, surely we deserve a respite from these just deserts? Can’t something hilarious and magical come along that we can all welcome with open arms, realising that we are, without question, getting the thing that we deserve – and that it is good? Yes. Yes it can. George Foreman has challenged Steven Seagal to a proper fight. This is the cultural event that should have you telling yourself “because I’m worth it”. Clearly, the best time to enjoy it is at this dare-to-dream stage because I sense that one of the parties may ultimately decide the bout can’t go ahead. Maybe because he’s too good. Maybe because he’s afraid of hurting the other guy. Maybe because he was demoted to chef after a bungled special forces operation to take out General Noriega. But at this stage, when Seagal has pointedly yet to respond and everything still seems possible, let’s get down to the background. A few days ago, former two-time heavyweight champion of the world and noted countertop grill retailer George Foreman took to Twitter to issue a challenge to cinema’s Steven Seagal. As all of us adrift on the strange tides of early 21st-century culture should know, Seagal is something of a renaissance man himself, combining age-inappropriate, straight-to-gif action roles with functioning both as a hench-sensei/fat best friend to Vladimir Putin, and as an occasional spokesmodel for the Russian arms industry. That is not the half of it, although space constraints mean we must gloss over his stint as an energy drink inventor and blues guitarist. Ditto the headlines he drew for his stint as an Arizona border-control guard – as part of the “posse” of recently pardoned horror sheriff Joe Arpaio – following which Seagal was accused of killing a puppy during a raid on a house. (“Animal abuser is a role I will not accept,” ran a rebuttal that primarily reminded completists like me of all the roles he has accepted. Some of the later performances are arguably on a par with canicide.) And of course there is more – so much more. Just when you think you know him, Seagal unfurls himself in another direction. Crimea expert. Ukrainian national security threat. Aikido trainer to the Serbian special forces. Like a series of lotus blossoms, his career decisions constantly rise above the shitty waters in which they germinated. And then they die and rot away again, and it all really stinks somehow much, much worse than it did before. But I think the message is the eternal cycle, or something. Anyhow, on to Foreman’s challenge, which may or may not be provoked by Seagal’s recent outburst on Good Morning Britain. Beamed in from Moscow, where he now lives, he raged about US athletes taking the knee in protest, declaring: “I myself have risked my life countless times for the American flag.” Mmm. As a young Katherine Heigl reveals in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory: “Uncle Casey’s got medals at home that are so secret he can never show them to anybody.” No doubt, no doubt. Seagal certainly has a purple heart in dismissing domestic abuse lawsuits. Shortly after this well-publicised rant, and indeed after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Foreman tweeted: “Steven Seagal, I challenge you, one on one. I use boxing, you can use whatever. 10 rounds in Vegas.” Well. I think you’ll agree those few characters contain multitudes, but the big-fight trash talk has been formally opened with that “you can use whatever”. As students of Seagal’s work will know, Steven has a seventh dan black belt in aikido, and a 10th dan in making it sound like he was given his powers by Buddha at a mountain rendezvous in Nepal, sometime between the mid-Mahajanapada era and the North American theatrical release of Above the Law. He has spent a lifetime talking up his “whatever”, while always remaining sufficiently adaptable to improvise a weapon from a bar towel, microwave or Native American something-or-other. To hear this art form – the sweet pseudoscience – dismissed as “whatever” by Foreman will surely send him up the wall. Where better to settle this than the ring? While Seagal desperately tries to come up with credible and face-saving answers to that question – and Foreman continues to goad him – we should consider the tale of the tape. At 68, Foreman is three years older than Seagal, with both of them clocking in a little older than the age that Rocky got back into the ring in Rocky Balboa. Which was pretend. Weight? Look ... I’m not sure we dare speculate here. George’s grill obviously indicates an interest in retaining lean muscle, while in his DVD outings, Seagal is mostly shot in shadow so dark it makes Marlon Brando’s lair in Apocalypse Now look striplit. In terms of other liabilities, Seagal’s widow’s peak is now being comprehensively out-acted by even John Travolta’s, and he may be terrified of experiencing something of what Andre Agassi went through during the 1990 French Open final. As the tennis star later revealed, there’d been some kind of toupee malfunction the night before, resulting in him squaring up to Andrés Gómez with it held together by paperclips, and being so worried about his rug coming off that he lost. On the plus side, Seagal is a sort of demigod, having been formally declared a tulku (a reincarnated lama) by the oldest sect of Tibetan Buddhism. That may come with powers of which we are as yet unaware. He is, however, slightly less known for actual fighting than George Foreman. Seagal’s martial artistry was only brought to a wider audience by his most famous client. Yes, if you’ve ever watched a Seagal movie and wondered “How did this guy get into motion pictures?”, you may like to know that he used to train legendary former Creative Artists Agency overlord Michael Ovitz. Seagal’s stardom is largely down to the fact that Ovitz couldn’t have a single second of the day where he wasn’t packaging some kind of deal, including at 5am or whatever ungodly hour he was shouting “judo CHOP!” at Steven, probably in some Beverly Hills aerobics studio where the part of “the Far East” was played by a silver bell and three jossticks. A star was born – and the rest, as they say, is history. It’s certainly in the past, anyway, with Seagal’s activities these days confined to touring Russian schools and arms fairs with Putin, cheerleading for Trump and explaining impatiently to western media that all governments dick around with other countries’ elections (I paraphrase slightly). Foreman’s history is a little more ... well, seriously historical. Still, there you have it. Think of the buildup. Think of the training montages. Think of the press conferences. Think of the undercard (preference: Holyfield-Van Damme). Think of the ponytail lumbering for the hills. It’s not going to happen in Vegas, but perhaps some ambitious dictator might oblige and stage it, as Mobutu Sese Seko did for the Rumble in the Jungle? Perhaps Putin could use it as a World Cup curtain-raiser next year? After all, Seagal now seems a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state, rather like Ivan Drago, and could be introduced as fighting out of his home town of Moscow. That might swing the scales in his favour (probably literally). Though this would obviously be a contest less morally shaded than even Rocky IV. As for the name of this epochal meeting, it should be thrown open to all of us prospective pay-per-viewers. I’ll start the ball rolling with the Oh-No in the Dojo and the Twatting on the Matting, and invite further suggestions at your earliest convenience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-wto-rules-not-a-brexit-safety-net","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T18:50:27Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on WTO rules: not a Brexit safety net | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-wto-rules-not-a-brexit-safety-net","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/the-guardian-view-on-wto-rules-not-a-brexit-safety-net","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on WTO rules: not a Brexit safety net","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When ministers point to a silver lining, check for clouds. So it is with recent boasts of a deal between the UK and Brussels on the division of shared quotas that, under World Trade Organisation auspices, manage food imports from non-EU countries. It is an unglamorous aspect of Brexit, but an instructive one. To summarise crudely, the deal presumes that the current EU quota is unchanged and sets a method for calculating Britain’s detached portion. This sounds fair to both sides, but not, it transpires, to the US and six other countries. They argue that Brexit removes the UK from current arrangements and so also changes the EU’s entitlements. They want more access to European markets and sense a stitch-up to keep them out. This dispute, still in its infancy, is revealing on many levels. First, it shows the labyrinthine nature of trade talks, rebutting hard-Brexiter claims that deals can be whipped up in a trice. These things take years. Second, it shows that the UK has enjoyed amplified clout as an EU member. Other countries see Brexit as an opportunity to reopen settled matters because they know they can drive a harder bargain. In this case, that means greater market access to a country that will have less leverage to demand reciprocal access for its exports. There are free-trade fundamentalists who are relaxed about that, urging abandonment of all barriers as a signal of Britain’s global outlook. But unilateral trade disarmament is not government policy and rightly so, given potentially ruinous consequences for farmers and manufacturers. Third, this row proves that the UK cannot expect favours from Donald Trump (no further proof was needed after Washington imposed a 219% tariff hitting aircraft parts manufactured in Belfast by Bombardier. Theresa May had personally lobbied the US president in a failed effort to avert that blow.) Above all, the episode exposes the vacuity of arguments that “WTO rules” are some kind of safety net for the UK in the absence of a Brexit deal. The WTO system is not a level field. Any negotiation within it is a ruthless game of power. Britain is a smaller, weaker player alone than it is as part of Team EU. Brexit, in trade talks as in many other areas, turns out to have a price tag denominated in the most cherished commodity of the leave campaign – control."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/05/frozen-elsa-dress-menace-disney-stereotypes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T14:55:44Z","webTitle":"Frozen’s Elsa in a racy dress: this is the menace of Disney | Emma Brockes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/frozen-elsa-dress-menace-disney-stereotypes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/frozen-elsa-dress-menace-disney-stereotypes","fields":{"headline":"Frozen’s Elsa in a racy dress: this is the menace of Disney","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My two-year-old twins came back from pre-school last week singing the chorus to Let it Go. For those fortunate enough not to know, Let it Go is the torch song at the heart of Frozen, the Disney princess movie of 2013 and beloved of girls everywhere. My children are played out by the song every week at ballet. Now, thanks to their teacher, they can sing the words too. And I was taken aback. The TV rules are pretty relaxed in my house. I don’t set quotas (the iPhone is different), nor do I fret about the quality of what they watch, as long as it is roughly age-appropriate. But after they begged me to load the video for Let it Go on YouTube, I found myself having a very un-fun parental reaction. I’ve seen the film before, on a plane, years ago, but that was before I had kids, and while it struck me as annoying at the time – the nakedness of its drive to be considered uplifting is as grim and depressing as that tone always is – I didn’t think much about its presentation of women. Now, in my living room, I have two avid two-year-olds trying to climb into the television to get nearer to Elsa. And what on earth is Elsa doing in the Let it Go scene? She’s dancing in the snow, complaining of how hard it is to play by the rules and conceal her inner self. She climbs the mountain. She sets up the ice palace. Then she raises her tiny, heart-shaped face to the heavens and bellows out the climax of the song, a moment of self-actualisation that the animators represent by having her bust her out of her dowdy village clothes and into … an evening gown, with a slit up the side all the way to her thigh and a bridal-like train dragging behind her. Meanwhile, in another universe, the boys are watching dogs in hats rescue puppies on Paw Patrol. I think banning things often backfires, but in this case I don’t care how much they complain: no one is going to Halloween as Elsa. Respect my authority Singing a Disney song would probably get my kids expelled from their new music school, a sort of junior Juilliard that takes itself very seriously. The first class last week reacquainted me with something I hadn’t seen for a long time: a very, very good teacher. “She’s mean,” whispered my kids’ babysitter, as we sat down on the floor, and went into a fugue state, whisked back to the terrors of some long ago classroom. The teacher, meanwhile, eyed the class like a flight attendant assessing a cabin for potential troublemakers before a long flight. Her eyes fell on one of my daughters, a child I consider to be very talented, but among whose talents I wouldn’t put sitting still very high. My daughter looked back with an air of “Eh, eh, what’s this?” But everyone felt the teacher’s authority. A mother to my left started hissing, desperately: “Cooper, sit down.” A little girl called Aquarius, taking a finger-puppet from the box before she was supposed to, was dispatched back to her seat with a single look. Whereupon class began, everyone behaved impeccably. It was a total delight. Larry by numbers Curb Your Enthusiasm came back for a ninth season last week, after a six-year absence, and it’s a sign of changed times that there were murmurings online about how it mocked the afflicted. The whole point, of course, is Larry David’s insensitivity to the afflicted and these reviews misunderstood who is in on the joke. The bigger problem was the show’s formula poked through a little too starkly – the set-up of finding something you can’t joke about (rape, disability), then having Larry blunder through all the stop signs until everyone hates him – being so luridly on display, it felt a little too much like awkward TV comedy by numbers. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/08/a-hall-for-hull-trinity-square-the-roman-singularity-sir-john-soanes-museum-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T06:59:44Z","webTitle":"A Hall for Hull; The Roman Singularity – modern classics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/08/a-hall-for-hull-trinity-square-the-roman-singularity-sir-john-soanes-museum-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/08/a-hall-for-hull-trinity-square-the-roman-singularity-sir-john-soanes-museum-review","fields":{"headline":"A Hall for Hull; The Roman Singularity – modern classics","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Bubbling beneath the surface of contemporary architecture is a certain restlessness, a craving that this art form recover its art, its ability to stir, provoke, enthral, speak. Which also means that it should do so with complexity and contradiction, in different registers, like music, with nuance and wit as well as oomph – not, in other words, the depthless sugar rush of much that gets called “iconic”. And not its usual alternative, in the two-party system of architectural style: the careful, dutiful sobriety that at best can produce a subtle poetry of space but at worst is no more than managerial. This craving looks to the past for inspiration. The rise in nostalgia for brutalism shows a wish for forms that can emote. Beyond that architects look to the baroque and ancient Rome. They also look at 1980s postmodernism – often gauche and risible, and rapidly degraded by the embrace of the more cynical end of the property business, but nonetheless a previous attempt at plundering history for its communicative power. There’s a surge of small signs of these feelings, such as an exhibition of photographs by Hélène Binet of the impassioned stonework of Nicholas Hawksmoor at Large Glass in north London, and a show at the Riba of delicate drawings by the artist Pablo Bronstein, which contrive to make 1980s neo-Georgian look fascinating. In Hull, as part of its year as City of Culture, the Chilean architects Mauricio Pezo and Sofia von Ellrichshausen, together with the Swiss artist Felice Varini, have been asked to make A Hall for Hull, a temporary “urban room” in the city’s Trinity Square. It’s an intelligent and open-minded commission, made jointly by the RIBA and the City of Culture organisers, to bring these architects from so far away. The couple’s reputation has been growing for a while now, but they are not so established that the choice would be boring or predictable. You wouldn’t call Pezo von Ellrichshausen postmodern, and they say they don’t want to make direct references to the past, but they do give their work a charge that comes from antiquity. They have made what they call a “hypostyle” – that is, a recreation of an ancient pillared hall – “without a roof”, with 16 six-metre-high columns arranged in a grid of four rows of four. The columns are stout-ish cylinders, which if made of masonry would have Egyptian or Romanesque majesty, but instead are made of relatively light sheets of galvanised steel, perforated with grids of rectangular openings. You can go inside them, through doorways in their sides. The installation does a version of what other Pezo von Ellrichshausen projects do, especially the Poli House that helped launch their reputation, where spectacular coastal surroundings are framed and intensified by regular and strong-minded architecture. Here, the things framed are historic fragments of Hull: the almost-cathedral that is Hull Minster; the grammar school where the poet Andrew Marvell was educated; a statue of said poet; and the brightly coloured pediment of Trinity House, the 18th-century home of a centuries-old guild and charity for seafarers. A Hall for Hull has handsomeness and presence. It has a play of substance and lightness whereby the solid-looking columns become light. It is also a bit aloof – once you are invited into the hypostyle, and then into one of the columns, you somehow want it to give a bit more. You feel a bit like Eeyore, when given a burst balloon and an empty honeypot by Piglet and Winnie-the-Pooh. Luckily, there is some more: Varini has painted the columns with white lines, which look inscrutable and arbitrary until you find that, from certain positions, they combine to make patterns of circles and squares. They give a different way to engage, not least because the effect works better in selfies than in the flesh, but the whole is still a touch too cerebral to be really moving. “Aloof” is not what you would call the work of architectural designer Adam Nathaniel Furman, although he has been accused of being both fascist and kitsch. In Sir John Soane’s Museum in London, in what was a basement kitchen, he has installed a tableful of gaudy objects, a miniature cityscape of towers and follies larded with columns, domes and pediments. They come in pink, baby blue, bright yellow, pillarbox red and lime green. They embrace superfluity and redundancy. An accompanying video weaves animations of the objects with film clips of Roman decadence and excess. This is a show called The Roman Singularity, made of the fruits of a year spent by Furman at the British School in Rome. There he would go on long walks, soaking up the city’s superabundance of architectural history, its promiscuous combinations of ancient, medieval, baroque and 20th century, sometimes in the company of a historian called Aristotle Kallis, before interpreting his experiences through drawing, story-writing and computer modelling. He would then send data files to 3D-printing companies such as Tethon in Omaha, Nebraska, which would turn Furman’s drawings into ceramic objects that would then be sent back to Rome. It is an engaging technique, futuristic and venerable at once, in which digital precision is subverted by the slipping and warping (and sometimes catastrophic collapse) of clay in the kiln. It’s perfect for Furman’s aim, which is to make something modern by recombining the past. Rome, he says, has been continually reinvented by architects, artists and film-makers, people such as Federico Fellini or the painter Giovanni Paolo Panini, who make their own imaginary version of the city, which version then creates its own reality. He cites Piranesi’s plan of the Campo Marzio, a reconstruction of an ancient Rome that never precisely existed but which in its monumentality was “more Roman than the Romans”. Furman’s objects are his own imaginative reconstruction of the Eternal City. They will, he hopes, recapture classicism from those traditionalists who think it should be dry and academic. “It should be a vibrant, creative, lively thing,” he says. And so he puts the camp back into the Campo Marzio, reviving the sensuality and extravagance that have been fundamental to Roman architecture for more than two millennia. He also believes he is following in the footsteps of Sir John Soane, in whose house he is exhibiting, a re-combinator of genius, and in the next room to the table of follies stands a totem made of stacked-up classical elements, an inverted Ionic capital, abused cornices and mis-scaled arches. This is Furman’s version of Soane’s pasticcio, which did much the same thing 200 years ago. Furman’s installation is small. It doesn’t immediately tell you how its playfulness would work if scaled up to the size of actual buildings. But as a sign of hope in the creative intelligence of architecture it is more potent than many more sprawling shows."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/06/new-cleaning-firm-to-give-staff-london-living-wage-and-guaranteed-hours","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T05:01:43Z","webTitle":"Church-backed cleaning firm to give staff London living wage and guaranteed hours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/06/new-cleaning-firm-to-give-staff-london-living-wage-and-guaranteed-hours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/06/new-cleaning-firm-to-give-staff-london-living-wage-and-guaranteed-hours","fields":{"headline":"Church-backed cleaning firm to give staff London living wage and guaranteed hours","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A church-backed commercial cleaning company which pays its staff the London living wage is aiming to win business from established firms by promoting ethical principles. Clean for Good aims to provide a fairer deal for workers in an industry known for low wages, antisocial hours and poor working conditions. The company, which formally launched this week, is committed to providing paid leave, guaranteed working hours and training as well as the London living wage. “We have no zero-hours contracts although we offer flexible hours for employees who want to combine work with study or family responsibilities,” said its business manager, Catherine Pearson. “We offer staff paid holiday and sick leave, an opt-in pension and health and safety training. We use ethical products, keep our carbon footprint to a minimum and offer our clients transparency.” Pearson is aiming for a turnover of at least £600,000 in the next two years. “Then we would be a sustainable business, covering our overheads and making a profit,” she said. Profits might be used to pay bonuses to staff, she added. As well as taking a share of the market, Clean for Good hopes to challenge established companies to change their practices. “Often contracts are sub-contracted, sometimes more than once, and it’s unclear to clients how much the cleaner actually gets for their work.” Clean for Good’s 10 staff are paid £9.75 per hour. The nine women and one man are from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Until recently, Florentina, 36, was working in a fast food outlet for 72 hours a week without a contract and being paid in cash. Now she works for Clean for Good for 30 to 40 hours a week, making the same money as she did before, paying tax and with a legal contract. She sends some of her earnings home to Romania, where her children, aged 14 and 12, live. The company was established by a City of London church, St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe, which wanted to find a way of helping low-paid workers within its wealthy parish. It has eight clients so far, including a charity, a PR agency and a number of churches. St-Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe, the Church Mission Society and the Centre for Theology and Community own 75% of the company’s shares; the remainder are owned by individual investors. Jonny Baker, of the Church Mission Society, said: “Clean for Good is a potent combination of pioneering mission, social enterprise and God’s love. It is a practical mission in action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/07/camelot-national-lottery-close-expensive-0844-lines","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Camelot lauded by campaigners for closing expensive 0844 lines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/07/camelot-national-lottery-close-expensive-0844-lines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/07/camelot-national-lottery-close-expensive-0844-lines","fields":{"headline":"Camelot lauded by campaigners for closing expensive 0844 lines","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Campaigners have praised the firm behind the National Lottery after it quietly abandoned an 0844 phone line. But they have warned that too many councils are still using the expensive numbers. A year ago, Guardian Money highlighted how Camelot had expanded its use of 0844 phone lines, to the huge annoyance of its customers and partner retailers. In some cases, consumers instructed to call the lottery firm to claim their winnings were spending more on the calls, which cost up to £2.60 a minute, than they had won. At the time, David Hickson of the Fair Telecoms Campaign said companies that continued to use 084 or 087 numbers were being “greedy and foolish”. Now the National Lottery operator Camelot has replaced the phone lines with standard 03 numbers that are free to call from most calls packages. Hickson, who praised Camelot for seeing sense, warned this week that too many other businesses – notably airlines and councils – are still using the 0844 numbers, which can cost mobile users in particular a fortune to call. Campaigners have fought a long battle to persuade companies to stop using 084 and other revenue-sharing numbers. The success of the “Say no to 0870” website campaign was in part due to consumers’ huge annoyance at the use of such numbers by firms, government agencies and doctors’ surgeries. The Consumer Contracts Regulations (2013), which came into force in June 2014, outlaw companies from using telephone numbers that charge existing customers more than the “basic rate” charged to geographic-rate numbers that are prefixed 01, 02 and 03. Such numbers are free to call for any telecoms users with an inclusive calls package. “The fight goes on,” said Hickson, who says 50 councils still use 084 and 087 numbers. There is a list of the offending councils on his website. “These lines are used for payment of council tax, council house rent, overpayment recovery and other items such as parking fines,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/05/everybodys-going-dutch-amsterdam-to-curb-tourist-shops-amid-visitor-influx","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:07:29Z","webTitle":"Cheesed off: Amsterdam to curb tourist shops amid visitor influx","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/everybodys-going-dutch-amsterdam-to-curb-tourist-shops-amid-visitor-influx","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/05/everybodys-going-dutch-amsterdam-to-curb-tourist-shops-amid-visitor-influx","fields":{"headline":"Cheesed off: Amsterdam to curb tourist shops amid visitor influx","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amsterdam is banning new shops targeting tourists in the city’s historic centre in the latest attempt to reclaim it for residents. The city government announced on Thursday that ticket shops, bike rental companies, cheese shops and other retailers or attractions catering mainly or exclusively for tourists would be prevented from opening in parts of the Centre district. The number of shops selling food for immediate consumption, such as ice cream and doughnuts, will also be limited in about 40 shopping streets around the centre. Kajsa Ollongren, deputy mayor for economic affairs, said inner-city buildings designated for retail were increasingly being occupied by shops geared towards tourists, reducing the variety of outlets for residents. “The situation in our city centre requires firm measures. I see too many shops offering more of the same, solely targeting tourists.” Though tourists were “very welcome” in the city, she said she wanted to ensure the centre remained attractive and liveable for residents. The Centre district is also home to the majority of Amsterdam’s landmarks. The mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, and alderpersons (executive board) agreed the plan in consultation with the Centre district and with the consent of the city council. Though the restriction was effective immediately, a zoning plan would be introduced for the specific purpose and finalised next year. The city government would publish guidelines identifying what retailers would be affected, taking into account advertising, presentation, product ranges and business operations. The decision follows other steps by the city government to manage the impact of increasing numbers of tourists. About 17 million people visited the city of 850,000 residents in 2016, up from 12 million five years earlier.

Not everyone agrees about wars, foreign powers, terror, or drugs. Some are not fans of the current president. Some even risk unconventional “pro-choice” opinions. But the second amendment – virtually unrestricted access to guns – is sacrosanct. Across the spectrum of rightwing opinion, from libertarians to the Christian right, pretty much everyone agrees that Americans’ unique access to firearms should continue. We can put this down to any number of things, from the country’s history of frontier settler violence to the influence of the NRA. But there it is. When a massacre happens, rightwing pundits have work to do: they need to convince any waverers that easy access to semi-automatic weapons has nothing to do with mass-casualty shootings. They also need Republican legislators to remain aware that any moves to restrict access to guns will ruin their career. Accordingly, rightwing pundits have evolved a series of standard responses to mass murder. Today we’ll look at five of them, all of which have been in evidence this week. The conspiracy theory Conspiracy theory is now an ingrained response to mass shootings. If it was once a marginal pursuit, the “alt-right” surge and the election of a president who is himself an inveterate conspiracy theorist mean that these beliefs have a large audience and a new quasi-legitimacy. As you would expect from highly influential radio show host Alex Jones, his website and radio show are canvassing the full gamut of conspiracy theories about the event. So far, Jones and his reporters have put forth a number of theories: that the shooter was targeting conservatives; that he was connected to Islamic extremism; that he was in league with anti-fascists. Just as he did with Sandy Hook, Jones is amplifying any explanation that comes to hand except the most obvious one: that a white man with access to powerful weapons opened up on a crowd of innocent people. As the Guardian reported on Wednesday, there is now a cottage industry of YouTube-based conspiracy entrepreneurs whose theories about Las Vegas are at least as lurid as Jones’s. But conspiracy theory also comes in a “lite” version, which can be passed off later as “just asking questions”. The new Fox News recruit Tomi Lahren tweeted that “something just doesn’t add up” about the shooter. Later she added: “Media focusing on guns. There’s something bigger here.” As long as we’re focused on wild theories about who really pulled off the murders, we’re not talking about gun control. Gunsplaining Fussing over definitions and technical aspects of semi-automatic weapons is a good way to avoid questions about why civilians have them. Conservative pundits have feasted on Hillary Clinton’s awkward tweet about the dangers of silencers. On Fox &amp; Friends, Laura Ingraham said a silencer would melt an AR-15’s barrel, and said Clinton’s unfamiliarity with this fact was “despicable”. Rich Lowry of National Review sniffed: “If Hillary cares so much about the issue, she might take 10 minutes to learn something about it, but gun-controllers tend to be low-information advocates.” But the derision went beyond Clinton. Lowry’s former employee Stephen L Miller – not to be confused with the White House aide – turned in a characteristically snide column for Fox News, lambasting “elitists in media who refuse to understand even a basic grasp or terminology about a sacred constitutional right”. Breitbart offered a defense of “bump stock” devices – which effectively convert semi-automatic weapons into machine guns – disguised as an explainer. One of the “key facts” they offered was that banning them would be a “typical leftist war on the poor”. At the Daily Wire, Aaron Bandler did similar service on behalf of the mass shooter’s weapon of choice, the AR-15. All of this gunsplaining sidesteps the real source of public outrage about mass shootings, which neither embodies nor requires any special technical knowledge: people are regularly killed in large numbers because there are very few restrictions on the circulation of powerful firearms. The double down Some pundits calculate that the best form of defence is all-out attack. If events put trusty arguments in question, they figure, you can just reassert them at a higher volume. In the first paragraph of Conrad Black’s latest ramble for National Review, he offers a potted version of what rightwing pundits say after every massacre: gun control won’t work, it’s politically impossible, and anyway it’s a local matter. On Newsbusters, Michelle Malkin opted for the familiar tactic of arguing that since no single gun control measure will completely end massacres, none should be tried at all. A Rush Limbaugh rant on Wednesday depended on familiar, uncontested statistics about declines in overall murder rates. (These figures always seem to go missing when conservatives want to whip up fear about law and order). Naturally, Rush said nothing about the increasing frequency, and lethality, of mass shootings. And at libertarian site Reason, Jacob Sullum got to the emotional core of this form of rightwing bargaining with reality in the title of his article, ‘A massacre is not an argument’. Heartland whispering This is a tactic often deployed by the higher-toned rightwing commentators, where it is solemnly explained that the left’s hopeless confinement to coastal enclaves means they don’t really know what’s at stake in real America. Any criticism of guns thereby becomes an attack on the communities where guns are owned. A past master of this tactic is National Review’s David French. On Wednesday, he made the argument that, despite the NRA’s organizing and funding opposition to gun control, gun laws remain as they are because of the heartland’s adherence to American values. Deny, distract, delay If all else fails, rightwing commentators can simply try to derail the entire conversation in the hope that eventually the news cycle will move on. One way to do this is to focus on missteps from the left. This offers endless possibilities. WND and other outlets have picked up on the fact that a tiny newspaper published an off-colour cartoon on the massacre. Others have focused their outrage on celebrity activism from reliable punching bags like Michael Moore or Jimmy Kimmel. Another is to try to spread the blame around to groups who have no relationship to the events. The right has a whole roster of scapegoats available for this purpose. Frank Gaffney made a characteristic move on Breitbart radio by trying to turn the discussion to Islam, even though there are no indications that the shooter had any connection to the faith at all, let alone Jihadi terror groups. On Godfather Politics, after describing the shooter as a “crazed Democrat”, Keely Sharp turned on “Rino” (Republican in Name Only) Paul Ryan, who appears to have given up on deregulating silencers. Focusing ire on the “establishment” is a surefire way of avoiding the matter at hand. The overall goal is to defer any move on restricting the ownership and use of firearms until the moment where it is is even a remote political possibility has passed. At National Review, Kevin Williamson summed it all up in a headline: “It’s time to do nothing about guns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/06/spielberg-review-susan-lacy-deft-chronicling-of-an-american-cinematic-giant","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T12:00:52Z","webTitle":"Spielberg review – deft chronicling of an American cinematic giant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/06/spielberg-review-susan-lacy-deft-chronicling-of-an-american-cinematic-giant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/06/spielberg-review-susan-lacy-deft-chronicling-of-an-american-cinematic-giant","fields":{"headline":"Spielberg review – deft chronicling of an American cinematic giant","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After nearly a half-century making films, Steven Spielberg’s reputation is that of a populist rather than a subversive film-maker: a man whose body of work drove audiences to theaters more than it did defy artistic convention. There’s something unseemly about that, since Spielberg’s crowning achievement – his ability to give moviegoers what they wanted before they knew they wanted it – was rooted in pushing the proverbial envelope. Susan Lacy’s authorized HBO documentary is intent on revealing the true Spielberg, the artiste. To do so, she’s assembled an impressively tenured Greek chorus of film-makers, actors, technicians and critics. There are appearances by the director’s film-making peers: Brian de Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Martin Scorsese. Plus commentary from the stars, producers and collaborators on many of his films (Tom Hanks, John Williams, Janusz Kaminski, Daniel Day-Lewis, Harrison Ford et al). There’s even room for the critics who’ve both praised and pilloried his work, including Janet Maslin and AO Scott. The result is a panegyric that’s at times too saintly but is nonetheless a fascinating exploration of Spielberg’s career. Lacy sketches the director’s early life as a Jewish wunderkind from Phoenix, Arizona; the son of divorced parents (his mother Leah Adler was a homemaker, his formerly estranged father an engineer), who nearly abandoned his directorial ambitions after seeing Lawrence of Arabia as a teenager. (The film, as Spielberg explains, intimidated as much as it inspired him.) But by the age of 20 he was directing Joan Crawford in Rod Serling’s Night Gallery; then at 26, Goldie Hawn in The Sugarland Express, which Pauline Kael called “phenomenal” but said showed “no sign of the emergence of a new film artist”. At 30, Spielberg was cavorting with the “movie brats” – Coppola, De Palma, Scorsese and Lucas – who lavish their former fraternity brother with praise and chart his artistic growth, recounting the director’s metamorphosis from boy wonder to box-office moneyspinner to eventual auteur. “The kind of movie he had a sense for was also the kind of movie the audience had a sense for,” Coppola notes. Lacy, who previously directed PBS’s American Masters series, does the same, in semi-chronological fashion, with most of the Spielberg oeuvre, from Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark to Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List, for which the most time is reserved. “Making Schindler’s List made me reconcile with all the vainglorious reasons I hid from my Jewishness,” says Spielberg. “I avoided therapy because movies are my therapy.” She pays justifiably cursory attention to his less-loved films like Hook, Always, Amistad, The Terminal and Warhorse before pivoting towards the director’s later work, Lincoln and Bridge of Spies, both of which are contextualized as products of his growing interest in democracy and moral rectitude. By omitting some of Spielberg’s lesser work, and its attendant criticisms, the film veers dangerously close to hagiography, but while other documentaries, like The Shark is Still Working and Spielberg: Steven On Set, have concerned themselves with smaller slices of his career, in Spielberg you never doubt that there’s more than enough material to chew on, and justify the film’s considerable length – it comes in at over two and a half hours. Spielberg also zeroes in on accomplishments which were groundbreaking at the time though elementary today: the moving dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are compared to the advent of the talkies, the lesbian kiss in The Color Purple is rightfully critiqued for its tepidness, and the red coat in Schindler’s List, the movie’s only burst of color, is hailed as a stroke of crimson genius. The only real tension in the film is relegated to subtext. When Spielberg, in an interview from the 70s, is asked whether his crowd-pleasing films qualify as real art, he somewhat squeamishly notes the pretension in the very question. Lacy glosses over the director’s complicated relationship with his father, too, which took shape in the filial unease of Close Encounters and the tales of torn, suburban families that appear in so much of his work. That’s not to say Spielberg is all surface-level sycophancy. As a primer for those less familiar with his films – a category as spare as those films are abundant – it functions quite nicely. And as a history of the advancements of late-20th century American cinema, it’s also remarkably precise, even though it takes the work of just a single director as its subject. But that’s a testament to the man’s outsize influence on film, one that can’t be measured in profit or Oscars. Accordingly, Spielberg shows the extraordinary life of a cinephile turned director, whose work has left an indelible mark, one that’s perhaps so entrenched that we often fail to notice it. As Dustin Hoffman says near the end of Lacy’s documentary, “Steven Spielberg is like a guy who works with Steven Spielberg.” That is to say: curious, learned and zealous, both humble student and consummate master. Spielberg airs on Saturday 7 October on HBO in the US at 8pm EST, and on Sky Atlantic in the UK later this autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-young-chef-of-the-year-tom-adams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"OFM Awards 2017: Young Chef of the Year – Tom Adams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-young-chef-of-the-year-tom-adams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-young-chef-of-the-year-tom-adams","fields":{"headline":"OFM Awards 2017: Young Chef of the Year – Tom Adams","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"“I’m not sure I merit one of these,” says Tom Adams of his OFM Young Chef of the Year gong. “I’m very flattered, but what constitutes ‘young’, exactly?” That’s a bit rich, coming from a 29-year-old who, with his mop of blond hair, huge specs and checked shirt, bears more than a passing resemblance to an unkempt Milky Bar Kid. Mind you, in his defence, Adams has worked in kitchens for almost half his life. He’s probably best known for Pitt Cue Co, which he co-founded in 2011, when he was all of 22. It was only meant to be temporary summer thing in a food truck on London’s South Bank, but the clamour for Adams’ inspired take on barbecue soon led to a bricks-and-mortar incarnation, first in Soho and later in the City. “I hadn’t a clue how to run a professional kitchen,” Adams admits now, “so I just winged it.” As if that wasn’t enough to be going on with, in summer 2016 he opened Coombeshead Farm in east Cornwall, and a little over a year later, this idyllic spot in a lush valley between Bodmin and Dartmoor is top of the to-do list of any British food obsessive worth their salt. That’s mainly because Adams has taken the now semi-compulsory farm-to-fork trope and turned up the dial, with just about everything they serve grown, reared and made on site. But it’s also because Coombeshead is a joint venture with April Bloomfield, the Brummie-born restaurant queen of the Big Apple. Rumours of a Bloomfield project on these shores have circulated on and off for years, but no one in a million years expected it to wind up in the deepest, darkest west country sticks. Adams, for his part, says it was kind of inevitable that he’d end up working in food: he was raised on a farm near Winchester where “eating was at the forefront of everything. You get a far broader knowledge of what you eat when you grow up in the countryside. Nothing mind-blowing, just proper seasonal cooking.” For his 16th birthday, as if to mark her son’s epiphany, Adams’s mother gave Tom his first pig. The next step was logical, to Adams’s mind at least, and he spent two school summer holidays working at Neal’s Yard Dairy, before enrolling at Westminster catering college as soon as he could at the age of 17. But then he met Jeremy Lee – at the time head chef at Terence Conran’s Blueprint Cafe, now at Quo Vadis – and decided the best way to learn wasn’t to go to college, but to start cooking for real. As Lee remembers it: “His thoughtful approach and intellect already suggested he was a cook apart. When he left for Pitt Cue – and to start his affair with mangalitza pigs – I could only applaud.” Ah, yes, pigs – they’re a bit of a theme, aren’t they? Adams blushes. “Er, you could say that,” he says with a faraway look that suggests this is no mere fling. His passion for porkers wasn’t consummated in the happiest of circumstances. A year after opening Pitt Cue Co, Adams took his first days off in six months to go on a research trip to the US, where he started feeling “a bit strange”. He put this down to stress and overwork, but the night he flew home, he took a turn for the worse – “I couldn’t actually breathe” – and his girlfriend, Lottie Mew (also a partner in Coombeshead), rushed him to A&amp;E. There, they whisked him straight to the cardiac ward, but he passed out before he even got there. “Turned out I had a virus that caused a swelling of the heart. It was touch and go for a bit, but it all turned out fine.” The ensuing enforced six-month lay-off was when the idea for Coombeshead – and its pigs – began forming in Adams’s mind. “Well, there’s only so much sport on telly you can watch.” So he bought four mangalitzas, as you do. “It was just to keep me entertained.” (During this “time off”, he also wrote the acclaimed Pitt Cue Co Cookbook.) Those pigs taught Adams “a new perspective on what I’d been doing with my life, so when I finally did go back to work, I began spending half the week with our suppliers in Cornwall. Three, four years later, I knew this was what I wanted to do, and where I wanted to do it.” coombesheadfarm.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/07/travel-insurance-airline-bust-monarch-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Does your travel insurance cover an airline going bust?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/07/travel-insurance-airline-bust-monarch-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/07/travel-insurance-airline-bust-monarch-policy","fields":{"headline":"Does your travel insurance cover an airline going bust?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If you have an annual travel insurance policy you may want to dig out the paperwork and find out whether you have “scheduled airline failure” cover, because given the state of the industry at the moment, you will almost certainly want a policy that includes it. In the wake of last weekend’s Monarch collapse, Guardian Money has been examining the terms and conditions of some of the UK’s most popular travel insurance policies. The headline findings? A surprisingly large group of insurers, including some big-name banks, will decline to step in and pay up if your chosen airline collapses either before you are due to travel or while you are away. Travel policies offered via paid-for bank accounts with NatWest/RBS don’t offer scheduled airline failure cover, and neither does HSBC for its Premier account customers, though it said it would “consider” claims following an airline collapse. Another of the UK’s biggest insurers, Axa, does not provide this cover on either its own annual or single-trip policies. Lloyds Bank’s popular annual travel policies do not feature the cover, but Axa, which underwrites Lloyds’ policies, has said the bank’s “travel disruption” cover would pay up to £5,000 per person in the event that the insured individual can’t reclaim the extra costs from another source. Nationwide, another big travel insurer via its Flex and FlexPlus accounts, does provide scheduled airline failure insurance. Overall, about half of UK travel policies offer it, according to the analysts Defaqto. Until relatively recently, scheduled airline failure cover was rare. Most people relied on the Air Travel Organiser’s Licence (Atol) scheme, which protects package holiday bookings, or the protection offered by credit cards. But the rise of the low-cost carriers and the fact that consumers are now more likely to put together their own holiday packages means you will want an insurance policy that specifically includes this cover. That is particularly the case if you are booking expensive peak-time flights that would cost a lot to replace at the last minute. While the Civil Aviation Authority has stepped in to help passengers caught up in the Monarch collapse, most passengers are left scrabbling for replacements when a carrier ceases trading. According to ProtectMyHoliday.com, there have been 254 global airline failures in the last decade. When XL Airways collapsed in 2008, it left 200,000 passengers holding worthless bookings. Those who had not paid using a credit card were left relying on travel insurers, who in most cases refused to pay out. Today, insurers offering scheduled airline failure cover typically state that they would only step in where the other protections – Atol or credit card – have declined to pay out. It can be hard for consumers to know whether they have cover or not. In many cases Money had to phone the supplier as the T&amp;Cs were so poorly worded as to be ambiguous. Defaqto, which gives all insurance products a star rating, said this week that 49% of annual travel policies include the cover, but it declined to name which big ones don’t. Consumers can’t buy a Defaqto five-star policy and assume it offers airline failure cover because many of its five-star polices do not. Money has found that in general only the priciest policies include it – and the amount of cover varies enormously. Tesco offers three levels of cover on its travel policies – Value, Standard and Finest – and only the latter policy provides scheduled airline failure cover. Admiral’s Premier policies offer it (up to £3,000) while its Standard and Backpacker policies don’t. Direct Line and Saga both offer the cover. Only LV=’s Premier policies have it. John Lewis only provides the cover on its more expensive policies, and only up to £1,500, which may not be enough to replace many long-haul flights. InsureandGo does offer the cover as standard – and up to £5,000. Georgie Frost, head of consumer affairs at Gocompare, says last week’s events have pushed the matter centre stage. “It is rare for such a large airline as Monarch to fail, but smaller airlines have gone bust in the past, leaving passengers stranded. “If you take out scheduled airline failure insurance, you’ll receive up to a specified amount per person for any irrecoverable flight costs if the airline goes bust before your trip, or while you’re already away. “The Monarch failure is also a reminder of the need to protect your holiday with insurance as soon as you book it. The majority of people buy travel insurance the week before they fly, which means they miss out on valuable benefits like cancellation cover,” she says. Always fly by credit card The Monarch collapse is a reminder that consumers should always use a credit card when buying flights, as it in effect insures the individual against the airline’s collapse. When you buy something costing more than £100 and pay by credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable to provide the service. If the supplier or airline isn’t around to provide the item or flight, the bank is responsible and will step in. The protection was enshrined in section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, but there are crucial caveats. To get the protection you have to have booked the flight and paid the airline directly – not via an agent or a booking website – using your credit card. Guardian Money is regularly contacted by people who still use debit cards to book flights and holidays. Just don’t. Some Monarch customers found that the Atol protection did not apply to them. Many will be able to apply to their credit card provider for a full refund. Debit card payers instead have to file a “chargeback” claim. These can succeed, but there are no guarantees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/05/syria-keep-world-cup-hopes-alive-after-al-somas-late-leveller-against-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T15:02:08Z","webTitle":"Syria boost World Cup hopes after Al Soma's late leveller against Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/05/syria-keep-world-cup-hopes-alive-after-al-somas-late-leveller-against-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/05/syria-keep-world-cup-hopes-alive-after-al-somas-late-leveller-against-australia","fields":{"headline":"Syria boost World Cup hopes after Al Soma's late leveller against Australia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Syria’s hopes of reaching their first-ever World Cup are alive and kicking after they came from behind to grab a controversial first-leg draw against Australia in Malacca. The Socceroos held a solitary one-goal lead for 45 minutes after Robbie Kruse’s strike in the first half but a disputed penalty, tucked home by Omar Al Soma with five minutes left, gave the Syrians a lifeline going into the return leg in Sydney. The Australia coach, Ange Postecoglou, had faced a torrent of criticism after his side failed to qualify automatically on goal difference for the 2018 World Cup. He rang the changes, handing the Suwon Bluewings defender Matt Jurman his international debut and surprisingly leaving the Celtic playmaker Tom Rogic on the bench. In hot and steamy conditions, and on a dire pitch at Hang Jebat Stadium, the Socceroos struggled to find their rhythm early on. Jurman had a chance in the second minute, after Matthew Leckie was hauled down on the edge of the box, but the centre back’s header from the free-kick that followed sailed wide. Australia should have taken the lead in the 17th minute after a wonderful long-range shot by the stand-in captain, Mark Milligan. But Ibrahim Alma pulled off a spectacular save to keep the score at 0-0. Leckie was causing the Syrian defence some problems and he blazed over the bar 12 minutes later after Josh Risdon’s cutback. The Qasioun Eagles were content to sit back and play on the counter, lumping long balls up to the striker Al Soma. The forward set up Omar Khribin with a great cross in the 34th minute but Khribin’s attempt was unsuccessful. The two attackers combined in similar circumstances four minutes later but Khribin’s ambitious bicycle kick failed to trouble Mat Ryan. The breakthrough came from the Socceroos in the form of Leckie in the 40th minute. He was released on the right by Milos Degenek and the winger beat his man, cutting inside to release a shot that was deflected in by Kruse on the Vfl Bochum forward’s 29th birthday. Syria started the second half with intent, with Mahmoud Al Mawas forcing Ryan into his first save of the game. They were, however, reprieved in the 49th minute as Tomi Juric beat Alma twice, only for both shots to hit a post. They were riding their luck but soon the roles were reversed after Australia needed Leckie to block Khribin’s drive, after the ball kindly fell to him on the edge of the box. The game was opening up as both teams surged forward. First, Soma headed over from a corner and then he should have scored after an exquisite cutback, if not for a timely tackle by Degenek. Syria continued to pose more problems, a series of free-kicks and corners keeping the men in green and gold under heavy pressure. Postecoglou tried to shore up his midfield by bringing Kruse off for Massimo Luongo. It was a nervy final 20 minutes for Australia. Syria’s talisman Firas Al Khatib, controversially left on the bench, was finally introduced in the 75th minute. His impact was almost immediate as he launched a dangerous cross into Ryan’s box. Then the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion keeper somehow managed to deflect a shot from Al Khatib’s pass on to the post and miraculously out of the goal. Syria kept probing and eventually got their reward. Leckie went from hero to villain when he was harshly judged to have jostled an opponent when jumping up to challenge for a header. The referee pointed to the spot and Al Soma calmly stepped up to convert past Ryan. The drama did not stop there as both sides had the chance to win the game in the frenetic closing stages. First Alma brilliantly palmed away a Trent Sainsbury header and then Ryan was forced into saving spectacular shot by Moayad Ajan from distance. But it ended with the spoils shared and all eyes on Sydney in five days time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/05/dame-vera-lynn-aged-100-is-top-selling-female-album-seller-for-this-year","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T15:10:47Z","webTitle":"Dame Vera Lynn leads list of this year's top-selling female artists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/05/dame-vera-lynn-aged-100-is-top-selling-female-album-seller-for-this-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/05/dame-vera-lynn-aged-100-is-top-selling-female-album-seller-for-this-year","fields":{"headline":"Dame Vera Lynn leads list of this year's top-selling female artists","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dame Vera Lynn, the wartime singer who celebrated her 100th birthday this year, has sold more copies than any other album released by a female artist in the UK this year. The “forces’ sweetheart” beat younger competitors including Dua Lipa, Lana Del Rey and Zara Larsson to top the new list released by the Official Charts Company. Lynn’s latest album was only beaten in sales by Little Mix’s Glory Days and Adele’s 25, but those albums were released in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Released in March, the album, named 100, went to number three in the charts, which makes Lynn the oldest living artist to score a top 10 album on the Official Album Charts. The album is the 28th best seller of the year overall in the chart, which combines physical and download sales with the number of times it was streamed. It features re-orchestrated versions of her best-known songs, cover versions by singers including Alfie Boe and Aled Jones and a previously unreleased recording of Lynn singing Sailing, the 1972 Sutherland Brothers song later made famous by Rod Stewart. “It’s truly humbling that people still enjoy these songs from so many years ago, reliving the emotions of that time,” Lynn said earlier this year. “I was after all just doing my job as a singer – and it’s so wonderful for me to hear my songs again so beautifully presented in a completely new way.” It is yet to be seen whether Lynn can hold on to her title, with albums from the likes of Taylor Swift, Pink and Kelly Clarkson to be released later this year. Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran’s Shape Of You is the biggest single of the year so far.

He has a charred kind of Edinburgh accent, and a fierce intensity of expression. Rankin has rendered cooking to its basic elements. He buys whole animals into his kitchen, butchers them on site, and holds every last scrap of them, brilliantly, to the flames. Meat hasn’t always been his thing: he used to be a fish cook. But he knew when he came here that he “wanted to play around with live fire techniques and develop that. And I knew that I liked fairly punchy flavours and didn’t want to hold back from that”. He grins. “But no, when I started I never quite imagined this,” he gestures around the cavernous underground space, which has the look of a subterranean speakeasy furnished by Dante Alighieri, stools circling the bar which circles the fire – and above it prime slices of cow and pig and goat – and low-lit confessional booths around the room’s edges. “I would have been quite happy to be head chef of a little 30-seater Soho basement.” Rankin called his book about cooking meat Low and Slow, and there is something of that pace about his own career. It is perhaps no coincidence that his first – fast – food enterprise went up in smoke. Having graduated in acoustic science and worked as a sound engineer, he opened a sandwich bar in an industrial park outside Glasgow early in the millennium. And then a couple of others. And then one in Edinburgh, where he lived. And then three in London. And then it all went belly up. He was in his late 20s, by then, and, he suggests, although he just about “managed to get out without being skinned alive” was stuck for what to do next. “Me and my ex-wife were quite competitive about cooking. She was better than me,” he recalls. “I wanted to do the sandwich thing again but with more of a focus on food. I went back to culinary school – and thought I’d teach myself in a few kitchens. One result of that was that I became much more competitive than my ex-wife.” Was he choosing specific kitchens to learn in? “Fifty per cent was luck,” he says. When he was at culinary school he read a review of Nuno Mendes’s supper club on Hackney’s Kingsland Road and phoned him to ask if he needed a hand. Then when he left his French cooking school, he called a recruitment consultant with an unusual request: “I need a hard kitchen.” The consultant asked him what he meant. He said: “You know, 18-hour shifts, brilliant but difficult chef, that kind of thing.” The consultant sent him to Pennyhill Park Hotel where he worked under two-star Michelin chef Michael Wignall, which proved perfect. “I was 31 years old by this stage, so I figured I would learn more in long shifts than regular ones,” Rankin says. “I had to accelerate.” He moved around, worked with Gary Rhodes, and noticed he was no longer getting shouted at. Rankin fully came into his own at Pitt Cue Co, the cultish corner cafe that began life as a trailer on the South Bank and ignited a barbecue obsession. “It was great, but you couldn’t make money,” he says. “We had 28 covers and 60 people queuing round the block. It’s tough to sustain a business based on having people wait for three hours to get fed.” The solution, with his business partner Sam Lee, was to do Temper at scale, but preserve the excitement. Rankin remembers what it is like to fail, so when Temper opened on Bonfire Night 2016 it was with meticulous business planning and a degree of fear. The confidence he had was based on a philosophy that insists that “we have to be able to buy the best meat possible and not overuse it” – and also that “people are generally pretty rubbish at cooking it”. Restaurants, he suggests, tend to focus on how to serve it quite quickly – Temper’s fire pit allows for time and space. Butchering their own carcasses lets Rankin take “nose to tail” a step further: “I don’t like the way we buy meat in restaurants and supermarkets,” he says. “The way we all buy certain cuts. I buy a great cow, and then work out how to sell the whole thing. People come in and say they want a sirloin and we may not have any. There are maybe six kilos of sirloin on a carcass of 600 kilos. Every single part of the cow is delicious to eat, it’s just knowing how to cook it. How do you make the shin delicious, the chuck, the rib cap? That is the basis of what we do here.” If all that meat sounds like it is going against the food politics of our time, Rankin is prepared to take on vegan all-comers. Their arguments, he says, are too often based on American industrial intensive-farming methods. “The problems arise from trying to grow things in places that aren’t suitable. Much of our land won’t support arable farming. Should a farmer whose farm has had cattle in the Isle of Mull for 400 years stop farming because of something that happens in America? These people sit there drinking coconut milk and goji berries flown half way around the world and telling me that I’m ruining the planet?” He smiles. “That pisses me off.” Some days Temper has 600 diners. They go through about three-quarters of a cow a week. A new venture near the Bank of England, Temper City, serves mainly curries, in part because the sauces and stocks are a great way of using every bit of the lamb and goat. But, as Rankin and Temper make very clear, “People don’t come out to dinner to be educated, they go out to have a good time.” Temper is never about “Ooh, look what he can do with a sauce!” he suggests. But if you come here on a busy night – and there is deep hip hop or 80s music playing, the place is filled with smoke, people drinking shots and having a good time – and you don’t have a good time, then Neil Rankin would like to think it is more about you than it is about his restaurant. 19-25 Broadwick Street, London W1F 0DF; temperrestaurant.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2017/oct/10/education-male-schools-policy-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Let’s free education from the hands of the stale, pale male | Fiona Millar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/10/education-male-schools-policy-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/oct/10/education-male-schools-policy-ideas","fields":{"headline":"Let’s free education from the hands of the stale, pale male","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Why can’t we take politics out of education? It is a frequent refrain, asked by someone at nearly every headteacher conference I have spoken at in the last few years. And it’s understandable. The level of change foisted on schools has been wearisome, but today the waters seem oddly becalmed. The conference season passed with no eye-catching announcements. Is it really only a year since the education secretary, Justine Greening, who this year hailed her own comprehensive education from the podium, was defending the expansion of grammar schools? Or less than a decade since the free school founder Katharine Birbalsingh shook up Tory delegates with her claim that the education system was “broken”? The words “free schools” or “grammars” barely crossed any lips in the entire conference season – a reminder of how many pointless initiatives there have been lately. The most arresting news story might even have been the appointment of a new education minister. In case you missed it, Sir Theodore Agnew, a former Tory donor and academy trust chair, has been fast-tracked to the House of Lords to become under-secretary of state for the school system. He replaces Lord Nash, another former Conservative donor, who chaired an academy trust before spending four years running the school system, of which academy trusts are such an important part. Agnew has already chaired the Department for Education’s Academies Board, during which time he oversaw the regional schools commissioner Tim Coulson, who in turn oversaw his own academy trust. That same RSC is now chair of governors at the Great Yarmouth Charter Academy, coincidentally part of Agnew’s trust and notorious for ruling that malingering children should vomit in a bucket and always smile at teachers. There may be no new policies on offer, but those old Goveian revolving doors are still spinning. Elsewhere, questions of funding aside, these humdrum times do provide respite for schools, still reeling from the introduction of new tests, exams, performance measures and curriculum. But education is political. The government funds public services, and how we educate our children goes to the heart of what sort of society we want to see. Both Greening and her opposite number, Angela Rayner, spoke sincerely about their goal of more equality of opportunity for all young people. Yet we are so far from achieving it. According to the Education Policy Institute it will be 50 years before we reach an equitable education system where disadvantaged pupils don’t fall behind. And it is by no means clear where the urgently needed refresh of the market-driven policies of the last 30 years will come from. As one headteacher told me last week: “We’re stuck.” Rather than taking politics out of education, a solution might be to take education out of the political cycle. There is too much tinkering driven by electioneering or the demands of a 24/7 media. It would take a bold politician to do it, but what if she or he committed to a cross-party group to look at the evidence and solutions on the most intractable issues, such as white British underachievement, and then implement the findings? It would be a churlish opponent who refused to take part. The gene pool needs to be widened when it comes to ideas. The ministerial/academy revolving door extends to the policy world, where the same old, often wealthy, pale, male establishment figures with links to chains of schools seem to pop up again and again. The ubiquitous Lord Agnew has been a trustee of two prominent thinktanks. Where are the professional, parent, even pupil voices – the people who are often experimented on? This month marks the fifth anniversary of the first meeting of the Headteachers’ Roundtable. At the time they constituted a powerful new voice in the education world by harnessing the views of professionals via social media. When they meet at the Guardian this week, we will be able to hear how much influence they feel they have really had. One of their original ideas was for curriculum and assessment to be taken out of the hands of politicians and handed to an independent body on a 20-year licence. Politicians rightly want to set the big aspiration goals but would it be such a bad idea if other experts were constitutionally obliged to contribute to the means? Parliament resumes this week but there is no education legislation on the horizon and no big ideas coming down the track. It might be time for something new."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/11/nation-capital-erbil-kurdish","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T06:30:04Z","webTitle":"Every nation needs a capital: how Erbil turned itself Kurdish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/11/nation-capital-erbil-kurdish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/11/nation-capital-erbil-kurdish","fields":{"headline":"Every nation needs a capital: how Erbil turned itself Kurdish","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The citadel in Erbil can lay claim to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited place on Earth. But towering over the old mud-brick structures, one recent addition on the hilltop stands out: a brand new gate. The gate was built to replace another thrown up by Saddam Hussein, just one in a long line of different rulers – from the Assyrians to the Mongols to the Ottomans – who have incorporated Erbil into their empires. But since Saddam’s fall in 2003, a clear identity has come to dominate the city’s public spaces: Kurdish. Since 2006, Kurdish authorities have been working to renovate the citadel, which was badly neglected under Saddam. As well as shoring up the crumbling homes and clearing out squatters, they have also scrubbed away any sign of the former dictator, whose traces they are eager to erase. Near the gate, now reconstructed in an older style, an enormous Kurdish flag – a red, white and green tricolour with a sun emblem – flies from the citadel. Along the main roads radiating out from a central hill, there is a Kurdish music archive, a Kurdish costume gallery and a Kurdish textile museum. The idea, says Sertip Mustafa, assistant manager of the textile museum, is to maintain a culture nearly wiped out by Saddam’s genocidal assaults on the Kurds. “Every people needs to take an interest in its culture, in its traditions, in order to preserve itself,” he said, sitting among a colourful display of rugs and handicrafts. So far, the efforts seem to have paid off. The city has steadily emerged as the capital of Kurdish Iraq, the dominant political and economic centre of a roughly 35 million strong ethnic group whose politics have been defined largely by division, their homeland split since the first world war between Iraq, Syria, Iran and Turkey. When the US invasion toppled Saddam in 2003, ending a decade of sanctions and making Erbil the heart of the first officially autonomous Kurdish region, Kurds have flocked to the city, fleeing repression and conflict or simply lured by its boomtown economy. A wave of oil firms, property developers, chain stores, hotels and consulates has inundated the city, reshaping its character and pushing its borders out into the surrounding plains and scrubland. Kurdish migrants from neighboring Syria, Iran and Turkey have poured in, joining migrant workers from Europe to South Asia, and refugees from across Iraq. Over about a decade, the population nearly doubled. “It was like an explosion,” says Chwas Sabr, a former urban planning official of how the rush of oil money and government jobs drew hundreds of thousands to the city. Yet the very names of the neighbourhoods in Erbil’s old city, a bustling warren of backstreets, cafes and markets, attest to a more complicated history. There is an old Jewish quarter, as well as a district named simply Arab. About a century ago, under Ottoman rule, the area was populated largely by Turkmen. Kurds who arrived to Erbil from the surrounding villages tended to learn Turkish, says Saadi Haruti, a professor of history at Erbil’s Salahaddin University. “Sometimes they even forgot their own language.” Yet, by the time of the Kurdish revolts against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, migration from the countryside had made Erbil a more distinctly Kurdish space. After a no-fly zone was imposed by a US-led military coalition in 1991, giving Kurds de facto self-rule from Baghdad, the city faced a new set of questions. How should a Kurdish capital look? Which names should grace its street signs, which statues its squares? How should its history be emphasised, and what logic should guide its development? Today, the memory of Erbil’s multicultural past is hardly evident. In the city’s downtown today, everything celebrates Kurdish figures. There are streets named after Mustafa Barzani, historic leader of the Kurdish independence movement and father of current President Masoud Barzani, and Salahaddin, a Kurd who led campaigns against the Crusaders. Statues celebrate Giwi Mukryani, a Kurdish publisher, and Sheikh Mahmoud Barzanji, who led revolts against Iraq’s colonial British authorities. Nearby, men in traditional Kurdish salwar pants and turbans sip tea in cafes plastered with images of fighters of the Kurdish peshmerga, whose name means “those who face death”, while traditional Kurdish music plays. The tricolour flag hangs from bunting, joined by banners urging “yes” votes in the controversial independence referendum, held last month. It would seem a Disneyfied spectacle – Kurdish culture fetishised and commodified for tourists – but for the fact that there are few tourists here, and the intended audience seems to be the Kurds themselves. But if one theme of Erbil’s development has been the studious preservation and curation of Kurdish identity, another is the almost complete neglect of that identity during the city’s breakneck expansion. Outside the citadel, the communal atmosphere swiftly collapses into a sprawl of hotels, freeways and malls. Inasmuch as there was any template for this stage of Erbil’s development, it was not any idea of Kurdistan’s past, but the vision of the future represented by Dubai, a regional byword for wealth and prosperity. Flush with oil revenues, Kurdish officials consciously strove to emulate the Emirati city by fashioning Erbil into a regional hub of tourism and trade. When oil prices collapsed in 2014 and Islamic State militants swept across northern Iraq, dreams of a new Dubai largely faded as well. Today, unfinished concrete skeletons and empty storefronts dot the city’s middle bands. An effort to give what’s left a Kurdish flavour feels slightly absurd: one display of statues celebrating great women of the past, such as poet and historian Mastoureh Ardalan and martyred activist Leyla Qasim, stands at the entrance to a vast mall. In other cases, they hint at deeper complexities and divisions. Sami Abdulrahman Park, built on a former military base, was named for a figure from the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) who was killed in a suicide bombing in 2004. But to supporters of the main rival party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the name is a reminder of the bitter civil war they once fought against fellow Kurds in the 1990s, when Abdulrahman invited Saddam’s troops to help oust them. As Erbil expands ever outwards, planners must decide not only how to navigate such contradictions but also how to tame the uncontrolled development of the city’s middle belts. To that end, Abdelmomen Maroof, director of urban planning at the regional government’s Ministry of Municipalities and Tourism, says the city has devised a “Green Belt” of parks, farms and wooded areas to control urban sprawl and exploit Kurdistan’s naturally rich – but highly neglected – agriculture. To succeed, Maroof says, this vision could benefit from the city’s history: not a falsely unified vision of the past, but one that embraces its historical diversity. The area’s older-style buildings, he notes, were generally better suited to their environments than today’s. “In the past you’d go from one village to another village, and you’d know there must be something different, because here they used brick, here they used natural stone, and here they used mud,” Maroof said. “But now everywhere is cement blocks.” As the region lurches toward talks with Baghdad meant to head toward secession, the city’s visible marks of identity will be less important than whether the region it governs will be able stand on its own in independence. Sitting beneath the citadel drinking tea, Nabaz Garda, a 57-year-old accountant, said corruption and over-investment in consumption without focus on infrastructure or education had left the Kurdish economy – and therefore the region’s people – vulnerable. “The Kurdish people struggled for all this time to win their identity – their language, their newspapers, their books, Kurdish education, the media, holidays. Thank God, this Kurdish identity is here,” he said. “But if we talk about the economy? It’s fragile.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/07/secondhand-bookshops-diary-of-a-bookseller-shaun-bythell","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Shaun Bythell: the bestselling subject in my shop?

Railway books","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Up at 8am. Breakfast and two cups of tea later, I opened the shop, [in Wigtown, Dumfries and Galloway] at 9 am, brought the bins in from the street, then spent five minutes looking for the book orders, both of which were about trains. Before I bought the shop, I had no idea what the bestselling subject would be. I certainly would not have put my money on railways, yet the reality is that this is my bestseller. I packed the online orders and began pricing up fresh stock from the piles of boxes around the shop. Online sales used to account for about 20% of the shop’s turnover, but since an Amazon algorithm suspended my seller account in February 2016, this figure has dropped to about 5%. The telephone rang at 9.30am. It was a woman in Milngavie (north of Glasgow, about three hours drive away) who is retiring into a smaller house and has 800 books to sell. This is predominantly how we acquire our stock. If I was to point out one inaccuracy in the wonderful TV comedy Black Books it would be that when he runs out of stock, Manny calls a central warehouse and orders more. There isn’t one. Or at least, if there is, no second-hand bookseller that I know is aware of it. The normal way books find their way here is downsizing or death, and consequently I spend a lot of time driving to the houses of the retired or recently bereaved and buying their books. I arranged to visit the woman at her house in Milngavie in three weeks’ time. At 10.30 am Desmond, a Northern Irish man who has retired to Galloway with his wife, Anne, called in. We chatted about the second edition of his book, which is about the history of wildfowling in the area. This year’s Wigtown book festival ended on Sunday, which means two things: the number of customers through the door of the shop each day falls from about 600 to about 30, and of those, probably fewer than one in three will buy something. It also means that the shop and the house have to be put back in order following an invasion of authors; my drawing room is taken over as the writers’ retreat, where visiting writers are fed and watered every day for almost two weeks. The caterer takes over the kitchen, and the spare bedrooms are stuffed full of authors. It’s a fortnight without privacy. At 11.45am a tall American man with a grey, meticulously trimmed beard and dark glasses came to the counter and said good evening before asking me if I bought books. I told him that I did, but it depended on what they were, at which point he stared silently at me for several seconds before explaining that he’d inherited them from a “preacher”. When I told him that we were not buying theology at the moment, he added that there were several by James Stewart, in what was clearly an attempt to sway me. I told him that I’d never heard of him. He replied: “What? You’ve never heard of James Alexander Stewart? He was a preacher in the 1950s.” This sort of person annoys me. He lives in his little evangelical bubble and expects everyone to know as much as he does about some obscure Glaswegian prelate, and scoffs with disapproval when someone hasn’t heard of his religious cult hero. At 1pm a woman brought in two boxes of modern Agatha Christie reprints, and two boxes of horse racing books. Horse racing books are difficult to sell, so I rejected them but gave her £50 for the Agatha Christies. Two booksellers from the Peak District who until today I have only known on Twitter turned up just after 3pm. They’re on their way to Fife, and asked if they could stay for a night en route, which inevitably means tonight will be an evening of sharing stories of dreadful customers and trying to survive in a business which has been brought to its knees by Amazon. I’ll go to the Co-op and buy more wine. At 4.50pm, a woman came into the shop, marched up to the counter and said “On the Road”, so I asked her if she was looking for a copy of Kerouac’s book of the same title, or just making a comment on her life. When I told her that we’d sold our only copy of it last week during the book festival, she marched straight for the door and barked “Disgraceful. I’m going to buy it on Amazon” and left.

Albert Dryden, 76, had been serving life in prison for the murder of Harry Collinson, principal planning officer with Derwentside council in County Durham, in June 1991. Collinson, 46, had been overseeing an operation to demolish a bungalow that Dryden had built without planning permission on his country lane smallholding in the village of Butsfield. Diggers were on standby to start the demolition and TV camera crews and news reporters were at the site to witness the negotiations when Dryden opened fire, killing Collinson. Footage showing the moment Dryden started firing his first world war gun was shown on Look North, the BBC’s local evening news bulletin. The former steelworker was also convicted of the attempted murder of Michael Dunstan, a council solicitor, and of wounding PC Stephen Campbell and Look North reporter Tony Belmont with intent. After Collinson, a father of two, fell mortally wounded into a ditch, Dryden fired two more shots into his heart and brain. During the trial at Newcastle crown court in April 1992, Dryden claimed he was mentally ill and not responsible for his actions. He has previously had four parole applications rejected. Alex Watson, a Durham county councillor and district council leader at the time, said Dryden had been released after 26 years because of his ill health and that he would be looked after in a residential care home. “He’s been released as he has had a severe stroke and it’s left him unable to talk,” he said. “He’s not in a good condition but he’s recovered enough to be released and placed in a residential home where there will be a measure of security. “It was a tragic situation, no doubt about it. He said he was defending his home but the murder can never be excused. It was cold-blooded murder.” Watson added: “He was well-known for having guns and ammunition but he was not taken seriously enough at the time. It was unbelievable, no one would have believed you if you had said this could happen before it did. It’s a regret of mine that I was not there because if I had been I could have tried to stop him.” Speaking to the Northern Echo, Collinson’s older brother, Roy, said: “Personally, I couldn’t bloody care less what happens to Albert Dryden. If he dies slowly, that’s good. I’ll be very happy about that. “He never showed one bit of remorse in all the 26 years he has been in prison. He still tried to justify his actions for some God-unknown reason. “If the police had done their job properly, my brother wouldn’t have been killed and Albert Dryden wouldn’t have spent all this time in prison.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/08/the-reagan-show-ronald-former-american-president-film-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T07:00:44Z","webTitle":"The Reagan Show review – how Ronald mastered the message","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/08/the-reagan-show-ronald-former-american-president-film-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/08/the-reagan-show-ronald-former-american-president-film-review","fields":{"headline":"The Reagan Show review – how Ronald mastered the message","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In one of The Reagan Show’s early scenes, we see behind-the-scenes footage of then president Ronald Reagan fudging Republican governor John Sununu’s name on camera. Directors Sierra Pettengill and Pacho Velez present the former actor’s outtakes as a blooper reel, cutting for comedic effect, setting a tone of amused indifference that colours the remainder of the film. Their documentary, made entirely of archive footage filmed during Reagan’s two terms, sets out to explore how he mastered the art of “staging the message”. He appeared in 53 Hollywood movies, we are told, before being elected president in 1981; it’s interesting to watch the way Reagan used his on-screen magnetism to charm the public and fellow world leaders alike (former leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev features heavily). “Anyone can slip on a fact,” says one of Reagan’s defenders during the Iran-Contra affair, hinting that it was Reagan who set the precedent for today’s “facts don’t matter” politics. It’s a prescient observation, and Pettengill and Velez actively invite the mapping of Trump’s politics on to the theatre of 1980s Reaganomics (the inclusion of a clip in which Reagan promises to “make America great again” is especially obvious). Yet it’s also uncritical, infatuated with Reagan’s charisma rather than searching for the chinks in his armour, the film’s lively score keeping things balefully light."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/08/sally-potter-interview-the-party","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T06:30:43Z","webTitle":"Sally Potter: ‘There’s nothing like hearing a whole place vibrate with laughter’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/08/sally-potter-interview-the-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/08/sally-potter-interview-the-party","fields":{"headline":"Sally Potter: ‘There’s nothing like hearing a whole place vibrate with laughter’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sally Potter isn’t quite sure how to react to seeing her name on a T-shirt. With bemusement, she turns over the garment I’ve given to her, as if concerned I might be playing a prank, but there it is: SALLY POTTER, emblazoned in bold black capitals on white cotton. She holds it up to her slender frame, its glaring whiteness almost garish against her tidy black turtleneck, and squints down at it. “People are wearing these?” she asks sceptically. Hers is one of several similarly stark tees celebrating women in film, run up by Etsy startup Girls on Tops, and now popping up all over the international film world. Isabelle Huppert has one. Ava DuVernay has one. Greta Gerwig, too. Tracy Letts, a star of Gerwig’s directorial debut, Lady Bird, wore it to the film’s Toronto premiere. Why not Sally Potter? She smiles wryly. “Well, that’s lovely. And also rather embarrassing.” It’s fair to say that Sally Potter, now 68, did not go into film-making to see her name up in lights, let alone across people’s chests. One of Britain’s most staunchly independent writer-directors, she has mostly resisted the lure of mainstream attention and awards in order to work on her own restlessly inventive terms: tackling Virginia Woolf’s Orlando (1992), once deemed unfilmable, with Tilda Swinton switching genders across a 400-year timespan; directing herself in the semi-autobiographical terpsichorean meditation The Tango Lesson (1997); writing and directing contemporary culture-clash romance Yes (2004) entirely in iambic pentameter. These are not the choices of a film-maker hungry for mass audiences or an Oscar, though she cocks her head when I say “small scale”. “Ish! Small-ish!” she laughs in mock-defence. “Let’s compare it to a bestselling novel. You consider it a bestseller if 10,000 people read your book, right? Well, 10,000 people have already seen The Party – more, actually. And it’s just beginning.” Certainly, The Party, the eighth feature film of Potter’s career, looks set to be her most widely watched work in some time. Briskly shot in crisp black and white, it’s a tight, zesty, riotously funny black comedy, with a deluxe cast including Kristin Scott Thomas, Cillian Murphy, Emily Mortimer, Timothy Spall and Patricia Clarkson gleefully scratching each other to shreds over the course of just 71 minutes. Scott Thomas is a newly appointed shadow health minister whose marriage and career both come spectacularly undone over the course of her own farcically doomed dinner party; it was conceived, Potter says, “as an entertainment, in the Graham Greene sense of the word”. It is arguably the most broadly entertaining film of her career, though Potter doesn’t see it as quite the departure that critics have described. “I always thought Orlando was a comedy – in fact, I often think my films are comedies and then I’m surprised when people don’t laugh,” she says. “I’ll get better at it. When writing comedy, it’s technically difficult because you don’t know: is anyone going to laugh? We were laughing while we were making it, but that doesn’t mean people are going to laugh.” Early test screenings were merrily received; concerned they were a fluke, Potter tried it on progressively larger crowds until its Berlin film festival premiere in February. “There’s nothing like sitting in a cinema like the big hall in Berlin, the first huge premiere, with 3,000 people and then hearing the whole place vibrate with laughter. You know it’s doing everyone good, it’s a kind of medicine and it’s also incredibly validating. Because I wanted to work with the healing power of laughter as, let’s say, a shortcut through the really tragic elements.” You don’t have to scratch far beneath The Party’s japey surface to find that layer of tragedy, the characters’ seemingly petty personal crises reflecting a wider despair over Britain’s social and political corruption. To the side of the personal meltdown of Scott Thomas’s steely minister, there’s a battle of principles between Bruno Ganz’s apolitically humanist life coach and the waspish nihilism of his wife (Clarkson), who believes democracy to be over; Murphy’s City boy counters the ultra-lefty discord between a lesbian couple who have differing standards of radical feminism. Potter wanted to examine such tensions on a contained canvas. “Part of the project was to go back to cinematic bare bones,” she explains. “Strip away everything other than characters dealing with those difficult things in their lives, but do it lightly. And have that be a microcosm of wider, quite heavy and difficult times politically.” Those precise times have shifted a bit since Potter first started writing the screenplay in the run-up to the 2015 general election. “Around that time, it felt like all politics had moved into a centre and lost its way, lost its feeling for telling the truth,” she says. “So I felt that the struggle for people to tell the truth was very fertile territory. The gap between how people present themselves, to each other, to the world and to themselves even, and then what happens to them under extreme pressure, as delusions of self-image start scattering, falling, disintegrating. So that feels like it’s part of the way things are written about truth and post-truth. That wasn’t there when I wrote it. But it has become that.” That realisation came rudely home to Potter midway through the film’s two-week shoot last summer, when the Brexit referendum threw her, not to mention her thoroughly international cast and crew, for a loop. “People turned up weeping,” she recalls. “On both sides of the camera, we had a lot of mixed European and other talent. A Russian director of photography. An Argentinian designer living in Paris. A French sound team. An Italian assistant, an Indian producer, lots and lots of different origins and a lot of people fearful suddenly or full of grief. “It didn’t change anything in the script because the script was written and there it was,” she continues. “But what it did change was the subtext: it had an additional layer of meaning and people were aware of that. They had that feeling of, ‘Well, this is England. Right.’” She makes a mordant grimace. The party to which Scott Thomas’s character belongs is never specified in the script – she’s a staunch NHS defender, which is one clue – but the political sympathies of The Party are far from ambiguous. “It also became about what it really means to be on the left, what it means to be effective, what it means to effect change, all of those things.” Like most of her professional peers, Potter is pessimistic about what a future outside the EU holds for the UK’s film industry: “It’ll be damaging institutionally – financially as well, obviously. But it’ll be most damaging in the wider sense, for sort of encouraging a form of xenophobia, a polite sense of civil war.” But she brightens. She’s fought all manner of obstacles to get her films made for decades and this is just another; she sees nothing changing the way she’s always worked. “For artists, for film-makers, there will always be this impulse towards collaboration and reaching out,” she says. “There is always a spirit of internationalism, because you don’t write only for your own country. My films have been, on the whole, much better received and more widely seen outside the UK than within it. So although often, as in this case, you have to work with a very specific subject matter, I never have a feeling that I am only working for this country. I’m working for wherever what I do will land.” Potter divides her time across borders, with most of her writing completed in a remote pocket of central France. “I have a very small hut there where I’ve written the last five plays or so,” she says, “with absolutely no distractions at all, which I need.” She adheres to a fairly ascetic writer’s routine: “I sort of have to whip myself into shape every day but, you know, no emails, no phone calls, no washing-up, no anything – I just have to get to the table. As long as I can get to the table and stay there for a minimum of five hours every day, with a day of rest a week, I can get it done.” Now, however, we’re sitting in her more capacious London study, a warm, book-lined buffer zone between her adjoining offices and flat in a renovated shoe factory near the Columbia Road flower market. Early autumn morning light pours in through the top-floor windows; with it comes children’s playground chatter from the school opposite. A grand piano, an heirloom from her grandmother, takes up much of the room: Potter, a sometime composer, says music is critical to her films and the piano reminds her of its presence. It seems to me, I remark, a pretty ideal writing space, though the city, where Potter grew up, is more a place of distracting inspiration for her. She’s been in her corner of east London for 27 years and the area feeds her people-watching instincts. “I go out for my coffee in one place, scrambled eggs in another, go out to Haggerston Park – the bleakest small park in London, which I love – or maybe I walk along the canal or something,” she says. “I like how mixed the neighbourhood is. Differently mixed,” she adds, with a nod to encroaching gentrification, “but we’re still in Tower Hamlets here and it remains very mixed racially, culturally, ethnically.” A question about her spare time is answered with a rueful wave of the hand: there isn’t much. “There are no gaps,” she laughs. “I write all the time. If I had to add up all the hours in my film-making life and look at what proportion was spent on what, vastly the largest space would be taken up with writing.” She’s an avid theatre- and cinema-goer, but only in waves; when she’s at a crucial stage in the writing process, she explains, it’s best not to have other people’s ideas and stories in her head. As we learned from The Tango Lesson, Potter is an accomplished dancer, though she has less time for that these days too. “Once a dancer, always a dancer,” she says wistfully, “but I don’t do it in the same way as I once did, not at all. I miss it desperately. The kind of dancing I did most recently meant going out and staying out until 3am. And that doesn’t jibe well with getting up at seven to work, so I find there’s a conflict.” Whether she’s practising them or not, Potter’s broad array of artistic interests feeds into her film-making. Her dance training, she explains, is invaluable to her direction of actors: “The need to move physically, to be in the body, helps me to look at an actor – not just at their face to hear what they’re saying, but 360 degrees, top to toe.” The daughter of artists – her mother was a singer and music teacher, her father a poet and designer – she learned early on to view such disciplines as overlapping, though she doesn’t feel she inherited an especially creative gene. “I think everyone is creative, actually,” she says. “I mean I really do, I’m not just saying that polemically.” She didn’t go to film school, which she does feel gives her a different perspective from many of her peers; instead, having dropped out of school at 16, she joined the London Filmmakers’ Co-op as a teen, later studied at the London School of Contemporary Dance, and experimented further in music and performance art. “I started with film aged 14; that was my first love, but I didn’t know how you got to this other magic land of making big films,” she says. “So I learned in a ragtag way. But film itself is a mongrel medium, so if you understand a little about all those things, you’re going to be a much better delegator, you’re going to understand what people’s struggles are, you’re going to have a feeling for movement – not just of individuals but of the camera, the movement of space, the choreographic element of being alive.” Potter wears her outsider status with pride, well equipped to handle the discriminatory pinch still affecting women in the film industry. When I relate the dispiriting findings of a recent BFI survey into female representation on screen and behind the camera between 1913 and 2017 – suffice to say that advances, if any, have been incremental – she sighs. “You can’t deny those numbers, they don’t need my opinion added,” she says. “Of course it’s normal to me because I don’t know what it’s like being on the other side of the line. But when you get to some of the Hollywood screwball comedies, when you had Katharine Hepburn and Claudette Colbert, you suddenly think: Jesus Christ, look at these amazing female characters. You’ve got brilliant writers, dealing with really interesting subjects, really lightly.” And those, I add, were mainstream movies everyone went to see. That men went to see. “Exactly, and I mean, what the fuck?” she groans. “So things rise and fall in that way and you can’t really separate any moment from the results. All one can do really is turn apparent disadvantage to advantage. Look at The Party: low budget, sure, and fast. You might think that’s a disadvantage, but maybe it’s not. You can still work with brilliant people and you can still deal with the most interesting themes. Freedom as an independent film-maker is a choice, it’s a sort of attitude. It’s a perspective on what is…” She pauses a couple of beats, staring down at the table between us. “I’m silent,” she eventually continues, “because it’s something I get asked about a great deal and I feel I’m never able to really answer it satisfactorily.” She’s far from the only one. I recall something the actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste said about diversity in the industry – that it’s not for her to explain why she hasn’t been invited to a party, but the more powerful host. Potter sees the struggles of women, people of colour and LGBT voices to be heard as essentially related: “You can’t separate them. We need to eliminate this notion that there’s one neutral point of view, which is what we’ve got used to, and that the rest is kind of other, with a prefix attached to it: gay, black, female, blah, blah, blah. There is not one story – there are multiple stories to be told in multiple ways.” Potter may strongly identify herself as a feminist – and takes pride in mentioning that everyone on The Party worked for equal pay – but she has long been leery of ascribing the same term to her work. “This is a complicated one,” she says with a half-smile, raising an index finger as if to warn of an imminent screed. “I am a feminist in life. I would expect you, or Ken Loach, or Martin Scorsese, to be a feminist in life. But I object to having my films called feminist, implying they’re only for a certain audience of like-minded people and that the film itself would preach that line. Feminist is somehow different from saying ‘anti-racist’. I would think of my films, or my life, everything in my life, as anti-racist, but you don’t hear that as a label. But feminist film is seen as specific.” It’s the attachment of the term to a single gender of film-maker, she continues, that really rankles – liberal-minded men can make female-driven stories without ever being so defined. “Why aren’t Ken Loach’s films called feminist? ‘The feminist film-maker Ken Loach’ or ‘the feminist film-maker Mike Leigh’ – why don’t we read that? And if not, why not?” She takes a breath. “I’m completely proud of the word. The feminist movement is one of the most vibrant, extraordinary political movements of the 20th century, and now there’s a younger generation who’s taken it up again with great joy and pleasure, and that’s wonderful to see. But I object to the way it’s used as a prefix to my work, to ghettoise it, often as part of a criticism rather than an appreciation. I just want to occupy a free space without a prefix. Because what does it mean? I have to ask someone, what exactly do you mean by that term and what is it adding to anyone’s understanding who might go and see the film? Take The Party – it’s probably more important that people know that they’re going to laugh, isn’t it?” Potter tends to place women at the centre of her films and actresses cherish her attention. (“I remember telling Sally while we were shooting how relieved I felt to be a part of her revolution,” Dianne Wiest said while promoting Potter’s film Rage. “How good it felt even if it was only imaginary.”) That said, she feels no obligation to represent women: “You can make a film about whatever the fuck you like! It’s that freedom that any male film-maker can take for granted, you know.” As it is, she continues to write and develop her projects – often rotating several at once – according to no one’s instructions or impulses but her own. Is she ever sent other people’s scripts, to act as a director for hire? “That happens a lot,” she nods. “I have a 100% record of turning things down.” Potter admits to having been burned on her one flirtation with more mainstream film-making: 2000’s ill-received The Man Who Cried, a bigger-budget, Universal-backed costume drama with a cast including Cate Blanchett and Johnny Depp. “I was less happy with that one,” she says breezily. “Really, really much less. That taught me, if I ever needed to know again, that the only way that I can deliver something I’m at all proud of is by having complete control at every stage, to the point where I have completed it and said OK, this is the film or at least close to the film I wanted to make.” She considers and shrugs. “It is never quite the one, but that’s it.” Does it get easier or does every film remain a battle? She fixes me with an amused look. I know the answer already. “Look, nobody’s ever said to me: oh, Sally, do make this film and here’s a lot of money to make it. This has never been the case, it’s been struggle, debt and so on.” She leans back. “Of course, that’s nothing compared to, say, working in a factory – it’s still a relatively privileged position to be in. “But I fought for it,” she adds mildly, tougher determination peeking out beneath her light tone. Now, five decades into her film-making career, she has the T-shirt to prove it.

Sunlight is slanting in through the windows, highlighting the dark walls and floorboards of the U-shaped interior; a local sits at one end of the bar, nursing a pint and reading a paper; a party of trippers make appreciative noises over their recently arrived ham, egg and chips; and landlady Tess Eaton is supervising a shipment of organic vegetables from nearby Fairlight Hall. “I just had a lady say that this was the best pub she’d ever been to,” she grins, as the courgettes are ushered back to the kitchen. “Completely unsolicited, too.” Actually, The Crown gets that a lot; the winner of OFM’s Best Place to Drink award is the Platonic ideal of the welcoming local. It sits at the end of the much-photographed All Saints’ Street, between the picturesque jumble of Hastings Old Town and the beachfront, and attracts a winningly diverse crowd, from dyed-in-the-wool locals – fishermen, foragers – to the more recent arrivistes deemed “DFLs” (Down From London) to curious gourmets and casual drinkers. They all sense that Eaton and her partner Andrew Swan have gone the extra mile in everything from their handmade tables (courtesy of Hastings &amp; Bexhill Wood Recycling) to their painstakingly seasonal menu (duo of mackerel or tempura courgette flowers, rather than cod and chips or vegetable lasagne) and local-pump selection of ales and ciders (from the likes of the Romney Marsh Brewery and Kentish Pip Cider). The art on the walls is covetable stuff by local artists; fresh-cut flowers, from Eaton’s mother’s garden, decorate the tables. Even the soap in the toilets is scrupulously sourced, from the Hastings Soap Co. “It wasn’t like we had an overarching vision for the place,” says Swan, who oversees the kitchen. “But Hastings is a creative town and, being independent, we could act as a showcase for all these local producers.” “And we’re a real all-day operation,” says Eaton. “We open at 11am, so we’re a coffee shop in the morning, a cafe in the daytime …” “… And we serve food eight and a half hours a day,” continues Swan. “So we’re a pub in the afternoon, a restaurant in the evening, a bar as it gets later …” “We also do haircutting in the snug, 20 quid for a cut and a pint,” says Eaton. “We had a gardening club, we’ve had wreath-making, craft workshops, cider festivals …” “We never wanted to limit ourselves,” says Swan. “And we wanted everyone to come through the door. It’s a public house, after all.” There’s been a pub on the site since 1758, but The Crown had been boarded up for two years when Eaton and Swan, refugees from marketing and structural engineering respectively, stumbled across it while touring the UK in their camper van. Their enthusiasm for hospitality had been fired up by a stint at The Reliance, the dining room/pub in Leeds: “The feel, the spread of customers, the fact they sold whatever they wanted,” says Eaton. “It was their life, and that really inspired us.” “We felt we could replicate that in Hastings,” says Swan. “We were really excited by the fishing fleet here, and that we’d be able to base our menu around that. We quickly realised there’s a lot of people power and social networks we could tap into.” From their “secret” opening in July 2014, which attracted 200 people, a mariachi band and the obligatory contingent of piratically costumed locals, Eaton and Swan have assiduously created their own local hub. At a time when pubs in the UK are shuttering at a rate of around 25 a week, their attention to detail and infectious enthusiasm has helped them buck the trend. “It’s about creating a whole vibe,” says Eaton, “from having local hazelnuts in the bakewell tart to the front-of-house staff knowing what a lot of regulars drink before they walk through the door. We want people to treat this place like their living room. We had one couple who came for brunch at 11am, and stayed till 11pm; they took all their meals at different tables, they had a nap in the snug, they read the papers, they played Monopoly …” “And then they missed their train home and had to find a B&amp;B,” says Swan. “They got a couple of bottles of beer as a prize for being our most dedicated customers.” With The Crown in the ascendant, their title could soon be in jeopardy. thecrownhastings.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/bbcso-vedernikov-review-bruch-double-piano-concerto","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T14:10:49Z","webTitle":"BBCSO/Vedernikov review – A rare outing for Bruch's truculent double piano concerto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/bbcso-vedernikov-review-bruch-double-piano-concerto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/bbcso-vedernikov-review-bruch-double-piano-concerto","fields":{"headline":"BBCSO/Vedernikov review – A rare outing for Bruch's truculent double piano concerto","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are few composers whose place in music history is more firmly tethered to a single work than Max Bruch. Though his First Violin Concerto may be a perennial favourite, even his other works for violin and orchestra (two more concertos and a Scottish Fantasy) only get occasional concert outings, and the rest of his orchestral output and chamber music is almost never heard. But the BBC Symphony Orchestra revived one of Bruch’s neglected scores in its concert with Alexander Vedernikov – the Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, from 1915, with Pavel Kolesnikov and Samson Tsoy as the the soloists. Adapted from an existing suite for organ to fulfil a lucrative commission from the US, the four-movement double concerto is not an ingratiating work. The sisters who commissioned it rewrote much of the score themselves before they gave the premiere, and it was not performed as Bruch intended until 1970. It’s in the rarely used key of A flat minor (seven flats!) – as if Bruch was determined to make things as awkward as possible for the performers. There’s something rather ungracious and truculent about the piano writing, too, which rarely gives the two soloists much of an opportunity to do what pianists expect to be able to do in concertos, while the orchestral accompaniment often seems overbearing and doom-laden. The best, most “Bruchian” moments come in the lyrical adagio, but even those are not especially memorable, despite Kolesnikov and Tsoy’s best attempts to gloss what there was. It was no surprise that the two pianists were easily persuaded to give an encore – the third movement of Rachmaninov’s First Suite for two pianos – which, though it was no more upbeat, at least gave them a better chance to show what they could do. Vedernikov had placed the concerto incongruously between Webern – the magnificent Op 6 Orchestral Pieces, in their original 1909 scoring for a massive band – and the UK premiere of Red and Green, a piece Thomas Larcher composed for the San Francisco Symphony in 2010. It is a large-scale study in orchestral motion, with persistent pulsations that merge into shifting planes of sound in the first movement, and gather together in an irresistible dance in the much longer second. The orchestral colours are ravishing, the sense of pacing spot on. • This concert will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 25 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/05/takeshis-castle-welcome-back-to-the-king-of-agony-as-amusement-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T11:48:23Z","webTitle":"Takeshi's Castle: welcome back to the king of agony-as-amusement TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/05/takeshis-castle-welcome-back-to-the-king-of-agony-as-amusement-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/05/takeshis-castle-welcome-back-to-the-king-of-agony-as-amusement-tv","fields":{"headline":"Takeshi's Castle: welcome back to the king of agony-as-amusement TV","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here are three things you should know. First, Takeshi’s Castle will soon return to Comedy Central. Second, Jonathan Ross will be the new English-language narrator. Third, this is wonderful news and you should all be very grateful. Takeshi’s Castle deserves far more recognition than it receives. With the benefit of hindsight, it was the jumping-off point for an entire genre of entertainment. Admittedly that genre is “people hurting themselves over and over in increasingly elaborate ways”, and therefore probably isn’t as noteworthy as something like prestige drama. Nevertheless its influence should not be discounted. Takeshi’s Castle might not have invented the form – that would arguably be the 1962 French series Intervilles – but it was responsible for buffing it to a standard that people wanted to mimic. Takeshi’s Castle is the once and future king of people hurting themselves over and over in increasingly elaborate ways. It is the The Wire of that. Just look around. Our culture is rammed with Takeshi’s Castle rip-offs. Ninja Warrior? Wants to be Takeshi’s Castle. Total Wipeout? Wanted to be Takeshi’s Castle. Netflix’s Ultimate Beastmaster? Wanted to be Takeshi’s Castle so much it hurt. There’s even a case for arguing that the current fad for hellish Tough Mudder-style obstacle races, where a selection of adults submit themselves to endless pointless electric shocks in the name of dumb recreation, has its roots in Takeshi’s Castle. Admittedly, in the form best-known to British viewers – a thrown-together version hidden behind a thick veil of distancing irony – Takeshi’s Castle was a vehicle for abject silliness. There are challenges where contestants dress up as giant birds and get ungraciously dragged through the air. There are challenges where they pelt across rollers perched over a lake. Challenges where they run at full tilt towards doors that may or may not have been bricked up. The series first came to British attention on Tarrant on TV-style compilations of weird international television, as a roundabout way of mocking foreigners and their bizarre tastes, and the UK version maintained that spirit. But that isn’t what Takeshi’s Castle is any more, because it’s been so profoundly influential over the years. The new series won’t be able to adopt the same “look at the funny Japanese people” stance as the previous version, because British television has bought into Takeshi’s Castle wholesale, from I’m a Celebrity’s Bushtucker trials to the still-raw nightmare of Hole in the Wall. Hopefully this will mean the revived Takeshi’s Castle will have to be a little more high-minded. Hopefully, instead of laughing at the stupidity of foreigners, we’ll just get to marvel at what a perfect metaphor it is for life itself. Like life, Takeshi’s Castle is grubby. Like life, the contestants are primarily faceless chaff – there are around 100 per episode – who exist purely to fail at every task in a variety of humiliating ways without progressing or evolving. And, like life, every episode ends in bitter defeat; with the handful of contestants who somehow beat the odds finding themselves outnumbered and outgunned, the end goal always in sight but just out of reach. The entire thing is a baroque exercise in absolute futility. Deep down, that’s why everyone watched Takeshi’s Castle first time around. And that’s absolutely why people will watch it again this autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/05/talking-horses-debating-ride-of-the-season-with-sir-anthony-mccoy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:22:20Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: debating 'Ride of the season' with Sir Anthony McCoy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/05/talking-horses-debating-ride-of-the-season-with-sir-anthony-mccoy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/05/talking-horses-debating-ride-of-the-season-with-sir-anthony-mccoy","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: debating 'Ride of the season' with Sir Anthony McCoy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Timeform have their say over Kempton Timeform have waded into the debate over Kempton’s future, saying it is “astonishing” that the Jockey Club could contemplate building on the site and moving the King George VI Chase to Sandown.

It’s a Jockey Club-inspired venture, focusing on the twig-hopping action at Wincanton, Exeter, Warwick and, of course, Cheltenham itself. Many gongs were handed out to the entirely deserving likes of One For Arthur, Sizing John, Many Clouds, Noel Fehily and others. But it seemed to me that the chief joy of the event came from the gathering of hundreds of people who can’t wait for real racing to resume in just a few weeks’ time. I enjoyed being on the judge’s panel, though it meant entering a discussion with Sir Anthony McCoy himself about what was the best ride given a horse at those four Jockey Club tracks last season. On the list of Most Impertinent Things I Have Ever Done, this must go straight in at number one. Guided by the man after whom the awards were named, we eventually lighted on Adrian Heskin’s effort on Sir Valentino in the Haldon Gold Cup last November, which you can see here. It was Heskin’s first ride on the horse and he managed to conjure a narrow victory aboard the 10-1 shot over Garde La Victoire with Richard Johnson up. ‘Ride of the season’ is a fun conversation to have and I’d like to hear from you on the subject, now and over the next six months. Did we pick the right ride for last season? Also, if you see an especially good ride at Cheltenham, Wincanton, Warwick or Exeter this winter, come on here and let me know about it and I’ll make sure the footage gets put before the relevant authorities for the next round of McCoys, whether or not I end up on the panel again. There’s a couple of interesting jumps cards today but it’s still early enough in the season for me to feel that the all-weather racing might be a more attractive betting proposition. Roundabout Magic (3.30) appeals for his return to Lingfield, where he won twice on the bounce in the spring, and he is now back to being just 1lb higher than for the most recent of those. He should not be judged harshly for a summer of defeat on turf, given that his career record is 0/8 on that surface. Simon Dow’s runner is available at 4-1. Easy Code (4.35) is worth a look at 7-4, having shown distinct improvement for the step up to a mile last week, when he scored readily over this course and distance. He comes from the William Haggas yard that continues among the winners and his main rival appears to be Evening Hill, whose best form has been the other way round at Kempton. Sissinghurst (4.10) attracts me at Huntingdon. Formerly trained by Nick Gifford, he is about to have his first run for Fergal O’Brien with a tongue tie on for the first time and it appears the market expects an improved showing, given that he opened at 6-1 and is now 9-2. Sissinghurst is a brother to Templehills who won four times last season for O’Brien’s neighbour Nigel Twiston-Davies and is now rated 40lb higher than Sissinghurst. The latter has been dropped 11lb from his opening handicap mark after just two defeats and it would be no surprise at all if O’Brien were able to send him back up the ratings this autumn.

It spent two weeks at the top of the UK box office (albeit with disappointingly low takings) and is currently a close third in the US. Unlike the summer flop The Mummy, American Made is a by-no-means-terrible movie and that’s exactly where the problem lies. This drug-running caper includes just enough flashy grins and amoral charm to makes us nostalgic for a time when the biggest star on the planet could really open a movie. Now that franchises and superheroes are the only bankables in the business, those glory days seem long gone – but are they? While “Make America Great Again” was never a slogan with global appeal, “Make Tom Cruise Great Again” feels like the kind of mission possible we can all get behind. Here’s how … 1. Sack off Top Gun 2 Cruise is right to seek a return to his pre-action hero oeuvre, but does he have to be quite so literal about it? Instead of this ill-advised-to-the point-of-insanity sequel, let’s see some contemporary incarnations of the quintessential cocky hotshot. 2. Confront commercial reality Last weekend’s three-way box-office showdown was about more than money. It demonstrated, under controlled conditions, the way things are in Hollywood. When pitted against either strong intellectual property (Stephen King’s It) or a comic-book franchise ballasted by an ensemble cast (Kingsman: The Golden Circle), purely star-powered movies such as American Made cannot compete. Think you can handle the truth, Tom? There it is. And surely only a bellowing Jack Nicholson could have made the point more forcefully. 3. Embrace ageing While we’re telling it like it is, there’s more; market research found that nearly half of American Made’s audience were over 50. No need for Cruise to book a suite at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel just yet, but this is a sign that the public perception of his all-action output needs updating. Perhaps a palate-cleansing comedy? Or even a mid-life Nancy Meyers? It’s Complicated didn’t do Alec Baldwin any harm, after all. 4. Go easy on the flag-waving Cruise’s translatable talents are widely admired for an ability to make up any domestic box-office shortfall overseas, but American Made is among his lowest ever international earners. Could that title have something to do with it? 5. Steer clear of superpowers What do the top-grossing actors of 2016 all have in common? Robert Downey Jr, Ben Affleck and Chris Evans all keep a superhero suit hanging up in their closets. But then a real star could never consent to share the spotlight with a franchise in that fashion. At least that’s one excuse for Cruise’s failure to launch Universal’s Dark Universe with The Mummy. 6. But hold on to that franchise In retrospect, Cruise’s success with the decade-spanning, $2bn-grossing Mission: Impossible series is one achievement that would genuinely justify jumping for joy all over Oprah’s nice clean sofa in your outdoor shoes. 7. No more Cruise Control He has worked with Stanley Kubrick, Michael Mann and Steven Spielberg, but Cruise is also said to exert an influence over his projects that can exceed that of his director. If he were to allow a great auteur to retake the reins, it might result in a new direction of travel; we’re talking Oscars-bound. Remember Magnolia? 8. Become a brand “Big agencies have been making adjustments for more than a decade,” says James Andrew Miller, author of Powerhouse, an authoritative history of Cruise’s talent agency CAA. “They can’t afford to rely on movies and television the way they did in the past.” In other words, no actor is too Maverick for merch. Even Johnny “Captain Jack Sparrow” Depp can accommodate the Dior Sauvage fragrance deal, in his pirate’s booty. 9. Remember who completes you Cruise used to be a sex symbol. Although that’s easy to forget when the image of a gyrating Les Grossman from Tropic Thunder has replaced all other memories in your mind. What would make women want Tom Cruise again? Allowing himself to be cast opposite a female actor of similar age and equal calibre would be a start. 10. Leave the Scientology chat to others The bad news is you’ve got yourself mixed up with Scientology. The good news is, most moviegoers don’t give a flying thetan. Elisabeth Moss’s polite-but-firm deflection of Scientology-related questions while publicising The Handmaid’s Tale worked a treat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/08/10-best-political-manifestos-and-tracts","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"From revolutions to free markets: 10 of the best manifestos and tracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/10-best-political-manifestos-and-tracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/08/10-best-political-manifestos-and-tracts","fields":{"headline":"From revolutions to free markets: 10 of the best manifestos and tracts","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Common Sense by Thomas Paine (1776) This is the all-time bestselling American political tract – and while Paine’s name is more closely associated with Rights of Man written 15 years later in praise of the French revolution, Common Sense was more directly influential. It made the case for American independence and the establishment of a republican democracy when both ideas were the preoccupations of a minority. Most Americans at this stage were still very attached to Britain’s “empire of liberty”, and wanted more self-government within it. Common Sense was brilliantly transformatory. Paine inspired and galvanised 2.5 million colonists to fight and win the war, and then the founding fathers to create the US constitution based on its principles. Reflections on the Revolution in France by Edmund Burke (1790) Edmund Burke, a Whig MP – as well as an author, orator and philosopher – who had supported the American colonists in their struggle for independence, was unexpectedly a critic of the French revolution. He was powerfully in favour of liberty – but not the imposition of equality. The attempt to create it, against the natural order of things, would necessarily involve violent horrors before transmuting into dictatorship, he believed. Politicians needed to respect society’s organic roots in small, immutable platoons. Top-down sweeping attempts to change them could only fail. This has become one of the most influential conservative tracts of all time – the bible of those opposed to revolutions to promote egalitarianism A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft (1791) Mary Wollstonecraft had already argued for the constitutional entrenchment of citizens’ rights, but she was galvanised to argue for the rights of women when the revolutionaries in the French National Assembly dismissed the case for educating women. Even the leaders of Europe’s greatest challenge against the old order believed that woman’s destiny, beset by her emotionality, sensibilities and biology, lay in the privacy of the home. Wollstonecraft irrefutably, even by the standards of the time, made the case for women’s co-education alongside men as their equal companions and the mothers of children. Not to educate women impoverished everyone. It was a landmark intervention foretelling the yet-to-be-completed equality between the sexes. The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels (1848) “The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle,” Marx and Engels declared uncompromisingly. “Working men of all countries, unite!”, they urged, in a final struggle against the forces of capital. Europe’s bourgeoisie, in control of the new forces of capital that has superseded feudalism, objectively oppressed an industrial proletariat. The proletariat’s historical destiny was to overthrow bourgeois domination in a violent revolution from below. Workers had to combine with whatever progressive forces, a new communist era of progressive income tax, abolition of inheritance and free public education would be born, leading to a stateless and classless society. This was the inspiration that launched socialist ideas across Europe and would eventually lead to communist China and Russia. What Is To Be Done? by Vladimir Lenin (1901) More than 50 years after the communist manifesto there was little sign of the communist revolution that Marx and Engels had promised. There were bitter strikes and industrial unrest across Europe, but the auguries for a revolution from below seemed very distant – especially in Russia, where bourgeois capitalism had yet to transform Tsarist feudalism. Lenin’s answer to the question he posed was that the communist party had to take a vanguard role, educating workers about the exploitation they suffered and organising them politically into a coherent revolutionary force. This was not going to happen spontaneously, as Marx and Engels had foretold. What is to be Done? was the rationale for the communist party’s vanguard role in both Russia and China – both economies that in Marxist terms were far too undeveloped for communism. The Beveridge Report by William Beveridge (1942) This was the brilliant wartime report that became the bible of millions who never wanted to return to the 1930s – and who elected the Attlee government to deliver the modern welfare state. Beveridge inveighed against the five great evils that had disfigured pre-war society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease – and urged a comprehensive policy of social progress. It had to be led and organised by the state, he argued, but not to stifle the incentive to help oneself. He passionately believed in the insurance principle as a core part of the new settlement and was opposed to means testing; everyone should pay in to a system of national insurance and receive the same benefit. Similarly everyone should have the opportunity to banish disease through the creation of a decentralised national health service. It was the intellectual origin of the modern welfare state. The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek (1945) This is the source book of contemporary conservative thought – the inspiration for not merely the rebirth of laissez-faire economics over the last 40 years but the rise of libertarian individualism. Hayek denounced economic planning in all its guises – whether socialist , communist, fascist or mixed economy Keynesianism. The state, he argued, could only achieve its planning ends through coercion and the denial of liberty. It would become ever more tyrannous and oppressive, stifling the capacity of competitive free markets to solve economic problems creatively, and so ultimately lead to serfdom. by Keynes declared he agreed with its philosophy, but it was utterly impractical. It was to take Lady Thatcher, who constantly referred to it, and Ronald Reagan to turn Hayek’s maxims into public policy with results that will be permanently contested and challenged. Animal Farm by George Orwell (1946) This paradigm-changing novel by the democratic socialist and Observer writer George Orwell is a satire aimed at undermining Stalin and, as crucially, the admiration in which he was held by many in the British intelligentsia. The animals, led by two young pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, take over Manor Farm in an act of revolution and proceed to run it in the name of equality. What happens in practice is that Napoleon drives out Snowball and abandons all his plans for social improvement, works the gallant horse Boxer to death and turns into exactly the same figure as the farmer the animals displaced. “All animals are equal,” proclaims the now very fat pig, “but some are more equal than others.” Animal Farm became a byword for how Stalinism worked in practice, and snuffed out any realistic chance the British communist party had of becoming a major political force. Silent Spring by Rachel Carson (1962) This was the foundation of the modern environmental movement. Painstakingly and exhaustively researched, it exposed the widespread use of toxic pesticides to improve crop yields as a menace to nature and humanity alike. The title brilliantly captured the book’s core message – that human and natural life are interdependent, that today’s generation has a duty to itself and succeeding generations to organise itself so life is sustainable and that the price of not doing so is not only materially damaging – it risks silencing the tumult of nature as it comes to life in the Spring. The chemical industry attacked the book and its author – but its popularity not only forced changes to the way pesticides were administered, but triggered a much wider examination of what humans were – and are – doing to nature. Little Red Book by Chairman Mao (1965) This collection of Mao’s writings was the inspiration for the savageries of the cultural revolution. Its depiction of anyone with bourgeois sympathies, cultural tastes or lifestyle as necessarily an enemy of the people was used by Mao’s young Red guards – often students – to arrest, denounce, torture and murder anyone in authority for trumped-up reasons without trial or redress. It became the excuse for a purge from below, cementing Mao’s insecure hold on power as the economy and living standards stagnated. Up to half a million people, including humble teachers and nurses, are estimated to have been killed. The amoral savagery left an indelible mark on Deng Xiaoping, exiled and humiliated, who seized power in 1978 to implement the market-based reforms that have driven China’s astonishing rise to today’s economic pre-eminence.

The answer is pioneering designer Ryan Yasin, whose range of children’s clothing recently hit the news for winning the prestigious James Dyson UK award. The reason he won and why his designs are causing such excitement – especially among parents and the environmental press – is because these clothes are not the usual throwaway fare. They actually grow with the babies and toddlers that wear them. The outerwear range, which is made from pleated lightweight fabric and is waterproof, machine washable and recyclable, can expand up to seven sizes – the number of sizes most kids grow in their first two years of life. It was the 24-year-old designer’s increasing dismay at the wastefulness of the fashion industry that sparked the idea while studying at the Royal College of the Arts. “I became really disheartened about how fashion operates and the unethical aspects of it both on a human level and on a sustainability and resource level,” he says. Despite campaigns against fast fashion – the term used to describe how disposable clothing has become – the problem isn’t going away. “I think we’re entering an era of fashion a bit like Netflix and Spotify, where we’re streaming fashion. It’s constantly changing and we’re constantly buying cheap items, which we know will go out of style soon, but we don’t care because it will break anyway and it is a small amount of money.” Buying clothes used to be an investment and you bought quality items to last, says Yasin. “As consumers, we have become so desensitised to the value of clothes. You can buy an item for £5, but if you think about the journey that it’s been on and that every item is a handmade product, it’s that price because people have suffered along the way.” Children’s attire wasn’t on his mind until a visit to his sister and her children in Denmark. His sister had just had her second child and by the time Yasin got to visit her, his nephew was too big for the clothes he had brought over with him. “That was the signal for me that kids are growing really quick and the clothing made for them today is just miniaturised adult clothing, which is not really suitable for their bodies. Children’s bodies aren’t static, they are changing all the time and I think it would be much better to think of them as dynamic objects, and then design clothing for that,” he says. He tried a few different ideas, but the one that resonated most with the parents he consulted was the one-size-fits-all concept. He created his first prototype at home and tried them on his nephew and niece. “The trousers fit both the newborn and the two and a half year old. My sister thought they were great because many parents she knew complained about having to buy so many clothes.” Following more user testing – and receiving lots of positive feedback in the process – Yasin decided to pursue the business, now called Petit Pli . That’s not to say he hasn’t faced a lot of scepticism. “I had a lot of people questioning it and I would have to convince myself that I was doing the right thing,” he says. Some wondered how an aeronautical engineering graduate could possibly move into the world of fashion. While studying at Imperial College in London, he worked with a team developing small satellites for Earth observation. The satellites would be sent into space folded up, but ready to open out when deployed. He enjoyed the work and it was how he first learned origami and folding techniques. However, he wanted to do something much more creative with the technical skills he had. Later, at the Royal College of the Arts, Yasin was able to work with materials in his hands rather than designing from a computer and, after spending six months in Tokyo on an exchange programme, he decided to move into fashion. While in Tokyo he designed a conceptual piece – again based on a folding structure – for the fashionistas of the city’s renowned style district, Harajuku. The piece, an origami-inspired collar, could be worn folded up as a modest cloth necklace, or unfurled as a larger ruff, adorned with flamboyant brightly coloured embellishments. Afterwards, however, he craved a more tangible project he could turn into a business. Winning the Dyson award was a huge confidence boost. He says: “It was so nice to get that stamp of approval, that this was an intelligent design engineering solution. An engineer going into the world of fashion, especially kids’ wear, isn’t that common.” Since the win he has been visiting suppliers and manufacturers. “Making sure there is an ethical supply chain is extremely important to me as that was the starting point to this project. If I veered away from that it would lose its whole foundation and meaning.” As the research and development phase draws to a close, Yasin has also been developing a team. He is in talks with investors and retailers and is looking to raise £100,000 to expand staff and supply chains, and to help complete the research and design stage. “It’s promising, but these things do take time so I’m just trying to push [the business] as far as I can without having to rely on the investment,” he says. “We’re looking for non-silent investors who really believe in what we’re doing, especially in the whole sustainable and ethical aspect. There are lots of great people out there, so I’m optimistic.” Later this month, the global winner of the James Dyson award will be announced, but Yasin isn’t giving it much thought. “I’m just so focused on taking my company forward, but it would be amazing if I did win,” he says. “Whatever happens, I’m going to get this out there.” Sign up to the regular Guardian B2B email here for more insight and advice direct to your inbox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/06/england-world-cup-fans-russia-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"How England can find World Cup spark and repair disconnect with fans | Dominic Fifield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/06/england-world-cup-fans-russia-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/06/england-world-cup-fans-russia-2018","fields":{"headline":"How England can find World Cup spark and repair disconnect with fans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The sense of anticlimax was inescapable. Gareth Southgate had spent his evening on the touchline dodging paper aeroplanes, tedium-induced origami, and blocking out occasional spasms of booing from the home support, and was left to plead for patience after the match. It matters not that plenty of nations would love to be in England’s position. Argentina are in real danger of missing out on a World Cup for the first time since 1970 after drawing with Peru in Buenos Aires. Holland are third in their group and in peril, while even the European champions, Portugal, are facing up to the likelihood of a play-off. The same fate almost certainly awaits Italy. England, in contrast, have emerged unbeaten through another qualification campaign and yet the mood was almost apologetic. Southgate, asked if he was enjoying himself a year into his tenure, mustered a rueful smile. “Well, weirdly, I am,” he said. “Although I’m not certain I’m standing here thinking: ‘Wow, isn’t it brilliant to have qualified for a World Cup,’ feeling all the love. But I get it, I get it. I go back to the first objective being to qualify, and we have done that. Now we look at how we build, evolve and improve. In international football you don’t have a chequebook of hundreds of millions of pounds to spend. So we have to coach and work to improve people and the team, and that is the great challenge. I get how people are feeling about us at the moment but I also believe in the potential of these players. I want to build a team that the country are proud of.” Now Southgate has Sunday’s qualifier in Lithuania and, at best, four friendly fixtures before he must select a squad for the tournament in Russia. So what areas must England address most urgently if they are to repair the disconnect between team and support? Conjure some kind of creativity in central midfield Adam Lallana should have played again for Liverpool by the time England confront Brazil and Germany, Fifa’s top-ranked sides, in friendlies next month and will be reintegrated immediately at international level, but he will find his reputation has soared in absentia. England’s shortcomings are felt most keenly in a lack of creation. Everything was a plod on Thursday, as it has been so often in a qualification campaign littered with slow starts, with the shepherding of the ball as laboured as the movement of the players when confronted by massed defence. Oh for a bit of zest, some incision, a burst of quality in the pass. Lallana’s forte is his movement, and his front-foot urgency and aggression in the pass will make a difference. Southgate must wish Jack Wilshere had not slipped so far down the pecking order at Arsenal, for all that he cannot rule out the 25-year-old still making a late case for involvement. “We’re in a position where there’s no way we would dismiss any creative player,” he said. “But, of course, people have to be playing at a good level.”But where are the other options? Has, say, Harry Winks done enough to suggest he can be the answer? Is there anyone else out there? Southgate believes there are players in the system who will go on to impress at the highest level, but they are 18 months to two years away from being ready. So, if the personnel are out of reach, a system of play must be employed that taps better into what qualities the current collective do possess. Is there scope to explore a back three again? Arguably England’s most persuasive performance under Southgate’s stewardship was the narrow, and unfortunate, defeat by Germany in March when the manager experimented with a back three with some success. Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling and Michael Keane started in Dortmund behind a pair of midfield anchors, and with the energetic Dele Alli and Lallana supporting Jamie Vardy. There was width and pace from full-back and proper bite on the counterattack. It was a tactic to which the team resorted in the latter stages against Slovenia on Thursday when the visitors went for broke, and it may be an approach that ekes the best from this group against more fancied, enterprising opponents at the finals. England will surely be more of a threat on the break against better teams than they are when asked to break down opponents. Germany and Brazil will test that theory. Pray English players benefit from involvement in the Champions League latter stages Southgate was at pains to point to this group’s lack of experience – “they’re young players and most of them have never been to a World Cup so this is a big moment in their careers”– and acknowledged they will find themselves in the company of sides laced with Champions League and league championship winners. That rather overlooked the reality that, in Cahill and Ryan Bertrand, he has two European Cup winners, not to mention players who have claimed the Premier League with Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea. But he was right in hoping the likes of Marcus Rashford and Alli, Kyle Walker and John Stones, sharpen their skills in the Champions League this season and thrive at that level. “The younger lads are playing more big games in the Champions League and, if they get to the latter stages and maybe the finals, all these big-pressure games will help this squad,” said Cahill. “We’ve held our own against the likes of Spain and Germany but to have the knack to go on and win those games … that’s something we can learn. To kill teams off when we’re playing well. That’s the gap.” Game management in highly pressurised occasions is something that has to be learned. The more familiar this group’s key players become with tense elite contests, the more likely England are to make an impact in Russia. So, if we acknowledge we cannot be like Spain, can we be like Iceland? “Are we going to become Spain in the next eight months?” asked Southgate on Thursday night. “No, we’re not.” But, if we can accept England’s options are not going to blossom unexpectedly, can we not at least aspire to be like Iceland at the World Cup? Not necessarily in style, but in structure, playing to a distinct and clear plan that brings the best out of those available? Iceland’s strength at Euro 2016 was an unswerving belief in their approach and an ability to implement a relatively simple gameplan. The approach only took them so far, of course, and they were found out by France. But, by then, they had seen off England and reached a quarter-final. Southgate would thrill at the prospect of doing likewise in the context of recent tournament traumas. Yet another troubling aspect of England’s qualification is that, for all the talk of progress, on the pitch a clear plan and thought process have not always been evident. The management team feel a plan is being implemented. They believe they are drumming it into the players at every get-together. Yet it is not always easy to notice from the outside looking in. If the supporters can identify what the team are trying to achieve, maybe the scepticism will recede."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/08/the-lie-review-elegant-look-truth-deceit-florian-zeller","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T06:50:43Z","webTitle":"The Lie review – an elegant look at truth and deceit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/the-lie-review-elegant-look-truth-deceit-florian-zeller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/08/the-lie-review-elegant-look-truth-deceit-florian-zeller","fields":{"headline":"The Lie review – an elegant look at truth and deceit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Florian Zeller and his translator Christopher Hampton brought something completely distinctive to the British stage with The Father three years ago. Now Zeller is one of the few contemporary European playwrights regularly performed here. The Lie in part shows why: it has Zeller’s wiry, unsentimental dialogue, his teasing out of a notion to its limits. But it is wispy: an acute parlour game. Two couples in a plush, uncluttered room discuss whether telling the truth is necessary or cruel. In particular, should you tip off a friend when her husband is unfaithful? Left alone, host and hostess trap each other into confessions, which they then retract. But can they be sure of each other? And are their guests implicated? Here is an elegant look at the mechanisms people use to make themselves look convincing – a clever theatrical wheeze, as it gets audiences considering what makes actors seem plausible. Most people lie as if they are telling the truth. This couple tells the truth in order to lie. In a clever twist the play has a false ending: it becomes its own fib.

Length: 3:54. Age: Three months, one week. I’m confused. What are we talking about? It’s a piece of music. Is it that one where no one plays their instruments? That’s 4’33” by John Cage. This is 4:44, a song by Jay-Z, so-called because that’s what time he woke up and started writing it. It’s the first track on an album of the same name that he released in June. I see. Any good? Yes. Pretty good. It’s been an inspiration to his pal Harvey Weinstein. Isn’t he that famous movie mogul and a champion of liberal causes? Not any more. A report in the New York Times alleges that Weinstein has been sexually harassing young women for decades. They claim he used to invite them for meetings in his hotel room, then take his clothes off and suggest a massage. Perhaps he got confused? Do we know if he also forced showbiz meetings on his massage therapist? I don’t believe so. Weinstein denies the accusations, but has apologised for his unspecified “behaviour”, which he admits “caused a lot of pain”. Ah. So not really a champion of liberal causes any more? No. And not really a movie mogul any more either. He has taken a leave of absence to spend more time with his lawyers. Right. So which part of all this was inspired by Jay-Z? The apology. Jay-Z was (basically) accused of having an affair in his wife Beyoncé’s album Lemonade. The album and song 4:44, in which he shows great remorse, is (basically) his response to that. As Weinstein now says: “Jay-Z wrote in 4:44: ‘I’m not the man I thought I was, and I better be that man for my children.’ The same is true for me.” Hang on. I’m sure this is horrible for Weinstein’s children, but the allegations against him are a bit worse than an affair, aren’t they? Yes. And furthermore, Jay-Z never wrote those words in 4:44. The closest he gets is: “And if my children knew / I don’t even know what I would do.” So Weinstein is a proven misquoter! That really is unforgivable. Do say: “My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes / And the mask goes away.” Don’t say: “I’m preparing 99 lawsuits and I’m going to win each one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/06/eu-rules-out-tax-on-plastic-products-to-reduce-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T13:53:51Z","webTitle":"EU rules out tax on plastic products to reduce waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/eu-rules-out-tax-on-plastic-products-to-reduce-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/06/eu-rules-out-tax-on-plastic-products-to-reduce-waste","fields":{"headline":"EU rules out tax on plastic products to reduce waste","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The EU has ruled out penalties on single-use plastic products, in favour of raising public awareness of the damage consumer plastics are doing to the world’s oceans. Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European commission, said a tax would “not be sustainable”, but that changing the way plastic was produced and used could work. “The only sustainable method is to create recyclable plastic and take out microplastics. You can’t take out microplastics with a tax. You need to make sure things are reused, and not put in the ocean.” He said the commission was working with manufacturers to help change their products and packaging. Karmenu Vella, environment commissioner, also pledged that the EU’s long-awaited plastics strategy would be published by the end of the year. The European commission cannot raise taxes directly, but can encourage member states to do so, and can impose other penalties, as with the emissions trading scheme to reduce carbon from heavy industry. Timmermans rejected outright charges and taxes on single-use plastic, and was reluctant to consider legislative measures, but called instead for public information campaigns on the problems plastics cause. “It is not that we, through legislation, should force [producers of plastic to change], though if we have to we might, but through public awareness, to urge countries to raise awareness,” he said. “Nothing disciplines companies more than consumer practices. We are on the verge of changing consumer habits. I sense a turning point, like that we saw 10 to 15 years ago on climate change,” he told journalists at the Our Ocean conference in Malta. “That was what happened with recycling. Who made us recycle? Our kids. I don’t think there is one producer of consumer goods that would go against the grain of public awareness.” At present, only about 6% of plastic waste is recycled within the EU. In part, this is because of the many different forms of plastic that are used in consumer goods, and the difficulty of returning them to the kind of versatility that virgin plastics enjoy. But Timmermans said consumers would accept “less flashy” and less aesthetically pleasing packaging, if they understood it would help remove pollution from the oceans. Vella added that companies should design plastic products with reuse in mind from the outset: “The circular economy is the most effective way to deal with plastics.” He promised that the forthcoming plastics strategy would include design, recycling, biodegradable plastics, single-use plastics and microplastics. The commission is also to remove single-use plastics, including drinking vessels, from its own offices by the end of this year. The commission is to devote €550m (£490m) to projects that improve the health of the oceans, from marine protection zones and satellite monitoring, to plastic waste disposal. At the conference, more than €6bn was pledged in total by governments, institutions and private sector companies towards efforts to combat overfishing, pollution, plastic waste, ocean acidification and other threats to the marine environment. This included a pledge of $150m (£115m) from a group of NGOs and companies to prevent plastic waste reaching oceans in south-east Asia. Five countries – China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand – are responsible for half of all the plastic waste that enters the oceans globally each year. In those countries, on average less than 40% of plastic waste is recycled. The organisations include PepsiCo, Procter &amp; Gamble, 3M, the American Chemistry Council, the World Plastics Council and Ocean Conservancy. Insurers are also taking action against illegal fishing, with several of the world’s biggest companies pledging to stop insuring vessels that have been pirate fishing. Illegal fishing costs the world an estimated $10bn to $23bn a year, amounting to about 25m tonnes of fish that are taken from waters against quotas, or in contravention of national fisheries rights and policies. The insurers include Allianz, Axa, Generali, Hanseatic Underwriters, and The Shipowners’ Club. However, the environment lawyers ClientEarth said laws against illegal fishing in the EU were being undermined by failures among member states. Analysing the enforcement system in six of the EU’s biggest fishing countries – France, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Ireland and the UK – the lawyers found none were properly implementing the anti-piracy regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy, and the level of sanctions against offenders was low. Elisabeth Druel, lawyer at ClientEarth, said authorities were doing little to combat illegal fishing. “Strong and systematic sanctions are needed to deter illegal fishing and pay for the damage done to our marine environment. The fishing industry would have us believe they are heavily inspected and sanctioned, but our research shows that is just not the case.” This article was amended on 27 October 2017. Oceana was named as one of the organisations involved in the $150m plastic pledge; this should have been Ocean Conservancy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/11/so-much-things-to-say-by-roger-steffens-review-bob-marley","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"So Much Things to Say by Roger Steffens review – an oral history of Bob Marley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/11/so-much-things-to-say-by-roger-steffens-review-bob-marley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/11/so-much-things-to-say-by-roger-steffens-review-bob-marley","fields":{"headline":"So Much Things to Say by Roger Steffens review – an oral history of Bob Marley","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Bob Marley died aged 36 in 1981, Island Records hurried to contact Peter Tosh (one of the original Wailers trio) to alert him before the news reached the general public. In the seven years since their acrimonious split Tosh had watched Marley’s spectacular rise. After a pause on the phone, Tosh startled Island’s messenger with his response to his former friend’s death: “Well, perhaps it’ll leave a little room for the rest of us to come through.” Robert Nesta Marley cast the world of reggae in his shadow. This is the case even more now than at his death – and is reflected in a global industry devoted to Marley albums, T-shirts, mugs, musicals and documentaries. It’s a development that might well have stuck in the craw of the righteous Rasta Marley, a man who famously maintained he could not be corrupted by the seeds of commercial success (“Babylon nah have no fruit”) and spurned the comforts of materialism. His legacy has been contested ever since his death, in large part because of his disinclination as a Rasta to leave behind a will. For decades Roger Steffens, compiler of this oral history, has been a leading authority on Marley; his home archive, almost a museum, is an essential pit-stop for any serious scholar. In So Much Things to Say, a title taken from the anthemic Marley song, linking Jesus Christ to Marcus Garvey, Steffens identifies many more pieces of the man than have ever before been put together in one book. More than a decade ago, David Katz drew on more than 300 first-hand interviews to tell a luminous story of reggae, entitled Solid Foundation. Steffens takes a similar approach, using the transcriptions of conversations he has conducted over 40 years. Marley is illuminated through the reminiscences of his wife, mother, girlfriends, band members, managers and many unknown but stylish Jamaicans who, to paraphrase Derek Walcott, reveal “all Kingston is a 12.30 show”. Steffens marshals his sources with skill, and we’re left with a complex representation. At the core of the book is the inimitable Wailers trio – Tosh, Marley and Bunny Livingston – who lived and worked closely together for a decade from their first encounter as youths. For a while, Marley’s mother was in a relationship with Livingston’s father – though as an “outside” child Marley was literally kept outdoors and made to sleep on the ground underneath the stilt house. He was strong-willed and his desperate circumstances forced maturity on him at a tender age; he was just another yard-boy “sufferer” who struggled to emerge from the rot and stench of the Kingston ghetto of Trenchtown. Music provided an escape from the parlous fate seemingly predetermined for him. Steffens catalogues the frustrations of musicians continually preyed on by exploitative managers (Livingston calls them “knickerbackers”). In Marley’s life, some of these older middlemen appeared to occupy the space forfeited by his absent father, Norval, who abandoned him as a baby. This was evidently the case with the Rasta elder and street intellectual Mortimo Planno, an extraordinarily gnarled walrus of a man, who for a time held a Rasputin-like grip on Marley, schooled him in the cultish religion and later attempted to groom him as a proselytising musical ambassador for Rastafari. The evolution of the group was marked by their change in image – in 1963, appearing in a talent-spotting stage show, they sported flat, shiny hair and satin suits as an ambitious R&amp;B outfit called the Teenagers. A decade later, the Wailers electrified audiences as Rastas dressed in army fatigues with dreadlocks flashing in the night air. Steffens’s interviews usefully adjust the story behind “Small Axe” – a biographical song in which the Wailers liken themselves to a small axe cutting down “the big tree”, Jamaica’s big three record producers (Jamaicans drop the “h” in three). Perhaps more doubtful is Esther Anderson’s assertion that the lines in “I Shot the Sheriff”, “Every time I plant a seed / He said kill it before it grow”, are a reference to her determination as Marley’s then girlfriend to take contraception. The recollection is compelling, though Marley himself said that the song’s lyrics referred to the fight he had with members of the band over its direction, and who was in charge, such that he “had to shoot all sheriff”. Many of the anecdotes recall the old Jamaican (pre-Trump) adage: “There are no facts; only versions.” Occasionally, Steffens ventures a critical assessment, employing words such as “disingenuous” when introducing a fanciful tale; but he rarely adjudicates on the accounts presented. If Marley is at the celestial centre of reggae, then Livingston is the brightest satellite. He emerges as a rancorous, mystical and magisterial guardian of Marley’s reputation, as keen as ever to convey the spirit and greatness of his fallen brother. In that task he is aligned with Steffens, the consummate fan. • Colin Grant’s A Smell of Burning: The Story of Epilepsy is published by Cape.

The Tories must now deliver","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May’s defence of free market capitalism didn’t begin well. The headline from that speech – aside from the various calamities – was a price cap imposed on a failing energy market. As far back as 2011, I argued that the public was being ripped off by the energy giants. The government back-pedalled, holding an energy summit at No 10, urging people to switch, tinkering with green subsidies, always resisting market intervention. Finally, in 2014, David Cameron commissioned a Competition and Markets Authority inquiry into the energy market, kicking the issue beyond the 2015 general election. The CMA concluded that the big six energy companies had been overcharging customers by an average of £1.4bn a year since 2012, rising to £2bn a year by 2015. It was a disaster for the companies controlling 85% of the energy market. The CMA urged a safeguard tariff for the 4m households using prepayment meters, who pay in advance, usually at higher tariff rates. One CMA panel member urged a price cap for all on the highest default tariffs, standard variable tariffs (SVTs). The Tories’ 2017 manifesto noted that customers “mistakenly assumed their loyalty was rewarded”, and those who did not switch “are punished for inactivity with higher prices”. It pledged a review. Perhaps in an attempt to shore up her ailing premiership, May announced the price cap. The big six didn’t wait long before attacking the proposal. Iain Conn, CEO of Centrica (parent company of British Gas), said: “Price regulation will result in reduced competition and choice … This will negatively impact consumers.” Price controls fail, he told Radio 4’s Today programme, citing international examples. Once again, the big six defend the indefensible. No mention that “competition and choice” had clearly failed the poorest customers – those using prepayment meters. In April, Ofgem introduced a safeguard tariff for those 4 million customers; average savings are around £100 per year. What about the rest? A KPMG report in June noted that only 1% of customers each month switch to a new provider. Ofgem says about 3m households did so in the past year. Citizens Advice noted that just 27% of households shop around for better deals, switching in the last three years – that’s the “active energy market”. More than two-thirds of customers (the passive energy market), never switch and languish on the expensive SVTs. KPMG noted that each of the big six have a majority of their customers on these tariffs. The financial website This is Money reported in March that the gap between SVTs and the cheapest tariff had risen to £262 per annum. Citizens Advice argued that the big six operate two different pricing strategies: one for the active customers, offering competitive deals, and a different approach for the majority, the passive customers, offering higher prices that bear no relationship to real energy costs. Eighty per cent of elderly customers, disabled customers, and poorest customers are on these tariffs. The least internet-savvy, the least engaged customers. Social justice demands that these customers get fair energy prices. And what about the international evidence on price caps? The European commission has noted that 24 years after the formation of the European single market, the EU still does not have a fully functioning single market in energy. It noted: “Prices for households remain regulated to different degrees in about half of the member states, which may constitute an obstacle to demand-side participation and retail competition.” The KPMG report cites the case of Belgium. Between 2012 and 2014, it introduced an upper limit on energy prices for customers on variable tariffs. This “reduced bills by €17 to €52 for electricity and €42 to €82 per annum for gas”. During this period, “customers’ confidence in the market improved by around 7% – the highest in the EU”. No one is arguing for permanent price controls. But this market needs reform. Fair pricing and transparency must be restored to rebuild trust. On 21 September, Michael Lewis, CEO of E.on UK confirmed that E.on is scrapping its SVT, moving customers to fixed-term deals. When a Tory PM wedded to free market capitalism tells a Conservative conference that she is “bringing an end to rip-off energy prices once and for all”, the big six know that the game is up. Labour has won this argument. Change is on the way, and millions of consumers will benefit from an effective price cap. This is just the beginning. Now let’s see the details. • Caroline Flint is MP for Don Valley and was shadow energy secretary from 2011 to 2015"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2017/oct/08/say-moo-why-instagram-loves-life-on-the-british-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T13:00:51Z","webTitle":"Say moo!

Why Instagram loves life on the British farm","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Instagram often gets criticised for triggering Fomo or self-esteem issues, but staring at images of belted galloway calves in the Yorkshire dales could inspire an unfamiliar calm instead. Around the country, farmers are using the app to connect not only with fellow farmers but also with fans of their animals, the rural lifestyle or simply just the picturesque landscapes they capture. Neil and Leigh of Hill Top Farm in the Yorkshire dales have more than 16,000 followers as @hilltopfarmgirl, the majority of whom they believe are non-farmers. “I think they follow for a real variety of reasons,” Leigh says. It could be concern for high-welfare meat or a love of animals and the landscape. “Some people love the escape into a different world - a US follower once said he loved looking at the photos when he was at work in his office in a skyscraper in Chicago.” For 24-year-old Lake District farmer Nathan Atkinson (@njatkinson1, 7,700 followers), sharing life on the farm resulted in a boost in followers. He swapped typical images of nights out for pictures of his animals when he noticed how his new fans were reacting. “People were tagging their friends, writing: ‘Look at this.’ So I kept posting the animal photos. I was getting more and more followers, although my friends now call it Cowstagram or Moostagram.” Some have found other forms of success through social media. Lake District shepherd James Rebanks turned his tweets at @herdyshepherd1 into a bestselling book, The Shepherd’s Life, published in 2015. At Hill Top Farm, showcasing the landscape and those striking belted galloways has brought more visitors to the farm’s holiday accommodation, and Atkinson has bought and sold produce through the app. On Instagram, the appeal for a bleary-eyed city dweller is obvious. No commute. Clean air. Working with your hands. And plenty of adorable animals. But the same caveat applies to Moostagram as to all of Instagram: is this merely the idealised version? Not on Atkinson’s page. “I posted a newborn english longhorn calf called Olivia,” he explains. “I felt I had to let my followers know when she had unfortunately died at eight days. This upset a lot of people! I then showed the process of fostering a new bought-in calf: skinning the dead calf and putting her coat on to the new calf, tricking the mother into thinking it is her own calf, is one of the only ways she will accept it. I think my followers appreciate the honesty – it’s not all just cute fluffy animals. Farming can be very difficult at times.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/06/uk-pharmacist-zameer-ghumra-jailed-beheading-video-child-islamic-state","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T13:39:31Z","webTitle":"UK pharmacist jailed for showing beheading video to a child","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/06/uk-pharmacist-zameer-ghumra-jailed-beheading-video-child-islamic-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/06/uk-pharmacist-zameer-ghumra-jailed-beheading-video-child-islamic-state","fields":{"headline":"UK pharmacist jailed for showing beheading video to a child","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A pharmacist who showed an Islamic State beheading video to a primary school pupil has been jailed for six years for a “determined effort” to radicalise children. Zameer Ghumra was found guilty of disseminating terrorist propaganda as he tried to brainwash two young brothers into becoming Isis fighters. The 38-year-old taught the children how to survive a bomb attack and fight with knives, rewarding them with sweets to keep them onside. He was sentenced at Nottingham crown court on Friday for what the judge, Gregory Dickinson QC, described as a particularly serious attempt to turn the children into terrorists. “These were shocking crimes which damaged the children and caused offence to the vast majority of law-abiding Muslims,” he said. Dickinson also noted there had been an “absence of remorse” from Ghumra. Jurors heard how Ghumra followed various Isis-linked social media accounts and made the two unidentified children follow similar accounts. Though he worked as a pharmacist in Oundle, Northamptonshire, Ghumra was said to have been setting up a madrasa, an Islamic school. The jury was told how Ghumra had online conversations with Anjem Choudary, the jailed radical preacher, describing him as a good man to the children. Giving evidence in court, one of the boys said Ghumra had shown him a lot of beheading videos. “[Ghumra] had Isis training videos and people being beheaded,” he said. “There was talking and then the American soldier was beheaded. “It made me feel disgusting. He said: ‘If you truly love Allah, then you do it.’ I told him I get a horrid feeling when I see this.” The boy told the court: “He believes in a very, very, very extreme Islam. He believes if anyone’s non-Muslim and they say anything bad about Islam you kill them. And you can’t make friends with any non-Muslim.” The boys’ mother told the court she had grown increasingly concerned about the man’s influence on the children, who she said were “waking up in the night because they think someone is killing them”. She said: “My kids have been forced to watch Isis training videos. He told them: ‘We will have to do this one day.’ He told them all kafirs [non-believers] go to hell, even if they’re good people.” She claimed that one of her children had been shown a beheading video and was told by Ghumra: “We will have to do this when we go to Syria.” She added: “He said if you truly believe in God you do it for him. He said they would go to Turkey and make a run for it.” The court heard that after Ghumra’s arrest at Birmingham airport in September 2015, a computer was seized showing 1,600 search results for terms including “survival knives” and “bushcraft”. However, after police officers searched his home, neither the phone containing the beheading video nor the video itself was recovered. Speaking after he was found guilty on Thursday, Sue Hemming, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Zameer Ghumra tried to brainwash impressionable children with this violent ideology by making one watch beheading videos and urging them both to adopt a hardline religious outlook. “The CPS case was that he intended to radicalise them in the hope that they would go on to be involved in terrorism. The children were brave to give evidence and we would like to thank them for helping to secure this conviction of a dangerous man.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/06/fgm-and-disability-also-hinder-girls-education","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T17:34:54Z","webTitle":"FGM and disability also hinder girls’ education | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/06/fgm-and-disability-also-hinder-girls-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/06/fgm-and-disability-also-hinder-girls-education","fields":{"headline":"FGM and disability also hinder girls’ education","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your sponsored roundtable on educating girls (Society, 4 October) is to be commended both for laying bare the critical need to address this issue in general, and for acknowledging the complications and taboos around menstruation as a severe obstacle to progress. It is difficult to understand, however, why the painful topic of female genital mutilation was not also a focus of discussion. One required element in some communities of the lengthy initiation ceremonies to “adulthood” mentioned is that girls must undergo FGM. This cruel initiation, often at or just before puberty, is the marker by which potential husbands (often already owners of other wives) are in traditional thinking assured of their soon-to-be purchased wife’s virginity. Raising a girl and paying for her FGM is expensive – ceremonies are often held around harvest time when there’s more money – and bride price is increased if the girl-woman is “pure”. Until girls are no longer perceived as chattels for exchange on the open market, the practices of FGM and early “marriage” (child rape) will continue. As your commentators acknowledge, FGM and early marriage will only be abandoned once men and women alike see these practices as patriarchy incarnate, the literal imposition of men’s power on female bodies. Assumed patriarchal entitlement remains to be challenged in many parts of the world, but nowhere more than in places where its imposition actually precludes young women even receiving an education which will empower both them personally and their wider communities. Hilary Burrage Author, Eradicating Female Genital Mutilation; and Female Mutilation • If the international community is serious about its pledge to leave no one behind, then we cannot focus solely on women’s and girls’ education. There are more than 100 million children with disabilities across the globe – and in developing countries, 90% never go to school. Tens of millions of the world’s most vulnerable children are prohibited from participating in society, from achieving their potential, from ever having a hope of escaping entrenched poverty. The huge strides made towards getting girls into education has set the bar for what can be done for children with disabilities. My work with deaf children in the developing world has shown me that we need to be creative and trial projects in different contexts and cultures. We need better data on what is working and what isn’t. And on top of all of this, we need the global political will to act.

Not just of a premiership under threat, but also of a signature policy falling apart within hours of being announced. The cap on energy bills was a pledge in the Conservative manifesto and the prime minister promised to introduce the legislation to make it happen. The Conservatives had at first dismissed an energy price cap as a reckless intervention in the market that would kill competition. But by the 2017 election the policy had been adopted by Theresa May and there was cross-party support. The drive to cap energy bills is understandable on one level. The energy market has been dominated by the big six energy firms and there was a high level of public concern that these companies were exploiting customers left on standard variable tariffs. Politicians felt compelled to act, and an energy price cap had huge political appeal. Arguments are now raging about whether it will in fact work, with a real risk that although some consumers may benefit, others will find their energy bills go up to compensate. Consumers as a whole may find themselves no better off. But there is also an elephant in the room. It’s not a very attractive elephant from a political perspective, but it is impossible to ignore: it is the poor energy efficiency of the UK housing stock. The UK has the oldest building stock in Europe, and according to Eurostat data, one of the least energy efficient. There are 19 million homes in the UK with poor levels of energy efficiency – with a grade worse than a C on their energy performance certificate. The properties rated F and G, the lowest on the scale, are in fact so energy inefficient that they can kill due to the excess cold hazard they pose. This has devastating consequences. The poor efficiency of our housing stock is the principal cause of high energy bills and the main cause of fuel poverty, with 4.5 million households struggling to pay their energy bills and facing the dire choice of having to heat or eat. It also means we are pumping out far more carbon emissions than we need to, and it also contributes to the UK’s appalling track record on excess winter deaths, with an average of 25,000 people dying every year due to the cold. But a ground-breaking report by the UK’s leading academic experts on energy efficiency last month found that the UK had, in the past, put in place an energy efficiency programme which had achieved enormous cuts in energy bills. They reported that in 2015 the average UK household energy bill was a staggering £490 lower than it would have been without improvements in insulation, low carbon lighting and energy efficient appliances made since 2004. But these energy experts also found that, based on the government’s own data, it was cost-effective to use energy efficiency measures to reduce energy bills by another 25%, a reduction of on average £270 per year at today’s energy prices. They also calculated that there was long term potential to cut UK household energy bills in half. Given this remarkable potential it seems extraordinary that when the prime minister stood up and prepared to make her intervention to crack the energy bill crisis once and for all, she did not instead announce the launch of a major energy efficiency programme. It is needed now more than ever as energy bills go up once again. The recent Conservative party record on this is acutely embarrassing. In a desperate attempt to challenge Ed Miliband’s energy price cap idea back in 2014, David Cameron and George Osborne decided to slash the levy on energy bills which paid suppliers to install insulation and other energy efficiency measures. The levy was cut in half from £1.4bn per year to £650m per year and the number of measures being installed in British homes crashed by 80%. In their attempt to “cut the green crap”, as Cameron allegedly said, his government did in fact torpedo the most effective policy it had to drive down energy bills in the long run. It turned out the “green crap” was in fact green gold, saving UK households hundreds of pounds a year. But it is not too late for this government to do what’s right and desperately needed. Within the next week it is due to publish its long awaited Clean Growth Strategy, setting out its plan for meeting the UK’s climate change targets while boosting British business. The government now has the opportunity to put energy efficiency first. A consortium of leading businesses, thinktanks and NGOs have united around a proposal for the government to launch a Building Energy Infrastructure Programme. Coordinated by an infrastructure unit, it would set out to decarbonise UK buildings, with a target to make all UK homes energy efficient by 2035. Additional public investment would come from infrastructure funds, meaning that energy bill levies would not have to increase. The programme would include stamp duty rebates, a demonstrator programme of zero carbon and equity loans, working with local authorities to insulate homes street by street, grants for low income households and sensible regulations to bring down the cost. Treasury data shows that making homes energy efficient does in fact deliver comparable economic returns to road and rail projects. But renovating homes has been given no access so far to the massive capital spending budget of £120bn that is going to be spent on infrastructure projects during this parliament. This is extraordinary, given that such a programme would target the infrastructure that more people care about than any other – their homes. The greatest politicians have a vision that goes beyond short term electoral cycles and leaves a legacy that benefits the country for generations. Making our housing stock highly energy efficient may not be political dynamite. But this is the solution to high energy bills that all political parties should now be uniting behind. It is hard to think of any other infrastructure programme that could do so much for so many. • Ed Matthew is associate director of climate and energy thinktank E3G"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/08/labour-of-love-review-james-graham-martin-freeman-tamsin-greig","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T07:00:44Z","webTitle":"Labour of Love review – the left does the splits, gracefully","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/08/labour-of-love-review-james-graham-martin-freeman-tamsin-greig","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/08/labour-of-love-review-james-graham-martin-freeman-tamsin-greig","fields":{"headline":"Labour of Love review – the left does the splits, gracefully","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Five years is a long time in the theatre. It’s hard to believe that it was only in 2012 that This House was staged at the National. It wasn’t James Graham’s first play: Neil McPherson of the tiny Finborough is owed applause for encouraging him early on. But it was the drama that took Graham, still barely 30, to a big audience and announced his particular idea of political drama. Nifty, buoyant, topical. Above all, popular. Plays – such as Privacy – that make their points structurally as well as in debate. Plays that can capture a West End audience. Graham has double-proved that last point over the past few weeks. His Murdoch play, Ink, transferred to the West End from the Almeida last month; now Labour of Love joins it a few doors down. A light-on-its feet canter through the past 27 years of the Labour party, it neatly encapsulates the uneasy alliance between old and New Labour in the bumpy romance between a constituency agent and a Blairite MP. The local party, in Nottinghamshire (in his 20s, Graham worked as a doorkeeper at Nottingham Playhouse), versus Westminster. The traditional symbol and the new brand. The Red Flag and the red rose: “looks pretty and is full of pricks”. There are some sketchy background performances and an over-Penelope-Keithed one from Rachael Stirling as the MP’s improbable wife. But Martin Freeman fans will find it worth a ticket to see him as that MP, breaking out of respectability with a hand-flipping dance, with little leaps. Tamsin Greig addicts can revel in her ability to do ballistic farce and po-faced drawl without looking as if she thinks herself amusing. She ages subtly too – from droopy bob to crop – finding what she calls “the lack of oil in the joints”. Jeremy Herrin’s production skips along, spinning the romance, telling dodgy jokes (like the one about the temporary bisexual: “bi for now”). It doesn’t go deep into Labour policy, but makes the divisions clear. And as Labour of Love runs backwards then loops forwards again it indicates, without didacticism, how little the new Labour looks like New Labour. Importantly, politics go right through to the seats in this comedy. There are some £10 tickets for all performances. Graham is clear: it’s daft, he argues, to say you are “engaging in a national conversation about the direction of the left… if you’re going to fill your Victorian theatre with people who can afford expensive tickets”. Labour of Love is at the Noël Coward theatre, London, until 2 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/08/bank-of-england-independence-20th-anniversary-brexit-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T06:00:43Z","webTitle":"Don’t count on our independent Bank to stop Brexit disaster | William Keegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/08/bank-of-england-independence-20th-anniversary-brexit-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/08/bank-of-england-independence-20th-anniversary-brexit-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Don’t count on our independent Bank to stop Brexit disaster","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In common with Sir John Major, Denis Healey, the Bank of England’s historian David Kynaston, and former governor (1983-93) Robin Leigh-Pemberton, I had great reservations about the granting of independence to the Bank. By independence – more precisely “operational independence” – was meant control of monetary policy: giving the Bank the power to change interest rates, as opposed to merely offering advice to chancellors and prime ministers that could be ignored. We doubters were mindful of the excessively deflationary bent of the Bank during the interwar years. When the Bank was nationalised by the Attlee government in 1946 – a reaction to Labour’s problems with the economy and the Bank’s influence in the 1920s – the Labour peer Lord Passfield said, recalling those troubled interwar years: “Nobody told us we could do that.” It was with this history in mind that I was so shocked when Gordon Brown, encouraged, indeed ably assisted, by Ed Balls, granted the Bank independence in a first dramatic act after the 1997 general election. This year sees the 20th anniversary of the granting of independence and, given the depth of the economic problems facing this country, it was a good moment recently for the Bank to hold a public conference, at which Brown, Balls and others were able to reflect on the record of their creation. It is also good timing that Kynaston’s magnificent Till Time’s Last Sand: A History of The Bank of England 1694-2013 has recently been published. At the conference, most of the media coverage concentrated on a speech by Theresa May that had little to do with the Bank, but was billed as a defence of capitalism at the end of a week when most of the press had done its best to pillory Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell for their leftwing programme. But the high spot of the conference was a brilliant presentation by Brown, in which he acknowledged what had gone wrong with the original concept. Few were in doubt that the monetary policy committee had done a pretty good job. The problem had been with the independent Bank’s approach to financial stability, or the lack of it. Inflation has hardly been a problem these past 20 years. It is an open question to what extent this has been due to the central Bank, as opposed to the impact of globalisation and competitive forces emanating from China. Nevertheless, operational independence in monetary policy has worked better than some of us feared; the point was made at the conference that knowledge of the inflation target has probably had a beneficent influence on wage bargainers who, in the past, would assume the worst of the prospect for inflation, and bargain everyone into the kind of wage-price spiral that only ends in disaster. But back to financial stability. It was a theme of the 20th anniversary conference that the newly independent Bank had been asleep at the wheel, both in the run-up to the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 and the immediate aftermath. In particular, the blame fell on the then governor Mervyn, now Lord, King, for allegedly having placed all the emphasis on monetary policy, at the expense of the Bank’s overall responsibility for the financial system; for the Bank still possessed this function, even though day-to-day supervision had been hived off to the Financial Services Authority. Brown was scathing about the behaviour of the governor he had appointed, not only for going on about “moral hazard” – ie being reluctant at first to bail out banks for fear it would set a bad example, but also for publicly offering advice on fiscal policy. The deal was supposed to be that the chancellor would not intervene in monetary matters, nor the Bank in matters of public expenditure and taxation– which King did, negatively, when the economy was nowhere near enjoying sustained recovery from the crisis. All in all, the independent Bank did not emerge well from the crisis, as Kynaston underlines in his book, although he goes out of his way to be fair, noting that some senior officials were not unaware of mounting problems at Northern Rock and elsewhere. Anyway, both Brown and Balls have concluded that lessons have to be learned, and that there needs to be more cooperation between Bank and government in future. One of the ironies they concede is that, by removing decisions on interest rates, which used to take up a lot of ministerial and Treasury time, the hope was that the Treasury would be able to concentrate more on wider economic policy. Well, to judge from the state of the economy now, there is a lot left to be desired when it comes to the achievement of a successful economic policy. This was all too apparent last Monday when, at that bizarre Conservative party conference in Manchester, chancellor Philip Hammond devoted his main thrust to attacking Labour, in the face of whose success with the younger generation the Tories are running scared. But the problems of the economy now are nothing compared with what is to come if our leaders, and the people they are supposed to lead, do not come to their senses and recognise that Brexit has to be stopped. The present Bank governor Mark Carney is well aware of the absurdity of Brexit, but his powers are reduced to damage limitation. Which makes me wonder why a manifest slowdown in the economy now is being met by threats of a rise in interest rates. This Brexit business is an unmitigated disaster. As a senior European politician recently observed of the British: “It was heroic of you in 1940 to stand on your own against your enemies; it is ridiculous in 2017 to stand on your own against your friends.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/oct/08/azed-crossword-2365","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T23:01:34Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,365","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/oct/08/azed-crossword-2365","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/oct/08/azed-crossword-2365","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,365","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Special Instructions The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.

Ministers have said building owners are responsible for funding safety measures, but town hall leaders complain that they are “washing their hands of their responsibilities” and are being “dismissive”, four months after the blaze at the Kensington tower block, which claimed about 80 lives. The government has said it will consider help “where works are essential”, but has so far resisted bids for support to retrofit sprinklers in towers despite the London fire brigade (LFB) saying this must happen. The Conservative-run Westminster council is understood to be the latest town hall to have had a request for financial assistance pushed back by ministers. It is removing cladding from six high-rise towers and wants to install sprinklers across other tall council blocks at an estimated cost of £20m. The housing minister, Alok Sharma, has already declined Nottingham city council’s request for help to install sprinklers inside flats and communal areas in 13 towers at a cost of £6.2m. Sharma told the council: “The fire safety measures you outline are additional rather than essential.” He has told the London borough of Croydon, which wants to spend £10m on retrofitting sprinklers to 25 tall residential blocks: “It is the landlord’s responsibility to ensure that people are safe.” Wandsworth wants to spend up to £30m on sprinklers in 100 towers but has been told: “Support will not include general improvement and enhancements to buildings.” All the councils said they had been advised to carry out works by their local fire brigades. The tension over who should foot the fire safety bill follows a pledge in July by the communities secretary, Sajid Javid, that any lack of financial resources would not prevent necessary works going ahead. However, the government appears determined not to fund or allow additional borrowing for any improvements that go beyond essential safety works. The necessity of sprinklers is proving a key faultline. Dany Cotton, commissioner of the LFB, has said retrofitting sprinklers in tower blocks “can’t be optional, it can’t be a nice-to-have”. Since 2007 they have been compulsory in new-build high-rises over 30 metres tall in England, but those building regulations do not apply to older blocks. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) argues that an appropriate level of fire safety can be achieved without the need to retrofit sprinklers, and fitting them is a matter for landlords to consider for themselves. A recent study of 677 fires where sprinklers were activated found they controlled or extinguished the fire in 99% of cases. The nationwide bill for replacing flammable cladding and retrofitting sprinklers is already likely to run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Southwark has previously estimated that the bill for installing sprinklers in its towers could be as high as £100m, and it is currently finalising its bid for funding. The council leader, Peter John, has told Javid: “Fire safety is a national issue and the financial burden for these works must not fall on already stretched councils.” Birmingham city council, the UK’s largest council landlord, is yet to submit a request for retrofitting sprinklers in up to 213 blocks. So far, 31 town halls have asked for government help to make high-rise flats safe. The DCLG said it was in detailed discussions with six, and others had been invited to provide further information about how the work they wished to undertake was essential. In Salford, the city council has borrowed £25m to fund works to remove potentially flammable cladding from nine towers, and leaders have accused the government of “failing to live up to its responsibility”. “Like many other councils, Salford is lobbying the government to recognise the huge financial cost of this national issue and provide funding to us and other local authorities to deal with it,” said the deputy city mayor, John Merry. Pressed on funding at the Conservative party conference in Manchester this week, Theresa May said: “We have said we would work with local authorities on any adaptations and changes they needed to make to ensure the safety of those tower blocks.” But asked about funding sprinklers, she said: “There’s a number of issues that can improve the safety of tower blocks. It is not just one answer.” Jane Urquart, the cabinet member for housing at Nottingham city council, said: “The government said a lot of things after the tragedy about money not being an object to ensuring safety. Now councils like ours, which have faced huge cuts over the last few years, are being told to dig into our pockets. The consequence of the government not paying is that other repairs to our housing stock won’t happen.” Adam Hug, leader of the Labour opposition at Westminster city council, said he had seen correspondence with the government detailing the council’s request for financial aid or better flexibility on borrowing. “Both were being asked for,” he said. “They were told: only in exceptional circumstances. Yet again it will be council tenants and people who desperately need new homes who are left to pay the price of this Tory government washing their hands of their responsibilities.” A spokeswoman for Westminster said it was “in ongoing discussions with the DCLG about a range of fire safety-related issues”. The DCLG said it had told Westminster it would consider removing financial restrictions where barriers stood in the way of essential works being done. “Building owners are responsible for funding measures designed to make a building safe,” said a spokesman for the department. “We’ve been clear that where a local authority has concerns about funding essential fire safety measures, they should contact DCLG as soon as possible to discuss their position. The department has written to Nottingham, Croydon and Wandsworth councils inviting them to provide more detail about the works they propose. To date these authorities have not submitted this information.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/11/wednesdays-best-tv-back-norskov-the-apprentice","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s best TV: Back; Norskov; The Apprentice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/11/wednesdays-best-tv-back-norskov-the-apprentice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/11/wednesdays-best-tv-back-norskov-the-apprentice","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s best TV: Back; Norskov; The Apprentice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Back 10pm, Channel 4 Final episode of the Mitchell and Webb comedy with a mysterious edge, and Andrew has a bizarre reaction when his fellow foster kids attend a memorial for Laurie.

Threading the ditch, their heads bent low, Toward the lines of the watchful foe They came through the murk and the powder stench Till the Sergeant whispered, “Third-line trench!” And the Captain whispered, “Third-line trench!” And the Aide repeated, “Third-line trench!” And Pershing answered – not in French – “Yes, I see it. Third-line trench.” Again they marched with wary tread, Following on where the Sergeant led Through the wet and the muck as well, Till they came to another parallel. They halted there in the mud and drench, And the Sergeant whispered, “Second-line trench!” And the Captain whispered, “Second-line trench!” And the Aide repeated, “Second-line trench!” And Pershing nodded: “Second-line trench!” Yet on they went through mire like pitch Till they came to a fine and spacious ditch Well camouflaged from planes and Zeps Where soldiers stood on firing steps And a Major sat on a wooden bench; And the Sergeant whispered, “First-line trench!” And the Captain whispered, “First-line trench!” And the Aide repeated, “First-line trench!” And Pershing whispered, “Yes, I see. How far off is the enemy?” And the faithful Aide he asked, asked he, “How far off is the enemy?” And the Captain breathed in a softer key, “How far off is the enemy?” The silence lay in heaps and piles And the Sergeant whispered, “Just three miles.” And the Captain whispered, “Just three miles.” And the Aide repeated, “Just three miles.” “Just three miles!” the General swore, “What in the heck are we whispering for?” And the faithful Aide the message bore, “What in the heck are we whispering for?” And the Captain said in a gentle roar, “What in the heck are we whispering for?” “Whispering for?” the echo rolled; And the Sergeant whispered, “I have a cold.” I had never heard of Arthur Guiterman until, searching out Richard Watson Dixon’s poems the other week, I found his name on the rather impressive website, Watchers of the Moon, dedicated to “the poetry of science and mathematical physics of the long 19th century”. Guiterman (the name rhymes with “fitter-man”) died in 1943, a prolific and successful comic poet and journalist. He was also the co-founder of the Poetry Society of America, and later became its president. He has a delectable flair for rhyming, and a timing that may be cleverer than his jokes. He satirises the technological obsessions and science fads of his times, as in Radiolatry, where arcane vocabulary and common exasperation set his valves alight. Social pretensions are noted with a keen but not unkindly eye in such poems as The Traveler. In Pershing at the Front, the social mockery focuses on military protocol. There are four main characters: General Pershing, who commanded the US Expeditionary Force at the western front (1917-18), his “faithful” aide-de-camp, the Top Sergeant, representing the lowest rank in the group, never mind that he’s the real expert in the field, and the Captain, who ensures that contact with the sergeant doesn’t tarnish the top brass. I’m indebted to Curt Smothers’s blog for his clarifications about these roles. Smothers finds an echo of limerick rhythm in Guiterman’s tetrameter. Those infiltrations by anapaest (di-di-dum) add jauntiness to a line, and, perhaps, the comic-sinister tattoo of a war drum. The couplets pair some unpredictable rhymes, although rhyme isn’t the major generator of the poem’s humour. The threading of sardonic poetic cliche (“watchful foe”, “wary tread”) with the diction of precisely descriptive reportage (“planes and Zeps”) produces a light but not stupidly trivialising register. Guiterman doesn’t appear to have seen active service in the first world war, but he portrays the squalor and stench with conviction. It likely he knew and admired the major war poems. The first stanza crisply sets the scene. Comic mileage then accumulates steadily, the characters repeating each other’s words in a whisper, initiated by the Sergeant, as they move towards the frontline. The whispering refrain is crucial. Why are these heroes whispering, the reader thinks: do they imagine it will save their skin? The lines of echo dialogue would be funny in an old-fashioned TV sitcom, but they’re funnier as pictures in a reader’s head. Guiterman adds just enough detail of manner or tone to spark our imaginations. He intervenes subtly in stanza three, when Pershing, already growing impatient, adds: “Yes, I see it. Third-line trench.” The observation that Pershing’s answer is “not in French” alludes to the unpopularity of the military strategy Pershing brought to Paris, but it might also suggest the limits of the top man’s education. The General is not a particular satirical target, though. You’ll notice that he whispers only when supposedly near the frontline! The longest stanza in the bunch, the fourth, sketches a vivid, socially telling picture of the men already in position at the first-line trench. Then, for a moment, in stanza five, Guiterman’s diction achieves the strangeness and daring of a serious poem: “The silence lay in heaps and piles.” His surreal image also allows the comic business to progress. Tension builds. The Captain is still echoing the Sergeant’s whisper, but the revelation that “the enemy” is three miles away infuriates Pershing to an outburst:“What in the heck are we whispering for?” Naturally, the others repeat the question, the captain’s “gentle roar” indicating his social ambivalence. The Sergeant’s blunt explanation finally unravels the hypocrisy and ignorance of his imitators: “I have a cold.” No, it’s not a great joke.

It was the first time in seven years that the US monthly total had recorded a fall. The US economy had added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year but as the labor department had predicted the storms, which caused fatal and catastrophic damage across Texas and Florida, slowed hiring. But a loss in jobs was far worse than the 80,000 new jobs most US economists had expected would be created. It ends the longest stretch of uninterrupted jobs growth in US history. This was the first loss in jobs since September 2010. Ahead of Friday’s jobs report the Bureau of Labor Statistics said some 11.2 million workers lived in the affected areas, about 7.7% of the US workforce. Employment in food services and drinking places declined by 105,000 in September. That sector has added an average of 24,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. The unemployment rate, which was 4.4% in August, fell to 4.2%, a 16-year low. This is the second month of disappointing growth in the US jobs market. In August the economy added 156,000 new jobs, below the 180,000 that had been expected by economists. August’s jobs report was revised up from 156,000 to 169,000 but July’s was revised down to 138,000 from 189,000, a net loss of 38,000 for the two months. The disappointing jobs figures could continue. After Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, the US reported a 35,000 decline in jobs, well below the three-month average of 175,000 in job gains. It took two payroll reports for the jobs market to recover. On Wednesday ADP, the payrolls processor, said the private sector had added 135,000 jobs in September, sharply down from the 228,000 added in August. “Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt the job market in September,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, which helps compile the ADP report. But he added that: “Looking through the storms the job market remains sturdy and strong.” Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: “If past storms, particularly Katrina, are any guide, employment will rebound markedly over the next few months. The drop in the unemployment rate might persist, however, with consumer and small business surveys both pointing to a drop in the unemployment rate to nearer 4% for some time.” Puerto Rico, the US territory also devastated by the hurricanes, is not counted in the jobs report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/27/aztec-baked-eggs-quick-recipe-day-of-dead-mexican-thomasina-miers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T16:00:34Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ quick recipe for Aztec baked eggs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/27/aztec-baked-eggs-quick-recipe-day-of-dead-mexican-thomasina-miers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/27/aztec-baked-eggs-quick-recipe-day-of-dead-mexican-thomasina-miers","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ quick recipe for Aztec baked eggs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s that time of year again when we at Wahaca call up our favourite face painters, bands and artists to celebrate Mexico’s most popular fiesta, the Day of the Dead. This annual holiday encompasses a day for adults on 1 November and a family day on the second, giving people the opportunity to remember deceased relatives and to celebrate the lives of those they respect or admire. In Mexico, it is basically an excuse to party, and great feasts are prepared to share with friends and family, taking place either at the graveyards of the relatives being remembered, or at home, in front of homemade altars decorated with sugar skulls and marigolds, poems and photographs. The idea is that the souls of the departed will find the smells and sights of the mouth-watering dishes and spirits so tempting that they will come back to Earth for two days, to hang out and be together once more. It’s possibly our favourite time of year, and we’re celebrating this year in the Vaults, below London’s Waterloo station, with all profits being donated to funds to support the victims of last month’s earthquake. Whether you celebrate this spiritual and moving celebration, or Halloween, a comforting, restorative plate of baked Mexican eggs should put a bit of vim back into your step the next day. Serve with tortillas or crusty bread to mop up those glorious juices. Aztec baked eggs This incredibly simple dish uses classic Mexican spices, cinnamon and allspice to give it the deep, warming flavours that I associate with much of this country’s food. Serves two to four. 2 red peppers, halved and deseeded 7 vine tomatoes, halved 1 red chilli 1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed 1 tsp ground allspice 1 tsp ground cinnamon 6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to drizzle Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 onion, peeled and sliced 4 eggs 1 large handful coriander leaves, roughly chopped Warm tortillas (or fresh crusty bread) 1 small pot soured cream (optional) Heat the grill to high and line a large oven tray with foil. Put the pepper and tomato halves cut-side up on the tray, add the chilli and spices, then drizzle over two tablespoons of the oil, a sprinkling of salt and a good grind of pepper. Grill on a high heat for 30 minutes, turning the pepper halves once, until everything is well blackened – you need a proper char. Put the pepper halves and chilli in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to sweat. Put the tomatoes to one side to cool. Remove the skin and stem from the peppers, and put them in a food processor with the chilli (if you prefer things less spicy, deseed it first) and any juices in the bowl. Add the tomatoes and two tablespoons of oil, then blitz to a smooth puree. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper and, if need be, a pinch of brown sugar to help the tomatoes along. Heat a large frying pan for which you have a lid on a medium-high flame, then add the remaining two tablespoons of oil and the onion. Season, then sweat, stirring from time to time, for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Stir in the pepper and tomato sauce, then crack the eggs into the pan, making sure they’re spaced well apart. When the whites start to turn opaque around the edges, cover the pan and leave to simmer for 10-12 minutes, until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny. Season to taste, scatter coriander on top and serve with tortillas and dollops of soured cream. And for the rest of the week… The combination of coriander seed, cinnamon and allspice is intoxicating. Bash all three together with olive oil, a few cloves of garlic and the zest and juice of a lemon, rub this mix all over a chicken and/or tray of root vegetables (parsnips and carrots are a family favourite), then roast in a hot oven until golden and caramelised. All you need alongside is some yoghurt, fresh herbs and a bowl of steamed rice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"cities/2017/nov/16/japan-reusable-housing-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T07:29:53Z","webTitle":"Raze, rebuild, repeat: why Japan knocks down its houses after 30 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/16/japan-reusable-housing-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/nov/16/japan-reusable-housing-revolution","fields":{"headline":"Raze, rebuild, repeat: why Japan knocks down its houses after 30 years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the suburban neighbourhood of Midorigaoka, about an hour by train outside Kobe, Japan, all the houses were built by the same company in the same factory. Steel frames fitted out with panel walls and ceilings, these homes were clustered by the hundreds into what was once a brand new commuter town. But they weren’t built to last. Daiwa House, one of the biggest prefabricated housing manufacturers in Japan, built this town in the 60s during a postwar housing boom. It’s not unlike the suburban subdivisions of the western world, with porches, balconies and rooflines that shift and repeat up and down blocks of gently curving roads. Most of those houses built in the 60s are no longer standing, having long since been replaced by newer models, finished with fake brick ceramic siding in beiges, pinks and browns. In the end, most of these prefabricated houses – and indeed most houses in Japan – have a lifespan of only about 30 years. Unlike in other countries, Japanese homes gradually depreciate over time, becoming completely valueless within 20 or 30 years. When someone moves out of a home or dies, the house, unlike the land it sits on, has no resale value and is typically demolished. This scrap-and-build approach is a quirk of the Japanese housing market that can be explained variously by low-quality construction to quickly meet demand after the second world war, repeated building code revisions to improve earthquake resilience and a cycle of poor maintenance due to the lack of any incentive to make homes marketable for resale. In Midorigaoka, even the newer homes built in the 80s and 90s are nearing the end of their expected lifespan. Under normal circumstances, their days might be numbered. But down at the end of one block, there’s a sign things are changing. Scaffolding surrounds a vacant house on a corner and workers from Daiwa House are clanging away inside. They’re not demolishing the house but refurbishing it – reorganising the floor plan, knocking down walls, opening up the kitchen and enhancing the insulation. Rather than tear down the house so the next buyer can build something new, they’re rebuilding it from the inside and putting it back on the market. It’s a relatively rare commodity, but something that is increasingly common across Japan: a secondhand home. “For the first time, Japanese people are beginning to appreciate living in older homes,” says Noboru Kaihou, a Daiwa House public information officer. Shifting citizenry Everywhere from major metropolitan areas such as Tokyo and Osaka to struggling mid-size cities to suburban housing estates, renovated buildings are an evolving niche in the property market, emblematic of the dramatic transformation under way in Japan. The country is shrinking, with a negative growth rate that’s expected to bring its current population of about 127 million down to 88 million by 2065. It’s also an ageing society, and within 20 years over a third of its inhabitants will be 65 or older. As the population shrinks and ages, it is also concentrating into metropolitan areas, leaving millions of suburban and rural homes vacant. The current vacancy rate nationwide is about 13%, according to the Nomura Research Institute, and that figure is expected to rise above 30% by 2033. Coupled with Japan’s stagnant economy, these statistics have many convinced that the market for new buildings will begin to dry. Like Daiwa House, many other big housing manufacturers are getting into the refurbishing business. A 45-minute drive north of Tokyo, the country’s largest prefab builder, Sekisui House, operates a home park featuring its newest models. Most cater to the high end of the market, with large multistorey layouts and luxury finishings, but tucked in a corner is a more modest two-storey house. The first floor is furnished like a typical home built in the 80s: small rooms, highly compartmentalised spaces and even a recliner in the living room. Upstairs, the same floorplan has been updated so that the kitchen opens out onto the dining area and walls are pushed back or removed altogether. A traditional tatami mat sitting room in the old layout becomes a media room, with a low couch and a flatscreen television. For the company, these simple renovations can turn a vacant home into a new sale. “If we can remodel these old houses, their value will not decrease to zero and we won’t have to demolish them,” says Kenichi Ishida, a managing officer at Sekisui House. “Nowadays young people don’t have much money, so they won’t hesitate to buy older buildings.” In Takatsuki, halfway between Osaka and Kyoto, that economic reality is evident. “Many of the younger generation around my neighbourhood live in renovated homes,” says one 39-year-old resident. He himself lives in a renovated Sekisui House with his wife and two young children, and notes that the price of a renovated home was much lower than that of a new one. “We want to save money for taking care of our kids and parents,” he says. “For us, the renovated home located close to my parents’ home has much higher value than a newly built home that is far away.” It’s not just the big housing manufacturers that are catching on. Zoe Ward is a Tokyo real estate agent and CEO of Japan Property Central, which specialises in finding homes for expats, and she says buyers are starting to reconsider the value of older buildings. New companies have opened in recent years that focus specifically on refreshing old spaces. “Sometimes they’ll gut the entire building to its concrete shell,” she says. “The outside won’t look any different from the buildings around it, but inside it’ll look like a brand new house.” As demand for housing grows in Tokyo, renovation companies are on the lookout for people ready to sell. “We get them calling every day,” Ward says. ‘A new lifestyle’ Renovation isn’t always an option. In the Tokyo suburb of Tachikawa, Shiro Kawashima and his wife, both middle-aged, are walking through a faux neighbourhood lined with model homes. Built by prefabricated-housing manufacturers and local carpenters, the homes are on display and available for tours guided by eager salespeople. The couple, who live nearby, are here shopping for a new home, albeit reluctantly. “I’m really proud of my old house,” he says. “It’s regrettable but I have to tear it down.” The house is 70 years old he says – a rarity – and suffering from structural damage that is prohibitively expensive to fix. Moving is also out of the budget, so his only option is to tear the old house down and build anew. The houses on display here don’t appeal to him. “Not at all,” he says, disappointed. “I just want a simple, basic structure,” he says. Like his current home. Younger people, particularly in urban areas, have more flexible options. To accommodate them, new companies are looking beyond conventional housing. In recent years, a number of small development companies have been buying up older buildings and giving them new uses. The Tokyo-based company ReBITA has been converting apartment buildings, offices and company dormitories into shared live-work spaces – affordable rental units with common kitchens and work areas. Such spaces were uncommon in Japan just five years ago, says Azby Brown, director of the Kanazawa Institute of Technology’s Future Design Institute in Tokyo. “It’s a new lifestyle and I don’t think a lot of the big housing companies have picked up on it yet.” He says it’s as much about reducing the cost of housing as embracing a more community-oriented form of living. Some even see these types of social space as a roundabout way to reverse the country’s low birth rate. In the face of Japan’s demographic trends, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is doing its own bit of social engineering as it focuses on refurbishing the mid- and high-rise apartment buildings that rose across the city during the 60s and early 70s. To give new life to these buildings, the capital is encouraging families with small children to move in by prioritising their applications. It is also helping people to qualify for housing slots if they choose to live close to their elderly parents. “All of these efforts are related to dealing with our ageing society,” says Hiroyuki Ebina, a director of planning and housing in the Bureau of Urban Development. But it’s not just about freshening up the resident pool. The buildings in question are often maintained through tenant associations, and as older tenants die, there’s less money for upkeep and earthquake retrofits. To inject more contributions to those efforts, the national government’s Urban Renaissance Agency is trying to lure younger people into these buildings. One approach is by partnering with the minimalist retailer Muji. As well as being a global presence, the Japanese brand retains considerable cachet in its home country, where its simple, utilitarian products are widely popular. Through its association with the Urban Renaissance Agency, Muji has begun renovating and redecorating units in public housing blocks to attract younger tenants – tearing out walls, replacing clunky kitchen cabinets with open storage spaces and racks, clearing space for bicycle storage. “The old design doesn’t fit with younger people’s tastes,” says Koji Kawachi, director of Muji’s dwelling space operation, noting that many of the buildings have a cramped, overly partitioned layout. “The renovation is based on the idea that small, separated rooms can be integrated into larger spaces,” he says. The company strips the rooms of excessive finishes and replaces them with clean white surfaces and spare wood furnishings. Kawachi says the Muji units receive five to seven times as many applications as typical units. The company has completed more than 500 renovations so far, and plans to continue with 150 to 200 units per year. With more than 750,000 housing units under its purview, the Urban Renaissance Agency has scope to experiment. A new urban landscape As Japan’s population shrinks and shifts, the demand for space has become increasingly uneven, which has left many small and mid-sized cities in a state of slow decline. The southern city of Kitakyushu, a former steel city, has seen its population growth rate fall to -1.5%. It’s just an hour by train from Fukuoka, the startup capital of Japan and the fifth largest city in the country, which has seen a population influx due to strategic tax incentives and foreign resident immigration reforms. But while Fukuoka is booming, Kitakyushu is emptying out. For Mitsuhiro Tokuda, the decline was particularly evident in the city’s downtown area, a compact network of narrow commercial streets and large shopping arcades. Tokuda, a professor of architecture at the Kyushu Institute of Technology, launched a study of downtown Kitakyushu to quantify how much of the city had become vacant. With a team of students, he conducted a detailed survey to identify which buildings were partially or completely vacant and which could be reused. “But thinking can’t change anything,” he says. So he started a small business to work with property owners to renovate vacant spaces for new uses. Their first product took a vacant 5th floor and converted it into shared office spaces now used by graphics designers and video editors. Tokuda walks through the ground floor of a mid-rise building near the centre of Kitakyushu’s downtown. A former clothes factory, it had long been empty. Tokuda and his team converted it into a hodgepodge of new spaces – a community room, small offices, creative work spaces for local craftspeople, a cafe and various boutiques. One features vintage paperback books. Another display window holds a pair of leopard-print loafers. Almost all of the spaces are now rented out. Nearby is Mizutama Shokudo, a restaurant in a renovated space. “We like old buildings, so when we started our business, we looked for an old property from the beginning,” says co-owner Yuka Ishikawa. “We liked the fact that this building is not facing a busy main street and it’s in the peaceful, old-style shopping neighbourhood.” She admits there are some downsides to older buildings. Rain sometimes leaks through its old roof and a recent fire next door partially burned some of the wood structure. But it’s part of the character of the space, she says, and works alongside the theme of the restaurant, which serves “mother’s home cooking-style” meals. “By serving that kind of meal in this old building, we would like to keep conveying the beauty of old things that have been cherished by people for a long time.” Tokuda says he saw a bigger potential for this type of building reuse and wanted to teach others to try it for themselves. In 2011 he launched what he calls a Renovation School in which students – architects, designers and businesspeople, mostly – develop business plans for reusing vacant space. It’s a crash course, and over one week teams identify vacant spaces, survey local needs and create plans. On the final day, they pitch their plans to the property owners. Tokuda says the school has resulted in dozens of projects. Renovation Schools have now been conducted in cities across Japan, creating new retail spaces, hotels, cafes and apartments out of once-vacant buildings. The impact is easy to see in Kitakyushu. Walking down a commercial street, Tokuda points to four different buildings on one block that have been reused or redeveloped through the Renovation School. The property owners and businesspeople have even formed an association that raised funds to re-landscape the street. Cracked asphalt on the narrow street has been replaced with square concrete paving stones, their varying shades of grey laid out like a long mosaic. Streetlights have been painted bright green and some shopkeepers, like those running a bar inside an old shipping container, have added benches and seating outside for public use. Tokuda says this approach to reusing space can be a kind of catalyst for change. “By stimulating the building, we can stimulate the neighbourhood,” he says. “It’s a form of town renovation.” Ishikawa, the restaurant co-owner, says renovated buildings like hers represent hope for the future in Kitakyushu. “We want to create a new cycle of ‘live in the town, work in the town, and patronise the businesses in the town’.” Travel for this article was supported by the Abe Fellowship for Journalists, a reporting grant from the Social Science Research Council and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, or explore our archive"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2017/oct/09/the-real-risks-of-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"The real risks of artificial intelligence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2017/oct/09/the-real-risks-of-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2017/oct/09/the-real-risks-of-artificial-intelligence","fields":{"headline":"The real risks of artificial intelligence","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Professor Toby Walsh has recently published a book – Android Dreams – giving a researcher’s perspective on the uncertainties and opportunities of artificial intelligence.

Like Exeter last season and Bath the year before Wasps have lost three of their first five Premiership matches and defeat at Saracens on Sunday would dump them in their worst run since 2014. Wasps started with victories over two clubs who finished in the bottom three last season, Sale and Worcester, but then lost to Harlequins and Bath at home with a 14-point reverse away to the team who defeated them in the final in May, Exeter, sandwiched between. Like many clubs Wasps have a long injury list but they have struggled to recapture their broken-play swagger of recent seasons, and not only because Kurtley Beale has returned to Australia. Bath strangled them last weekend at the Ricoh Arena by slowing down their ball and narrowing their lines of attack. “I hope it is not a hangover from the final but Bath and Exeter dipped after losing in one,” says the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young. “We have said since the start of the season, including the victories, that we have not been playing the way we like. “We had enough quality to see us through in the first two rounds but we need to get our accuracy back and respect the ball more, both when it comes to kicking and passing. We have been losing the possession and territory battles because we have lacked patience and composure, and we need to defend for fewer periods. “Last season has gone. Although we believe we are a good team, we are not good enough to beat many sides in the Premiership if we are well below standard. Bring our A-game and we are more than a match for anybody, difficult to beat. We have dropped below the standards we set. Injuries have hindered our preparation as well as performances but we need to be more simple and direct rather than playing too much in the wrong areas and causing ourselves problems.” The last time Wasps lost three league games in a row, in 2015, they ended the run with victory over Worcester, as they had the year before after four straight defeats, but Saracens will take rather more toppling. Wasps have won only two of the last 11 league meetings between the clubs but, looking at it another way, they have won two of the last three, including a 64-23 success at Allianz Park during the 2016 Six Nations. “The defeats have been a poke in the eye and everyone at the club, coaches and players, need to look at ourselves,” says Young. “We are all in it together. We win together and we lose together. It has highlighted the fact that what we did last season will not be good enough this one; the game has moved on. We need to move on with it. We are conceding a lot of points. We are more of an attacking team than a defensive one but the boys are working hard and we are up there in tackle completion. We are just giving teams too many chances.” Wasps’ England flanker James Haskell has yet to taste victory this season having missed the first two matches because of injury. He believes a trip to the home of the Champions Cup winners for the last two seasons will focus minds. “Going away to Saracens is an opportunity to test yourself and you have to win these games if you have a desire to be successful this season,” he says. “Results have been disappointing but you cannot fault the boys’ work ethic or desire to play. Sometimes it just does not go the way you want. “All teams go through a bad period. Exeter lost a few games early on last season but still went on to win the Premiership. It is about turning things around and that is not by trying harder but being smarter and making sure as individuals we all improve. We need to raise the bar. It is easy in this position to look elsewhere but you have to look at home and ask what you can do. If everyone finds an extra 10%, we will get the results we deserve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/06/worcester-gary-gold-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T11:11:47Z","webTitle":"Worcester’s Gary Gold: ‘We don’t have a crisis.

We’ve got a problem’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Imagine you are a well-regarded rugby coach, presiding over the league’s bottom team. What would you do if someone with an American accent offered you a fistful of dollars and the biggest job in US rugby? Gary Gold has duly signed up as the next Eagles head coach but the high‑fives are on hold. After five successive Premiership defeats, Worcester are less bothered about American dreams than extracting themselves from an increasingly Grand Canyon-sized hole. Not that Gold is the type to jump gleefully to safety without a backward glance; he was due to return home at the end of this season anyway, having initially arrived merely as a consultant. It is also only four years since he suffered the cruellest of coaching cuts, ousted from Bath shortly after having relocated his family to Somerset. His return this weekend to the Recreation Ground with Worcester will arouse understandably mixed emotions. “I haven’t been back to Bath since. I’ve no idea how it’s going to be. I’ll be going back with quite a sore heart.” If anyone is a world-class authority on the rollercoaster existence of modern coaches in both hemispheres it is surely the thoughtful South African, who took his first job in the UK with London Irish at the beginning of the millennium. Coaching “underdog” teams – and helping younger coaches avoid the pitfalls he has encountered – remains his passion, at the expense of a cosier existence back in Cape Town: “I think my children would much rather I was a bank manager, a clerk pushing paper, home for dinner at 5.30pm. This is my 18th year as a professional coach ... if I had my life again I wouldn’t have minded being a lawyer.” All that top-level coaching experience – he was assistant Springboks coach from 2008 to 2011 and has also enjoyed spells at Newcastle, Western Province and the Sharks – has also taught the 50-year-old another brutal truth: a coach cannot please everyone, particularly impatient wealthy club owners. He is far from alone in being shown the Bath door; more unusually the club were third in the table when Bruce Craig opted to hand over his pet project to Mike Ford, with whom Gold had been working at both Newcastle and Bath. Gold remains distinctly unimpressed. “The Bath time was one of the lowest points in my life because of the nature of how it was done and why it was done,” he says, crisply. His enduring friendship with Toby Booth and others – “The players are a great bunch and the supporters are absolutely wonderful” – will not dilute his satisfaction should Worcester somehow spring a surprise this weekend. Either way, he is sure of one thing: all coaches are increasingly affected by the social media vitriol swirling around every track-suited operative: “It’s changed the dynamics of the job completely. It takes a unique individual to crack on and not be affected. There are times when I don’t know if I’m that type of individual; other times my skin becomes a little bit thicker. But it absolutely affects your decision-making, your demeanour and the positivity you want to portray. The tough times are very lonely.” Working for the Springboks under Peter de Villiers was a particular eye‑opener, even though the Springboks won a Tri Nations title and beat the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions on Gold’s watch. “It’s the same as football is in this country. You just have to drive home on a Saturday after a game and listen to the call-in shows on the radio. Everyone wants blood if their team has lost. It’s not like 25 years ago when people would read the paper but you wouldn’t know what people were discussing in their households. It is more public now and people are braver behind social media.” After South Africa lost heavily against New Zealand last month, he knew exactly how the coaches and players felt. “I wasn’t emotional about the loss, I was just very emotional for them. The tirade of abuse and the fallout, is immense. Almost nobody deserves that. You see your players getting abuse and wonder: ‘Is it fair for a 23‑year‑old kid, who’s trying his best, to deal with that?’” Things are not yet that bad in Worcester but injuries and the uncertainty surrounding the club’s financial stability are not helping. Perversely the US job has made Gold even more determined to leave the Warriors on a high, which he still believes is feasible. “We don’t have a crisis. We’ve got a problem: we’re not playing well enough. But I’ve got a lot of confidence in this club and now, more than ever, I want to leave it as a Premiership club.” If a suitable replacement can be swiftly recruited, nevertheless, the club says Gold could depart early. With Jemma, his 16-year-old daughter, due to take her end-of-school exams next year and his son Jamie, 13, also needing parental support – “He’s on the autistic spectrum” – he has other priorities away from the Premiership hamster wheel and his imminent American adventure. Soon enough, though, the pressure will be cranking up again: the Eagles are in England’s pool at the 2019 World Cup and Gold is already wary. “England are an outstandingly good team and they’re going to get even better. I can’t believe anybody will go in as bigger favourites to win in Japan, particularly with Eddie Jones’s knowledge of the country. I just think Eddie is class. It’s unquestionable what a good job he’s done. I’ve crossed paths with him enough to know he will have every minute planned until that World Cup final. We’ve got lots of work to do.” As have Worcester, with one solitary point gathered so far. “I’m pretty bloody annoyed we haven’t won a game of rugby and so are the boys. Hopefully they don’t feel anybody’s jumping ship and abandoning them. Maybe some of them are ecstatic. I don’t know.” Gold and his Warriors, regardless, do not intend going down meekly beside the River Avon on Saturday. “There are no panic buttons being hit but you don’t want to start falling too far behind the rest of the pack. Even if you turn the corner it might be too late. I don’t think we should shy away from admitting we need to go down there and be desperate.” Few know more about the art of winning against the odds than America’s next top mentor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/06/your-bag-for-life-doesnt-have-to-carry-a-food-poisoning-risk-heres-what-to-do","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T15:42:29Z","webTitle":"Your bag for life doesn't have to carry a food poisoning risk.

Here's what to do","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) is urging consumers to continue to shop for food with reusable “bags for life”, fearing that worries about the food poisoning risks could trigger a backlash and even a resurgence in the use of thin plastic bags. The government’s food watchdog, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), recently updated its guidance for consumers on how to pack their food shopping, saying that the sturdier reusable bags normally bought from supermarkets can spread deadly food poisoning bacteria if they are used to carry raw foods such as fish and meat. That has raised the prospect of consumers having to pre-plan every food shopping trip like a military campaign, armed with a battery of different – and ideally colour-coded or labelled – bags to enable them to separate raw foods from ready-to-eat items and non-grocery items. The CIEH has now waded into the row, urging consumers to stick with the bags for life while being cautious about which food stuffs are placed in which bag. Urging a “commonsense” approach by consumers, it fears a resurgence in the use of single-use and thin plastic bags following a significant (85%) decrease since the 5p charge was introduced in England in 2015. “We must not cut down on our use of bags for life as a result of this warning from the Food Standards Agency,” said Tony Lewis, head of policy at the CIEH, which represents some 9,000 professionals in the public, private and non-profit sectors. “The excessive use and disposal of plastics in our country is a growing problem which affects all of us and deeply damages our environment. Bags for life are integral to efforts to tackle this.” Shoppers should be mindful of what food they are putting in which bag, he added, “and not mixing raw food with things which are ready to eat straight away. By being aware of the need for good hygiene, people can quite easily avoid picking up any damaging bacteria from their bags for life.” Given the mixed messages, how can consumers sensibly take steps to reduce their risk of food poisoning without resorting to using more plastic? What exactly is the problem? The FSA has raised the dangers of mixing bag usage, highlighting that some food packaging can carry salmonella, E coli and campylobacter; the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. It quietly updated its advice in August, although it had published earlier guidelines for shoppers on packing food safely on the eve of the introduction of the plastic bag charge in England. Why are bags for life now being singled out? A change in the law means that supermarkets and other large retailers in England have had to charge 5p for single-use bags since 2015. Charges were introduced in Wales in 2011, Northern Ireland in 2013 and Scotland in 2014. Tesco, the UK’s largest retailer, recently stopped handing out single-use bags altogether. The charge was part of a government scheme to reduce litter and protect wildlife, given that plastic bags can take hundreds of years to break down. Bags for life – which are reused rather than thrown away – have become the bag of choice for shoppers since the introduction of the levy. How can there be cross-contamination even when raw foods are packaged? Raw foods (meat, fish and shellfish, loose vegetables with soil on, and eggs) can contain germs or have germs on their surface that cause food poisoning, but are not visible to the human eye. Even wrapped raw foods such as pre-packed fresh meat or fish may have traces of harmful bugs on the outside of the packaging. How can I carry my food safely? You should pack and carry raw foods separately from read-to-eat foods and non-food items such as washing powder and household cleaners. Reusable bags could be colour coded or labelled to avoid any mix-up. If there has been visible spillage, seepage, soiling or damage, plastic bags for life should be replaced, while cotton ones should be machine-washed to keep them hygienic. The CIEH also recommends wiping out bags for life with warm water and a splash of bleach after each use. Also wash your hands when you get home and after unpacking your fresh food shopping to avoid any cross-contamination. Any other protection? Despite charging a small fee for plastic bags, supermarkets are supposed to offer free bags for raw meat at the checkout (even it is already packed in the supermarket’s own packaging) to stop you spreading any harmful germs. Not all have been doing this and if you’re paying for your shopping at the self-service till then you might not think to ask for one. Pick and choose The FSA points out that if you decide to purchase a ‘bag for life’, there is a variety on sale in supermarkets, made of different materials and in a range of styles and sizes. Many standard plastic bags for life will cost 10p, whereas other styles will be a bit more expensive. Consider what would work best for you. For example, you may want to be able to machine wash your bag for life to ensure it remains hygienic – in which case opt for a cotton-based one. Any light at the end of the tunnel? Some manufacturers are developing bags for life that have anti-bacterial technology to make it safe to carry raw meat one day and general groceries the next. It is likely that enlightened retailers will start introducing simple, standardised colour-coded bags for life to echo those used for chilled and frozen foods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/08/doctor-foster-curb-your-enthusiasm-tunes-for-tyrants-porridge-the-last-post","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T05:59:42Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Doctor Foster; Curb Your Enthusiasm; Tunes for Tyrants; Porridge; The Last Post","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/08/doctor-foster-curb-your-enthusiasm-tunes-for-tyrants-porridge-the-last-post","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/08/doctor-foster-curb-your-enthusiasm-tunes-for-tyrants-porridge-the-last-post","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Doctor Foster; Curb Your Enthusiasm; Tunes for Tyrants; Porridge; The Last Post","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The question occupying most intricate minds this week – the non-intricate were just drooling over Maygeddon – was, of course… Doctor Foster: another series? I seem to remember, years ago, Liam Neeson, asked on some sofa about the chances of a second Taken, scoffing lightly, certainly as lightly as Liam ever can scoff, and saying “He’d have to be pretty feckin’ unlucky to have that happen to him a second feckin’ time,” or some such. Taken is now on its third franchised incarnation. Starring Liam Neeson. So: can writer Mike Bartlett resist the siren lure of more money and doubtless more plaudits by firing Gemma, Simon and Poor Tom from the cannon once more? Certainly the ending was left open enough for them all to return. Poor Tom, young actor Tom Taylor, who deserves not only our applause but surely his very own ™ sign whenever Poor Tom is mentioned, eventually simply wearied of his gothically dysfunctional parents, left his phone in the car, closed the door quietly and just… walked away. Ah well. He’s a grown laddie. And no one died, despite the mad internet’s predictions. Simon tried to top himself a couple of times. The first, on a dual carriageway, was rather frightening: I’ve rewatched it several times and the actor, or his stunt double, honestly comes within a gnat’s crotchet of being windscreened like a juicy faithless bluebottle. On the second attempt – cyanide in the hotel bedroom – he’s rescued by Gemma, who decided she didn’t want him to die after all because that would leave their son without a father. The son left downstairs in the car, all safe and… oh. Suranne Jones as Gemma is quite rightly feted, but this conclusion also had me physically shivering at a couple of scenes. Bertie Carvel, who had hitherto played Simon as just a preening, compromised fucktard, cranked up several gears: his tearful, snotty meltdown was genuinely unsettling to watch. And the hotel-breakfast scene, Simon’s large whisky-and-Pepsi as he wept, the stoic and madly upbeat waitress… Beckett and (certainly) Pinter have crafted far worse. It’s been quite a ride – absolute hokum, of course, but thrillingly moreish hokum, and, crucially, our own British-beef hokum. The risk is surely that a third series could simply turn into a kind of forlorn Wacky Races, with Gemma and Simon running off cliffs and buying Acme anvils and ticking bombs labelled Ticking Bomb. Against that, I think we all want to see what happens next. I’m not full yet. Mr Bartlett has earned our plaudits, again: will that be enough? Can he ever let go? Can Gemma? Can Simon? Mr Larry David certainly doesn’t need the money, which is why there’s been some head-scratching and chin-stroking over the return of Curb Your Enthusiasm after six years off-air. Also some criticism, among the more cerebral American commentariat, along the lines of – rich white guy, big house, scary hair, takes sharp umbrage over every little thing, do we need yet another? Most definitely yes. Because it’s very funny, still, and we still need funny, and Mr David is – I’m making a small assumption here – wiser than Mr Trump. And if there were ever days when we needed guidance from a cranky Jewish oldster about the appalling rush to take offence on behalf of others, the mindlessly niggling gradations of said offence either given or taken, the hatefulness of identity politics, then these are those days. I don’t know quite where the fatwa storyline is going, but suspect to a darkly divisive place, and Larry and cohorts will doubtless crank it to maximum ouch, out of which we can all just about wriggle with teensy bits of dignity and wisdom intact. This show manages to splash equal vitriol on both entitled baby boomers and pantywaist millennials, and is in debt to no doctrine: in thrall to nothing except truth and humour. Not that political correctness is exactly anything new. Composers in Russia in the 20s faced the prospect, laughable in hindsight, of trying to compose “correct” music for a new regime which was itself groping to define correctness. Post-tsar, elite was out, bourgeois was out: jazz was deemed too decadent, the charleston and foxtrot too western, avant garde orchestral too elitist. There was an official suggestion that all pianos in all Russia be smashed in the name of equality. An equal right not to have access to a piano. And so the sparkling Suzy Klein, to the crashes of Rachmaninov’s Prelude in C sharp minor, smashed up a piano: the one clunky piece of exposition in what promises to be an otherwise marvellous three-parter entitled Tunes for Tyrants. Ambitious and wise, it showed inter alia how any interference from politics in culture will always result in blancmange: the politburo’s take on what the revolution should “sound” like led only to unutterably bland, folksy, spirited hee-haw marches. In a land of glorious, unprecedented composers. Rachmaninov was retro-banned as elitist. As, in Berlin in the 30s, Mendelssohn was retro-banned for being vaguely Jewish. Not for the first time I was struck by the antisyzygy – the left’s madness circling to meet the right’s madness – of those twin dictatorships: the music of the Third Reich was also unutterably bland, folksy, spirited hee-haw marches. And not for the first time I yearned to have lived back in the Weimar Republic, that frankly loopy German decade in which the freedoms of jazz, sexuality, poverty, humour, wildness, went head-to-head against the reactive notion of Verwilderung der Sitten (“the degeneration of morals”). Guess who won. Klein was wonderful, not least in attempting to rescue Die Moritat von Mackie Messer, AKA Mack the Knife, from its Hollywood-Sinatra glitterdome schmaltz back to the original Brecht-Weill message about a nasty, greedy killer of prostitutes. The inclusion of the cheesy golden arches “Mac Tonight” ad of 1987 was a touch of genius, in that it perfectly demonstrated how Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill’s dreams of betterness had been so thoroughly shanghaied by naked human greed. In this series, Klein runs the serious risk of telling the tale of the entire 20th century, via music, about as well as it’s ever been told. Porridge, revived, is sadly thin gruel. Oh, it’s fine enough, and a good cast, and Kevin Bishop is great as Norman Stanley Fletcher’s cheeky-chappie grandson Nigel. But sainted writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais are eightysomething, surely, and it shows. As soon as Cyrano de Bergerac was mentioned (by Mark Bonnar, nicely channelling Fulton Mackay), I could just hear something like “doesn’t he play for Spurs?” Sure enough… “Didn’t he used to play for Watford?” Cue orgasmic studio audience laughter, and the non-joys of being 15 all over again. The Last Post is a safe BBC Sunday‑night thing about some chaps leaving Aden in the 60s, and features a fine, if cliched, cast of cuckolds and wimps and warriors, and a phenomenally hot and gin-swilling Jessica Raine, who might still persuade me. It is less essential watching than Doctor Foster. It is less essential watching than Doc Martin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/09/mondays-best-tv-the-human-body-rellik-the-vietnam-war","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T04:59:10Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: The Human Body; Rellik; The Vietnam War","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/09/mondays-best-tv-the-human-body-rellik-the-vietnam-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/09/mondays-best-tv-the-human-body-rellik-the-vietnam-war","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: The Human Body; Rellik; The Vietnam War","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rellik 9pm, BBC1 The gruelling Rellik arrives at its penultimate episode (or second episode if you’re doggedly buying into the whole story-told-backwards business).

This means, according to campaigners, that they are being repeatedly let down by the system. A National Audit Office (NAO) report highlighted the stark lack of data, triggering serious questions about the government’s commitment to prisoners’ mental healthcare. The report states that despite evidence of a high prevalence of mental ill health in the prison population, not only does the government not know how many of England and Wales’ 85,000-plus inmates have a mental health condition, ministers are unable to pinpoint how much is being spent on mental healthcare. This lack of robust data is a significant stumbling block to improving provision, the report concludes. It highlights that data compiled by NHS England, responsible for delivering health services in English prisons, does not track “outcomes for prisoners, continuity of care, or service quality”, which makes it difficult to calculate or assess need. What data exists is not shared sufficiently between the bodies that coordinate or deliver services within the adult prison estate, namely NHS England, the National Offender Management Service and Public Health England. Funding is another contentious area, according to the NAO. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) estimates a total health budget for adult facilities in 2016-17 of £400m, but there is no breakdown available of mental versus physical healthcare spending. The upshot is that despite “ambitious” goals for wellbeing in adult prisons, those responsible “do not know the base they are starting from, what they need to improve, or how realistic it is for them to meet their objectives”, the NAO reports. Andy Bell, deputy chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health (CMH), says the dearth of routinely collected, up-to-date and accurate information has been an issue for a long time and represents a gaping hole in prison and health policy. The last reliable data on prevalence of offender mental health problems is from 1998, according to Bell, a time when the prison population was about half what it is today: “The situation has changed tremendously since then.” The report’s findings have proved “particularly” prescient at a time when mental health is being touted as a government top priority but also because the prison system is facing a large-scale “crisis” that is damaging for inmates’ mental health, says Howard League for Penal Reform director of campaigns Andrew Neilson. Extreme overcrowding, greater use of inmates being locked in cells for 23-hour periods and increased violence taking place against a backdrop of severe staff shortages and drastic budget cuts, is having a detrimental effect on the mental health of prisoners, he says. According to CMH and the Howard League, all of these factors have contributed to a dramatic deterioration in prisoner wellbeing, which at its most extreme is evidenced by record rises in rates of prison suicides (up 32% in a single year between 2015 and 2016). Self-harm has also spiked (up by 73% between 2012 and 2016) making it all the more crucial that mental health needs are quantified so that adequate care is provided, advocacy groups suggest. The Royal College of Psychiatrists attributes the sharp rises in suicide and self-harm, at least in part, to “failures in reaching prisoners who need general medical and specialist healthcare”. Echoing the NAO, Bell says a starting point would be a government “blueprint for mental health” that assesses the scale of needs among inmates, but which also sets “clear” measurable objectives on health outcomes. According to the MoJ, moves are already being made in this direction. It says a slew of measures are in the pipeline, such as NHS England efforts to identify which inmates have “specialist” mental health requirements. In terms of prevention, more funding for prison safety, a recruitment drive for officers and a project to address rises in suicide and self-harm are under way. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

As Alice Roberts’s book exemplifies, we now have a multitude of paths into the deep past: “geography, archaeology, history and genetics”, of which for her the most important is genetics. Genomes contain a record of everything that has happened to DNA since life began – yes, it has been overwritten countless times, but key events remain preserved in genomic amber. “Pots are not people,” the archaeologists’ adage goes, which means that a single source of evidence can be misleading, but when there is mutually reinforcing evidence from two, three or more modes of inquiry, it’s possible to achieve a high degree of consensus. Two recent pioneers of the history of humanity are Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs and Steel, and Yuval Noah Harari, in his book Sapiens. It is a teeming subject, about which Roberts is multiply qualified to write, as an anatomist, archaeologist, anthropologist, paleopathologist and professor of public engagement in science. She has found a neat approach to the topic: ostensibly her theme is the species humans have domesticated and how this was accomplished. But it is also an elegant way of recounting the human story in 10 episodes, from the beginning of agriculture, 11,500 years ago, to the birth of written history. We are used to the idea of technology transforming our way of life, but until the industrial revolution our innovations were largely based on nature: the domestication of animals and plants and the products derived from them, such as wool, cotton and other fibres, timber and leather. The 10 species on Roberts’s list are: dogs, wheat, cattle, maize, potatoes, chickens, rice, horses, apples and us. Some of these species have shaped history more than others: the horse, for example. In 2007 the anthropologist David W Anthony wrote a powerfully argued book, The Horse, the Wheel, and Language, which put forward the Yamnaya steppe horse culture of the Black and Caspian sea regions as a major driver of migrations into western Europe, from about 4,500 years ago. This migratory surge is now regarded as the most likely source of the vast family of Indo-European languages, spoken by half the world today. In 2015 a collaborative project led by David Reich, which analysed ancient DNA, confirmed his hypothesis. The Yamnaya inheritance provides the strongest component in modern European genomes. Why the horse? Until the horse was tamed for riding, human populations moved slowly. With horses, whether as a result of conquest, competitive advantage or simply by spreading new ideas, a great acceleration occurred. Then these same people began to use wheeled wagons, which led to war chariots, and so on. An important argument of Roberts’s book is that evolution did not stop when we began to develop civilisation. Quite the reverse: what happened was a process of gene-culture co‑evolution; our ability to drink milk, especially cow’s milk, in adulthood is the classic example. It began with domesticating cattle for their meat and as beasts of burden. But you can have your cow and milk it. A single base mutation in the human lactase gene was all it took to enable milk drinking throughout life. This gene spread rapidly through Europe (that Yamnaya herder culture again) from about 4,000 years ago, peaking in northwest Europe today, where over 90% of the population are milk tolerant, against less than 10% in east Asia. Similarly, a simple genetic mutation made the difference in the case of some of the plants we have domesticated. The head of wild wheat used to shatter, which made harvesting impossible. Domesticating the species involved selecting natural mutants that kept the seeds on the stem. Many wild species remain resistant to domestication because there is no such simple genetic fix available. Everyone now agrees that the first animal to be domesticated was the dog, and that its wild ancestor is the wolf. From 1959 onwards, a domestication experiment was conducted on foxes by the Russian scientist Dimitry Belyaev; in more than 40 generations the foxes became tame and their appearance changed dramatically. Foxes are related to wolves, so this almost proved the point. Where and when domestication happened remains much debated. With most domesticated species, the wild ancestor isn’t hard to deduce, but maize is a puzzle. Teosinte from Mexico does not have the characteristic single multi-seeded cob, but multiple stalks and small seed heads – so how was its potential spotted? The crop’s variation in response to different climates is the suggested answer. Rice, first domesticated in southern China, is a staple for half the world’s people, but it has its limitations. Roberts tells the story of the efforts to genetically modify it to boost its vitamin A content: the product, “golden rice”, works but mostly languishes unused because it is GM. The wild card here is the apple. Roberts obviously loves them and they do have a surprising story: the cultivated apple, so English by adoption, hails from Kazakhstan, but along the Silk Road it consorted extensively with wild crab-apples, so has hybrid vigour. This is not just a book for those with a curiosity about origins. In her last chapter, devoted to how we tamed ourselves, Roberts shows how our transformation of the natural world has brought us to a moment of ecological crisis. In this situation, understanding where we come from – in particular, our good fortune in launching our experiment in domestication in an interglacial period – is vital in trying to project a way out. Roberts remains composed, engaging and undogmatic throughout, and ends with a beautiful allusion to one of Darwin’s most famous passages. Observing her garden, she writes: “There are divisions here, between the wild and the domesticated, the untamed and the tamed. But in the end, it’s all one: a tangled bank beautifully intertwined.” Tamed is an excellent point of entry for anyone who wants to understand the new deep human history and what it portends. • Tamed is published by Hutchinson.

In a potentially far-reaching judgment at the high court in London on Friday, Mr Justice Jay ruled that IVF Hammersmith had failed in its obligation to ensure consent from both parties before carrying out the procedure, but found the clinic did not have to meet the costs of caring for the man’s daughter although he allowed the father to appeal. Passing judgment at the high court in London, Jay wrote: “Although [the father] has lost this case, my judgment must be seen as a complete personal and moral vindication … The same, of course, cannot be said for [the mother].” But Jay said the claim had failed due to public policy, which stipulates that parents cannot be compensated for the birth of a healthy child. The man, who is in his 50s, said IVF Hammersmith should be liable for “hundreds of thousands of pounds” needed to care for his daughter, who is six, including a private education, nannies, her wedding, university education, skiing trips, refurbishing her bedroom and a Land Rover Discovery used to transport the girl and his eight-year-old son. In a statement following the ruling, he said the case had “never been about money; it is about justice.” He wanted to draw attention to the “catastrophic failings of the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), and the unacceptable conduct of fertility clinics, which have grown into multimillion-pound businesses on the back of sharp practices”, he added. The HFEA said it would not be commenting on the case. The judge found the company had breached its contract in accepting a document that purported to give the man’s consent to using a frozen egg fertilised by his sperm, five months after he said he and his partner had parted ways after a “volatile and rancorous” relationship. The clinic said at no point had it been informed of the couple’s separation. Although the judge did not find the company liable for damages, he did state concerns about the way consent was obtained by clinics during this period. The fact the clinic had changed the way it obtained consent demonstrated “that more robust procedures were not beyond the bounds of practical possibility”. The case has significant ramifications for parents seeking IVF and the clinics they turn to, setting a precedent in terms of the circumstances under which parents of “unwanted” children can claim damages. It comes after a man who had a failed vasectomy was unsuccessful in his bid to sue for negligence after fathering two daughters. In the IVF case, the father said he was devastated when his former partner, a teacher, emailed him a year after their breakup on Valentine’s Day 2011, writing: “By the way, I’m pregnant.” The mother, who is in her 40s, denied forging the signature and says her former partner did give his approval. A six-day trial in July was told the father’s signature on the “consent to thaw” form had been forged after someone “traced” his real signature. Dr Audrey Giles, a handwriting expert, told the court she was “99% sure” the document had been falsified. In his ruling, the judge said the girl’s mother, known only as R, had lied while given evidence and accused her of “mendacious embellishment”, adding: “I have to say that some of her evidence was made up as she went along.” The man and his then girlfriend attended the clinic in 2008 and signed an “agreement for cryopreservation”. They conceived a son by IVF in 2008. The couple then returned to the clinic in 2010 to discuss thawing a frozen embryo. The man later said the relationship was already broken beyond repair at this point and he had only attended to “avoid another shouting match”. The judge found he “persuaded himself that the purpose of the consultation with [the consultant] was not to discuss the use of the frozen embryos in the context of R having another baby”. Giving evidence, the father, who has since remarried, told the court he was devastated when he heard his former partner was pregnant. “I said that’s clever – why would you do that? I’m truly amazed by what you have done,” he said. “I phoned the clinic on 15 February 2011 to reveal all. I wanted to know what had gone on. I was in a terrible state. “My response was: ‘Oh my God, how could this happen?’ I’d never agreed to get her pregnant. My head was exploding. It turned my head upside down. I just couldn’t function. It was just so overwhelming.” The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has previously said that although he loves his daughter, her birth has placed an unwelcome financial burden on him. During the trial he said the child was “unwanted” but would be treated like any of his other children. Describing how he felt about the situation, he said: “It’s very difficult to comprehend the situation. You have a beautiful girl who, when she’s in our midst, all she does is remind us of pain. She’s a beautiful girl who doesn’t feel like she’s part of our family. She feels like an alien in our home despite the fact that she’s a beautiful girl.” The case has already changed procedures in many IVF clinics, many of which now insist on the signing of contracts in clinics or Skype calls to witness the signing of contracts if parents are abroad. It could have a further impact on the regulation of IVF treatment and how frozen embryos can be used years after they are initially stored. Jude Fleming, the chief operating officer for IVF Hammersmith, said the clinic was pleased the judge had ruled in its favour and dismissed the claim for damages. The clinic has changed its practices so that if both parties are not available for the signing of the forms, written consent is followed up with a phone call. She added: “It’s very sad for the people involved, the patients, the children and the staff that were involved in this treatment.” James Lawford Davies, a partner at Hempsons who represented the clinic, said the court had found that the signature had been properly checked, and was only found to be fraudulent using “sophisticated machinery”. He added: “Clinics cannot presume that all their patients might be dishonest, but the case highlights the importance of having systems in place to ensure that both partners continue to agree to pursue treatment together, right up until the moment of transfer.” Praful Nargund, the chief executive of ABC IVF, a private London clinic, said industry leaders were considering whether further steps could be taken to safeguard the consent procedure. “The most crucial appointment, the embryo transfer, which is the point of no return, clinics will be looking at this very carefully,” he said, adding that ideally the father should attend this appointment, but clinics would need to decide whether this was necessary on a case by case basis. “The core message here is clinics are not sleuths trying to decide if a patient is a patient or not,” he added. “We see both people in person and take reasonable steps to identify them using a passport or driving licence. We inform them at the outset that if there is any change in consent that they inform us straight away.” The father plans to appeal against the decision regarding damages in the supreme court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/06/japanese-firm-fined-token-sum-after-woman-died-from-overwork","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T11:12:58Z","webTitle":"Japanese firm fined token sum after woman died from overwork","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/japanese-firm-fined-token-sum-after-woman-died-from-overwork","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/06/japanese-firm-fined-token-sum-after-woman-died-from-overwork","fields":{"headline":"Japanese firm fined token sum after woman died from overwork","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Japan’s biggest advertising agency has been fined 500,000 yen (£3,385) for forcing staff to work illegally long overtime, after the death of one of its employees forced the country to confront its unforgiving work culture. Work practices at Dentsu came under scrutiny after it emerged last year that one of its employees had been driven to suicide by her brutal work schedule. Matsuri Takahashi killed herself on Christmas Day in 2015 in a case that labour standards inspectors later ruled as karoshi, or death from overwork. Takahashi, 24, was forced to work 100 hours’ overtime in the month leading up to her death. Weeks before she died, she posted on social media: “I want to die.” Another message read: “I’m physically and mentally shattered.” While the token fine is expected to attract criticism, Takahashi’s lawyer, Hiroshi Kawahito, described the ruling as a “historic” event. “It is very meaningful that a company has been punished,” the Nikkei business newspaper quoted him as saying. “Dentsu’s crime has been confirmed.” Takahashi’s death sparked a national outcry and forced the government to draw up guidelines that cap overtime at 100 hours a month, although critics say the limit needs to be lower to protect employees’ health. Friday’s ruling in the Dentsu case came a day after Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, admitted that one of its employees had died from karoshi four years ago. Miwa Sado, a political reporter in Tokyo, had worked 159 hours of overtime in the month before she died of heart failure, NHK said. Sado, 31, was found dead in her bed in July 2013, reportedly holding her mobile phone. “My heart breaks at the thought that she may have wanted to call me,” her mother told the Asahi Shimbun. “With Miwa gone, I feel like half of my body has been torn away. I won’t be able to laugh for real for the rest of my life.” NHK’s president, Ryoichi Ueda, vowed to improve work practices at the broadcaster. “We are sorry that we lost an excellent reporter and take seriously the fact that her death was recognised as work-related,” Ueda told reporters. “We will continue to work for reform in cooperation with her parents.” A white paper on karoshi approved by Japan’s cabinet on Friday said that male employees in their 40s were at highest risk of killing themselves due to overwork. The report said there were 191 karoshi cases in the year ending in March 2017, adding that 7.7% of employees regularly put in more than 20 hours’ overtime a week. It said 368 people – 352 of them men – had killed themselves between January 2010 and March 2015 in officially recognised cases that involved compensation payouts. However, the actual number of karoshi-related suicides is thought to be significantly higher. Dozens of other people die every year from heart failure, strokes and other conditions brought on by punishingly long working hours. Prosecutors had taken action against Dentsu for forcing Takahashi and three other employees to work overtime between October and December 2015 beyond a monthly 50-hour limit agreed with the company’s union, Japanese media said. “Illegal long working hours were becoming the norm” at Dentsu, the judge Tsutomu Kikuchi said in his ruling at the Tokyo summary court, according to Kyodo news agency. “Overtime work without payment was also rampant” at the firm, he added.

The rapid trajectory towards power enjoyed by Shapps in the first half of his political career has long since gone into reverse, however, and he resigned from his ministerial post amid a seedy bullying scandal. His peers have shown no hesitation in belittling his influence, with one MP placing him among “a coalition of disappointed people”, sarcastically adding “who think their brilliant political talents have not been fully recognised”. Shapps has an unconventional background for a Tory. Educated at a grammar school and polytechnic, his cousin is Mick Jones, one of the founding members of the Clash, the great punk counter-culturalists of the 70s and 80s. At the age of 21, he founded PrintHouse Corporation, a successful printing business. In 1999, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma but he successfully beat the disease and two years later went on to launch a bid for the parliamentary seat of Welwyn Hatfield. He failed, but four years later, on his second attempt, ousted Labour’s Melanie Johnson. It was not long before a new Westminster star started to shine. In May 2005 he was made a member of the public administration select committee and the same year was appointed a vice-chairman of the Conservative party, with responsibility for campaigning. Two years later he was promoted to shadow housing minister and, following the 2010 election, became housing minister and a privy counsellor. In September 2012 he was appointed chairman of the party. In 2012, the first of a series of scandals emerged that would test the then prime minister, David Cameron’s patience with one of his most prized campaigners. Shapps was accused of having potentially breached the code of conduct for ministers and MPs when it was revealed he held a second job after entering parliament, something he had repeatedly denied. Shapps was exposed as having continued working as a marketer of get-rich-quick schemes under the pseudonym Michael Green. He initially denied the claims, telling LBC radio: “To be absolutely clear: I don’t have a second job and I have never had a second job whilst being an MP. End of story.” But a recording obtained by the Guardian captured the MP in 2006 selling business self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a “ton of cash by Christmas”. He later came clean, saying he had “over-firmly denied” having a second job and reportedly admitted to the BBC he had “screwed up” on dates. Months after the Michael Green alter ego was unearthed, it was reported that Shapps had deleted information from his Wikipedia page, including the names of donors to his private office. One of the more peculiar edits was to omit a reference to his studies at Watford grammar school for boys, where it was noted that he “obtained four O-levels including an A in CDT”. Similar allegations resurfaced weeks before the 2015 general election. The online encyclopedia banned a user called “Contribsx” after the site’s administrators found they had deleted unhelpful references to Shapps’s business career, while adding the baffling claim that responsibility for a tweet posted by Shapps, who was accused of denigrating bingo players, lay with Tory party election guru Lynton Crosby and George Osborne. A Wikipedia administrator told the Guardian that they had concluded that the account was “either run by Shapps directly” or by an associate “under his clear direction”. Shapps denied having anything to do with Contribsx. The account was subsequently unblocked after a vote of Wikipedia’s arbitration committee, and the site administrator who had reported the original concerns was removed from his post. As party chairman, Shapps played a key role in the 2015 election campaign, spearheading the BattleBus and RoadTrip initiatives, which saw Tory-packed coaches travel the length and breadth of the country in an attempt to energise the party faithful. But after the party secured its first majority win since 1992, Shapps was sacked from the cabinet and handed a middling ministerial post in the Department for International Development. The move was widely seen as a demotion. Six months later, he resigned from the government amid the so-called Tatler Tory bullying scandal. It emerged Shapps had signed off the appointment of Mark Clarke as director of RoadTrip. Clarke, a failed parliamentary candidate nicknamed the Tatler Tory after the socialite magazine once pegged him as a future Tory star, was accused of bullying in a suicide note left behind by the 21-year-old Tory activist Elliott Johnson. Shapps denied being informed about any allegations of bullying, sexual abuse or blackmail but quit his post saying that “responsibility should rest somewhere”. The scandal surrounding the Tatler Tory and the youth movement Conservative Future was full of torrid tales of low-level backstabbing and House of Cards-like plots to oust rival political contenders. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme after the party whips had reportedly outed him as a former cabinet minister attempting to force May out, Shapps said his call for the prime minister to step aside did not “qualify as a plot”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/03/tuesday-briefing-vegas-killer-had-42-weapon-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T05:29:16Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Vegas killer had 42-weapon arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/tuesday-briefing-vegas-killer-had-42-weapon-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/03/tuesday-briefing-vegas-killer-had-42-weapon-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Vegas killer had 42-weapon arsenal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: A one-man militia Good morning, Graham Russell here with the news at the start of the day. Dozens of firearms, explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition have been uncovered as police carefully search the hotel room and properties of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock. Twenty-three guns were found in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, plus 19 firearms along with the munitions at Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada. Ammonium nitrate, a bomb ingredient, was also found in his car. The arsenal has emerged but a motive is not yet clear for the 64-year-old, who has not even committed a traffic offence let alone followed in the ways of his bank-robbing father, Benjamin. At least 59 people are now confirmed to have died, with 527 injured, in Sunday’s attack, which ended when Swat teams stormed his room and found Paddock’s body. Here’s how the night unfolded. The rapid rate of fire captured in footage from the scene has sparked debate about whether he had an automatic weapon (which are tightly restricted), or simply converted a semi-automatic one using a $100 device. #FakeNews also emerged as a topic after Facebook and Google promoted false stories claiming the killer was a Trump-hating Democrat.

A departmental spokesperson said it was “not the role of government to decide on the viability of a business” even as the Civil Aviation Authority revealed it has been making contingency plans for more than a month. The CAA has embarked on a £60m operation to create what its chief executive called “one of the UK’s largest airlines” and asked those stranded to check monarch.caa.co.uk for advice. * * * Tom Petty dies – US rocker Tom Petty died on Monday night in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest, his manager Tony Dimitriades has confirmed. Initial reports based on Los Angeles police sources earlier wrongly claimed his death. “It’s shocking, crushing news,” Bob Dylan told Rolling Stone in a statement. Here is a life in pictures of the Heartbreakers frontman. Petty was a music fan as much as he was a musician, writes Alexis Petridis. * * * Labour danger – Jeremy Hunt has told Boris Johnson to back Theresa May or risk the two worst things he can think of: opening the door to “dangerous” Jeremy Corbyn and jeopardising Brexit. The health secretary backed the PM in an interview with the Guardian and said the NHS would “fall down” without 150,000 EU citizens working across the country. He makes his Tory party conference speech today. Polly Toynbee’s take so far: In a Tory party torn apart by Brexit, the fever of schism burns. * * * Too much hospital – The recent spike in the death rate in England and Wales could be down to vulnerable patients being stuck in hospital too long, leaving them vulnerable to infections. A total of 39,074 more deaths than usual occurred between July 2014 and June 2015 – the biggest year-on-year rise in half a century. Meanwhile, spinal surgery has been suspended at Warrington and Halton hospitals after two patients died. * * * Diary of an Anne Frank detective – “I am just trying to solve the last case of my career.” So says Vince Pankoke, a former FBI agent who claims to have uncovered declassified documents that could answer whether Anne Frank’s family were betrayed to the Gestapo or simply found by chance.

To the experts, the rampage on the Vegas Strip immediately recalled the first mass shooting of the modern era, in 1966, when a 25-year-old ex-marine enrolled at the University of Texas rained fire from the 28th-floor observation deck of a clock tower on campus. Charles Whitman, armed with a sawn-off shotgun, three rifles, three pistols and more than 700 rounds of ammunition, hit more than 40 people, killing 11. Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock’s access to a form of automatic weaponry enabled him to kill more than five times as many people, much faster.

Lewis Hamilton has made clear to his Mercedes team what he wants from his car for the next round of the F1 world championship, having struggled for pace at the Malaysian GP, finishing second to Max Verstappen. Castleford have been the form team all season but their coach, Daryl Powell, denies the favourites tag will make any difference in the club’s first Super League Grand Final.

The FT and Daily Mirror carry picture stories on the mass shooting but lead with the enormous logistical operation to repatriate thousands of passengers stranded by the collapse of Monarch Airlines. “Monarch rescue is biggest since Dunkirk,” says the Mirror. “Monarch Airlines collapse spurs ‘biggest peacetime repatriation’,” goes the FT. The Sun went big with the simple Vegas headline “Run!” and the Daily Mail asks “What turned Mr Normal into a mass killer?”. The Guardian focuses on the massacre plus an interview with Jeremy Hunt in which he warns Boris Johnson against opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn. The Times went with Trump’s quote on the mass shooting, plus a single-column story on Amber Rudd hiring Sir Lynton Crosby to mastermind her re-election campaign, fuelling leadership speculation.

Morris’s non-runner rate was the worst of any British trainer either on the Flat or over jumps when the BHA published detailed tables of declarations and non‑runners for the first time on Monday, covering the year between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2017. The trainer, who runs a small stable near Liverpool, declared 104 horses to run over the 12-month period, of which 24, or 23%, then failed to start. Steph Hollinshead, with a 20% rate of non-runners from 129 declarations, was next in the list, while in all there were eight Flat trainers above the “threshold” level of 14% non-runners. Any trainers still above that level in six months’ time will be stripped of the right to self-certify non-runners without a veterinary inspection. Over jumps only one trainer, Mark Gillard, was above the threshold level of 12%, while at the other end of the table Colin Tizzard, one of the country’s leading trainers, had only two non-runners from 433 declared runners, in effect a non-runner rate of zero. Non-runners are a constant source of irritation for punters and bookmakers alike and also a concern for the sport’s administrators since a high level of non‑runners reduces betting turnover and thus the return to racing from gambling operators. There have also been suggestions that some trainers may be abusing the self-certification system to scratch horses if they are drawn in unfavourable stalls at tracks with well-established draw biases, such as Beverley and Chester. Robin Mounsey, the BHA’s director of media, said on Monday that the BHA’s aim in publishing data on non-runners was that trainers would address the issue themselves before losing the right to self-certify. “The objective is that we won’t have to ban anyone,” Mounsey said. “Hopefully, in six months’ time when the potential sanctions would kick in, everyone on the list will have reduced their non-runner rate sufficiently that no one is over the thresholds. “If that happens, then we’ve suddenly knocked out quite a lot of non-runners from the system. Publishing now gives everyone six months to get their house in order.” Morris was warned about his non-runner rate in April 2011, when it was double the national average. He said on Monday evening that, while he would do all he could to reduce the number of non-runners from his stable, the welfare of his horses was the over-riding concern. “When you declare at 48 hours,” Morris said, “a horse could be running at 9 o’clock on Friday night and you declare on Wednesday morning. Two and a half days in a racehorse’s life is a long time. “I will be doing everything I can to get these figures down by next April and it’s only a small sample but the most important thing to me is horse welfare.

But how it will ever be restored remains unclear: the Sundowner is just one of hundreds of wrecked boats still littered across the island – tossed ashore, dumped on the seabed or torn to pieces by Irma and its sister storm Maria. “Irma destroyed me,” said the bar’s owner, Ecedro Thomas as he surveyed the devastation. “Thirty-two years this bar stood here. I’d have it rebuilt already if they’d just move this damn catamaran.” With the local economy in tatters and the annual tourist season fast approaching, dealing with hurricane boats – and thousands of tonnes of other storm debris – is becoming an urgent priority for the BVI. The government is acutely aware that it needs to restart the tourist economy and recently announced that visitors are once again welcome to the islands. But those expecting the paradise of old might have to wait. When the BVI took the full force of Hurricane Irma on 6 September, it was the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, with winds that averaged 185mph, gusting to 215mph. Less than two weeks later, the islands were hit for a second time by Hurricane Maria. Such was the force of the wind that even boats secured in the most sheltered lagoons cartwheeled huge distances – as did cars, shipping containers and roofs. Almost every tree was stripped of leaves and bark, then broken or blown away. When residents awoke the day after Irma, their tropical island views had gone from paradise to post-nuclear. And for a small territory which sold itself on its natural beauty, the disposal of thousands of tonnes of debris has become a new national emergency. “I heard an estimate that in the first month we processed a year’s worth of garbage,” says Anslem Myers, assistant manager at the department of waste management. “That sounds about right.” In normal times, most of the islands’ unsorted garbage is incinerated; like many other small territories, BVI is simply unable to recycle. “If you could make a profit out of it,” says Myers. “a lot of people would have been doing it already.” Charlotte McDevitt, a PhD specialist in the subject and founder of the local non-profit, Green VI, said that small islands around the world face similar challenges when it comes to dealing with waste. “It’s difficult being so far from the recycling markets. People don’t pay for waste in the Caribbean so we have to find ways to reduce it and process what we can locally,” she said. At Coxheath, one of several new debris management hubs set up since the storms, trucks drive in between two 40ft ridges of garbage half a mile long. Once there, they tip their backs up and a large yellow excavator scrapes out the contents, grabs bucketfuls and adds them to the ever-growing pile. Moments later, the next truck arrives. Now that roads have been cleared, Myers’ team is starting on the next task: picking through the waste, taking out metals and pushing organic waste on to burn piles. Plastic and household waste goes into the incinerator. What happens to the metals is not yet known. On the shorelines, fibreglass boats are being raised daily by the few available cranes big enough to lift them. About 2,000 vessels are believed to have been destroyed. “Around 80-90% of the BVI’s charter fleet was damaged,” says Michael Hirst, a local marine surveyor. “Of those, between 40 and 60% will probably be write-offs. Whether we’re repairing or disposing of them, we have a lot of boats to deal with.” What happens to the wrecks next is unclear: options include scuttling them far out at sea, barging them to the US for disposal, or creating a new boatyard to repair or chop them up, while also creating jobs and training schemes. It’s too early to say which option will prevail, though the government has said that it won’t allow wrecked boats to simply be sunk offshore, where they will eventually break up and float to the surface in pieces. Other solutions are also being considered. “Most of these boats are made of fibreglass, which, if it is processed right, can be used for aggregate in concrete,” says Julie Swartz, whose tiny recycling startup, Green and Clean BVI, has found itself in sudden demand. “Organics go to compost; wood is getting made into charcoal; plastic and aluminium cans go into a compactor and metals are separated into different types,” says Swartz. Galvanized roofing, she tells me, is chopped into small pieces and put into the baler for shipping to a recycler in Florida. Swartz believes she can bring the load down just by separating and flowing the different materials to the right places. “And no, I’m not making any money out of it,” she says. “But we are making enough to pay between four and eight people who’ve been employed every day since the storm.” Once the immediate debris crisis has been dealt with, the BVI government hopes to make the territory a model of resilience for the future and establish a long-term recycling system, says Greg Massicote manager of the government’s department of waste management. “We very much see this as an opportunity to implement a system that’s much better than the one we had before.” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/02/philip-hammond-jacob-rees-mogg-tories-back-future","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T18:28:21Z","webTitle":"Freewheelin' Phil and preacher Jacob take the Tories back to the future | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/02/philip-hammond-jacob-rees-mogg-tories-back-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/02/philip-hammond-jacob-rees-mogg-tories-back-future","fields":{"headline":"Freewheelin' Phil and preacher Jacob take the Tories back to the future","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sometimes you just have to take one for the team. The chancellor has a strong track record in delivering underwhelming speeches, but this year he was determined to excel himself. It was his duty. Not just to be averagely feeble but to be truly desperate. To make a speech that was so leaden, so empty of content, so lacking in hope that even the prime minister’s harshest critics would come away thinking she might possibly have done a better job. Right now she needed all the help she could get. Freewheelin’ Phil looked up. He’d lost most of the audience before he had even said a word. His reputation preceded him. The perfect start. Now to work on the remaining insomniacs. “I don’t want to give a history lesson,” he said. That was one of the few things he got right. It wasn’t history and it certainly wasn’t a lesson. Rather it was just a bit of an ill-informed mumble about Jeremy Corbyn. The Tories are in a complete panic about Labour at the moment but the depth of their analysis only extends to mentioning Venezuela as frequently as possible. It’s desperate stuff. That was the high point. Rant over, Freewheelin’ Phil meandered on to the economy. He couldn’t quite work out if it was doing OK because he was in charge or doing really badly because John McDonnell was. What he could say was that people were working hard but not producing very much. And he should know. He’s been doing just that ever since he became chancellor. Lurch then tried a gag about the Tory party being the ageing population. It didn’t go down well. Partly because it wasn’t funny, but mainly because it was a bit too close to the mark. At a meeting earlier in the day aimed at winning over the youth vote, just 70 people – with an average age of 50 – bothered to turn up; the Tory Momentum starts here. He ended with a few words on Brexit. He had no idea what the government’s plan was, but he was sure it would work out OK in the end. Probably. The applause had ended long before he had even left the stage. Job done. For proper signs of life at this conference, you have to go to the fringes. Or rather a fringe event with Jacob Rees-Mogg. In the absence of stardust in the main hall, the backbencher is the only real show in town for rightwingers starved of the opportunity to have their Brexit fantasies indulged. Even though Rees-Mogg is booked for 13 events – all on Brexit, he is a one-trick pony – they are all standing room only with dozens of people turned away at the door. He is a strange choice for a messiah. But desperate times call for desperate choices. Just as the lunchtime meeting in the town hall was about to get under way, a few protestors started shouting “Tories out”. Most were bundled out, but one managed to make his way to the front of the 700-strong crowd where he started shouting “you’re despicable” at Rees-Mogg. Old school charm is one of Rees-Mogg’s strongest selling points and the Conservative MP was a model of courtesy as he attempted to engage the protestor in a more polite conversation. In vain. When several economists with doubtful credentials had finished their warm-up acts – GDP would rocket by 7% immediately after a hard Brexit, apparently – Rees-Mogg took to the platform. After a brief bow to the photograph of Margaret Thatcher placed just in front of him, he began his own version of the Sermon on the Mount. Blessed were the Brexiters, for theirs was the kingdom of heaven. Blessed were the pure in heart, for they shall see Bill Cash. Or Boris Johnson, if they were very lucky. There could be no turning back from the hardest of all possible Brexits. Even though the people may be poor in cash, they would be rich in spirit. But beware the false prophets of Labour leavers. There was only one true Brexit religion and that was free-market Conservatism. Rees-Mogg ended with another blessing and his disciples prostrated themselves before him. It may have been nonsense, but this was the message they had come to hear. Finally the Tory party was going forwards. By going backwards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/04/my-three-days-at-tracey-emin-mountain-hideaway-on-the-cote-dazur","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T04:00:18Z","webTitle":"My three days at Tracey Emin's mountain hideaway on the Cote d’Azur","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/04/my-three-days-at-tracey-emin-mountain-hideaway-on-the-cote-dazur","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/04/my-three-days-at-tracey-emin-mountain-hideaway-on-the-cote-dazur","fields":{"headline":"My three days at Tracey Emin's mountain hideaway on the Cote d’Azur","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m scared of heights. I’m scared of snakes. These were just two of the fears that Tracey Emin challenged when I spent three days alone with her on top of a French mountain. The vertigo was first to go. We landed at Marseille after a civilised flight spent sipping white wine and talking about art and books. The black car that greeted us was, I assumed, a taxi to her house above Le Lavandou on the Cote d’Azur. Instead, it zipped round the corner to – gulp – the heliport, where we were strapped into a waiting chopper before I could say: “Tracey, I’m terrified of helicopters.” Thoughtfully, she sat me by the pilot so I could see everything below. We hovered over a landscape of white rock and silver olives that had been painted by some of the giants of modern art. After we’d passed Cézanne’s Mont Sainte-Victoire, Tracey pointed to her orange-roofed house in a rambling, wild estate on the edge of a nature reserve. Given all this, I was expecting to be greeted by a team of servants, but once the helicopter buzzed away we were totally alone. Tracey is self-sufficient here. She grows vegetables in a little valley where she has her studio, and cooks them in the cosy cottage kitchen of her half-chateau, half-hobbit-hole home. She potters about in the vast, semi-cultivated garden in gold sandals, writing letters, reading, drawing, painting. I told her she reminds me of Andy Warhol, by which I meant she’s a great pop artist. She replied, unexpectedly, that when I saw her life here I’d find she has more in common with Georgia O’Keeffe. And it’s true, she does. When she showed me the guest cottage where I was to sleep, I instinctively closed the bedroom window, worried about what slithered about in the woods out there. The next morning, I woke up to find a big lizard crawling about. It kept returning. We became friends, to a degree. When I mentioned over breakfast that at least it wasn’t a snake, Tracey looked dark. “Oh,” she said, “there are snakes.” The only time she actually joked about killing me, though, was when we went swimming at Le Lavandou. By now we’d been talking for a couple of days and food was running short. She drove us to the town, where we got groceries from a shop whose owners are very slowly teaching her French. Then we went to the beach. As we swam out towards the luxury yachts, she said this was the plan all along: to lure me to France, get me out to sea and drown me in revenge for bad reviews I’d written. When she was shortlisted for the Turner prize in 1999, I was horrified that the infamy of My Bed seemed to be eclipsing what I saw then as more serious contemporary art. Now I think My Bed is one of the most enduring and poetic works of our time. I also think the drawings and paintings she’s always done alongside her conceptual works are powerful and expressive. She draws with the raw energy of Basquiat and the sensuality of Egon Schiele. Her nudes are explosions of sheer life. Tracey may appal snobs who think they know a lot more about Proper Painting than they do, and perhaps you too, if you think it’s a sin to be rich. But my enthusiasm for her has given me the chance to get to know this extraordinary person. It started when she wrote out of the blue, inviting me to provide the introduction to a luxurious new picturebook of her art. She then suggested that, to get to understand her better, I go with her to Provence. With all my fears, I can see the downside to living alone in this remote place, though obviously it does not occur to her to be scared of anything. She has a running battle with local hunters who pursue wild boars across her land. I don’t fancy their chances. Although, when a hornet got caught in the kitchen skylight, it was me who stood on a chair to ineffectively flail at it. She then told me about the time she arrived here to find a swarm of insects invading her bedroom, like some installation by Louise Bourgeois. Books about her hero Bourgeois are on her coffee table, but she reads more widely than that. When I arrived she lent me her copy of F Scott Fitzgerald’s novella The Diamond as Big as the Ritz. She was reading his collected short stories. A house overlooking the Cote d’Azur is a great place to read Fitzgerald, who set Tender Is the Night in these parts. We also found we both adore Horse Crazy, Gary Indiana’s novel of love and madness in the New York art world. It’s no longer in print in Britain, but Tracey recently helped Indiana get his autobiography published in the US. That support for a writer friend is typical of the Tracey Emin I got to know. As we worked together, I was more and more impressed by her openness and generosity. I love her art, but what I love most about it is not necessarily what she intends people to fix on: the sheer sexiness of her nude drawings and paintings. For me, that is not a detraction. It is high praise. Art should be joyous. Why not? “No nude,” as the much-misunderstood art historian Kenneth Clark put it in the 1950s, “should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of erotic feeling”. Looking at her explicit drawings and paintings, it’s not so much a vestige as a tidal wave of passion that comes through. How could I ask her about this, alone on her mountain? We got on well. We drank wine moderately, she cooked, and we covered everything from her love of Vermeer to her memories of the 1990s art scene. The reason she made, or rather kept, more money than some of her YBA contemporaries, she said, is that although she got a reputation for wild living – and created a permanent monument to it in My Bed – there was one thing she never blew her earnings on. She never touched drugs. When one friend came home enthusing about cocaine, that was it. She thinks coke wrecked the creativity of many of her generation. So the fascinating stories went on, but it was only at breakfast on my very last morning there that I finally raised the subject of sex. Needless to say she explained her preferences and her desires in the same forthright way she says everything else. I still hadn’t really explained that I planned to write an essay almost entirely about art and sex and how she fits into the history of the nude. When I sent the finished piece, I wondered if she would be shocked or simply perplexed. Her response was quick: “I just read it straight through. I love it. It’s so sexy, almost pornographic, hardcore.” I don’t think many other artists would have responded so imaginatively, or given me such freedom. So, my hardcore study of Tracey Emin and the history of the nude is launched this week, and I hope it does justice to a tremendous artist and a rare soul. Tracey Emin: Works 2007-2017 by Jonathan Jones is published by Rizzoli. The artist is in conversation with Jones at Tate Modern, London, on 5 October. Emin will be also be signing books at Frieze art fair on 5 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"America's passion for guns: ownership and violence by the numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics","fields":{"headline":"America's passion for guns: ownership and violence by the numbers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Not only is the United States the runaway world leader for gun ownership – it also suffers mass shootings at more than 11 times the rate of any other developed country, according to a 2014 study published in the International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences.

It seems to have shocked even President Trump. But the oleaginous teleprompted piety with which he responded could not be further from his contemptuous indifference to the plight of Puerto Rico. At least 58 people are known to have been murdered in Las Vegas. Hundreds are wounded and the death toll will undoubtedly rise. But it will never approach the toll caused by hurricane Maria in the Caribbean island a fortnight ago. Although the official death toll there stands at only 17, the morgues are full in hospitals all over the country: it is only the lack of electricity, water, and transport that prevents them from being tallied. Sixty of the island’s 69 hospitals are still cut off from power; half the 3.4 million inhabitants still lack safe drinking water. These shortages, which are largely the result of government inaction since the onslaught of the hurricane, will likely kill hundreds more in the weeks to come. Mr Trump took more than a fortnight to arrange a visit to Puerto Rico, where he could for once do some good; a visit to Las Vegas, where he can pose with the police, was arranged almost instantly. The differing responses to the two catastrophes is a stark illumination of racialisation of first- and second-class citizenship in the US. The Puerto Ricans are brown-skinned Spanish speakers. Although they are American citizens, they have no political representation in Congress and no votes in presidential elections. The crowd in Vegas were predominantly white, celebrating a form of music that is also largely white, and where the iconography, by a sour irony, is all in favour of the right to bear arms. They get the treacly appeals to Jesus; the Puerto Ricans were dismissed as “ingrates”. The crowd in Vegas are offered Mr Trump’s prayers; the thirsty Puerto Ricans had a golf tournament dedicated to them by a President who chose to spend the weekend at one of his luxury resorts rather than help them. They have no water? Let them drink from golfing trophies. The dreadful killings in Las Vegas are part of a ghastly pattern whose lunacy has been dulled by endless repetition. Mass shootings are so common that the satirical paper the Onion has run the same headline four times in the last two years, each time prompted by a different mass murder: “‘No way to prevent this’ says the only nation where this regularly happens”. Yet the dramatic headline-catching slaughter is not the only dreadful aspect of the situation. Eighty or more people are killed by gunshots every day across the USA. So far this year, there have been 11,565 gun deaths in the US; 545 children under the age of 11 killed or injured, and 273 incidents classified as mass shootings. There is a desolating pointlessness to these statistics. A third of the gunshot deaths are suicides, as it appears the Las Vegas gunman’s was too. In a country where guns are so freely available, legally or otherwise, and the nearest thing to a state-funded and universally available mental health service is the prison system, the figure for suicide is hardly going to diminish. The desperation of the suicidal and the rage of the homicidal are not the only forms of derangement around the subject of guns. The persistent refusal of Congress even to consider restrictions on the right of gun ownership is now so much part of the political landscape that shares in gunmakers rose at the news of the massacre. The two tragedies in Puerto Rico and Las Vegas are dreadful in themselves, but taken together they suggest a systematic weakness in American democracy which is more threatening than either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/06/the-joy-of-six-the-best-of-michael-owen","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T09:32:24Z","webTitle":"The Joy of Six: the best of Michael Owen | Jacob Steinberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/06/the-joy-of-six-the-best-of-michael-owen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/06/the-joy-of-six-the-best-of-michael-owen","fields":{"headline":"The Joy of Six: the best of Michael Owen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) That goal against Argentina (1998) Michael Owen might have become a mild figure of fun in retirement, mocked for his stubborn hatred of films, castigated for that YouTube clip of him goading a 13-year-old goalkeeper and widely criticised for his punditry, but the bantz can make it easy to forget what a brilliant footballer he was at his peak – one of the most gifted ever produced by England. “When he was the same age as Marcus Rashford, he’d won two golden boots in the Premier League and scored 50 goals,” Rio Ferdinand said recently. “Even look at the likes of [Kylian] Mbappé. If he’s going for that type of money now what would [Owen] be going for?” Fair point. From the moment the teenage Owen burst on the scene with a smoothly taken debut goal at Selhurst Park in May 1997, utilising the searing pace that made him such a threat, it was clear he was special. Owen did not take long to establish himself in the England squad, although he was upstaged by Chile’s Marcelo Salas on his debut in February 1998. Glenn Hoddle told the press that Owen was not a natural goalscorer and initially named the 18-year-old on the bench at the 1998 World Cup, preferring the Euro 96 vintage of Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham. Yet Sheringham was out of form after a difficult first season at Manchester United and England lacked craft and unpredictability, especially with Hoddle getting his Davids mixed up and starting Batty instead of Beckham in midfield. History might have been different had Owen started. He came on in the second game against Romania and equalised with nine minutes left, but Graeme Le Saux’s error let in Dan Petrescu for a last-gasp winner that left England second in Group G, pitching them against the mighty Argentina in the last 16. So much would happen on that night in St Étienne. England’s 10 men lost on penalties in the end, but only after a virtuoso performance from Owen, whose claim to stardom was cemented in this match. He terrorised Argentina from the start, an early run almost creating a goal, and helped England draw level when he made the most of minimal contact with Roberto Ayala to win a penalty after 10 minutes. Six minutes later, it happened. An accurate pass from deep from Beckham, a clever piece of control from Owen, and then, as David Lacey wrote in the Guardian, a blur of white. Viewed in the cold light of day, the goal arguably seems overrated. To hear it described, it can sound as though Owen ran the length of the pitch and beat every Argentina defender. In reality, it was not in the same league as Diego Maradona’s extraordinary goal in 1986. Owen picked up possession inside Argentina’s half and only had to beat Ayala after shaking off José Antonio Chamot. Where had the Argentinian midfielders got to? No matter: Owen ran straight, swerved at pace into the area, and found the top corner. But the context matters. It was Owen’s swagger, fearlessness and certainty, the authority to push Paul Scholes aside. The quality of the opposition and the enormity of the occasion, and the fact he was only 18 – the sheer chutzpah of doing that at 18 – all contributed to one of the most exhilarating World Cup goals of all time. At that point, everything felt possible because of Michael Owen. 2) The ‘Owen final’ against Arsenal (2001) Arsenal fans remember it as the Henchoz final, and it is difficult to think of a more infuriating defeat from Arsène Wenger’s early years. Blowing this one was even more maddening than the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester United in 1999. Yes, Arsenal may well have blown a chance to repeat the Double but at least they played their part in that epic. There was honour in defeat to the eventual Treble winners; losing to Liverpool after threatening to spank them out of sight was just careless. Despite Patrick Vieira stomping all over Steven Gerrard and the rest of the Liverpool midfield in Cardiff, Arsenal contrived to not break the deadlock until Freddie Ljungberg’s goal after 72 minutes. That was partly down to Stéphane Henchoz somehow escaping punishment in the first half, when he blatantly handled Thierry Henry’s goalbound shot on the line. The defender got away with a less obvious handball later on, too, and Liverpool found a way to hang on. After years of flattering to deceive, Gérard Houllier’s side were developing a hardened edge that caused him to observe that they were “destined for greatness”. However, Arsenal seemed to have the measure of them – until Owen got involved. Arsenal had mostly dealt with the striker’s threat, but hadn’t killed Liverpool off. When Gary McAllister’s free-kick dropped to Owen with seven minutes left, the ball was drilled past David Seaman in a flash. It was a classic piece of poaching from a striker who had barely had a sniff all afternoon.Owen won the game five minutes later, racing on to a Patrik Berger long ball on the break and making the Arsenal defenders suddenly look their age. Running in from the left, on his weaker left foot and facing a tight angle, he aimed a low shot across Seaman to complete a stunning turnaround. He had also made an FA Cup final all about himself in the space of five minutes. It takes a special talent to do that. 3) Winning the Ballon d’Or at Liverpool (2001) One of the curiosities of Owen’s career was that he struggled to flourish in partnerships that made perfect sense on paper. Injuries, form and circumstances often got in the way. It never quite clicked with Shearer or Wayne Rooney for England, while it gnawed away at Liverpool that they rarely saw Owen and Robbie Fowler at their best together. Fowler was hit by a serious injury just as the teenage Owen was starting to make his mark, while Houllier came to lose his faith in them as a pair. He preferred Emile Heskey for his unselfish work-rate, even though he lacked Owen’s directness and Fowler’s impudence. Houllier went with Heskey for all three of Liverpool’s finals in the 2000-01 season, leaving the other two to fight for a spot alongside him. Owen was an unused substitute when Fowler scored a superb volley in the League Cup win over Birmingham. His momentum had stalled when he pulled a hamstring against Leeds in April 1999 and he struggled with muscle problems the following season, mustering 12 goals in all competitions. He responded to adversity by working even harder. The sweat and toil was worth it – 2001 would belong to Owen. He built on sucker-punching Arsenal by helping Liverpool beat Bayern Munich in the Super Cup, grabbing the decisive goal against United in the Charity Shield and scoring a hat-trick in England’s 5-1 win away to Germany in World Cup qualifying. More than anything, it was that breathtaking display in Munich that earned Owen the Ballon d’Or. The injuries that marred the end of Owen’s career can make it easy to forget how much opponents feared him. No defender wanted to be left isolated against peak Owen, who was undoubtedly one of the best strikers in the world. While Fowler moved on to Leeds, Owen ended the year by coming off the bench at Upton Park, rescuing a point for Liverpool by crashing in his 100th goal for the club. 4) Scoring for Real Madrid in a clásico (2005) One of Owen’s biggest problems was that supporters found it difficult to identify with him. Part of Fowler’s appeal was that along with being a brilliantly inventive striker, supporters could recognise themselves when they saw him play. Fowler’s cheek, wit and personality always shone through and it was clear how much Liverpool – the club and the city – meant to him. Owen exuded less warmth and felt duller, less relatable. Next to Fowler, the man known as God on the Kop, Owen seemed like a robot who had mastered the art of goalscoring but was still working on human interaction. He was respected, Fowler was revered. Owen won six trophies to Fowler’s five at Liverpool. Owen was seen as a world-class talent, whereas Fowler’s greatest moments were largely restricted to a two-year spell tearing up the Premier League. But it mattered to supporters that Fowler got Liverpool. It also mattered that Owen’s ambition and single-minded approach could be mistaken for aloofness. Some players regard it as a job. For supporters, it’s a religion. Owen remained prolific, scoring the clincher in the 2003 League Cup final, but the team had become dull and laboured by the time Houllier left, and many felt Owen cared more about his international career. After six months of tortuous negotiations with the board, Owen had a year left on his contract, which left the new manager, Rafa Benítez, in an unenviable position when Real Madrid offered £8m plus Antonio Núñez for the 24-year-old. Owen did not settle in Madrid. He was behind Raúl and Ronaldo in the pecking order and his young family struggled to acclimatise to Spanish life. His goalscoring record was still impressive despite a lack of playing time, though, and the highlight of his one season in that famous shirt came when he scored – from a Beckham through pass – in a raucous 4-2 home win over Barcelona in April 2005. One month later, Liverpool won the Champions League without Owen, who would never come close to being a European champion. If he had his time back, would he do things differently? 5) Another goal against Argentina (2005) If there is a tinge of sadness to the St Étienne goal – other than it coming in an agonising England defeat – it is that Owen never really scored one like it again. Not once the hamstrings started to play up. Between France 98 and Euro 2000, where he struggled in Kevin Keegan’s deathly side, he scored three goals in 10 matches. Owen was substituted in each of England’s group matches, his only goal of the tournament coming in the wretched defeat to Romania. After toiling under Keegan, Owen thrived again when Sven-Göran Eriksson took over, scoring 28 goals in 56 matches. He continued to love tormenting Argentina, too, and annoyed them by winning a debatable penalty at the 2002 World Cup. “Owen jumped like he was in a swimming pool,” said Mauricio Pochettino in 2016. “I didn’t touch him.” Come November 2005, England’s Golden Generation were getting ready to win the World Cup, and nothing was going to stop them after a thrilling friendly win over Argentina in Geneva. Rooney scored for England in the first half, before two late headers from Owen turned a 2-1 defeat into a 3-2 victory. Owen might not have been tall, but he had killer instincts and always knew how to find space in the area. Rooney and Owen could have formed a devastating partnership, but it proved to be another in a long line of lost England opportunities. A month later Owen broke his foot while playing for Newcastle. He recovered in time to make the World Cup – and damaged his cruciate ligament in England’s final group match. It was the beginning of the end. 6) A late, late Manchester derby winner (2009) After a year in Madrid, Owen wanted to return home in the summer of 2005. Liverpool were reluctant to meet the £16.5m asking price, so instead he joined Newcastle, where … well. Let’s just say that Owen could only have made himself more unpopular with Newcastle fans if he had snuck into St James’ Park and painted the stadium red and white. At least he still had admirers elsewhere after Newcastle went down in 2009, although few people suspected that one of them would be Sir Alex Ferguson, who jumped at the chance to sign Owen on a free. The transfer came as a shock, especially to United fans who were expecting more than a waning former Liverpool striker to soothe the blow of losing Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. The pace had gone, taking much of Owen’s menace with it, but he still had the knack in the area, and that old sense of drama was undiminished. Old Trafford didn’t look too bothered about Owen’s past affiliations when he won the 153rd Manchester derby in the sixth minute of added time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence","type":"interactive","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-15T23:00:01Z","webTitle":"Mass shootings in the US: there have been 1,624 in 1,870 days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/02/america-mass-shootings-gun-violence","fields":{"headline":"Mass shootings in the US: there have been 1,624 in 1,870 days","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-victims-named-full-list","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T23:58:34Z","webTitle":"Family and friends pay tribute to Las Vegas shooting victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-victims-named-full-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-victims-named-full-list","fields":{"headline":"Family and friends pay tribute to Las Vegas shooting victims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A registered nurse from Tennessee. An off-duty Las Vegas police officer. A 35-year-old Californian middle school teacher. Details of the victims of Sunday night’s mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas began to emerge on Tuesday, 24 hours after at least 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the most deadly mass shooting in modern United States history. Cameron Robinson Cameron Robinson was a young city of Las Vegas employee, who was at the festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley, when the popping sounds started. Eardley recalled on Tuesday, “And I just remember being really upset – why would somebody set off firecrackers at a venue like this when shootings have happened?” After a second round, Eardley decided it was time for them to move: “I remember seeing people sitting on the ground and wondering why they were sitting because they were going to get trampled. And I realized they were bleeding.” Eardley, 36, and Robinson, 28, had been together for four years after meeting on OkCupid; a year ago Robinson moved in with Eardley in St George, Utah. Robinson was a records specialist for the city. “Long before he came to work for the city he gave me his resume,” recalled his boss, Las Vegas city attorney Brad Jerbic, “and the first thing I remember noticing is that he got his bachelor’s degree when he was 20 year old – that immediately got my attention.” When Jerbic hired him several years ago, his desk ended up being in the center of the office. “It was a perfect metaphor,” Jerbic said. Robinson organized potlucks, brought food to the office, ran games at the Christmas party. With Robinson, “everything went up a notch. If it was fun it was more fun, if the records were being processed efficiently it was more efficiently.” Robinson’s sister, Meghan Ervin, wrote on Facebook: “I was never suppose to say good bye to you little brother. You were suppose to take over the world ... I love you to the moon and back.” What did Eardley love about him? “He’s my other half. I’m the crazy, fly by the seat of your pants – he’s the straight laced and level headed one ... And so many other things. His quirky little smile, his big teeth, his crooked sunglasses … so many things.” Dorene Anderson A self-described “stay-at-home wife and mother”, and hockey lover, Anderson had traveled to Las Vegas with her husband, and two daughters for the festival. In a Facebook post of a recent picture, daughter Stefanie reported “This is one of the last family photos we will take… Sadly, my mom was one of the victims that did not make it.” “You lit up her world,” one friend commented on the photo. “There was no end to her love for you and your sister and dad. She was by far the best person I’ve ever known.” Steve Berger Berger was a father of three and a financial adviser in the Minneapolis Twin Cities. Friends said he had traveled to Vegas to celebrate his 44th birthday. “He was charismatic, full of energy and breathed life into every room. He was always so positive,” his best friend Josh Decker told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “He was larger than life to me.” Family told the Los Angeles Times that Berger was the primary caretaker of his children and spent his time off ferrying his children between school and sports practices, while also coaching youth basketball and football. “He was a devoted father. You couldn’t ask for a better father and a better man,” his father said. Berger and Decker were together when the shooting started, the newspaper reported. After the two and everyone around them got on the ground Decker recalled looking around for his friend and seeing him lying motionless and bleeding. “He was covered in his own blood,” he said. Candace Bowers Bowers, a 40-year-old mother of two older children, had adopted a two-year-old into her home just five months before being killed in Sunday’s attack. “She had a big heart. She was just a sweetheart. She would do anything for anybody,” her aunt told the Los Angeles Times. The Garden Grove, California, woman worked as a waitress at a local Mimi’s Cafe restaurant. “Her laugh and her smiles and [she was] always happy and spoke from the heart and you wanted the truth, you got it from Candace,” a longtime friend, Patty Tran, told ABC Los Angeles. “Candice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,” her family wrote on a GoFundMe campaign they launched to support her children. “She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.” Denise Cohen Cohen, 57, was in Las Vegas to celebrate the birthday of her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died in the attack. The Carpinteria, California, resident was a mother to three boys. “We will miss her big smile, positive attitude and the way she loved to live life large,” wrote her sister in law on a GoFundMe page. Her friend Leana Orsua said she hoped Cohen didn’t suffer. “I know she was at a happy place,” she told NBC Bay Area. “She was dancing and singing, and I think that’s what she’s doing in heaven.” Austin Davis Davis, a 29-year-old pipe fitter from Riverside, California, was in Las Vegas for a “guys’ trip” with Thomas Day, who also died in the attack. Family friends described Day, 56, as something of a second father to Davis. “If he knew [you], he loved you. That’s just how he cared for people,” wrote his friend Katelyn Hood on a GoFundMe page set up to assist his family. “Austin would refuse to let you be upset the slightest bit in his presence. You honestly couldn’t be upset ... his smile was so contagious.” Mark McManus, president of United Association, the union to which Davis belonged, said: “We are now beyond stunned at the loss of one of our brothers.” Brian Fraser Fraser, who worked as a sales manager at a mortgage company in Orange County, California, was a father of four, aged four through 25. “He was the life of the party,” said his widow, Stephanie, who was at the festival with him. “He always had a smile on his face. He loved to hug everybody, get into everybody’s bubble,” she told Time magazine. “‘Here’s the deal’... If you knew Brian, you have heard that come from his mouth numerous times,” family wrote on a GoFundMe page set up earlier this week. “He had a way of saying what needed to be said in just enough words.” Keri Galvan Galvan, a mother of three young children, was in Las Vegas attending the country music festival with her husband and a group of friends. “Her days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,” Galvan’s sister wrote on a GoFundMe page. After being struck by the gunfire, Galvan died in the arms of her husband, Justin. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal, the two met when they were students at Simi Valley high school, though they didn’t get together until later, when Justin Galvan was in the US Marine Corps. The couple married in Jamaica in 2011, and were just a couple of weeks away from their sixth wedding anniversary. Stacee Etcheber Etcheber was struck and killed while her husband, off-duty San Francisco police officer Vinnie Etcheber, tried to help usher others to safety. “He stood back, he stood back to help those victims that were shot and he stuck with them, he stuck with them all the way to the hospital,” officer Etcheber’s brother Al told ABC San Francisco. When he returned to find his wife, everything was blocked off and she was unaccounted for. “She leaves behind two adoring beautiful children and an amazing husband. Thank you to everyone for all the support in this past few days. We will dearly miss you,” wrote Al Etcheber in a Facebook post. Tara Smith Smith, 34, was a mother of two from Alberta, Canada and worked as a professional model. “She was a beautiful soul. She was a wonderful mother and our family is going to miss her dearly,” her aunt Val Rodger told the Toronto Star. Her company, Sophia Models, also expressed their condolences. “She worked as a model for our agency for over 10 years. She was always a friendly face and had a very caring spirit.” Jordyn Rivera Rivera, 21, was a fourth-year student in a healthcare management program at Cal State San Bernardino, and friends described her as a warm, energetic person. In an email to students, university president Tomás Morales called her death “a devastating loss for the entire CSUSB family”. “She passed away so young and she had everything going for her,” wrote a family friend who set up a GoFundMe page on her family’s behalf. Carrie Barnette Barnette was in Las Vegas celebrating a friend’s 30th birthday, when she was struck with gunfire in the chest. Barnette, 34, worked on the culinary team at Disneyland in Anaheim and the company expressed condolences in a post Tuesday. “Our thoughts are with her family, along with our support, during this incredibly difficult time,” the post read. “She was a ray of sunshine,” Destiny Calderon, a former coworker, told the Orange County Register. “She always had a smile. If you had a bad day, she would lift you up.” That’s a sentiment numerous friends shared on her Facebook wall. “Your words would dry my tears, your laugh would make me smile,” a friend wrote. Rocio Guillen Rocha A longtime cast member at Disneyland who lived in Anaheim, Guillen Rocha gave birth to her fourth child, Austin, just six weeks ago. “My heart breaks that you were taken from your babies far too soon,” wrote a friend on a GoFundMe started by one of Guillen’s cousins. Even though Guillen Rocha was shot, it was reported she managed to climb a fence at the concert venue, but later died at the hospital. Hannah Ahlers A 34-year-old mother of three, Hannah and her husband had come to the festival with three other couples. Dave Ahlers, Hannah’s father-in-law, confirmed Monday evening to the Las Vegas Review Journal that Hannah had been struck in the head by the gunfire. “She was possibly one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, with a heart to match,” a friend told the Los Angeles Times. “She never came across with the diva mentality she easily could have had. She was a devoted mother and wife.” The music festival was a destination for country music fans far and wide, and the reported deaths are likewise, from all over the US and Canada. Sonny Melton Sonny Melton, 29, who lived in Big Sandy, Tennessee, and worked at a nearby hospital, was the first victim publicly identified. Family members confirmed to the news station WSMV that he was killed in the gunfire. His wife, Heather Melton, told WZTV that her husband had shielded her from bullets on the ground when the shooting began. “He saved my life and lost his,” she said. A friend of the couple told the Paris (Tennessee) Post-Intelligencer that the two had gotten married about a year ago. “I want everyone to know what a kindhearted loving man he was, but at this point I can barely breathe,” Heather Melton wrote to USA Today. The couple both worked at Henry County medical center in Tennessee, he as a registered nurse, she as an orthopedic surgeon. “The thoughts and prayers of the entire HCMC family are with Sonny and Heather’s families,” the center’s chief executive, Thomas Gee, said in a statement. Jordan McIldoon The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that a 23-year-old British Columbia man, Jordan McIldoon, was also among the dead, according to his parents. Another concertgoer posted on Facebook on Sunday night that McIldoon had “died in [her] arms”. “We only had one child,” McIldoon’s parents told CBC. “We just don’t know what to do.” Bailey Schweitzer Local outlets in Bakersfield, California, have confirmed with family members that 20-year-old Bailey Schweitzer was killed in the attack. The Los Angeles Times reported that Schweitzer was a receptionist at Infinity Communications and Consulting, a software company in Bakersfield. “Bailey was always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,” Infinity’s chief executive Fred Brakeman told the Times. “No one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.” Dana Gardner San Bernardino County officials announced in an email to staff that Dana Gardner, 52, a longtime county employee, had died Monday morning from gunshot wounds sustained in the onslaught. Five other county employees who were also at the concert are said to have been injured. Bob Dutton, the assessor-recorder-county clerk, told the Sun that Gardner, the deputy recorder, was a “go-to” person and a “dedicated public servant”. Jessica Klymchuk Jessica Klymchuk, an Edmonton, Alberta, mother of four, was also confirmed dead in the shooting. In a statement, Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, called the incident an “act of violence that is almost beyond comprehension in a time of peace”. Klymchuk worked as an educational assistant, librarian and bus driver for St Stephen’s School, according to the Edmonton Journal. Tina Moore, who had worked with Klymchuk, said: “She did so much for her children. She went over and above for them.” Klymchuk was in Vegas with her fiance for the music festival. Quinton Robbins The first Las Vegas resident identified as a victim was 20-year-old Quinton Robbins, a student at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. On Facebook, a woman who identified herself as Robbins’s aunt wrote: “He was the most kind and loving soul. Everyone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile. He was truly an amazing person.” Rhonda LeRocque Rhonda LeRocque, of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, was identified as a victim by relatives. Her family told Boston 25 News that she was with her husband, Jason, when she was shot in the back of the head. “[Her husband] thought she ducked and she didn’t – she was caught in the back of the head,” Rhonda’s half-sister Jennifer Zelenski said. Denise Burditus Denise Burditus, of Martinsville, West Virginia, was also among the first victims to be identified. Her husband, who was also at the concert, mourned her on Facebook. “It saddens me to say that I lost my wife of 32 years, a mother of two, soon to be grandmother of five this evening in the Las Vegas shooting,” Tony Burditus wrote. “Denise passed in my arms. I LOVE YOU BABE.” Sandy Casey The city of Manhattan Beach, California, lost Sandy Casey, 35, a middle school teacher. A local paper, the Daily Breeze, reported that Casey was a special-education teacher from Redondo Beach, and had attended the Route 91 Harvest festival with a group of fellow teachers, principals and staff members from Manhattan Beach Unified, which shared news of her death in an email to parents. Casey was engaged to Christopher Willemse, a special-education aide, according to the Daily Breeze. He shared a photo of the couple on Facebook and wrote: “As I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today as that’s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!” Rachael Parker Also of Manhattan Beach, Rachael Parker was a 10-year veteran civilian employee of its police department. Her mother, Robin Monter, told KXLY, a TV news station in Spokane, that Parker was “brilliant and had a heart of gold”. She also said her daughter volunteered with the elderly and the homeless. Angela Gomez A 2015 graduate of Riverside Polytechnic high school in Riverside, California, Angela Gomez was identified by the Riverside Unified school district as one of the victims, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. On Monday, a Facebook post read: “It is with heavy hearts that we inform you that one of the victims of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy was a 2015 graduate of Riverside Poly High School.” The high school’s staff described Gomez as “fun-loving young lady with a great sense of humor” who had a “warm heart and loving spirit”. Gomez, a cheerleader in high school, was described by her former English teacher and cheer coach, Lupe Avila, as a “wonderful young woman who had her whole life ahead of her”. Charleston Hartfield An off-duty Las Vegas police officer and military veteran named Charleston Hartfield was identified by friends as a victim, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I don’t know a better man than Charles,” said Troy Rhett, who said he’d been friends with Hartfield for eight years. “They say it’s always the good ones we lose early. There’s no truer statement than that with Charles.” Stan King, who wrote “RIP Brother” on Hartfield’s Facebook page, told the Review-Journal that Hartfield was “one of the nicest guys ever” and would be remembered as “the most true-blue American guy I’ve ever met”. Adrian Murfitt A close friend of Adrian Murfitt watched as medics tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him, the New York Times reported. Murfitt, 35, was a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. He loved playing hockey, could fix almost anything mechanical, and was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika. After working long hours throughout the summer, he and two other childhood friends booked tickets for the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, his sister, Shannon Gothard, told the Times. Murfitt was with his friend, Brian MacKinnon, when shooting broke out, Gothard told the Times. “He was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,” she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Murfitt was shot in the head, MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Murfitt, though the medics told MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety. Susan Smith Susan Smith, 53, was a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif. She had two children. Her father, Tom Rementer, told the New York Times that his daughter was a “wonderful person”. Smith had worked at the Vista Elementary School in Simi Valley, California, for three years and the school district for 16 years, a spokesperson for the school district told ABC News. She had been attending the festival with two friends, who both survived. Lisa Romero-Muniz Lisa Romero-Muniz, a high school secretary from Gallup, New Mexico, was an “incredible loving and sincere friend, mentor and advocate for students”, the Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools interim superintendent, Mike Hyatt, said in a statement. “As a colleague, she was also outgoing, kind and considerate of all those she worked with,” he said. A wife, mother, and grandmother, Romero-Muniz had been in Las Vegas with her husband to see the country music singer Jason Aldean for their wedding anniversary. “She was beyond excited,” said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked told the New York Times. “For her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.” John Phippen John Phippen of Santa Clarita, California, was with his son, Travis, at the country music festival in Las Vegas when he was struck by a bullet in the lower back, Reuters said. Travis, an emergency medical technician, carried his father to a car that took them to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, where the elder Phippen died from his injuries. “He was my best friend,” Travis told the Los Angeles Times. “He never did anything wrong to anybody. He was always kind and gentle. He was the biggest teddy bear I knew.” In the chaotic scene, Travis had been shot in the arm but didn’t realise it until he arrived at the hospital. He is staying with family in the Las Vegas area until the Clark County coroner releases his father’s body. A GoFundMe page set up by a neighbour described Phippen as having “a heart that was larger than life and a personality to match”. Chris Roybal Roybal, 28, was a United States military veteran who served in Afghanistan. He was in Las Vegas celebrating his birthday with with his mother, who survived, ABC News reported. In a Facebook post from July, Roybal described what it was like to come under gunfire during combat. “I remember that first day, not sure how to feel. It was never fear, to be honest, mass confusion. Sensory overload … followed by the most amount of natural adrenaline that could never be duplicated through a needle,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, as the fights continue and as they as increase in numbers and violence, that excitement fades and the anger is all that’s left. “The anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you’ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit. “Still covered in the dirt you’ve refused to wash off for fear of forgetting the most raw emotions you as a human being will ever feel again. “What’s it like to be shot at? It’s a nightmare no amount of drugs, no amount of therapy and no amount of drunk talks with your war veteran buddies will ever be able to escape.” Thomas Day Jr The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas Day Jr was a 54-year-old home builder from Riverside, California. He went to the festival with his four children, who are all in their 20s and 30s. Day’s father told the LA Times that Day’s children were “crushed.” “He was the best dad,” Day Sr said. “That’s why the kids were with him.” Neysa Tonks Tonks was a mother of three who lived and worked in Las Vegas. “She was a very nice woman who was full of life and energy,” her former church counselor Tracy Downey told the Las Vegas Review Journal. After word of her death, Tonk’s employer, Technologent, began a GoFundMe page for her family “in their hour of need”. Tonks “has been a light to everyone she’s touched” one friend wrote on GoFundMe. “The world will not be the same without her. We must carry on in her honor. Love and prayers to her family!” Friends flooded the fundraising page with photos, of them together and captions like “you made me smile and always knew how to enjoy life”. She was 46. Jenny Parks A kindergarten teacher and mother of two, Parks lived in Lancaster, California with her husband Bobby, who sustained a non-fatal gunshot wound in the arm Sunday. Family told People Magazine that Parks had just earned her master’s in education earlier this year and was in the process planning her husband’s 40th birthday party. Jenny was “absolutely beautiful and very intelligent, had a wonderful sense of humor and was so kind”, Bobby’s uncle told the magazine. Her husband’s Facebook page shows a smiling family at Dodgers games and on vacation. “Great picture of such an amazing family!” one friend wrote. Christiana Duarte Christiana Duarte, 22, had gone to the country music festival with her brother’s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Although both women were shot, Romero was expected to recover after having undergone surgery, family friend Danette Meyers told the New York Times. “I can’t tell you how this has hit all of us,” she said. “This is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.” Victor Link Victor Link, from Orange County, California, died after taking a bullet to the chest. Victor’s father, Loyd Link, 52, who worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales, told the New York Times: “Rob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,” Loyd said. “But it didn’t happen.” Jack Beaton Beaton died while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family told the New York Times. His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, said Beaton covered his wife’s body with his own, and was hit. “He told her he loved her,” Cook said. “Laurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.” Beaton’s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. “Lost my best friend,” he wrote. “I love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!” Melissa Ramirez The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became American citizens, Melissa Ramirez, 26, had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, told the New York Times. She added: “She always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there.” The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday, the NYT reported. Heather Alvarado Heather Alvarado, 35, was described as a wife, mother, sister, friend, and “so much more”, according to a GoFundMe page. The page reportedly said that Alvarado was “always the first to help out” and “anyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.” Alvarado had travelled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas, and the police said she died after being injured in the shooting. “It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,” Sergeant Jerry Womack, spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement. Kurt Von Tillow Kurt Von Tillow, 55, had travelled to Las Vegas for the concert with his family members and they were together when the attack occurred. Von Tillow’s wife and daughter escaped unharmed but his sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in the ankle, his brother-in-law Mark Carson said. The NYT said both were expected to recover. Von Tillow’s wife told her family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Carson told the New York Times. “That was probably the hardest part for her – having to leave him there.” Carson described Von Tillow as being “the most patriotic person you’ve ever met” and told the NYT: “Guarantee you, he’s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music.” Andrea Castilla Andrea Castilla, 28, was visiting her younger sister, Athena, in Las Vegas for her birthday when the attack took place, said the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The Review-Journal said her death was even more painful as her boyfriend was intending to propose to her. Athena said: “I told him, ‘I hope you knew she would say yes in a heartbeat.’” Castilla wanted to make those afflicted with illnesses feel beautiful. For Castilla, from Huntington Beach, California, makeup was more than just a job for her. She told her brother that she wanted to serve cancer patients with her talents. The same disease had taken her mother’s life when she was a teenager, reported the Review-Journal. “That’s what made her really happy. Making people feel beautiful,” Athena told the Review-Journal. “She just had such a great outlook on life.” Lisa Patterson Lisa Patterson, a Californian mother of three, was a great person who was active in church, her husband of over 30 years, Robert Patterson said. He added that they loved coming to Las Vegas. “We liked the atmosphere of Vegas, so a lot of times when we took a vacation, it was to Las Vegas,” he said. Patterson was not with his wife when the attack occurred, said the Review-Journal, and came to Las Vegas to find his wife after the incident happened. While his two older children came with him, he said his youngest eight-year-old daughter stayed home. Patterson said he wanted to be the one to tell his daughter her mother is dead. A friend of Lisa Patterson, Andy Tamilin, said: “Lisa had an infectious energy and fierce love for her family, and we are beyond heartbroken for Bob and their three kids.” He added that Patterson and her husband “spent hours donating their time and energy to help the girls of our community”. Bill Wolfe Jr Pennsylvania youth sports coach Bill Wolfe Jr, a 42-year-old father of two, was celebrating his 20th anniversary with his wife, Robyn, when the shooting happened, said the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Wolfe was a Little League coach and coached the Shippensburg youth wrestling programme for children in kindergarten through sixth grade, Tony Yianiello, head coach of the Shippensburg high school’s varsity wrestling team, told the Review-Journal. “Some people simply live in the community, Bill lived for his community,” Yianiello said. Michelle Vo Michelle Vo, 32, of Eagle Rock, California, who worked in financial services for the Pasadena branch of New York Life Insurance Co, was remembered on Tuesday in the US House of Representatives. Vo, who was a native of San Jose, California, was described as “an ambitious hard worker, known for her charisma and fierce independence” in a statement read on the House floor by representative Jimmy Gomez. Derrick Taylor Derrick “Bo” Taylor, 52, was a Californian correctional lieutenant who led inmates to fight wildfires, said the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He was a 29-year veteran of the California department of corrections and rehabilitation, and celebrated his most recent birthday on 25 September, a department spokesman, Bill Sessa said. It added that Taylor led a staff of nine, and together they were responsible for more than 100 inmates in coordination with Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting arm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/04/images-challenging-domestic-abuse-scottish-womens-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T06:30:21Z","webTitle":"Strong, brave, diverse: new images challenge our ideas of domestic abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/04/images-challenging-domestic-abuse-scottish-womens-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/oct/04/images-challenging-domestic-abuse-scottish-womens-aid","fields":{"headline":"Strong, brave, diverse: new images challenge our ideas of domestic abuse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Photographs show us snapshots of lives and experiences but they can also mislead, misinform and show versions of a story that we wouldn’t always recognise. Most photos that try to portray domestic abuse do the latter. They tell us only young, white, slim, beautiful women experience abuse and that their abuser is physically violent, broadly built: a brutish modern day neanderthal. They say victims of abuse are weak, cowardly and passive. But survivors of domestic abuse, such as Lilly*, tell a very different story: “There were small but definite acts of resistance,” she says. “You can still be a strong woman in an abusive situation. In a way you fight it every day of your life when you are in it.” When we speak about violence against women our society tends to equate being a victim with being weak in a way that we do not with other crimes. Photos of domestic abuse reinforce this perception: a woman is shown cowering, helpless, head in her hands as a clenched, tattooed fist looms over her. She is stripped of her agency as we judge her for not leaving her abuser, and assure ourselves we would act differently if we were ever in that situation. Believe it or not, most survivors of domestic abuse would have thought the same. The continued misrepresentation of domestic abuse as an entirely physical phenomenon – as black eyes, tears or broken bones – stops women from reporting and seeking support for domestic abuse. For many years women’s organisations have supported women who have lived through years of emotional, sexual and financial abuse, who still question the validity of their experience on the basis that their abuser never raised his fist. We also know from survivors that the psychological trauma inflicted by abusers, the control, humiliation and degradation, often stays with them for far longer than physical pain. Abusers are not simply white, working class men with an alcohol problem, and they certainly don’t need to be physically violent to try to break their victim. “If photographs always show hitting or bruises it means that men who don’t hit absolve themselves of the label abuser because they don’t leave bruises,” says Mariama, a survivor of abuse. “Also it makes people think that if a woman doesn’t have bruises she must be OK.” An EU study has shown that one in three women across the EU has experienced some form of intimate partner violence since the age of 15. That’s not just a statistic. It’s your neighbour. It’s your sister. Your teacher. Your boss. Your friend. Your daughter. It might even be you. Domestic abuse knows no boundaries of race, religion, disability or class. Nobody thinks it will happen to them, or that they might be vulnerable to such horrors. The damage inflicted by our use of misleading domestic abuse images is severe. It shapes our understanding of whose experience we consider to be valid, and whose is invalid. It influences who we believe and how we respond when someone we know tells us they have experienced abuse. It bewilders women experiencing fear and anxiety in their relationship. How are the women who don’t look like the photos we exclusively use to represent domestic abuse supposed to think of themselves and their experiences? As Pia, another survivor, puts it, these kinds of photos give people permission to ask why someone didn’t leave, rather than asking why the man didn’t stop hurting her. For women to recognise their own experiences they must see themselves represented. For our society to take seriously the experiences and trauma of women who have lived through domestic abuse they must see women affected who are older; they must see women of colour, they must see disabled women, fat women, professional women, young women, working class women, they must see diverse women. That is why Scottish Women’s Aid and Zero Tolerance have worked collaboratively with survivors of domestic abuse to produce One Thousand Words, a photography project by Laura Dodsworth, to represent survivors in a different way. As we develop our understanding of domestic abuse as being a crime that does not require physical violence, we must also recognise the impact of our narrow depictions of victim-survivors of male violence. Those women who have experienced domestic abuse are victims – they have been wronged – but they are not weak. They are survivors, and their strength and courage deserves representation too. * Some names in this article have been changed Brenna Jessie is a Scottish feminist, activist and external affairs officer at Scottish Women’s Aid.

The Oscar-winning film-maker appeared at the Zurich film festival to promote his new thriller. Based on a True Story. It was the same city that saw his extradition proceedings initiated back in 2009. In 1977, Polanski was arrested for drugging and sexually assaulting 13-year-old Samantha Geimer. After spending 42 days in jail, he fled the country after hearing the judge was planning to sentence him for longer. “As you know, Samantha Geimer has been asking for over 30 years for this thing to end,” Polanski said to the Hollywood Reporter. “But, I’m sorry the judges who dealt with it the last 40 years were corrupted, one covering for the other. So I don’t [sic] maybe one of them will [eventually] stop doing it.” Polanski remains a fugitive and in August, a judge in California pushed for the case to go forward despite Geimer appearing in court to urge them not to charge him further. “As far as what I did: it’s over,” Polanski said. “I pleaded guilty. I went to jail. I came back to the United States to do it, people forget about that, or don’t even know. I then was locked up here [in Zurich] after this festival. So in the sum, I did about four or five times more than what was promised to me.” Since the initial case, Polanski has been hit with two further claims. In 2010, the British actor Charlotte Lewis said the actor had “forced himself” on her when she was 16 and earlier this year, a woman identified only as Robin claimed she was “sexually vicitimized” by the director when she was also 16. His new film, starring Eva Green and Polanski’s wife, Emmanuelle Seigner, received poor reviews when a work-in-progress print screened at Cannes. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it “flat”. Polanski, whose credits include Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby, has said that it is “unfortunate” that his work is now being viewed with knowledge of the scandal surrounding his case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-monarchs-collapse-the-market-at-work","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T18:08:09Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Monarch’s collapse: the market at work | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-monarchs-collapse-the-market-at-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-monarchs-collapse-the-market-at-work","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Monarch’s collapse: the market at work","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At the Conservative party conference in Manchester, where the chancellor Philip Hammond was extolling the virtues of free markets, the day’s big example of markets at work – the failure of Monarch – did not rate a mention. The airline went into administration hours before Mr Hammond spoke on Monday morning, at the least disrupting the holiday plans of hundreds of thousands of its customers. Some may have been lost altogether. The Civil Aviation Authority, emerging as effective regulator, launched a plan it rehearsed a year ago to rescue passengers who would otherwise be stranded. Aware of the airline’s questionable viability, it had been raising a levy on Monarch passengers that will help fund the rescue. Customers who had booked future holidays must hope they are covered by their credit or debit cards. This is what the market does so ruthlessly: it destroys the weakest. Monarch’s collapse will allow its rivals to breathe a little easier. More passengers and less capacity means higher prices; the share value of other budget airlines rose sharply on the news. Monarch was the product of a kinder, gentler age. It was launched in the 1960s as a package holiday pioneer, and traces lingered of the idea of flying as a luxury for the mass market. It had a reputation as a good employer that rewarded hard work. Loyal customers speak fondly of good service and slightly more legroom, but in a market framed only by price competition, it could never match the more aggressive misery airlines. Its already frail business model was further undermined by the terrorist threat in some of its most popular destinations such as Sharm El Sheikh, and it continued to try to function as a tour operator as well as a budget airline. Passenger numbers have been falling, and a £165m last-chance investment from its major shareholder, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, failed to turn round its fortunes. Brexit and the collapse in the value of the pound was the final blow: Monarch’s fuel costs have risen by an estimated 16%. Nor did Mr Hammond mention the virtues of the market when he confirmed that an extra £10bn would be available for the government’s help-to-buy scheme. Not even he could pretend this will amount to anything other than an unjustifiable bung to developers that will stoke up house prices without increasing supply, making it even harder for the first-time buyer. The chancellor told Tories they could fight Labour by showing how capitalism delivers for all. But, as would be home-buyers know, it doesn’t."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-stephen-paddock-gun-semi-automatic","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T16:55:56Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas gunman may have used special device to fire faster, expert says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-stephen-paddock-gun-semi-automatic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-stephen-paddock-gun-semi-automatic","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas gunman may have used special device to fire faster, expert says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Law enforcement officials have yet to confirm what kind of firearms Stephen Paddock used to shoot from his Mandalay Bay hotel room into a crowd of people at a country music festival in Las Vegas, killing at least 59 people, though reports suggested he had at least 19 guns, including rifles, and explosives. The rapid pace of the gunfire suggested that the shooter was using either a fully automatic weapon, tightly restricted under US law, or that he had attached a device to a semi-automatic gun to make it fire more continuously, said Massad Ayoob, a firearms expert, instructor and author. “It’s faster than almost any human being is going to be able to pull a trigger on a semi-automatic,” Ayoob said. Fully automatic weapons, which fire multiple rounds of ammunition from a single pull of the trigger, are strictly regulated, taxed and tracked under US law. This makes them expensive collectors’ items, and comparatively rarely used in crimes. Semi-automatic rifles, in contrast, which fire only one round of ammunition with each pull of the trigger, are widely available. Unlike some states, Nevada, which has laws generally friendly to gun owners, does not ban the sale of “assault weapons” – semi-automatic civilian guns built to resemble military weapons. From listening to the footage of the attack, Ayoob said that the gunshots “did not sound as consistent” as he would typically expect from a fully automatic M-16 or AK-47. “The pace of fire is a little bit erratic. At one point it’s slower than it is at another point.” Paddock could have used a Hellfire or a bump-fire device, which attach to normal semi-automatic rifles and allow them to fire more rapidly, Ayoob said. These devices are legal, but rarely used by serious shooters, he said. “It’s hard to shoot accurately with them, and serious shooters want accuracy,” he said. He called them “not terribly popular” and “something a gun geek would want”. For the Las Vegas shooter, though, the accuracy of these devices would not have mattered, since he was “hosing a two-acre area with 30,000 targets,” nearly every shot he fired would have hit someone. On its website, Bump Fire Systems advertises the device as permitting “simulated full-auto firing” that is “absolutely legal”. It sells Bump Fire stocks for $99.99. The Hellfire system uses a hand-operated crank to hit the trigger of the gun more rapidly than a person could fire it, Ayoob said, which could explain apparent changes in the pace of the fire. Ayoob said he knew of only one previous incident in which a legally owned fully automatic gun was used in a murder. When fully automatic guns do show up in crimes, they have often been stolen, he said. Semi-automatic weapons patterned to look like fully automatic M-16s have been a political flashpoint for decades, with Democrats arguing that these guns should be banned, and gun rights advocates arguing that semi-automatic weapons such as the AR-15 are no more dangerous than semi-automatic hunting rifles, which are not politically controversial. The wide availability of large-capacity ammunition magazines, which allow shooters to fire dozens of rounds of ammunition without reloading, has also been a political battleground. For 10 years, under the 1994 federal assault weapon ban, Congress did limit the production and sale of certain kinds of semi-automatic rifles, as well as higher-capacity ammunition magazines. Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004, though some states do have their own assault weapons bans still in place. The 1994 law was written in a way that allowed gun manufacturers to market and sell very similar military-style guns with only a few tweaks to make them ban-compliant. The ban also grandfathered in as legal guns and ammunition in banned categories that Americans had already owned. Following previous mass shootings, some Democrats have argued that Congress should reinstate a broader ban on semi-automatic rifles styled after military weapons. A justice department-funded evaluation of the ban found no clear evidence that it had reduced violence, and concluded that the live-saving effects of even a much stricter ban “are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement”. Most gun murders in the United States are committed with ordinary handguns. Rifles of any kind were used in only about 3.5% of firearms murders from 2010 to 2014, according to a Guardian analysis of FBI data."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/02/opinion-divided-by-the-catalan-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T18:12:31Z","webTitle":"Opinion divided by the Catalan referendum | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/02/opinion-divided-by-the-catalan-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/02/opinion-divided-by-the-catalan-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Opinion divided by the Catalan referendum","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One cannot fail to have been moved by the scenes of violence in Catalonia, as Spanish forces attacked unarmed voters (Hundreds hurt as Catalonia poll descends into violence, 2 October). Whatever the view on Catalonia’s right to hold such a vote or not, the response by the Spanish national government was brutal and excessive. The sight of people being dragged from polling stations by baton-wielding police and disabled people being attacked in wheelchairs has no place in a modern western democracy. What is deeply disappointing is the muted response from the international community, which – bar a few exceptions such as Angela Merkel, the Belgian prime minister Charles Michel and Nicola Sturgeon – has been largely silent. While the EU may argue that this is an internal situation, in the past it has been willing to act in such matters. In 2000, for example, it imposed diplomatic sanctions on Austria when Jörg Haider’s extreme rightwing Austrian Freedom Party entered the government. The Tory government is so morally bankrupt that little more was to be expected than the pathetic response from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office when it referred to Spain as a “close ally and a good friend, whose strength and unity matters to us”. There was no condemnation of the violence. One suspects that if there was any doubt previously over Catalonia’s desire for independence, the actions of the Spanish state have pushed it well and truly down this road. Alex Orr Edinburgh • Whatever the merits or otherwise of Catalan independence, Sunday’s referendum was unquestionably illegal, unconstitutional and illegitimate by every relevant national, European and international standard. The Spanish state had no alternative, therefore, but to suppress it using whatever force was reasonably necessary and proportionate. It is debatable whether police conduct always met this standard. But attempting to prevent the poll was not itself anti-democratic or a violation of human rights. Nor, given the radically different contexts and in spite of the superficial similarities, was it “Francoist”. Neither Spain nor the rest of Europe can afford to endorse attempts at secession on such terms. Professor Steven Greer and Dr Albert Sanchez-Graells University of Bristol Law School • I am a Spanish national who relocated to Spain after living in Northern Ireland for 13 years, which puts into perspective the problems in Catalonia. Politics aside – which are well covered in all the media – my experience meeting Catalan people abroad was shockingly negative during my time abroad. Most young Catalans refused to mix with the Spanish for the simple reason that we were born in Seville or Madrid. Spaniards abroad are seen by Catalan people as “the enemy”. This would have not happened among people of my parents’ and grandparents’ generation during the Franco years. I find it strange that the views of Catalans who do not support independence and the referendum are nowhere to be seen in the international papers. But they hardly feature in the Spanish media either. It appears that they are a minority there, and they are afraid to lose jobs and be ostracised by their neighbours. It was only in the last few days that that minority have spoken up. I have heard accounts of a secondary school student who reported that school staff asked students to raise their hands if their families were going to vote. I cannot help but wonder what would happen if teachers asked students if their families would support a Sinn Féin-orchestrated referendum about joining the Republic of Ireland. It would be called sectarianism. I have not read in the international press that on Sunday people in Catalonia could vote as many times as they wanted as reported by, for example, El País. I have not read either that the advice on the day of the referendum was to bring children and form big queues for the press to photograph, or that their regional police had instructions to watch from a distance. Northern Ireland got over the hatred and violence cycle. The mantra there is “we don’t want to go back to that”. They have accepted that there are two sides; no winners and that the only way forward is together. Unfortunately, Spain and Catalonia lack the kind of politicians and the international support that made peace and prosperity possible in Northern Ireland. Elena Tavera La Línea, Cadiz, Spain • Anyone watching, in horror as I did, the videos of the treatment of voters in Catalonia can see that the police did not act with “firmness and serenity” as Spain’s prime minister said, but with brutal force. They literally seized voters and threw them on to the streets, in some cases even hurling them down steps. One poor old man was thrown down with his dog, and his fears for the animal are visible. This would have been bad in a riot, but as a government attempt to stop voting it was disgusting. Spain should be hanging its head in shame. Sara Neill Tunbridge Wells, Kent • The contrasts between the Catalan and Iraqi Kurdish independence referendums are unsettling. Catalonia is divided with as many people opposed to its separation from Spain as in support of it. Though Catalan as a language is distinct from Castilian Spanish, there is no great cultural or ethnic divide. The Spanish government sought legally, if harshly, to disrupt and undermine the vote. “No” voters largely stayed at home. And yet the Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont claims a mandate to unilaterally declare independence. By contrast, support for independence among Iraqi Kurds is rock solid, as it would be among the Kurds of Turkey, Syria and Iran, if they were ever to be asked. Also, there are deep ethnic and linguistic differences between the Kurds and their Arab and Turkish neighbours. So the Catalan nationalists on limited support and an illegitimate referendum are throwing Spain and the EU into crisis and may soon achieve independence, while the Kurds, the victims of repeated genocidal injustice, will just have to wait. It is time we stopped indulging Catalan, Scottish and other micro-nationalisms unsupported by any substantial ethnic difference, where demagogic politicians seek to split successful countries for personal glory and self-advancement. Otto Inglis Edinburgh • Surely the most sensible approach for Catalan separatists is to campaign for a change in the law before embarking on the referendum. After all, they must have known that the central government would declare the vote illegal. That means that whatever the outcome, no further legal action can be taken towards independence. It will be interesting to see what the Catalan government proposes. Will it declare independence? If not then what has all this posturing been about? Roy Hogg West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire • If Catalonia, like Scotland, wants to separate from its parent state then, instead of blaming the Spanish government for mishandling the current crisis (Editorial, 2 October), shouldn’t you be seeking the root cause of the problem in the paradoxical nature of the EU? The EU unites nations but, at the same time, it also carries within an incentive for break-up. Ambitious politicians belonging to various composites that make up the EU would always ask: why share your sovereignty with your national capitals and remain forever a “bridesmaid” when you have the option of becoming a “bride” by sharing your sovereignty with Brussels? The EU – its claim to unity notwithstanding – is seen by many as a potential wrecker of a “marriage of convenience” between Europe’s composite states. Perhaps, it is time the EU dealt with the problem and introduced a law, barring seceding states from ever becoming a member. Randhir Singh Bains Gants Hill, Essex • I am extremely disappointed by the coverage the British media has given to the Catalan so-called referendum, and by the reaction of many public figures in the UK. The constitutional tribunal of Catalonia, that is to say, the judiciary rather than the government, declared the vote as illegal and in contravention of the rule of law in Spain. The police therefore had no choice but to act. What happened in Catalonia on Sunday was the security forces policing a crime, and not the police preventing a vote and removing ballots, as you have presented it. It is critical to democracy that the rule of law is upheld and that the right to demonstrate, protest and exercise legal rights, which Catalan citizens have always had, is not confused with the right to break the law, which no citizen, in any democratic country, has. Santiago Dominguez Hereford • I will not talk about politics, nor about laws but I will talk about human rights. I just ask that for a moment let us all reflect on what happened. I am sure that no member of the Spanish government party will be able to sleep with a calm conscience for the rest of their lives. There is no doubt that political responsibility is shared by the Catalan and Spanish governments and probably a referendum five years ago would have left a high “no” independence result as a clear winner. But the assault on human rights of the Catalan people that we have seen is the sole responsibility of the Spanish government. I can only say that after what we have seen, Catalonia is increasingly far from Spain. We will never forget this. Vicente Sorribes Barcelona • The superstar footballers of FC Barcelona, Messi, Suárez et al, playing against Las Palmas in an empty, huge, Camp Nou was an oddly appropriate protest against the violent crackdown on the Catalan independence vote by the Spanish government (Lionel Messi helps Barcelona extend perfect start at empty Camp Nou”, 1 October). It made for a strangely evocative and ghost-like symbol of the authoritarian and paranoid actions by the government of Mariano Rajoy. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland • I am dismayed by the May government’s statement of reaction to developments surrounding the Catalan referendum. I have written to both the prime minister and the foreign secretary to express our disappointment. Gibraltar looks on with great trepidation under these circumstances, witnessing no steadfast, bulldog defence of freedom and democracy in government’s official statement on this important and signal occasion, and contrasting this (for veracity’s sake) with the oft-repeated British government’s “reassurances” to the people of The Rock contained in the preamble to the Gibraltar constitution. I therefore write to express a deep sense of disconcert, an expression of what has been an accumulated sense of disquiet represented to us over time following a years-long failure to demonstrate strong will and defence of our British Gibraltarian sovereign waters in the face of continuous and aggressive Spanish incursions.

This series seeks to redress that, by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers. No one study or journal can provide a definitive answer, but they can help offer some guidance. Some of the studies I will choose in these articles are iconic, some quirky, some are large scale, and some have a small sample size. But all of them look to help answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? We begin with a study on memory. Long-term learning How do our students learn? The ability to retain and recall information is central to improving memory, knowledge and learning. But do students know what works, and are they using the best strategies? In 2013, researchers from Kent State University, Duke University, University of Wisconsin and University of Virginia published a review of hundreds of studies to explore which strategies are most likely to lead to long-term learning. This study is one of the most thorough and comprehensive appraisals on strategies that students employ to improve their memory. It is often the first piece of psychological research that we recommend teachers read in our work advising schools on learning techniques. What are the main findings? Two techniques were rated as being very effective for improving long-term memory: Practice testing. This is where students have to generate an answer to a question. It can include past papers, multiple choice questions or doing practice essay answers. It’s a technique that has been extensively researched and is consistently found to be one of the most effective ways to improve learning. Distributed practice. Sometimes referred to as “spacing”, distributed practice involves doing little bits of work often instead of a lot all at once (ie cramming). Essentially, students remember more if they spread out their learning; for instance, one hour a day for eight days rather than eight hours in one day. Two techniques were found to be fairly effective strategies: Elaborative interrogation. Asking “why is this true?” or “why might this be the case?” helps students think about the material and make connections to previously learned information. However, this technique does require students to have a good base knowledge for it to work effectively. Interleaved practice. Interleaving is where students mix up either the types of problem or different subjects, so as to avoid “blocking” their time on just one type of question. This helps keep things fresh and makes it easier for students to identify similarities and differences between the materials they are studying. Finally, these two strategies were found to be not very helpful at all in improving students’ ability to recall information at a later date: Highlighting/underlining. Despite being the weapon of choice for many students, highlighting material often fails to lead to long-term learning. This is because it’s often done on autopilot, doesn’t help students make connections from previous learned material and doesn’t help them make inferences on what they are learning. By itself, highlighting is not the worst technique – it’s more a case of how students use it, with many excessively over-highlighting, making it more akin to colouring in. Rereading. Although students may feel that they have learned something if they can point to a whole chapter they’ve read, it may not be as beneficial as they think. This is because people sometimes end up skim-reading, which doesn’t require them to think very deeply about what it is they are looking at. Related research Numerous researchers from around the world have run studies that support these findings. For practice testing to be most effective, it has to be done at “low-stakes”, which means it isn’t increasing stress levels of students and isn’t used as a form of judgment on their abilities. Other research has supported the use of spacing out learning – found to be effective because it allows time for students to forget and relearn the material, which cements it into their long-term memory. What does this mean for the classroom? How can teachers use these findings? It will vary, of course, depending on the nature of your cohort and the subject you teach. But ideas include using the testing effect by setting up short quizzes at the start or end of a lesson. Meanwhile, look to revisit previous topics (distributed practice) – important now that students no longer do modular exams. We need to teach our students what does and doesn’t work. Each minute spent highlighting or re-reading is 60 seconds not spent doing something more effective. As the authors of this study state, “a premium is placed on teaching students content and critical-thinking skills, whereas less time is spent teaching students to develop effective techniques and strategies to guide learning… teaching students to use these techniques would not take much time away from teaching content and would likely be most beneficial if the use of the techniques was consistently taught across multiple content areas, so that students could broadly experience their effects on learning and class grades”.

As supermarkets suspend sales from the factory involved and Labour promises a parliamentary inquiry, some members of the food industry are sighing at the media’s obsession with the subject of poultry hygiene. But the subject will keep coming up, however much business wishes it away, because industrial chicken is one of the defining commodities of our era. Its cheapness comes at a high price. Meat production has quintupled in my lifetime, in large part thanks to the ubiquitous skinless factory chicken breast, and chicken accounts for around half of the meat we eat. At any one time there are more than twice as many chickens on Earth as humans – around 19 billion of them, bred to put on weight at turbocharged rates and mature in record time as uniform units of production that fit abattoir machinery. We have invented food Fordism – meat for the masses from the conveyor belt, no longer a luxury but an everyday ingredient. But, for all its apparent democratising possibilities, it is a commodity fraught with inescapable dilemmas. Intensive livestock production is one of the most significant drivers of climate breakdown. It contributes nearly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, rivalling the whole global transport sector. True, feedlot cattle leave a greater environmental footprint than poultry, but if you care about mitigating global warming, plant-based proteins are far better than intensively reared birds. Most of us in developed countries eat far more protein than we actually need for health, and most people could do more for the climate by cutting meat than giving up their car and plane journeys. As the world’s population grows, the question of how we produce enough to feed everyone becomes ever more urgent. Intensively reared livestock is an inefficient way of meeting needs. Previous calculations based on global averages from the 1970s found that farming an acre of decent land produced 20kg (45lb) of animal protein; the same acre given over to producing wheat yielded 63kg of protein. In developed countries, which use more agrochemicals, protein yields from grain are now six to eight times higher. The comparison is not direct because it does not measure livestock protein conversion efficiency per acre, but research published in 2013 looked at how much protein you get from animals per 100 grams of grain protein fed to them. The finding for chickens was 40 grams (35 for eggs, 10 for pork and 5 for beef). If the grain that is currently used to feed animals were fed directly to people, there might be just enough food to go round when population peaks. If instead we continue to spread our industrial meat habit to poorer countries, we’ll need three planets to feed the world. The ethical argument is overwhelming: we need to get back to thinking of meat as a luxury, to be enjoyed occasionally, if not entirely forsworn. The reason the sector is beset by repeated scandals is that it is economically unsustainable. Even leaving aside the big planetary questions, meat can only be this cheap if the price is paid elsewhere. The livestock revolution took off in the 1950s because of three factors: cheap energy, which allowed farmers to house animals indoors; cheap synthetic fertiliser, which produced surplus grain for concentrated feed; and the mass production of cheap drugs, particularly antibiotics – you can only keep large numbers of birds in close confinement if you have the means to control the disease that inevitably accompanies the practice. For centuries before that, farmers had been constrained in their production by how much their land could support. Chickens were fed waste and acted as scavengers of food and insects, allowed to range free so that they could eat food that would otherwise go unused, with the added advantage that they spread their manure as they went. The next leap forward for industrial chicken production came with the development of processing machinery in the 1960s – an engineering feat that automated the mass slaughter, plucking, eviscerating and cutting of birds in one continuous conveyor belt. Large numbers of workers are still needed to process chickens, but they are in low-skilled production-line jobs. All this slashed costs and allowed the populations of developed countries to consume meat in a completely new way. But now the consequences are coming home to roost. Energy is no longer cheap; nor is the grain needed for concentrated feed, despite agricultural subsidies. Some of the raw materials for fertiliser are running out globally. Frontline antibiotics needed for humans are losing their efficacy in large part because of overuse in farming. Supermarkets with their oligopolies of buying power have used cheap chicken as a weapon in their price wars and kept prices low, so that processors have to work on high volumes with low margins, despite the pressure of rising costs. The sector is highly concentrated, with just a few corporate players. Just five companies account for 90% of the birds slaughtered in Britain each week. The pressure to cut corners in factories and sweat capital-intensive machinery, leaving little time for cleaning, is intense. Food-borne illness caused by chicken is a stubborn problem. Meanwhile, if a supermarket wanted to go elsewhere to punish an errant supplier, it has little choice left. There’s plenty you could do to make it a more sustainable industry. You could slow the growing time and give birds more room on farms, using less engineered breeds that take 12 weeks, rather than just over a month to reach slaughter weight. That would help curb some of the cruellest aspects of the business, which see densely packed, overbred birds, prone to disease and bacterial infection, collapsing under their own weight. But that would cost more. In the factory you could slow the speed of the lines, so that cross-contamination of carcasses was less likely, and workers’ jobs less relentlessly tough and unpleasant, thus easing the pressure to break hygiene rules and making the sector more attractive to local staff. But that, too, would cost more. We know roughly how much more, since the top end of organic production already does these things, and a posh chicken from that sort of outlet is three to four times as expensive as a conventional supermarket one. But there are hardly votes in arguing we should pay that much for our chicken. Politicians dare not say it for fear of sounding Marie Antoinette-ish. But the price of cheap is too high, and we should probably be eating something else. • This article was amended on 12 October 2017 to clarify and augment the information about protein yields from grain and from animals fed with grain protein. • Felicity Lawrence is special correspondent for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/alys-fowler-time-wrap-warm-climate-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Time to wrap up your warm-climate plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/alys-fowler-time-wrap-warm-climate-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/alys-fowler-time-wrap-warm-climate-plants","fields":{"headline":"Time to wrap up your warm-climate plants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We all feel the onset of autumn: that first day you wish you had a scarf, or the evening you draw up a blanket around you on the sofa; or instinctively move to the sunny side of the street. It’s not just you – all those far from home in your garden are wishing they had a scarf, too. Globe artichokes, potted lemons, cannas, dahlias, pelargoniums, bananas, fuchsias, tree ferns and Melianthus major hail from warmer climes, and at best just about tolerate our winters; at worst they give up the ghost and haunt our springs with dead stems. All of these can take a few cold nights, but it’s the flux between temperatures, and wet and cold, that makes them sulk and then give up. No one wants wet feet that then freeze – it’s the quickest way to send the cells to mush – but while frosts come in many varieties, the killers tend to be those where repeat freezing is followed by rapid thawing. The larger plants (bananas, tree ferns and M. major) must be wrapped in situ. Dry bracken is excellent for packing around the stems; dry autumn leaves and straw work just as well. A chicken-wire cage will keep everything in place, as will fleece that’s been tied. An internet search for yuki-gakoi, which roughly translates as snow enclosure in Japanese, will teach you that there’s a fine art to winter wrapping, and that a little hat on top of whatever you want to protect is essential to keep rain and snow away from the crown of the plant. Traditionally, tender perennials such as cannas, dahlias and gladioli are lifted before the first frosts of autumn and stored, to be replanted in spring. The tubers and corms are dug and left to dry out for a few weeks in a greenhouse or a garage, and then packed in crates or pots with dry compost, leaf mould or sand, where they are stored until spring. This is an excellent method, but does require cold but frost-free storage. You cannot store the tubers in your house: it will be too warm and wake them from dormancy, where, with inadequate light, they exhaust themselves trying to grow. If you don’t have storage, your other option is to insulate the ground they are in. In sheltered gardens it’s possible to put a deep layer, several inches at least, of dry mulch (garden compost, leaf mould, straw or potting compost) that will insulate the soil from ground frosts. The trick is keeping this mulch dry, covering it with a cloche if necessary. Potted pelargoniums, citrus and pomegranates will need very sheltered conditions; sometimes it’s possible to get them through winter in the lee of the house with layers of fleece and polystyrene under the pots, but really they want to come indoors, which may entail drastic pruning. Porches, sunrooms and other cool rooms are best. A spot next to a radiator will cause them to drop all their leaves, as they rapidly dry out, and sulk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/03/chapman-brothers-jake-dino-bronze-suicide-vests-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:40:27Z","webTitle":"Chapman brothers' bronze suicide vests go on show in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/03/chapman-brothers-jake-dino-bronze-suicide-vests-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/03/chapman-brothers-jake-dino-bronze-suicide-vests-london","fields":{"headline":"Chapman brothers' bronze suicide vests go on show in London","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jake and Dinos Chapman, known for their pessimistic ruminations on human violence and barbarity, have filled a London gallery space with seven bronzes of suicide vests. The “life and death vests” are horrifyingly detailed and real, made from images found online, apart from one which was made from a Hollywood film prop. They were challenging works but also things of great beauty, said Craig Burnett, director of exhibitions at the BlainSouthern gallery. “When they came in, part of the surprise was how beautiful they are as objects, as sculptures,” he said. “I think the surface is beautiful, the form is beautiful – there is a kind of mundanity to the object itself … but, of course, there is an implied violence: it is an explosive device. “Beauty is a difficult word, it means a lot of different things … the way I’m using it now is in terms of a quality that is seductive; you want to look at it, you want to analyse it, you want to engage with it as an object.” The bronzes clearly address world events but the artists have declined to speak about the new works. Each bronze is being sold as a one-off, apart from the one based on a prop used in the Jackie Chan film Rush Hour, which the brothers bought from a movie props website. That comes in an edition of six. The Chapmans’ work is often a response to the work of other artists. In this case, they were inspired by Jeff Koons’ Aqualung from 1985, a buoyancy device which had been uselessly cast in bronze. Burnett said the suicide vests reminded him of walking into the Imperial War Museum. “There is always an engagement with violence and politics in [the Chapman brothers’] work, and I think when you walk in here there is a real sense of a memorial with the objects.” The vests are the brothers’ first work for BlainSouthern, having previously been with White Cube. Also on display are works that continue the Chapmans’ fascination with Francisco de Goya. Prints from Goya’s Disasters of War have been dramatically, sometimes hilariously, reworked by the brothers in collage, watercolour and glitter. • Jake and Dinos Chapman, the Disasters of Everyday Life, is at BlainSoutthern from 4 October until 11 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/02/john-oliver-donald-trump-puerto-rico-hurricane-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T14:32:51Z","webTitle":"John Oliver: Trump's response to Puerto Rico relief was 'horribly racist'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/02/john-oliver-donald-trump-puerto-rico-hurricane-relief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/02/john-oliver-donald-trump-puerto-rico-hurricane-relief","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver: Trump's response to Puerto Rico relief was 'horribly racist'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"John Oliver took aim at Donald Trump’s angry response to problems over hurricane relief in Puerto Rico, calling him “horribly racist”. During his HBO show Last Week Tonight, the comic played footage of Trump happy with what he saw as a successful first response. “How are you even trying to take a victory lap right now?” Oliver asked. The interview led to problems for the president, as many didn’t share his positivity. “Getting aid to a disaster zone is a huge challenge but Trump’s rosy assessment of success has been disputed by many on the ground, like San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who went on TV to plead for more aid and got a depressingly predictable response from the president,” he said. A flurry of tweets followed Cruz’s remarks. Trump claimed that there needed to be a greater effort from the Puerto Rican community and that the victims couldn’t expect everything to be done for them. “The primary obstacle to hurricane relief has been Puerto Rican laziness?” Oliver said. “You have got to hand it to Trump: anybody can say horribly racist things about Hispanic people on a golden escalator, but it takes real balls to do it while their fellow citizens are dying. Trump is basically saying: ‘When hurricanes are hitting our people, they’re not hitting our best, they’re killing poors, they’re killing lazies and some, I assume, have said nice things about me.’” The host said that this particular episode “came at the end of a week of embarrassments”. The Republican party had experienced yet another setback in its quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as the party’s latest bill failed to pass. During a live on-air interview, the president claimed that it was down to a senator who was in the hospital and was therefore unable to vote. This turned out not to be the case. Thad Cochran had been experiencing health issues, but he hadn’t been hospitalized. His office was forced to release a statement saying it was a urological issue. “The president’s lies became so frustrating that the only way to shut them down was to publicly discuss the fact that something may be wrong with Thad Cochran’s dick,” Oliver said. He continued: “The president just repeatedly said something that was not true, that was wrong. We just caught him in a lie.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/02/the-fiver-everton-ronald-koeman-uh-oh","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T15:25:48Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | With the crisis klaxon currently hooting around Goodison Park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/02/the-fiver-everton-ronald-koeman-uh-oh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/02/the-fiver-everton-ronald-koeman-uh-oh","fields":{"headline":"With the crisis klaxon currently hooting around Goodison Park","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"THE SEVENTH SIGN Like religion, politics and the best way to poach an egg, the subject of football can be a decidedly divisive one, sparking frank exchanges of views that regularly end in scenes of unseemly, outright violence. With debates about refereeing decisions, team selections and whether or not Lionel Messi could hack it on a wet night in Stoke regularly sundering relationships, there was until recently at least one thing everyone could agree on. Having seen them finish seventh in the Premier League before spending £140m on new talent during the summer, everyone with a passing interest in English football was unanimous in their belief that Everton would once again finish alone in their own little mini-league snuggled between sixth and eighth. Along with death and taxes, the Goodison Park outfit finishing seventh in the table next May was one of few certainties in life. But that was then and this is now … a decidedly unexpected “now” in which Ronald Koeman’s underwhelming collection of overpriced scampering midfield playmakers and Wayne Rooney have won just two of their first seven league matches and are licking their wounds after having their derrieres handed to them in their own back yard by Burnley. It was their fourth league defeat of the season and leaves them 16th, nine places below their allotted, carved-in-granite place in the pecking order. Trying to replace Romelu Lukaku was never going to be easy, but barely trying is beginning to look a rather monumental act of folly. With the crisis klaxon currently hooting around Goodison Park and Koeman reduced to praising the “effort” of his players for want of anything else to enthuse about, Everton’s majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has proffered the worrying vote of confidence that generally signals a manager is about to be ushered towards the door marked Do One. Through the medium of his confidante, broadcasting’s Jim White, Moshiri agreed that Everton fans deserved better, but that Koeman was not coming under pressure from upstairs. “We are in a bad moment,” he said, in a bespoke statement neatly embroidered on one of Jim’s old Deadline Day ties. “There is mental and physical fatigue and seven [knacks]. These are early days and Koeman has my total support. We have great fans and they deserve better. We know the honest and objective expectations of our supporters and will not let them down.” Translation: seventh it is, then and you can take that to the bank. While Everton fans are a reasonably patient bunch whose expectations are far from outlandish, many have voiced their irritation with Koeman’s comment that he saw plenty of reasons to be cheerful in the defeat by Burnley. “I am pleased with the performance of all the players,” he tooted. “What the team showed today was positive.” Meanwhile on Lazy Journalist Story Generator, he praised the “commitment” of his players in a tweet that could scarcely have spawned more outrage if it had been written by Katie Hopkins and endorsed the clubbing of baby seals. Brighton are up next and with the Goodison Park natives getting restless, another defeat could spark open revolt.

And Ghanaian ref Joseph Lamptey, banned for life over officiating that forced the South Africa v Senegal World Cup qualifier to be replayed, has offered his side of the story. “I can tell you that I felt deep pain after having done such an injustice against that country,” he sobbed. “I really love that country.

They shift uneasily. Gently, she answers her own question: “All of them are terms used for childless women … I’m a childless woman. And I’m here to tell you about my tribe – those one in five women without children hidden in plain sight all around you.” Day is involuntarily childless. She remembers the moment she realised she was definitely never going to be a mother. It was February 2009 and, at 44-and-a-half, she had left a bad long-term relationship and moved into a grotty London flat. “I was standing by the window, watching the rain make dusty tracks down the glass, when the traffic in the street below seemed to go silent, as if I’d put it on ‘mute’. In that moment, I became acutely aware of myself, almost as if I were an observer of the scene from outside my body. And then it came to me: it’s over. I’m never going to have a baby.” We now know that 20% of British women born, like Day, in the 1960s, turned 45 without having a child. The number is double that of their mother’s generation – we’ll have to wait for the next census in 2021 to find out whether the numbers rose or fell for women born in the 70s and 80s (and whether or not government statisticians revise the fertility cutoff point – the age at which it is assumed women will stop having children – to extend beyond 45). And yet, on that February afternoon eight years ago, Day could find nothing on the internet or in books about her painful, irreversible situation. When she typed “childless woman” into any search engine, she was directed to sites run by women who had elected to be “child-free” – “some of them saying really hateful things about how awful kids were”. She knew no one like her, and felt alone and frightened. There followed “four years of hell”: “My personality completely changed. There were loads of things I couldn’t deal with. I withdrew from all my relationships. I saw doctors, therapists – nobody knew what the matter with me was.” It’s fascinating to watch how conversations about uncomfortable, rarely discussed subjects begin to take root in the public domain. Almost always, they’re pushed into consciousness, not by academics or specialists, but by people who have been personally affected by the issues and find themselves reluctant champions of causes they still have difficulty admitting to. Day’s first blogpost – two years into her four-year hell – concerned what she called the Tunnel, “the experience I had at the end of my time to become a mother. It’s a non-specific time, every woman knows what I’m talking about, and it’s kind of when your life is narrowing down and down and down, and you feel as if you’re stuck in this tunnel.” The response was enormous. Her blog, Gateway Women, flourished into a huge online community, and then became a book for women struggling to find meaning in a life that was supposed to be filled with children. Now there are more than 100 free Gateway Meetup groups for involuntarily childless women in Britain and another 100 around the world, including in Switzerland, the US and India. Day runs workshops around the world for women struggling with childlessness, and is training to be a psychotherapist. Only very recently have other people started talking publicly for the first time about their involuntary childlessness. And, intriguingly, most of them are British, where the rate of childlessness among women over 45 is lower than in, say, Ireland (where one in four women born in the 1960s haven’t had children) or Germany (where the number is one in three). I talk to Lizzie Lowrie, who runs retreats for childless women and this year organised a “Mother’s Day Runaway” service at Liverpool Cathedral; to Stephanie Phillips, who set up World Childlessness Week two years ago (“Parents will say they are fed up waiting to be a grandparent. People need to stop saying ‘the clock is ticking’. There needs to be an acceptance that not everyone will be a parent, and that some people who aren’t need to grieve”); to Kirsty Woodard, founder, three years ago, of the organisation Aging Without Children, which supports and campaigns for older people who don’t have children. Woodard tells me that 1.2 million people over the age of 65 in the UK do not have children – a number that will double to 2 million by 2030: “Half of all older people live alone. The assumption by the government is that all older people have family who will help to look after them.” This Friday, as part of the 50+ festival in York, the shadow transport minister, Rachael Maskell MP, who doesn’t have children, will, for the first time, join a panel discussion on ageing without children. On the same afternoon, on the other side of the world, in Cleveland, Ohio, Day will be the keynote speaker for the Not Mom summit. Among many interesting observations made by its organiser, Karen Malone Wright, is her belief “that parents take for granted the many networking opportunities available to them. It’s similar to businesspeople who play golf. Parents bored at a PTA meeting or soccer game talk and connect, sometimes professionally.” May says that, in the workplace, “the one in five” are where the LGBT community were two decades ago, except that – proportionally – they’re far more numerous. “Companies conflate family- and female-friendly policies, and you often have situations where childless people are expected to pick up the slack when someone goes off on maternity leave. I think HR departments are going to start having to factor in the wants and needs of the childless.” This is a concept that’s likely to be baffling to some people, as one female blogger wrote in her review of a US book about childlessness: “In a world where there is war, disease, starvation, murder and divisiveness, being a childless old maid is pretty low on the scale of tragedies.” But who are the childless and how many of them wanted children? The closest we can come is a 2010 meta-analysis by the Dutch academic Prof Renske Keiser, which suggested that only 10% of childless women actively chose not to become mothers. That leaves 90% of women like Day. Only 9% of that 90% are childless for known medical reasons. If we take these figures at face value, it becomes all the more puzzling that involuntary childless women are so invisible. “I believe the main reason that the child-free are so much more visible online,” says Day, “is that they do not feel silenced by shame. Their child-freedom is a positive choice; one that they feel proud of and that helps them face down the stigma of being women without children. Childless women have to wade through grief to get to that place, and many of them remain stuck in it for decades, maybe even for their whole lives. I have certainly met and worked with women in their 70s who have never had a chance to move beyond their grief because of a lack of awareness or support.” Among those people who are involuntary childless is an even more invisible subset, and not a small one: men. In the late 90s, Robin Hadley, then 39, began to grapple with a paradigm shift in his own future life plans. Hadley had started a relationship with a woman a few years older than him. She had already accepted that she would remain childless, but Hadley had always wanted to be a dad. He had been deeply jealous when his best friend had started a family. And now, here he was – confronted by a last chance to have a baby. For Hadley, being childless by circumstance meant having made a decision to pursue a relationship where he knew children were off the agenda. “I know there are some men who prioritise their desire to be a dad over the desire to have a good relationship, but, for me, the relationship was more important.” He remains happily married and childless. “The pain of childlessness comes in waves. I have friends who are becoming grandparents, and the same feelings you had when they started having kids resurface.” Hadley’s painful situation ended up redirecting his professional interests. He wanted to know more about how men like him felt about fatherhood – “and I was stunned. There’s just nothing out there at all.” (It’s startling, for example, that the Office for National Statistics only collects data on how many women have children.) A technical photographer, he began to retrain as a counsellor. He did an MA (his thesis was on how the desire for fatherhood affects men), then got funding to start a PhD on life without fatherhood. He advertised in the back of the Oldie magazine for men who would be willing to speak anonymously about how they would have liked to have been a dad (“getting men to speak about it is almost impossible, even privately”). The 15 men he interviewed at length were between the ages of 49 and 82. They had become childless through fertility problems, bad timing, the lack of a suitable partner and bad relationships. One man had been written off by his spouse as “not dad material”; other men had partners whose fear of giving birth was so intense that the couple decided to remain childless. “Men don’t say ‘bereaved’ or ‘lost’, like their female counterparts might,” he says. “They’re more likely to say, ‘I feel my life’s off track’, or ‘something’s missing’. And behind that little word ‘missing’ there is a universe of thoughts, feelings, desires, fears and what-ifs.” Childless men, he says, are seen as weak and objects of deep suspicion: “If you don’t have children as a man, you are basically saying you are a failure as a reproductive human being. There’s a feeling that you’re a threat, that you could be a paedophile and that you shouldn’t be around children at all.” He thinks that research into male infertility and public discussion of it is so meagre because it makes men look feeble and our culture doesn’t allow that. Hadley says the assumption that men can have children whenever they want to ignores the “social clock” – the “what your peers are doing” factor. “To men, it’s as important as the biological clock. Yes, there are people such as Rod Stewart having kids in their 60s, but they really are the exceptions. Men have said to me: “It wouldn’t be right for me to have children when I’m 50 or 60. I don’t want to look like their grandad at the school gates.” (There are also, of course, biological factors that might affect men’s choices about when to procreate – fertility decreases for men with age, too.) Hadley, who undertook his research for personal reasons, is almost alone in Britain in having gone on the record about this complex, hidden predicament for men. However, a pair of film-makers are now attempting to crowdfund a documentary, entitled The Easy Bit, in which men will speak publicly about their experience of being involuntary childless and the lack of support around the issue. To date, they have raised £1,000 of their £10,000 target. By the time she was 33, Lizzie Lowrie (now 37) had had six miscarriages. Married to a trainee vicar and living in Cambridge at the time, her social environment, she says, was “like a baby factory. It was possibly the worst environment for someone who couldn’t have children.” She once hid in a bike shed to avoid the other vicars’ wives and their children. “My biggest nightmare was to have that life; of not being a mother. I had always imagined that I’d have had children by the time I was 35, and, as the day got closer, I had no idea how to handle it. I didn’t know how I was going to survive. Not being able to have children is the most difficult experience of my life. I have come a long way. I know now that I don’t need a child to have a life of purpose, but the desire to have a child – that never goes away. I’m not as ashamed of it as I was at first.” Lowrie and her husband set up a blog, Saltwater and Honey, with another childless couple because “there is so much online about people’s experiences, but the majority are really unhelpful. People usually only share their story when it has a happy ending. When you don’t have the happy ending, you need to know someone’s there with you in [feeling] that pain.” This year, in Liverpool Cathedral, she and the Rev Sonya Dorah held a service on the evening before Mothering Sunday for people who, like them, had not been able to have biological children. Dorah, who wrote the liturgy and now has three adopted children, contracted chlamydia when she was raped, aged 17, leaving her infertile. She says of the service: “It was an amazing day. The kind of thing where you think: why hasn’t this always existed? Why have childless people never been acknowledged? We had about 80 people in the cathedral – men and women – and we’re thinking of doing others. There are markers in the year that are particularly difficult for the involuntary childless: Christmas, Valentine’s Day, the kids going back to school at the beginning of the academic year. There’s also a feeling – that I believe is wrong – that you don’t know love unless you have had a child. I know other vicars who are childless and don’t hold the baby at christenings because it’s too painful for them.” There are many dozens of reasons people become involuntarily childless. Day has described some of them in her post, Fifty Ways Not to Be a Mother, “but I could easily go up to 100,” she says – the list includes “being single and unable to find a suitable relationship from your mid-30s onwards” and “having your ovaries damaged by chemotherapy”. It’s the most-visited page on her site, alongside advice on how to respond to the “Do you have children?” question and the almost comically inappropriate responses childlessness can provoke in other people: “Everything happens for a reason,” is in the Top 5, though Lowrie’s Spanish teacher topped that when “she offered to carry a baby for me on Facebook”. It’s noticeable, in the comments section of Day’s blog, how often it’s mothers, not fathers or other childless women, who most frequently cause upset or offence among people who have not been able to have children. “Motherhood is almost like an idol that is worshipped,” says Lowrie. “A lot of women who can’t have children find their relationships with female friends and their mothers are really affected. Being childless is a very complex form of grief. Day to day, it’s still painful. The desire to have a child is still there. I have friends I’m no longer close to because all they talk about is children or being a mother.” She tries to get them to embrace the other aspects of their lives because, if they don’t, what does that say about them or her? “Surely a mother is more than someone who has children? And I’m more than someone who doesn’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/02/tesco-executives-court-directors-sfo","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T19:38:31Z","webTitle":"Former Tesco executives were warned of profits hole, court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/02/tesco-executives-court-directors-sfo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/02/tesco-executives-court-directors-sfo","fields":{"headline":"Former Tesco executives were warned of profits hole, court told","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three former Tesco directors were repeatedly warned by their juniors that the UK chain was facing a multimillion-pound hole in their profits and yet they carried on “conniving and manipulating figures” rather than admitting to the problem, a court has heard. Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, and Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, have all been charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The allegations relate to Tesco’s accounting records after a public announcement to the stock market on 22 September 2014, stating that it had previously overestimated profits by about £250m. The announcement sent “shockwaves” through the market, Southwark crown court in London has heard. The Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014. The three men deny any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty. Sasha Wass QC, a lawyer for the Serious Fraud Office, told the court that members of Tesco’s UK finance and commercial teams had repeatedly made clear that the they were going to fall short of expected profit targets as they faced a competitive market. By the end of June 2014, Wass said the hole in the accounts was “spiralling out of control and yet [the three directors] were refusing to deal with it”. She said: “Attempts to persuade them to lower the targets had been unsuccessful and the defendants carried on conniving and manipulating the figures.” Wass said the defendants “must have been fully aware of the damaging effect this practice was having on the financial health of the company and, more particularly, its shareholders”. But she said they had become “like a little hamster running around on a wheel” as the problems “snowballed in size each year”. Wass said that it was clear Rogberg was a “major driving force” together with Bush in covering up the accounting hole, as both insisted that the profit targets must be met despite poor performance. Wass said Rogberg was asked by Tesco’s then chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, who will later give evidence, whether there would be any difficulty in meeting the projected profits for the first half of 2014. She said Rogberg claimed there was not a problem and dismissed colleagues’ suggestion of a shortfall as being based on a misunderstanding. Wass told the court this was a “barefaced lie”. She said all three directors were well aware of the problems but refused to change the profit target. Employees described the runup to the posting of Tesco’s half-year results, known every year as “diving for the line”, as “frenetic” in August 2014. Wass said that their juniors had the legitimate options to meet the “unrealistic” targets of using “unpalatable” tricks such as increasing prices for shoppers and short-term promotions. But she said the illegitimate practice of “pull forward” had also developed, which was “effectively misreporting income in an earlier period to the period it was actually earned”. This income was earned in payment from suppliers rather than money through the till and so was difficult for Tesco’s auditors to monitor. The jury was told the practice “was contrary to proper accounting standards and principles”. The trial, expected to last for 13 weeks, continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/03/campaign-urges-people-to-recycle-dead-batteries","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T05:45:19Z","webTitle":"Campaign urges people to recycle dead batteries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/03/campaign-urges-people-to-recycle-dead-batteries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/03/campaign-urges-people-to-recycle-dead-batteries","fields":{"headline":"Campaign urges people to recycle dead batteries","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Major high street retailers have joined forces to encourage people to recycle their used household batteries as a new poll revealed that more than half of respondents admitted they throw them in the bin. Asda, B&amp;Q, Currys PC World, Marks &amp; Spencer and Morrisons are all backing the drive to make it easier for consumers to recycle dead batteries and avoid millions ending up in landfill every year and wreaking environmental havoc. Retailers who sell more than 32kg of batteries a year are already required to provide collection points, yet they are not always visible. Those backing the new campaign have committed to making sure these facilities are easy to spot in store. A poll of 3,055 UK adults by environmental charity Hubbub and compliance scheme Ecosurety revealed that less than half of those surveyed (47%) realised that batteries are made of valuable heavy metals which can be reused, including lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc, manganese and lithium. The toxic contents mean that they can be hazardous to the environment if not disposed of properly, yet half of respondents (52%) admitted throwing batteries away in the regular waste bin. This results in millions every year ending up in landfill, with the potential to leach into the ground and water supplies if not carefully managed. In addition the research found that six in 10 people in the UK hoard batteries in their homes, adding up to a whopping 178m batteries stashed, despite the dangers to children. Dead batteries are currently shipped to be recycled in Finland, Germany and France, although the first UK plant will open in Scotland in November. That will be able to process 20,000 tonnes of batteries a year – enough capacity to deal with all the UK’s current batteries. However there are concerns that the drive to replace petrol and diesel cars with a new breed of electric vehicles will raise a fresh environmental headache – the fate of half-tonne lithium-ion batteries when they wear out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/shortcuts/2017/oct/02/young-tories-gone-conservatives-on-side-of-rich","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T12:29:59Z","webTitle":"Where have all the young Tories gone?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/oct/02/young-tories-gone-conservatives-on-side-of-rich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/oct/02/young-tories-gone-conservatives-on-side-of-rich","fields":{"headline":"Where have all the young Tories gone?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Young Tories. Age: 18 to 29. Appearance: all but invisible. You mean they walk among us in disguise? No, there just aren’t very many left. What happened to all those young Conservatives of yesteryear, braying and dancing in Union Jack cummerbunds? They became old Conservatives. And what about the next generation of Tories? Where are they? They’ve failed to materialise. Where once about 32% of 18- to 29-year-olds supported the Conservatives, these days it’s more like 21%. That’s a big drop. The younger you go, the worse the numbers look: according to a recent poll, only 15% of 18- to 24-year-olds think the Tories represent “people like me”. What lies behind this shift? Young people increasingly think the Conservative party is on the side of the rich rather than the poor, and the homeowner rather the renter. Well, duh. The reasons may be obvious, but it’s still a big problem for the Tories – their ageing base is dying off, and the under-30s are all Corbynistas. What are they going to do about it? They did just announce a cap on tuition fees. But Corbyn has promised to scrap tuition fees. Give them a break – they can’t suddenly introduce a bunch of policies that appeal to young people. Why not? They’re Tories. Oh yeah. Any other strategies? In August they launched a rough equivalent of Labour’s Momentum movement called Activate, “an independent national grassroots campaign organisation that seeks to actively engage young people in right-of-centre politics”. How’s that working out? The initiative was widely mocked. They also held a Big Tent Ideas Festival two weeks ago in Berkshire, which was quickly labelled Tory Glastonbury. Who was the headliner? Bach, apparently. Well, there was a violinist anyway. Did they come up with any Big Tent Ideas? MP James Cleverly said at the event that the party should “be doing the right things for the right reasons rather than trying to be cool and popular and saying whatever thing is going to get good headlines or a big cheer at Glastonbury”. Now that’s a slogan. It’s a bit long for a T-shirt. Might work on a mug.

I’d had some minor injuries; I fell off a tightrope once and sprained my ankle, but that’s all a part of working in circus. On this occasion, I drove from London to a show in Manchester with two of my fellow performers. We always allow plenty of time for travel, but there was an accident and roadworks so we ended up running late. The venue was a huge park and finding where we had to be took ages. When we finally got there, we had only 10 minutes to get changed, put on our makeup and set up our equipment for our fire show, a process that usually takes about an hour. Normally, we set up our own fire equipment, but other performers were helping because we had such little time. We set up our safety equipment – wet blankets and fire extinguishers. Despite the rush, we were all pretty chilled – I’d done this show many times before. In the finale I use a fire whip, a long, tapered rope that lights up when soaked in paraffin and lit, and creates an explosion when cracked. But I hadn’t prepared the whip myself. When I do it, I quickly run it through the paraffin so it’s wet but not soaked. Unfortunately, the performer who prepared it didn’t know how to, so it was soaked with paraffin. I didn’t realise anything was wrong when I first picked up the whip – it might have been slightly heavier, but it’s not something you’d necessarily notice. I spun the whip above my head and some drops of flaming paraffin fell on to the back of my shirt. One of the other performers gave me a look to say “Something is wrong”, and I realised my shirt was on fire. We use a professional flame-retardant on all our costumes, but it only makes things flame resistant – nothing is ever fireproof. I patted the flames down, dropped the whip and thought that I’d put the fire out, but then my shirt roared back into flames. Normally we brief event staff before a show so that one of them can be waiting by the stage with a wet blanket just in case, but on this occasion we hadn’t had time. At that point, I ran off the stage and rolled on the wet blankets we had laid out. Extinguishing the fire only took about 10 seconds, but that was enough to give me severe burns from my waist up to my neck. There was an intense aching all over my back and it felt like the pain was encompassing my whole body. There were lots of children in the audience, so I felt a duty to come back on stage. We finished the minute or so that was left, using the fire whip but being careful not to do any overhead moves, then we took a bow. I waved to the audience with a smile and a shrug to show these things happen, but I was in an overwhelming amount of pain. We had some basic first aid by the stage, so I took off my shirt, but bits of it were stuck to my back. I was taken to an ambulance and when we got to A&amp;E I found out I had first-, second- and third-degree burns over most of my back. The pain was so great, I thought I would pass out. They gave me morphine, and cleaned and dressed the wound, and I had a month of treatment to heal the skin and prevent infection. Despite the pain, I was back performing with fire three days after the accident. I was careful, and actually it’s easy to suck it up and get through short bursts of activity; it was more painful sitting in the car travelling to the events. I used Bio-Oil for several months after the accident, so the scarring isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Although this accident was caused by us being rushed, it’s ultimately the safety measures we did take – laying out wet blankets and treating our clothes – that prevented something that could have been much worse. Following the incident, I won’t perform unless I’m 100% happy that all of our safety requirements have been met to my satisfaction. It would be nice to think you could avoid every accident, but the truth is, if it wasn’t dangerous, it wouldn’t be circus. • As told to Katie Antoniou Do you have an experience to share?

The campaign has led to the detention of up to 10 popular clerics – the biggest mass arrest of its kind in the kingdom’s recent history. It follows a failed recent attempt to end the three-month feud between Riyadh and its tiny neighbour, which has defied calls to sever links with the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran, whom the oil-rich state and its allies in the Gulf view as subversive threats. The clampdown also comes amid ongoing speculation that Prince Mohammed is positioning himself for an ascension to the throne, perhaps as early as the first half of next year. The claim has been strongly denied by the royal court. However, figures close to the seat of power insist that plans have been made for an accession – but on terms to be set by the incumbent monarch, King Salman, the crown prince’s father. The arrests of the clerics – and recent departure from Saudi Arabia of high-profile dissenters – come after a campaign launched in June against Qatar by Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates, which has since led to an air, land and sea blockade, trade sanctions and a series of demands that have so far not been met. At the same time, Mohammed bin Nayef, the senior royal family member ousted by Prince Mohammed as crown prince, remains in effect under house arrest, while other senior princes have been prevented from travelling. Senior figures inside Saudi Arabia say the crackdown is aimed at sidelining influential clerics who the royal court believes have been muted in their support for the stance against Qatar, which some senior officials believe has exposed the limits of Saudi power, rather than showcasing its strength. “This [crackdown] needs to be viewed through the prism of Qatar primarily,” said one senior figure. “But it’s also about eliminating any other potential rival power bases on the home front for an eventual ascendancy to the top job. He remains wary of anyone connected to Mohammed bin Nayef, or the old guard.” The country’s top religious body and state media supported the arrests, with the latter accusing the clerics of being aligned to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Security Directorate said it had arrested people who were aligned to “foreign powers”. A poet, a university professor and a well-known businessman were also among those detained. However, attention has focused on the clerics Salman al-Odah, Awad al-Qarni and Ali al-Omari, all of whom have extensive reach in Saudi society, where they have attracted millions of social media followers. Salman al-Odah alone has more than 14 million Twitter followers. “It is a big risk to take these people on in such a way, but the 32-year-old crown prince has got authority from [the king] to do what he wants,” the senior figure said. “He demands total loyalty and will get rid of anyone who he thinks doesn’t offer that.” The ageing monarch gave his son a broad remit to transform the oil-dependent Saudi economy and partially reform its society when he moved Mohammed bin Nayef aside on 21 June. The centrepiece of the planned economic reforms is a selloff of 5% of Aramco, the state-owned oil conglomerate, which is thought to be the world’s biggest company. Investors in the Gulf and in London say contingency plans are being made for a delay to the initial public offering of Aramco, which, if true, would be a significant setback for the ambitious leader. Robust foreign policy moves, such as a war in Yemen, and the Qatar standoff are also yet to yield results. “He needs to make things happen,” said a second insider of Prince Mohammed. “If he doesn’t he may be seen as weakened by his rivals. He doesn’t want that. His inner circle has been telling him that now is the moment to go for the top job. The king is disengaged and doesn’t want to be bothered, so he is doing all he can to shore up power. He runs the risk of overreaching.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/16/christian-candy-developer-brother-nick","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Christian Candy reshuffles assets worth more than £300m in a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/16/christian-candy-developer-brother-nick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/16/christian-candy-developer-brother-nick","fields":{"headline":"Christian Candy reshuffles assets worth more than £300m in a year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The controversial property mogul Christian Candy, whose luxury developments attracted some of the highest prices ever paid for London real estate, has sold and mortgaged assets worth an estimated £340m in less than a year. The sum is a significant part of the £600m joint fortune Christian and his elder brother and business partner, Nick, disclosed to a British court last year. A trawl through the land registry, property websites and news reports suggests that eight homes and developments have been sold, borrowed against or placed on the market between July 2016 and June of this year. They include a villa on the French Riviera, a penthouse above the Plaza Hotel in New York, and a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in London with a swimming pool and staff quarters. Known as the “brothers bling” for their private jet, their yachts and collections of Swiss watches and sports cars, the Candys were the poster boys for London’s super-luxe real estate boom. Their developments, including One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, attracted oligarchs, Nigerian petro-bosses and Middle Eastern royals. But the five-year high-end property rush has stalled, with too many competing developments and an oil price slump curbing interest from potential buyers. Christian Candy, it seems, has decided to cash in some of his chips. “Players at this level often shuffle their chess pieces around,” said property agent and market commentator Henry Pryor. “The market, even for the Candy brothers, is no longer as sweet as it was a couple of years ago – but, having enjoyed some of the most impressive returns over the years, they can probably weather a modest downturn.” However, the disposals have prompted legal letters from the businessman Mark Holyoake, who is suing the brothers for £132m in damages after they fell out over a loan. The trial was held in February and March, and judgment in the case is expected in October. Many of the transactions took place during and after the trial. Holyoake’s solicitors wrote to the Candys in July threatening to ask for a court ruling to freeze their assets. Such an order would prevent the brothers from making any further disposals. However, Holyoake has yet to take any such action. His spokesman said: “We are extremely concerned at the level of recent Candy property disposals in the UK and abroad. Mr Holyoake and his legal team are currently investigating these issues as a matter of urgency and will not hesitate to take appropriate action if assets are being dissipated.” The Candys declined to comment on the disposals and dismissed Holyoake’s concerns as misplaced and without foundation. They have fully defended the claims brought by Holyoake and expect to be successful in their defence. They say their remaining assets would, after the disposals, be sufficient to cover any penalty were Holyoake’s case to succeed. Loans have been taken out against properties, including a two-floor penthouse in block D at One Hyde Park, where security measures include iris scanners and SAS-trained guards. The proprietor is a company registered at the Guernsey address used by Christian Candy’s CPC Group. In July 2016, it raised a mortgage from the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, according to the title deed, which states that the bank is under obligation to “make further advances”. This June, Christian Candy was reported to be under contract to sell his three-floor Plaza penthouse for just under $40m (£31m). The property, which occupies the attic floors of a famous New York hotel once owned by Donald Trump, was acquired for $25m in 2012 and, after a revamp, was placed on the market a year later with a price tag of $59m. A buyer was found after a decision to drop the price earlier this year, according to reports. In May, Villa l’Horizon in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, one of the most expensive locations on the French Riviera, was sold to an undisclosed buyer – for nearly 30% less than the original €35m (£31m) asking price. Hugh House on Eaton Square was refinanced in March with Swiss bank UBS. It appears to have been put up for sale and then withdrawn. Once the property of Lily Safra, widow of billionaire banker Edmond Safra, it was marketed at £45m by the estate agent Savills, according to an advert which states it has now been “removed by the agent”. Clermont Trust (Switzerland) SA, which appears to be a Geneva-based wealth manager, is now named as the proprietor of three other addresses. A large property at Cornwall Terrace, used by Christian as his London family home, has been transferred to Clermont for just over £39m according to a land registry entry from December 2016. The Swiss group is also named on the title deeds of two associated houses at Cornwall Terrace Mews: one was acquired for £2m, and the other, valued at £1.2m, previously belonged to Christian Candy’s wife Emily Crompton. Finally, the Financial Times reported in June that the Duke’s Lodge development was for sale. The 1930s mansion block was bought for £85m, according to the title deed, and Christian Candy’s CPC Group obtained planning permission to refurbish the building as luxury flats. Rather than developing the property itself, CPC is now reported to be seeking buyers at a discounted £75m. In 2016, a judge imposed restrictions on disposals by the Candys. He forbade them from selling assets worth more than £1m without notifying Holyoake first, after deciding there was “risk of dissipation” ahead of the damages trial, which took place in the high court in February and March of this year. The judge later varied the restriction significantly, including allowing for no notice on “transactions in the ordinary and proper course of business”. In October the court of appeal decided the notification order should be completely lifted, with a judge concluding there was “insufficient evidence showing a real risk of dissipation”. The properties 1. One Hyde Park Penthouse D, London – valued at £120m in 2011, was refinanced in July 2016 according to the land registry 2. Plaza Penthouse, New York – reported in June 2017 to be under contract with a buyer at just under $40m 3. Hugh House, London – mortgaged in March 2017, advertised for sale at £45m 4. Villa L’Horizon, Cap-Ferrat – the French Riviera villa was originally marketed at €35m, but reported in May to have been sold for €25m 5. Cornwall Terrace, London – Britain’s “most expensive terraced house”, overlooking Regent’s Park, was bought for £35m in 2012. In February of this year it was recorded as transferred to Clermont Trust (Switzerland) SA, at a value of £39m. 6. Cornwall Terrace Mews – Originally in the name of Emily Crompton, Christian’s wife, the property was transferred in February 2017 to Clermont Trust for £1.2m. 7. Cornwall Terrace Mews – a second mews house associated with the main property at Cornwall Terrace was transferred to Clermont Trust for £2m in January 2017. 8. Duke’s Lodge, London – The 1930s mansion block in Holland Park was bought for £85m in 2015, and refinanced with a loan from Credit Suisse in February 2017. A newspaper report says it is now on the market for £75m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/lab-grown-meat-fish-feed-the-world-frankenmeat-startups","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T15:40:08Z","webTitle":"Could lab-grown fish and meat feed the world – without killing a single animal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/lab-grown-meat-fish-feed-the-world-frankenmeat-startups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/20/lab-grown-meat-fish-feed-the-world-frankenmeat-startups","fields":{"headline":"Could lab-grown fish and meat feed the world – without killing a single animal?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The broad avenues that lie south of Market Street in San Francisco are dotted with the headquarters of famous tech firms, from Uber and Airbnb to BitTorrent and Dropbox. Grand arts and civic buildings sit incongruously among office blocks, huddles of the city’s homeless and hip shared workspaces in which tech entrepreneurs and scientists plug away at their ideas to change the world. One such workspace houses Finless Foods, a company growing fish flesh in their laboratory, aiming to feed the 5,000 and then some without needing to kill a single animal. It was founded in 2016 by university buddies Mike Selden and Brian Wyrwas, bright-eyed biochemists in their mid-20s who are on a mission to save the oceans and bring affordable, contaminant-free fish to the masses. Finless Foods is the first firm to enter the race to take cellular agriculture – meat grown outside of animals – to market with marine, as opposed to land animals. In 2013, the godfather of what is also known as cultured or in-vitro meat, Professor Mark Post from Maastricht University, unveiled the first ever cultured beefburger - no livestock required. It was dry and anaemic, but, says Post, “it showed it could be done.” Three years later, San Francisco startup Memphis Meats delivered a succulent beef meatball, following up this year with fried chicken and duck a l’orange. Meanwhile, Hampton Creek foods (also in San Francisco) are boldly promising they will be selling cultured poultry as soon as the end of next year. Selden and Wyrwas’s lab was only established in March 2017, and as Selden says, “Fish cell culture was really not a thing. Human cell cultures - we do that all the time and there’s all sorts of papers on animal culture, but for fish, Brian had to invent a protocol to do that.” Yet by the end of our first conversation I am invited to taste their first prototype. “We’re small but we’re moving very quickly, and so are the investors,” says Selden, with the robotic urgency of someone who dedicates every waking hour to their vocation. He bristles at the phrases “Frankenmeat” and “lab-grown meat”, insisting that “they’re not fair or accurate”. He makes his point by comparing the process of culturing meat cells to another passion of his: brewing beer. That hallowed, ancient process tends to happen in giant, sterile, sealed fermenters, which are not unlike the bioreactors that will be used for culturing meat in industrial quantities. Trusty beer, he points out, “is often prototyped in a facility that looks like a laboratory: it’s white, everyone’s wearing lab coats and gloves, and is using lab equipment. So if we’re lab-grown meat, then beer is lab-grown beer. We’re not going to have armies of scientists sitting over petri dishes forever.” The technology for culturing animal cells was originally developed for medical use; in fact Post, whose early burger attempt was funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, had a background in repairing heart tissue. An early attempt by academics to culture fish (the results of which were published in 2002) tested the processes as a potential renewable protein source for astronauts embarking on a four-year schlep to Mars. Brin’s motivation to jumpstart the path to cultured meat was simple: “There are three things that can happen going forward. One is we will all become vegetarian – I don’t think that is really very likely. The second is we ignore the issues, and that leads to continued environmental harm. And the third option is we do something new.” Other high-profile investors include Kimbal Musk (brother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk), Bill Gates, Richard Branson and traditional meat and agriculture corporations such as Tyson Foods. A representative from Tyson, the world’s second largest processor of chicken, beef and pork, informed me by email that the move is “part of its overall strategy to invest in solutions to feed a growing world population”. The principle for culturing cells is relatively straightforward. Animal cells can be obtained harmlessly by biopsy from a living beast, or in the case of Finless, says Selden, “We have an agreement with the aquarium at the bay that whenever a fish dies, they call me and I jump in a car, pick up the fish, bring it back and Brian cultures it up.” By “culturing up” he means feeding the cells in a solution of salts, carbohydrates and proteins. “Typical division time for most animals is about 24 hours,” he says. Whether you’ve got two cells or two tonnes, you’ll have double a day later, although this may get faster. The greatest challenge lies in making the process affordable enough to scale-up production and be competitively priced. An alternative needs to be found for the animal serum – commonly foetal bovine serum – that’s currently used to kick-start cell division. “It’s about $500 a litre, and it’s totally against the mission of our company,” says Selden. “We’re trying to make food that doesn’t harm animals and it’s kind of doing the opposite. Also, animal serum is variable from batch to batch.” I visit Finless Foods’ lab ahead of the prototype tasting. They’re moving to new bespoke quarters later this year, but in the meantime share a workspace with various young companies developing biotech solutions to the world’s problems. We pass Clara Foods, which has created the world’s first animal-free egg, and a centrifuge whizzing around something to do with regenerating “the nipple-areolar complex” for women after mastectomies. Senior scientist at Finless, Jihyun Kim, proudly invites me to peer through her microscope at fish cells developing in a beaker of clear, pink liquid resembling the run-off from defrosting pork. A pattern has formed on the bottom of the beaker – the slightest sliver of fish. It doesn’t look appetising, but neither do the contents of an abattoir. Selden, Post and the other cultured meat startups exude confidence about solving the serum puzzle: with venture capitalists to keep sweet, and stiff competition, a certain swagger must be displayed at all times. The serum provides proteins called growth factors. “We’re trying to find which growth factors are most important for fish cell growth,” says Selden, “and we’re making those ourselves in-house.” They produce them in a similar way to how human insulin is made for people with diabetes. Up until 1978, medical insulin was extracted from ground pig or cow pancreases. These days we can genetically modify yeast or bacteria to produce human insulin. Similarly, the serum alternative will involve putting fish DNA inside yeasts, “which then act as little protein factories”. Selden assures GMO haters that this doesn’t mean the meat cells are GM, “but they used proteins produced by a GMO to signal them into dividing and growing.” At Finless Foods they say they’ll have a blue-fin tuna product ready for market in late 2019. Post is more conservative; he says he is happy with his product, but is at least three years from selling one. As well as working on his own serum alternative, he is seeking to replace the bovine collagen he uses “so the cells can find each other and form a fibre.” Hi-tech, plant-based protein alternatives, meanwhile, are starting to give meat a run for its money. Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat makes chicken strips largely from a protein in peas, and beefburgers that bleed beetroot juice. After Bill Gates tried a Beyond Chicken taco, he blogged about being fooled into thinking it was the real thing. Meanwhile the Impossible burger exploded out of Silicon Valley and is available in restaurants across the US. It is uncannily beef-like, oozing cholesterol-free fat and pink through the middle. Impossible’s not-so-secret ingredient is heme, a compound that is abundant in meat but can be sourced from plants. According to Impossible’s blurb, heme is what makes “meat sizzle, bleed and taste gloriously meaty.” But in the eyes of the cultured meat trailblazers, fancy vegetarian food will never have mass appeal. Demand for meat, and fish, is only going one way. “The question is, which product can satisfy the craving of the population for meat?” posits Post. “At the moment it’s there and it’s increasing ... culturing is going to cover the entire gamut of meats that are out there. It will be much more difficult to achieve that goal with vegetable-based proteins.” This is a sentiment the Chinese government has got behind, announcing a $300m investment in cultured meat produced in Israel. The US may be among the world’s most carnivorous nations, but as China’s economy swells, the planet’s most populous country is catching up. Hampton Creek is a little different. The company already produces a range of plant-based vegan foods. Their “Just” branded mayonnaise, dressings and cookies is delicious. As we perch on stools in the industrial open-plan, dog-friendly office and test kitchen, CEO Josh Tetrick tells me his life mission is to transform the food industry by testing the culinary properties of all plants. He has a storeroom housing endless shelves of white tubs of ground-seeds, and lab machines that use AI to “find plants as fast as we can that we can make better products from”. I taste a “scrambled egg” prototype made from a substance found in a variety of mung bean. It’s surprisingly good. So why isn’t he making plant-based meat alternatives? “I can’t imagine the people I was raised with in Birmingham Alabama under any scenario choosing a plant-based hamburger ... it’s an identity thing.” Tetrick is a controversial figure. He recently fired three top executives who he claimed were planning a coup and when we meet, he is plotting to control the cultured meat industry, buying up patents across the globe. He admits, however, that the road to public acceptance of cultured meat is paved with “gnarly problems, communication issues, regulatory issues.” When you tell people about growing animal muscle and fat cells in factories, the initial reaction is invariably revulsion. But after you point out the ethical and health benefits, they warm to the prospect. Cultured meat doesn’t involve intensively farming and slaughtering animals, nor the associated environmental and animal-cruelty costs, not to mention the risks of human contamination with disease, antibiotics, pesticides and – in the oceans – mercury and plastics. Fish farming, which accounts for over half of global fish consumption, increasingly relies on pesticides, fungicides and antibiotics, which pollute open water surrounding the captive fish. Aquaculture also employs inhumane methods to physically detach parasites from the fish. Farmed fish are not even immune to absorbing mercury and toxic industrial byproducts such as PCBs and dioxins, although being in shallower water reduces their exposure. This is why companies such as Hampton Creek and Memphis Meats are referring to their produce as “clean meat”, and it’s catching on: clean meat, clean conscience. However, research into public attitudes to cultured meat, published in January in the peer-reviewed journal Plos One, found that while politically liberal consumers were more receptive to the idea than conservatives, and while most respondents to their online survey were up for trying it, only a third were willing to eat it regularly in place of conventionally produced meat. The key consumer concerns were cost, flavour and it being unnatural. Naturalness is perhaps one of the most slippery concepts ever to have been massaged by advertising copywriters. As New Harvest, an organisation that funds cultured meat research, states on its website, “bread, cheese, yogurt and wine are unnatural. All involve processing ingredients derived from natural sources.” No one can argue that intensive farming is natural. Eating insects is arguably more natural, and yet westerners turn their noses up at the idea. Meat without consciousness is a far more philosophically befuddling concept. Post says that 16 people have tasted his product, “and all agree that it’s meat”. However, Arnout Fischer, associate professor of consumer behaviour at Wageningen University in the Netherlands has found that “in the minds of many people, cultured meat is currently somewhere in a ‘grey border zone’ between being perceived as meat or not meat. In several of our studies it was shown that people associate it with some properties of meat, but also with some properties of meat replacers – ie vegetarian burgers etc.” Without a brain, cultured meat can indeed be thought of as almost plantlike. “If you look under a microscope, you see the same cell structures as you would meat from an animal,” says Koert Van Mensvoort, director of the Next Nature Network, a non-profit organisation in Amsterdam that investigates how technology transforms our relationship with nature. “But there’s a different story there that forces us to reevaluate our positions.” Which is partly why he thinks the new culinary possibilities created by cultured meat should be explored, rather than seeing it as replacing the sausages and burgers we’re so familiar with. “Meat sashimi, for instance – growing the meat in very controlled circumstances, you could make sushi or sashimi softer and better than the best sushi you have tasted.” Knitted steak, made from long strands of cultured meat, is another recipe in his In Vitro Meat Cookbook. “Why not look into high-protein, exquisite, slightly weird, extraordinary dishes?” he says. Acting as “a radar for potential futures,” he posits that we could one day culture-up our own cells for meat. Lovely pink beakers of human flesh. He surely can’t mean ethical cannibalism? “You could say it’s an intimate dish for a loved one – you give your body to your lover.” It’s a niche idea, he admits. “Most people I speak to say this is horror, they don’t see the poetry in it just yet.” People are already coming around to the idea of produce grown in factories rather than fields. Marks and Spencer has introduced microherbs cultivated free from pesticides in air-raid shelters, 33 metres below Clapham High Street in south London. And perhaps knowing that cultured meat isn’t a new idea might help normalise it. Winston Churchill was banging on about it in 1932. “We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium,’’ he wrote, presciently. How a clean-meat revolution could affect the landscape and environment is riddled with ifs and buts, not helped by the secrecy among the startups. Hanna Tuomisto, a specialist in the environmental impacts of food production at the University of Helsinki, started investigating the implications at Oxford University in 2008. Feeding the cells is one thing, but to convert a mush of them into muscle-like structures adds a second layer of energy burn, and she can only guess at the expenditure involved. “When we estimate energy consumption,” she says, “it’s at the same level as beef or higher now, but there is lots of uncertainty in bioreactor design and the scales we are looking at now are quite small.” Culturing fish cells will probably use less energy than land animal cells, because fish cells will merrily reproduce at room temperature. However, if the land freed up by moving from intensive farming to cultured meat was used to grow bioenergy crops (a big if), this could mitigate the carbon generated by culturing. Post, meanwhile, thinks enterprising farmers might switch to crops that could provide the nutrients for cultured meat factories. Either way, converting the grassland we use for grazing would have serious drawbacks. Grassland has higher biodiversity than arable land, and converting grassland to arable land would release, Tuomisto says, “a lot of carbon from the soil.” When it comes to the craggy grasslands, especially highlands, that aren’t suitable for arable use, nobody’s in doubt that there will still be demand for free-range animal meat. “There will likely always be a role for family farms to play in feeding the planet,” says Memphis Meats CEO, Uma Valeti, “and we have no problem with that – in fact, my co-founder used to be a family farmer. But family farms can only produce a tiny fraction of the world’s demand for meat.” We do, of course, rely on animals for more than their meat. Brooklyn-based Modern Meadow is already on the case with culturing leather, but alternatives for all animal products need consideration. The world’s first cultured fish tasting takes place on an afternoon in early September, as the mist rolls over San Francisco from the bay. Silicon Valley chef Laurine Wickett will be preparing the fish at her gleaming catering kitchens. Before she fries the five bite-sized, cultured-carp croquettes she has made, she describes the raw paste of harvested cells within them as having a delicate flavour of the sea, a little like the water in an oyster shell. As I suppress thoughts of beakers of pink liquid and taste my perfectly-cooked croquette, I find it both delicious and disappointing. It’s only 25% fish and the subtle carp flavour is eclipsed by the potato. I just about detect a pleasant aftertaste of the sea, though not fish as such. But then, far from a polished product from a development kitchen, this is a first prototype – a benchmark of scientific progress. Selden and Wyrwas only tasted their fish for the first time a few days before. Despite the stingy fish-to-potato ratio, each tiny croquette had cost $200 (£150), working out at about $19,000 (£14,380)-per-pound of fish. But such is the speed of technological advance that they’ve already slashed that by more than half. Afterwards, Selden and Wywras are flushed with the raw elation of having given birth to something important, and they talk frenetically about strategies for developing a more mature fishy flavour, expansion into fresh premises and the structural wonders their newly recruited tissue engineer will create.

Speaking at the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge, Karen Bradley said she wanted Channel 4 to have a “major presence” outside London and that decisions about what programmes it showed “should not all be made in the bubble of Westminster”. However, while Bradley’s comments confirm that Channel 4 will now almost certainly have to move some staff outside London and increase spending outside the city, she also offered an olive branch to the broadcaster on relocation. The culture secretary said that “relocation may not mean the whole business” and that her preference was to “agree a way forward in concert with Channel 4”. This represents a rowing back of government rhetoric about Channel 4’s location. The Conservative manifesto for the 2017 general election said: “Channel 4 will remain publicly owned and will be relocated out of London.” The comments were welcomed by Channel 4, which opposes the relocation of its entire headquarters because of the cost and disruption. The government launched a consultation about Channel 4’s impact earlier this year and this led to a dozen local authorities expressing an interest in hosting all or part of the broadcaster’s operations, including Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield. Bradley said legislation could be used to force the move, but she revealed she had already had constructive discussions with Alex Mahon, who starts as the new boss of Channel 4 in November, and she hoped to reach an agreement with the broadcaster by the end of the year. These changes should be implemented by the end of parliament, which is 2022 at the latest, the culture secretary said. “There is cross-party agreement on the fact that Channel 4 needs to do more and we can, if we need to, legislate,” Bradley said. “ But I don’t think we will get to that point. I am confident we can work with Channel 4 to come up with something that works for the organisation without the need for legislation.” On whether she wanted Channel 4 to move its headquarters outside London or increase spending on commissioning outside the city, Bradley said: “I think it is about a combination of things, but I think it’s also where the decisions are made. I am very clear that what we want is for decisions to be made outside London and I will work with Channel 4 to get to a point where we are all comfortable and we can see that there is a transparent decision-making process outside London, so that Channel 4’s decisions are taken reflecting the nations and regions of the UK.” In response to Bradley’s comments, a Channel 4 spokesperson said: “We are committed to increasing Channel 4’s regional impact and welcome the secretary of state’s desire to work with us to achieve this. “Channel 4 is proud of our leadership on diversity and the existing contribution we make to the nations and regions and we are developing innovative and sustainable proposals to grow this further and give even greater support to creative talent across the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/14/lizard-or-laundry-coventry-family-wrongfooted-by-pink-stripey-sock","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T15:36:18Z","webTitle":"Lizard or laundry?

The “terrified” family called the RSPCA to their Coventry home after they thought they had spotted a reptile under a bed. Vic Hurr, an animal collection officer with the charity, said she approached the “lizard” cautiously as she was unsure what breed it might be. “It was around seven inches long and about two inches wide. It was protruding from the edge of the bed and it wasn’t moving at all,” she said. “As it wasn’t very light, I got out my torch to see better and that’s when I realised it wasn’t a lizard at all … it was a pink stripey sock. “I advised the young girl whose bedroom it was to tidy her room and to take care of her socks, but not before reminding her that another one will turn up soon as they are usually in pairs.” Previous unusual callouts by the RSPCA have included a smoke alarm’s beep being mistaken for a bird in a loft, and multiple cases of toy animals being mistaken for the real thing, including a toy snake and plastic crocodile. An RSPCA spokeswoman told the Telegraph that the family who mistook the sock for a lizard said it had been there for a week without moving. She said when they realised their mistake “the family were mortified. Vic said she couldn’t stop laughing once she got back into the car and I think the family eventually saw the funny side too. “The sock had obviously been there quite a while.

Will the new golden age of scary movies save cinema?\r\n\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A creepy clown has just chomped a monstrous chunk out of the box office – and It is not alone. This year, horrors Annabelle: Creation and the fantastic Get Out have thrived while other genres struggled to draw in the crowds. The Stephen King adaptation about the evil Pennywise has made nearly $180m (£134m) worldwide in its opening weekend, the biggest-ever opening for a horror. It’s official: horror films are firmly part of the mainstream – for good or bad. The Conjuring “universe” kicked off in 2013, buoyed by the success of the Insidious series. The supernatural sequels and spin-offs that followed its success have since magicked themselves into the worldwide top 30, a list that’s more typically dominated by action, sci-fi and family films. Annabelle and Annabelle: Creation were both part of this phenomenon – the latter made it to number one at the US box office – and there’s more to come: there are spin-offs called The Nun (scarier than it sounds) and The Crooked Man in the offing, alongside The Conjuring 3. It seems audiences cannot get enough. So: why the stampede? Over to Ian Sandwell, box-office reporter at industry mag Screen International. “There’s always a core audience willing to turn out for a horror, and if it gets good reviews, it can cross over into the more general Friday-night crowd. Both Annabelle: Creation and It had built-in audience recognition, so that doesn’t hurt. It is a genuinely good movie that’s received some of the best reviews for a mainstream horror in some time. It’s led to It being a film that can appeal across different audiences, from the generation terrified by the 1990 adaptation to teenagers, for whom It might be their first-ever horror.” Cinema staff have noted the variety of punters pouring in to see It. Picturehouse’s Clare Binns points to the nostalgic influences in the 80s-set film. “It’s really a Spielberg/Lucas film for those that were too young for when those directors were cranking out their most iconic films. Stranger Things led the way.” Most contemporary horrors owe a debt to more sinister classics. Period horrors such as Annabelle have taken visual and thematic cues from supernatural 60s and 70s horror, while Get Out put a modern, racial spin on the genre with a Stepford Wives vibe, also owing a debt to Rosemary’s Baby. The latter is echoed in Darren Aronofsky’s new film Mother!, out this weekend. According to Alan Jones, director of London festival FrightFest: “Horror is a cyclical genre. There’s always one movie that kicks off another golden era. First it was Hammer, then Psycho, then Rosemary’s Baby, then The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, Blair Witch, Hostel, Paranormal Activity, Saw, and now it’s The Conjuring universe and It.” In terms of box-office success, the movie world is see-sawing between sub-genres such as slasher, psychological, paranormal, teen, comedy-horror, found-footage and “torture porn”. Remakes of Asian films have also made a significant dent in the box office: The Ring and The Grudge both place in the top 30 horrors of all time. And just as Last House on the Left and Night of the Living Dead helped popularise the genre in the 60s and 70s, indie hits still give studios fresh encouragement to produce mainstream horror. The rule can also work in reverse. “There’s a reason studios churn out horrors that are basically just loud noises without any thought to atmosphere,” says Sandwell. “It’s because they generally pull in an audience on the opening weekend at least. But maybe It, which balances jump scares with likable, well-rounded characters and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, could lead to studios taking more of a risk when it comes to what constitutes ‘mainstream’ horror.” While a film based on jump scares and young kids bonding seems relatively benign, the rise of so-called torture porn raises more troubling questions. I’m a big fan of paranormal horror but found the extremes of Hostel and Saw, which contain extended torture scenes, the most challenging part of my otherwise rewarding job as a film critic. A teenage horror fan once told me: “It’s fine if you don’t imagine it is happening to you.” Aren’t we supposed to be identifying with the characters we see on screen? And if we’re not, are we becoming dangerously desensitised? Alice Haylett Bryan, a lecturer in film studies at King’s College, London, says: “Certain subgenres of horror are undoubtedly getting more extreme, but this is the case across culture as a whole, with computer games and television programmes such as The Walking Dead. We are now living in an age where real acts of violence, and indeed death, have been screened on Facebook and YouTube. Could it not be argued that this desensitises viewers on a more fundamental and concerning level?” If she’s right, then perhaps this overall desensitisation is making younger people bolder in their movie choices. “I see horror constantly regenerating and attracting a much younger audience who can now access content in the way we never could, and are getting intrigued by what the genre possibilities are,” says Alan Jones. The good news for cinemas is that today’s teens and twentysomethings watch horror on the big screen as well as on streams or downloads. Student Andrew Williams, 19, recently went to see It with his friends. He says: “The best horror movies need to be watched in total darkness with surround sound and silence, but with other people around you so that there is an atmosphere of fear in the room.” As for choosing what to watch: “We decide as a group. Many of my friends don’t love horror, so it has to be enticing.” With easy access to trailers and online reviews, it’s easy to see how recent generations may be persuaded to shell out for cinema tickets when their parents and grandparents would have opted for DVD or video. Williams’s experience also highlights the influence of peer pressure: young people have always been more inclined to use cinema outings as social experiences and may be led by dominant members of their social group. Mike Berry – a clinical forensic psychologist at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, says: “Most people go in small groups to the cinema. Individuals apparently enjoy horror films more in the presence of a stronger character, and less when with someone else who is weak and frightened.” It’s not just age that’s altering: Jones says the gender gap is narrowing. “The female demo at FrightFest has grown consistently over the years: now I’d say it was roughly 60% male, 40% female.” Picturehouse’s Binns,says: “Women are now just as keen to see and openly enjoy what was seen in the past as a ‘boys’ subject matter’.” Steve Oram, writer and star of British horror comedy Sightseers, suggests: “Horror has a much wider gender appeal these days. It’s less for sweaty teenaged boys in shorts. And that’s a good thing!” All in all, horror looks on the way to becoming cinema’s most reliable profit-generator. But surely not everyone likes scary movies? Perhaps the typical traits of a horror fan are more common than we think these days. Berry says: “There is a significant correlation between people who accept rule-breaking behaviour and have an interest in horror movies. People who watch horror films want to be frightened, excited and scared, yet psychologically distance themselves from the reality.” That’s a change from the moral panics of the 80s and 90s. “Twenty years ago,” continues Berry, “it was suggested people who loved the blood and gore displayed low empathy, with males often strongly identifying with the villain while ‘thrill watchers’ displayed empathy with the victims, and liked the suspense of the film.” Berry also cites Carl Jung on the genre’s more general appeal. “Apparently, he believed horror films ‘tapped into primordial archetypes buried deep in our collective subconscious – images like shadow and mother play an important role in the horror genre’. Others have argued that people watch violent horror films to relieve themselves of aggressive feelings.” Haylett Bryan points to the wider meaning of horror booms. “The political and cultural climate undoubtedly influences both the production and reception of horror cinema. The success of Get Out and its exploration of the fetishisation and exploitation of the black body is testament to that. How horror cinema responds to the Trump presidency through the types of film produced, for example, will be very interesting. But across international horror as a whole, over the last 10 years or so, the rise in far-right political support has been reflected in narratives that allegorically or directly explore race, immigration and nationhood.” Gareth Tunley, who directed the British psychological horror The Ghoul, says: “Horror writers have to tap into the subconscious in order to access anything remotely scary, so exploring the things the rest of society would prefer swept under the carpet or locked up in the woodshed goes with the territory.” So is there something about our current society that is driving people into the cinemas, seeking scares? Stephen Prince is professor of cinema at Virginia Tech. “Whether or not the world is a more dangerous place today than in earlier eras is debatable. How many of us, for example, would choose to live in a time before antibiotics? But people today may feel they are under greater threats than ever before. Part of this is due to the interconnected world - the internet magnifies a sense of peril. More people in US die from car accidents than from terrorist attacks, but terrorism seems much scarier than cars because it gets plenty of news coverage. Horror films address questions that continue to haunt us, and these have to do with the frailty of the human body, the fragility of our hold on life, and the ambiguities about what a human being is and why people can’t be trusted to remain reliably human.” As for the opening weekend of It, Margee Kerr, a sociologist and the author of Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear, takes a topical approach. “After weathering, literally and figuratively, two hurricanes and a political climate to match, we’re all ready to escape reality for a while and fight a monster we know we can beat. There is a real sense of satisfaction when our fears are made real, at least real on the big screen, and we can celebrate their defeat.” “Maybe the worse things get in the real world, the more we need the emotional release of being scared half to death,” says Tunley. “When you’re living in a world which may end in nuclear fire at any point, a bit of casual onscreen dismemberment seems an appealing bit of light relief.” Send in the clowns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/14/how-trumps-most-toxic-lie-is-becoming-an-institutional-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T18:06:29Z","webTitle":"Trump lied about 'voter fraud' ... now he wants to steal people's votes | Lawrence Douglas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/14/how-trumps-most-toxic-lie-is-becoming-an-institutional-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/14/how-trumps-most-toxic-lie-is-becoming-an-institutional-reality","fields":{"headline":"Trump lied about 'voter fraud' ... now he wants to steal people's votes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Of the hundreds of whoppers that President Trump has told since his election, an early one remains the most toxic. In days following his electoral college victory, Trump claimed that he would have also won the popular vote “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” Trump later refined this claim, insisting that three to five million undocumented voters threw the popular election for Clinton. By way of proof, the president waved at an outlandish story: that golfer Bernhard Langer – a German citizen, barred from voting in the in the US – had had his path to the voting booth clogged by men and women, who by skin color and accent were obviously fraudulent voters. At first, the voter fraud fantasy seemed like no more than a display of the touchiness and extravagant narcissism that led Trump, in the face of undeniable evidence to the contrary, to insist that his inaugural crowds were larger than Obama’s. In fact, the lie concealed a much more ambitious and insidious political agenda. In May, with the creation of the “Presidential Advisory Committee on Voter Integrity,” Trump bootstrapped the myth of voter fraud into an institutional reality. The goal: to use the allegation of fraud to tighten voting procedures that will suppress the votes of minorities, groups that generally vote Democratic. Vice-President Pence, who nominally chairs the 10-person committee, sought early on to assure the public that the group was convened with no preconceived views or agenda. He might as well have said: “Yes, we’ve created a dedicated, tax-payer funded committee to look into Bigfoot’s existence, but I want to emphasize that we remain open to evidence that Bigfoot may not exist.” Alas, Bigfoot is alive and well on the committee. Recently we learned that in the run-up to the panel’s creation, a member of the Heritage Foundation, presumably Hans von Spakovsky, a well-known voter fraud alarmist, wrote an email responding to the “very disturbing” news that the commission might be “bipartisan and include democrats (sic).” Even appointing “mainstream Republican officials and/or academics,” the email warned, would run the risk of turning the committee into “an abject failure.” The concern was duly noted. The de facto head of the committee is its vice-chair, Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach, a true believer who has shown a Trumpian disregard of fact in his crusade against a widespread and persistent problem the very existence of which remains entirely fanciful. On 7 September, Kobach, a regular contributor to Breitbart, wrote a headline-grabbing piece for the alt-right website alleging that the results of the senatorial and presidential election in New Hampshire were “likely changed through voter fraud”. Noting that it “has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters … [in New Hampshire’s presidential and senatorial races] cast fraudulent votes,” Kobach delivered a bombshell: “Now there’s proof.” According to Kobach, evidence conclusively showed that thousands of people with out-of-state driver’s licenses – persons who “never were bona fide residents” –poured into the Granite state, swinging the election in the favor of the democratic senatorial candidate Maggie Hassan and Hillary Clinton. “If the presidential contest had been closer,” Kobach noted, apocalyptically, “then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences.” The charge was sensational, incendiary, and bogus. On Tuesday, at the committee’s second meeting, dramatically staged in New Hampshire, the scene of the alleged malfeasance, Kobach was forced to eat crow. New Hampshire’s long-serving secretary of state, Bill Gardner, a Democrat, dutifully explained that New Hampshire law permits domiciled out-of-staters, such as college students, to vote; Kobach’s thousands of “fraudulent” votes had, in fact, been properly cast. Lacking the president’s panache for denying facts even when they stare him in the face, Kobach swiftly switched gears, launching an attack on the wisdom of the New Hampshire law. That Kobach continues to head the committee in the wake of such recklessness is hardly a surprise, given the bad faith that chartered the group and animates its activities. But what makes the effort truly outrageous is not simply that it bootstraps a lie into an institutional reality, or that it marks an attempt to deny the franchise, the most foundational act of participation in a democratic polity, to millions of eligible voters. What is truly heinous is that Kobach &amp; co are prepared to pursue a partisan end by cynically undermining confidence in the integrity of our electoral process, the sine qua non for the peaceful transition of power. This is not to deny that our electoral system faces genuine threats. We have seen our vulnerability to hacking and external tampering by foreign adversaries. In parliamentary elections held on 9/11, Norway wisely tightened its security procedures to prevent electoral tampering, mandating that ballots be counted manually at least once in addition to being scanned by computer. But instead of focusing on such wise and necessary steps to safeguard our electoral system and to protect our confidence in its results, the president’s commission insists on pursuing a bogeyman of its own making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/14/andrea-leadsom-shrugs-off-jaw-dropping-week-for-government","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T15:12:14Z","webTitle":"Andrea Leadsom shrugs off a 'jaw-dropping' week for the government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/14/andrea-leadsom-shrugs-off-jaw-dropping-week-for-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/14/andrea-leadsom-shrugs-off-jaw-dropping-week-for-government","fields":{"headline":"Andrea Leadsom shrugs off a 'jaw-dropping' week for the government","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When even the crusty Little Englander Peter Bone suggests that the government ought to be taking parliament a little more seriously, you might have thought ministers would care to pay some attention. But Andrea Leadsom, the barely competent leader of the house, was having nothing of it. As far as she was concerned the government was already taking parliament much too seriously as it was. Business questions had begun with the shadow leader Valerie Vaz describing the government’s performance over the past week as “jaw-dropping”. First by granting itself a whole load of executive powers in the EU withdrawal bill; then by stacking the standing committees with its own members so it could control the progress of the bill through parliament; and finally by ordering its MPs to abstain in the opposition day debates on NHS pay and student fees. Leadsom merely shrugged. The SNP’s Pete Wishart went further by calling the government a “dysfunctional tinpot dictatorship”. Leadsom appeared to be quite pleased by this. She hadn’t realised her party had even that level of credibility and gravitas. If it is sometimes hard to remember that Leadsom was once a frontrunner for the leadership of the Tory party, it is harder still to believe that she still has serious designs on the top job when the prime minister goes. Her grasp on reality is tangential at best. “The government takes the opposition day debates incredibly seriously,” she said. So seriously that it had even sent out a few MPs to speak in them. Though not to vote in them. Expecting its MPs to vote in a debate it knew it was going to lose would have been the height of frivolity. It had been incumbent on her party to rise above such pettiness. By being even more petty. Just because the government didn’t have a majority in the house, it didn’t mean that the opposition parties should be allowed to exploit that weakness. The only worthwhile democracy was one where the government was able to do as it pleased. Leadsom seemed unaware that the logical conclusion of her argument was that voting on anything was a bit of a waste of time. Far better not to show up and pretend you don’t care than risk the embarrassment of losing. Leadsom’s insistence that the government took the democratic process seriously hadn’t been wholly born out by its conduct in the urgent question on police pay that had preceded business questions. Rather than sending out the policing minister, Nick Hurd, to fend off the incoming flak, it chose to put up Sarah Newton, the most junior minister in the Home Office. Newton’s specialist subject is hopelessness: she would be out of her depth on a children’s TV programme and is one of the few people who make Leadsom look like an intellectual colossus. Labour’s Louise Haigh tried to make things as simple as possible for her. Why hadn’t the government accepted the recommendations of the pay review board? Why did it expect police officers to accept what amounted to another pay cut? The Police Federation had said that the prime minister’s claims that police officers had received a 32% pay increase were rubbish: who was lying, the police or the prime minister? And could she explain how, if the pay rises were coming out of existing budgets, she could guarantee police numbers wouldn’t be cut? “I am grateful for the opportunity to lay down some facts before the house,” said Newton. The house waited expectantly. And waited. Only Newton didn’t appear to have any facts to offer. Just a few sweet nothings about crime falling and the police being thrilled about everything. Worried that Labour was in danger of looking like the party that was standing up for the police, Conservatives Andrew Selous and Philip Davies – ever so gently – took the minister to task for her general levels of uselessness. Newton waved her hands about frantically to express her outrage through interpretive dance. “Everyone in the Home Office wakes up every morning and thinks: ‘What can I do to keep my country safe?’” she wailed. This was news to everyone in the house. And to everyone in the Home Office. They were all under the impression that everyone in government woke up every morning and thought: “What can I do today to keep us in power for another day?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/sep/16/environment-agency-health-safety-violence-illegal-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T10:02:09Z","webTitle":"For waste enforcement officers, facing aggression comes with the job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/16/environment-agency-health-safety-violence-illegal-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/sep/16/environment-agency-health-safety-violence-illegal-waste","fields":{"headline":"For waste enforcement officers, facing aggression comes with the job","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Aggression, threats and on some occasions, violence, are all things you become accustomed to as a police officer. During my 30 years at Northumbria Police, I’ve found myself in tricky situations with tricky characters. Dealing with these encounters helped me in my current role as a waste enforcement officer at the Environment Agency. It is my job to make sure waste sites have a permit and that they have the right measures in place to protect the environment. For example, fencing to prevent litter from escaping from the site, or drainage that is sealed and won’t pollute nearby water supplies. As you can probably imagine, these measures can be pretty expensive, so some irresponsible waste operators will try to avoid this to save themselves a buck. This is illegal and it’s my job to investigate these rogue traders and bring about enforcement action, such as a hefty fine, imprisonment or the use of the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover any ill-gotten financial gain. Last year alone we stopped illegal waste activity at 989 sites. People are often shocked to hear about some of hairy situations we encounter on visits to illegal waste sites, and they tend to find it hard to believe that it can be as bad as my time as a police officer. The reality is: it can be as bad, and when things get tense, we need to be protected. One incident that sticks with me most occurred just six months after I joined the Environment Agency. A colleague and I had visited a waste site that we suspected was being operated illegally, when we were approached by three, obviously rattled, men. They turned out to be the waste operator and his sons who were less than pleased that we were serving notices to halt their illegal operation. Things quickly escalated and I was physically assaulted, not to mention verbally abused and threatened with further violence if they ever saw me again. My colleague, who had held back in the car, was heckled whilst they tried desperately to open the car door to get to him. Pretty scary stuff, for a routine visit. Despite my background, I was still shaken up and was stuck at how vulnerable we were. Thankfully, the men involved were prosecuted, but it could have been much worse. The situation, and the trial that followed, could have been avoided with the use of body-worn cameras. I proposed the idea to my team, and it was agreed that given the number of illegal waste sites across the country – many of which we suspect are linked to organised criminal rings – Environment Agency officers should be better equipped to deal with aggressive scenarios. Having worked with digital video equipment in the latter part of my police career, I was familiar with the technology and convinced of the benefits, particularly as they act as a deterrent and capture evidence that could be used in court. Various enforcement agencies routinely wear the cameras, so it seemed right that we should too. We opted to trial the body-worn cameras in the north east of England, before potentially rolling these out across the country. I’m fully trained to use the camera now and would only switch it on if I felt that I may face hostility. If the footage isn’t going to be used as evidence it is automatically deleted after a month. Personally, I feel safer since wearing the camera. Although most of the interactions I have whilst doing my job are respectful and productive, I know that I have the backup should things turn ugly. It’s an extension of my personal protective equipment and a welcome addition to our professional skills in managing hostile situations. Although some of my colleagues were initially nervous about using the cameras as some thought it might increase hostility, it’s now accepted as a great tool. Since we’ve been trailing the cameras, officers have already said that it’s helped prevent threatening situations from occurring. I joined the Environment Agency to protect people and the environment. Now that we’re better equipped to deal with challenging situations, I can get on with fighting waste criminals operating illegal sites which we know is bad for the environment, blights communities and undermines legitimate businesses.

Mané will miss Liverpool’s next three matches having been dismissed in Saturday’s 5-0 defeat and had an appeal against the length of his suspension rejected by the Football Association. He has apologised to the City goalkeeper for what he says was an accidental collision, one that forced Ederson off on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment and required eight stitches to a gruesome facial injury. The Liverpool striker is adamant he would not back out of another challenge with a goalkeeper. “I think the next time I will get the ball before him, I will do my best,” Mané said. “My intention was not to hurt the goalkeeper. It was bad and I wish him the recovery to come back healthy. I am happy for him that he could play again [against Feyenoord on Wednesday] and help his team. “It is not what I wish. I think it was a challenge for the ball. I made contact and it was not what I wanted to do so I apologised to him. It is part of football and I cannot change anything. I don’t have his number so I just posted messages for him and I think he has seen them.” Mané has scored three goals in four Premier League games this season but will miss Saturday’s home game against Burnley plus two trips to Leicester City, in the Carabao Cup and league next week. “It is not easy for me because I always love to play football and to enjoy, especially to help my team to win games,” he said. “But we have a great team and great qualities and I think the boys can do it. I would love to be on the pitch all the time and help my team but I will also accept [the punishment] and try and be ready for my comeback. “I was going for the ball. I didn’t have intention to hurt him because I am not that kind of player, so I wish him a quick recovery. I was focusing more on the goalkeeper than the card [after the collision] so when I saw the red card I was surprised because I was expecting maybe a yellow card. I will accept it and try to forget.” Mané’s absence could be offset by the return of Philippe Coutinho. The Brazil playmaker was given a rousing reception when he appeared as a substitute in the Champions League draw against Sevilla on Wednesday, his first Liverpool appearance since pushing for a move to Barcelona. Mané said: “It is always nice to welcome him back because he is one of our best players. He will not only help my game but I think he is a very important player for Liverpool and he will help us to get better and better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/14/frank-vincent-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T14:00:27Z","webTitle":"Frank Vincent obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/14/frank-vincent-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/14/frank-vincent-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Frank Vincent obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Martin Scorsese’s 1990 gangster drama Goodfellas opens with a bang. Three mobsters are driving at night when they hear a persistent thudding. They pull over and warily open the boot. Inside is Billy Batts, the man they thought they had killed, wrapped in blood-soaked tablecloths and pleading for his life. Armed with knife and gun, and bathed in an infernal red from the vehicle’s rear lights, the hoods finish what they started. The unfortunate Batts was played by Frank Vincent, who has died aged 80. A flashback later in the picture, which shows what Batts did to warrant such an unhappy end, gave Vincent the catchphrase that followed him around for the rest of his days. “Go home and get your fucking shinebox!” he tells the volatile Tommy (Joe Pesci), a former shoeshine boy, enraging him and sealing his own fate. Vincent and Pesci had been close friends since the late 1960s. They were co-stars in the 1976 film The Death Collector, which brought them to Scorsese’s attention when he was casting Raging Bull (1980). In the latter film, Pesci is shown breaking a glass in Vincent’s face and repeatedly slamming a car door on his upper body. In Scorsese’s Casino (1995), Vincent gets his own back for this, and for his treatment in Goodfellas, by luring Pesci into a cornfield, beating him savagely with a baseball bat and then burying him alive. Vincent’s Italian-American heritage, natty appearance and confident comportment made him a wise choice for wiseguy roles; he looked the part, with thick black eyebrows, a helmet of silver hair and an insinuating chin. The actor’s familiarity from Goodfellas initially gave David Chase pause early in the casting of the groundbreaking HBO television series The Sopranos. But he relented and Vincent became an important part of the show’s last two seasons, broadcast between 2004 and 2007. He played the crime boss Phil Leotardo, referred to mockingly by Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) as “the shah” on account of his resemblance to the last shah of Iran. (“It’s irrelevant, Phil!” says a stooge, trying to placate him.) Phil was the final character murdered on screen: he is shot and then, in a gruesome flourish, his head is crushed by his wife’s SUV, which she has left unattended without its handbrake on. Vincent was born in North Adams, Massachusetts; his father, Frank, an iron worker, moved the family to New Jersey when Frank Jr was three. He was educated at St Paul’s grammar school, where music was his passion. “A lot of guys I know went to jail,” he said. “Music saved my life.” He became a bugler in the Jersey City department of recreation’s drum and bugle corps and then joined St Joseph’s Cadets of Newark, taking part in national competitions. He became a session drummer on records by Paul Anka and Del Shannon, among others, as well as drumming live with Bobby Blue and the Aristocats. Eventually he took over that outfit, which was by then a trio, and replaced Blue’s name with his own. The clubs he played, he later said, were “more or less run and owned by the guys that I portray in the movies”. In 1969, he hired Pesci as a guitarist for the band. “We had such chemistry,” Vincent said. “Not just playing. We’d do bits back and forth. We both got a lot of laughs, and before you know it we’re doing two hours of comedy a night.” It wasn’t all plain sailing. “We were like a husband and wife and broke up many times. Every night we’d argue over every word. We would never say who’s the boss but we were two very creative people.” The partnership dissolved in 1975 but a year later Pesci got Vincent a part in The Death Collector, which gave him the first of many grisly on-screen deaths: he is shot in the leg and throat while sitting on the toilet. He teamed up again with Pesci in the comedy-drama Dear Mr Wonderful (1982), about a nightclub owner trying to make it in Las Vegas. He also starred in Brian De Palma’s knockabout crime comedy Wise Guys (1986) and two of Spike Lee’s best films, Do the Right Thing (1989) and Jungle Fever (1991). He played Jennifer Aniston’s father in the romcom She’s the One, a police captain in Sidney Lumet’s Night Falls on Manhattan and John DiBernardo, a member of the Gambino crime family, in the TV movie Gotti (all 1996). He also reprised his Casino character that year in the music video for Street Dreams by the rapper Nas. This led to him becoming an acting coach to several rappers, including Nas, DMX and Method Man, during the shooting of Belly (1998), in which Vincent also appeared. He was sanguine about typecasting. “It is a pigeonhole and Hollywood has a tendency to do that to you. They don’t want to give you a chance to stretch. But as a working actor, you have to work, you do what you can do.” It did not stop even when Vincent wasn’t visible on screen: he had a recurring role as the mobster Don Salvatore Leone in the Grand Theft Auto series of video games between 2001 and 2005. In 2006, he published A Guy’s Guide to Being a Man’s Man, in which he offered advice on how to eat, date, listen to music and smoke like a man. He sold his own brand of hand-rolled cigars as well as merchandise emblazoned with his Goodfellas catchphrase; he was immortalised as a character in Killogy, Alan Roberts’s series of graphic novels set during a zombie apocalypse. He is survived by his wife, Kathleen, and three children. • Frank Vincent Gattuso, actor, born 4 August 1937; died 13 September 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/14/megan-rapinoe-alex-morgan-juan-mata-mats-hummels-common-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T14:00:33Z","webTitle":"USA World Cup winners Rapinoe and Morgan join Mata’s charity wage project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/14/megan-rapinoe-alex-morgan-juan-mata-mats-hummels-common-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/14/megan-rapinoe-alex-morgan-juan-mata-mats-hummels-common-goal","fields":{"headline":"USA World Cup winners Rapinoe and Morgan join Mata’s charity wage project","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two members of the World Cup-winning USA women’s team of 2015 have signed up to Juan Mata’s initiative for footballers to donate 1% of their wages to charity. Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan have joined Manchester United’s Mata and the Bayern Munich defender Mats Hummels in pledging money to Common Goal, which supports global football initiatives for disadvantaged children. “Myself and Alex felt it was important that women’s football was represented from the outset,” said Rapinoe, a midfielder with Seattle Reign in the National Women’s Soccer League. “We’re really looking forward to building the movement with Juan and Mats from here.” Rapinoe and Morgan each have more than 120 caps and have played in two World Cup finals, suffering defeat by Japan in 2011 before beating the same opponents four years later. Morgan, a striker with Orlando Pride, was recently on loan at Lyon. “As the global profile of women’s football continues to grow, players like myself and Megan will have an increasing number of opportunities to use our status for good,” Morgan said. “I’m thrilled to join Common Goal at this early stage and hope we can inspire many others to become part of the movement.” Mata is aiming to put together an XI of professional footballers for the project, which is overseen by streetfootballworld, a group of more than 120 local charities. “In Europe, we’ve just experienced a record-breaking transfer window,” Hummels said. “I think some fans are starting to feel alienated from the game in light of these kinds of developments. But as more players join Common Goal, we hope to show the world that football still has its heart in the right place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2017/sep/16/equity-release-over-55s-8m-day-from-homes-unlock-value-in-property","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Over-55s take out £8m a day from their homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/16/equity-release-over-55s-8m-day-from-homes-unlock-value-in-property","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/sep/16/equity-release-over-55s-8m-day-from-homes-unlock-value-in-property","fields":{"headline":"Over-55s take out £8m a day from their homes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Equity release is booming, with older people withdrawing almost £8m a day from their homes, it emerged this week. And there are more schemes than ever available to over-55s looking to unlock the value tied up in their property so they can, for example, pay off their interest-only mortgage. There are 78 product options available for releasing equity – more than three times the number a decade ago. And we could soon see the arrival of a new breed of interest-only home loan for older people that would last until someone died or moved into care. The equity release market appears to be benefiting from the fact that large numbers of interest-only mortgages are currently maturing, with some homeowners feeling they have little choice but to raid the equity in their home to clear the outstanding debt. It also reflects the huge gains in property prices in recent decades. The basics Equity release is a way for older people – the minimum age is usually 55, sometimes 60 – to get cash out of their property without the need to move home. Typically, there are no monthly repayments. Leading providers include Aviva, Legal &amp; General, More 2 Life, Just (formerly Just Retirement) and LV=. “Soaring consumer demand” means annual equity release lending is on course to hit £3bn for the first time this year, according to a report this week by trade body the Equity Release Council. However, it can end up being an expensive way to borrow. That’s because the way these schemes work means you end up paying interest on interest, so the total owed can balloon. Generally, for most older people the most financially effective way of releasing equity would be to move to a smaller property or cheaper part of the country. However, broker Ray Boulger of John Charcol says that if someone borrowed 25% of the value of a home on, say, a 4% fixed rate, all they would need is for house prices to rise by 1% a year for the roll-up of interest to stay pegged as a proportion of the value of the home. He adds that equity release mortgages are also the only ones that have fixed rates running for longer than the 10-year maximum in the conventional market. What are the types of scheme? The most common are mortgage-based products secured against your home that are repaid – usually from the sale of the property – when you die or go into long-term care. These are known as “lifetime mortgages” and allow you to take out a loan on your property in return for a one-off lump sum or regular smaller sums. These deals are becoming more flexible. For example, most now allow customers to make occasional repayments (typically up to 10% of the initial loan per year) without early repayment charges. Meanwhile, drawdown facilities, whereby a pot of money is set aside for you to draw from when you need to, and inheritance protection – the ability to ringfence a guaranteed minimum amount of housing wealth to leave to loved ones – are features of about half the current deals. Drawdown is particularly popular, partly because not everyone needs a big lump sum at the outset and also because you only pay interest on the cash you release, which could save you money and allow more to be left in your estate. How old are those signing up? The average age of a new customer opting for drawdown is 71, and 68 for those wanting a lump sum, says the Equity Release Council. But it adds that an increasing number of homeowners aged 75-84 are unlocking equity. How much can you borrow? This depends on your age, the value of your property and sometimes your health. Someone aged 75 with a £300,000 house could typically borrow £141,000 from Just, or £123,000 from Aviva, according to their website calculators. At 85 those figures rise to £162,000 and £156,000 respectively. If you have certain medical conditions, you may be able to borrow a higher proportion of your property’s value or get a better interest rate. What are the rates like? The average lifetime mortgage interest rate was 5.3% in July, down from 6.2% at the start of 2016, says the Equity Release Council. However, Dean Mirfin at independent specialist firm Key Retirement says rates currently start at 3.79%. An example A couple, both 71, have a £350,000 house and want to release £60,000. Key Retirement looked at two scenarios: releasing the money as a lump sum or releasing an initial £20,000 and withdrawing four lots of £10,000 at the end of years three, five, eight and 10. It says More 2 Life would offer one of the best interest rates – 3.89% – which would be available through specialist advisers. Under the first scenario the amount owing – loan plus interest – would be £72,614 after five years and £87,880 after 10 years. After 20 years it would be £128,714. Under the second scenario the amounts owed would be lower: £34,998 after five years, £65,251 after 10 years, and £110,216 after 20 years. A new breed of deal Interest-only mortgages almost became extinct following the credit crunch, and were once branded a “ticking timebomb”. But now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is talking about reviving them to help older borrowers. In a consultation paper this month, the FCA says the “retirement interest-only mortgages” it is proposing could help two categories of older people: those with a maturing interest-only mortgage but no repayment vehicle, and those interested in equity release but turned off by the way the interest on a lifetime mortgage rolls up. With the proposed product, the loan would carry on until “a specified life event” is triggered, ie, the borrower’s death or the date they move into a care home. Until then they would continue to pay the interest each month and the loan would ultimately be repaid through the sale of the property. There are already a few such deals on the market: for example, specialist firm Hodge Lifetime offers a retirement mortgage, which allows older people to borrow money for most purposes. They pay interest each month and the capital is repaid from the sale of their property when they die or move into long-term care. However, the FCA’s move could see many more deals being launched."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/when-good-tv-goes-bad-red-dwarf","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"When good TV goes bad: how Red Dwarf’s star faded","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/when-good-tv-goes-bad-red-dwarf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/18/when-good-tv-goes-bad-red-dwarf","fields":{"headline":"When good TV goes bad: how Red Dwarf’s star faded","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thirty years ago, science fiction was terminally unfashionable on British television. Few would have given a sci-fi sitcom a hope, yet Red Dwarf’s creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor revelled in their underdog status. The premise was ingenious: defiantly slobbish Dave Lister (Craig Charles) wakes up on a mining vessel 3m years after the radiation leak that wiped out the crew. The last human in the universe, his only companions are magnificently irritating hologram Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), idiotic yet omnipotent ship’s computer Holly (Norman Lovett and, later, Hattie Hayridge) and a humanoid evolved from cats (Danny John-Jules), bearing the perceptible DNA of both Prince and James Brown. Marrying the slacker aesthetic of Dark Star to the wry humour of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, it had both the innate melancholy and odd-couple dynamic central to all great sitcoms. The wobbly staging added to the charm; Naylor and Grant had crafted a lived-in universe with a keen sense of self-awareness, refusing to let budgets act as a brake on their imaginations. Once Robert Llewellyn had joined as fussy mechanoid Kryten, the conceptual shenanigans – always ambitious and interesting – had a fully functioning ensemble to bring them to life. The array of ideas Red Dwarf explored was dazzling, from the implications of AI to the vagaries of memory, talking toasters to curry monsters. By 1990, it was the best British sitcom on TV, its catchphrases (“Smeg!”, “Smoke me a kipper, I’ll be back for breakfast”) instantly recognisable, with an International Emmy the crowning glory. For a cult sitcom in a niche genre, such mainstream acceptance was an extraordinary achievement. Perhaps the seventh series could only have disappointed. Grant had moved on, leaving co-creator Naylor to soldier on alone, seemingly exposed as the straight man in the partnership: an apparent lurch into comedy-drama may simply have been the result of a drought of comic invention. A disillusioned Barrie left and focused on The Brittas Empire – could a greater snub be imagined? – while (re)introducing Lister’s girlfriend, Kristine Kochanski, as ship’s scold gave Chloë Annett nothing to work with. The chemistry had been fatally undermined. The jettisoning of the studio audience saw the actors playing to an invisible crowd while their characters either reverted to one dimension or resorted to navel-gazing that strove for poignancy but palled into dullness. Series eight was even worse, abandoning the idea of Lister and co being alone in space and resurrecting the entire crew for a conventional sitcom with an overreliance on bad CGI. It killed the franchise for a decade, by which time its moment had passed. Or had it? 2009. Enter Lister’s namesake channel Dave, brimming with both witty banter and bullish confidence. Red Dwarf: Back to Earth was feverishly anticipated, making its utter smegging ineptitude all the more dismaying. Dave pressed on and further revivals have been much better. But, with the chances of matching its imperial phase receding faster than Chris Barrie’s hairline, it might be time to abandon the crew to their fate before the whole thing starts to resemble a subpar Red Dwarf episode about the endless reliving of one’s glory days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/sep/14/mays-public-pay-fix-is-too-little-and-too-late","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:53:54Z","webTitle":"May’s public pay fix is too little, and too late | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/14/mays-public-pay-fix-is-too-little-and-too-late","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/sep/14/mays-public-pay-fix-is-too-little-and-too-late","fields":{"headline":"May’s public pay fix is too little, and too late","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government’s signalling of the end of the public sector pay cap (Report, 12 September) is a welcome development, but no additional funding was offered to pay for it, which sets a worrying precedent for the NHS. The NHS is struggling to recruit and retain nurses. One in 10 nursing posts are unfilled and the reliance on overseas staff is at risk with Brexit and the falling value of the pound. Pay is not the only factor behind the growing crisis, but nurses have seen a 6% drop in the real value of their pay since 2010. Pay restraint has been central to making the big efficiencies expected from the NHS, and ending it without proper funding will not work. Hospitals are already struggling to balance their books this year, before there is even a hint of winter pressures. Ending the pay cap will require a commitment to properly fund it, but it will not solve the NHS’s growing workforce issue – for that there needs to be a credible long-term strategy for the NHS and social care. Anita Charlesworth Director of research and economics, The Health Foundation • Although it is far too late, it is at least a good sign that the government has, at last, started to relax the limit on public sector pay increases. Could we, though, put a stop once and for all to the myth that the public sector pay review bodies are independent? They have to take into account what the government says about affordability. In other words, they are bound by a unilateral criterion imposed by the government. I have never understood how that can be consistent with true independence. Dr Stephen Pacey Newark, Nottinghamshire • The decision to release the pay cap only for police and prison officers will inevitably attract strong criticism from nurses and others, but it makes sense. Most Tory MPs probably have private healthcare, but they might well need the services of the police to intervene between them and the electorate during the conference season and beyond. Tory peers should also support the decision; Lords Archer, Hanningfield and Taylor of Warwick could tell them how helpful prison officers can be at difficult times.

It was, well, terrible from Everton, but also inspiring from Atalanta, a rebuilt team playing their first European fixture for a quarter of a century 150 miles from home. They will, on this evidence, be making another killing in the transfer market come January/July. Thanks for joining me. Bye! Koeman signs off, with a word on Everton’s opening fixtures. He really laid into himself there, but I dare say he’ll have had a angry words for others as well. We knew. We knew from the beginning of July that the start of the season was really tough. OK, we need to accept it. That’s not the problem. The problem is what we showed in the first half. More Koeman rage: Of course we need to have a little bit more patience. But on the other side, everybody can do their maximum for a good result. But once again, it’s not the time and not the place to criticise the players. I need to criticise myself, because the team was not prepared for this tonight. We showed eight times clips of the play of Gomez, he’s right-footed from the left, and he still got a free shot. That’s the individual quality from one player. The whole team of Atalanta was much better prepared than us today, and once again, that’s the manager. Ronald Koeman fumes on TV: A lot went wrong. Except maybe after a difficult start maybe 10 minutes, that we had the ball a bit better. But OK, ball possession was poor, but the most painful was in the first half. They showed more aggression, they showed more passion. And that’s really painful, because in my opinion it starts with that and they you need qualities on the ball. I asked myself what I’m doing wrong, about the second half against Tottenham and the first half here. It’s not the way I like to see my team. The commitment, the passion, what they showed in the first half was much bigger than we showed. Chelsea 2-0 Everton; Everton 0-3 Tottenham; Atalanta 3-0 Everton. That’s a grim run of results, and with a visit to Old Trafford to come on Sunday it doesn’t get any easier (actually it does: they then have successive home games against Sunderland in the League Cup, Bournemouth, Limassol and Burnley, followed by a visit to Brighton). Elsewhere in Group E: Lyon have blown a lead at Apollon Limassol, who scored an equaliser deep into stoppage time to make the final score 1-1. Read all about it here: 90+3 mins: It’s over. Everton weren’t just woefully inept today, they were lazy. Grumpy, sleepy and dopey – they were three of the seven dwarfs, and after this they have roughly the same international stature. 90+2 mins: There will be three minutes or so of second-half stoppage time. Everton’s torture is almost over. 90+1 mins: Mirallas plays in Holgate, whose first touch is good and whose second, a left-foot shot, goes behind off Rafael Toloi. The referee gives a goal kick. 89 mins: Keane, 40 yards out, hits a rubbish and wildly ambitious shot miles over the bar. 88 mins: Atalanta break, Gomez feeds Cornelius, and he could have done a bit better than hit a low shot that Stekelenburg saves. Decent chance. 87 mins: Sandro gets the ball on the left, spins and then spears a rubbish and wildly ambitious shot straight to Berisha. 85 mins: Kurtic’s low shot is blocked by Besic. “I’d just like to add that Glenn Strömberg also does a lot of TV punditry,” writes Ed Rostron, “and we once received a free copy of his Italian cookbook, which features lots of Swedish footballers who played in Italy choosing their favourite Italian meals. The bolognese recipe is excellent.” Here’s some more Strömberg-related reading: 84 mins: The match is being played at half pace, but that just means Atalanta are attacking in slow motion. Gomez lifts the ball into the box but it’s just too far ahead of Cornelius. 82 mins: The last of the substitutions. Cristante goes off, and Jasmin Kurtic comes on. 81 mins: Everton have stopped doing a bit better, and Atalanta are once again dominating. Meanwhile, pick this out of the net. 79 mins: Another substitution. Andreas Cornelius comes on and Andrea Petagna, who has been phenomenal, comes off. 78 mins: Gomez lifts the ball into the penalty area, where Petagna runs on to it and is in the process of swinging his left foot when Jagielka steals the ball away. “I’m not an Everton fan and am not English but Everton are even embarrassing me,” writes JR. “The hell is going on over there? Seventh place might be up for grabs this season.” 76 mins: Besic biffs a 40-yard shot high, and both teams make a substitution. Everton bring Mirallas on for Calvert-Lewin, and Atalanta bring Mattia Caldara on for Masiello. 75 mins: Everton have been doing a bit better of late, though mainly because Atalanta are suffering from threenilupitis. The visitors have had a bit more possession, but haven’t done a lot with it. 74 mins: If you’re wondering what Glenn Stromberg, the big Swede standing next to Caniggia in the photo I used earlier, is up to these days, here’s the answer: he’s watching this game in a pub. 70 mins: A break in play while Masiello is treated for a jarred knee. 66 mins: A double substitution for Everton, who take off Rooney and Schneiderlin and bring on Klaassen and Ramírez. 65 mins: If you’re hanging about waiting to watch the Arsenal game, prepare to hang about a bit longer – kick-off has been delayed by an hour to give them time to work out what to do about all the ticketless away fans who are outside and don’t want to be. 63 mins: A disgruntled Sigurdsson, who has achieved nothing all night, executes a sulky late challenge from behind that brings an inevitable yellow card. 62 mins: Hateboer cuts in from the right, Baines falls over in astonishment, and the Dutchman’s shot with the outside of his right foot is blocked by Jagielka. 60 mins: Here’s a great picture of Rooney which pretty much sums up Everton’s night so far. 57 mins: Atalanta hit the bar! They attack down the right, the ball is passed to Petagna, and he holds it, waits, and then lays it into the path of Freuler, whose shot beats Stekelenburg for pace but is just too high! 56 mins: Everton win a free-kick on the right flank. Sigurdsson’s cross is headed clear, and when the ball is sent back into the area Berisha catches. 54 mins: Atalanta miss a chance to make hit four! Petagna screams down the right, gets to the edge of the area and touches to his left, where the ball rolls to Gomez, who blasts high. 53 mins: Gomez strikes a delicious 50-yard pass to Petagna, just outside Everton’s penalty area, but Besic closes him down and then steals the ball away. 52 mins: There’s some nice build-up play from Everton down the right, before Vlasic pulls the ball back to Rooney and his chipped cross floats to Berisha. 49 mins: Everton haven’t completely turned the tide, though: Petagna cuts in from the right and tests Stekelenburg with a low left-footer towards the near post. 48 mins: Everton attack again, Vlasic carrying the ball down the middle of the pitch as team-mates run left and right in support. He tries a long-range left-foot shot that is so poorly struck it only barely reaches Berisha. 47 mins: As Atalanta struggle to clear the ball Freuler twinkletoes his way past two players on the touchline and then goes down under Holgate’s gentle challenge. Free kick. 46 mins: Shot! Everton have a shot! It’s Rooney with it, spinning into the area and blasting a low, hard effort that Berisha pushes clear. 46 mins: Everton get the second half started. Can they dig themselves out of this very big hole? The players are back out. Remarkably, Everton appear to have made no substitutions. Andrea Petagna looks excellent. He’s 22, but tall, strong, technically sound, controls the ball well and spots a pass. And Alejandro “Papu” Gomez, at 29, is not so youthful a prospect but is quite the mover. As you can see here (honestly, watch it. It’s really quite funny): 45+1 mins: The referee doesn’t bother with stoppage time. Everton haven’t really started. Atalanta have been excellent; Everton embarrassing. This is so easy! The ball is pumped into Everton’s half, where Petagna runs into an impossible amount of space, looks to his left and sees two team-mates also running into impossible amounts of space! He tries to slide the ball across the area to Gomez but Cristante intercepts, runs all alone into the penalty area, and prods past Stekelenburg! 43 mins: Somewhere in the bowels of the stadium, inside the Everton dressing-room, there are some very frightened teacups. Atalanta get reward for their dominance, and it’s a beauty! Gomez has been excellent on the left wing; this time he cuts inside and, from a couple of yards outside the area, sends a shot dipping and curling into the far corner! 39 mins: Atalanta, who should be more than a single goal to the good by now, have their sixth corner of the game. The referee spots a foul (though replays suggest it was an Everton player doing the fouling). 37 mins: Another save from Stekelenburg. It was a selfish shot from Gomez, towards the near post when really he should have crossed, giving the goalkeeper an easy save. 34 mins: Another chance! Petagna holds the ball up on the edge of his area and plays it through, Masiello runs onto it but Stekelenburg comes out fast, closes him down and makes the save. 34 mins: And the day’s first booking, which goes to Timothy Castagne. Atalanta are massively dominant here. 33 mins: Oooh again! Gomez crosses from the left and it bounces through to Hateboer, beyond the far post, who volleys into the ground and back across goal, where several team-mates were queueing up, but Keane got a foot to the ball and they all missed it! 31 mins: Ooooh! Gomez gets to the byline but his pull-back is just too far in front of Masiello, and just too far behind Petagna! 29 mins: Rooney’s chip is very much his attacking highlight thus far – he’s spent most of the match tracking up and down the left flank, often working as an auxiliary left-back. The corner is played into a cluster of players at the near post, deflects I think off Sigurdsson’s shoulder and rolls to the one player at the far post. Masiello is barely a yard out when it comes to him, and can’t miss! 26 mins: Chance! And a save! Gomez chips the ball into the area to Petagna, who brings the ball down. Jagielka gets in the way but the ball deflects to Masiello, whose first-time shot from close range hits the goalkeeper and goes wide! 24 mins: Another long spell of Atalanta possession. They are moving forward, but very slowly. 21 mins: Remo Freuler smacks a powerful shot from the edge of the area. That was really travelling, and Stekelenburg would surely have struggled to save it, so it’s just as well Keane threw himself in its way. 20 mins: This photograph of classic Atalanta players of yesteryear is absolutely phenomenal. Among the questions it raises: is Claudio Caniggia’s shirt very big or are his upper arms just very small? 17 mins: Atalanta win a third corner, and after Rooney gets his head to it first, a fourth. That one drops in the six-yard box and causes a bit of panic before it’s booted clear. “I can’t believe I’ve just spent 2 minutes and 12 seconds watching a video of fans milling around out side the Mapei Stadium,” complains Andrew Kennedy. “I’m sitting in the Singapore Air lounge in San Francisco airport listening to people slurp Seafood Laksa. I was hoping the video would be a pleasant distraction. It didn’t work.” Yes, nothing happens. But there’s some very invigorating music. 14 mins: And another shot! This one, from Rooney, is different in almost every way to Sigurdsson’s: he’s running away from goal, from left to right, when he suddenly chips back towards the far post. It causes Berisha a few moments of intense concern before plopping onto the roof of the net. 13 mins: A shot! Sigurdsson thumps a nasty dipping effort from just outside the area. It’s straight at Berisha but he’s got no chance of catching something that vicious. He pushes it to safety. 10 mins: This is better from Everton, keeping possession, gently probing first down one flank, and then the other. Nothing comes of it, mind. 8 mins: Everton attempt to attack, sending Calvert-Lewin down the right, but he gives the ball away. 7 mins: Atalanta aren’t really pressing now, but they have had the ball for the very great majority of the match so far. 4 mins: Atalanta still press. Petagna controls with his hand, gets away with it, and has his shot deflected behind off Keane. 2 mins: Atalanta press, and their ball into the box comes off Jagielka’s head, loops into the air and has to be tipped over the bar by Stekelenburg. “Having visited beautiful Bergamo to watch Atalanta dispatch the mighty Pescara in March I can confirm that Stadio Atleti Azzurri d’Italia required renovation approximately 20 years ago,” writes Michael Kruse. “Great team. Wonderful supporters. Dilapidated stadium. As an aside, as a result of that match I adopted Atalanta as a second team and given the stripping that the team has undergone the past couple years I can only imagine how Southampton supporters feel on an annual basis.” 1 min: Peeeeep! Atalanta get us under way. Coins tossed, hands shaken, kick-off moments away. The Atalanta fans are extremely boisterous. We’ve got flares, smoke, and a lot of noise, and the game hasn’t even started yet. The players are in the tunnel. Actually, it looks more like a foyer. That’s a particularly random-looking stand. It looks like one of the stands you put on your properties in the various football-related versions of Monopoly. If you’ve ever wanted to know what the outside of the Mapei Stadium looks like while fans mill about listlessly before they’re let in, this nearly-live video is for you! Important fact: The game is being played at the Mapei Stadium because Atalanta’s own ground, the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d’Italia about 150km away in Bergamo, which the club bought outright earlier this year, is being renovated. That victory was Atalanta’s first of the domestic season – they had lost their first two league games, 1-0 to Roma and 3-1 to Napoli. Atalanta make a relativaly understated four changes to the team that beat Sassuolo 2-1 on Sunday. The teams! These are the people who will be contesting today’s tie. Everton make no fewer than six changes, bringing in Maarten Stekelenburg, Mason Holgate, Phil Jagielka, Mo Besic, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Nikola Vlasic. Atalanta: Berisha, Toloi, Palomino, Masiello, Hateboer, Cristante, Freuler, de Roon, Castagne, Petagna, Gomez. Subs: Gollini, Orsolini, Cornelius, Caldara, Kurtic, Haas, Bastoni. Everton: Stekelenburg, Holgate, Jagielka, Keane, Baines, Besic, Schneiderlin, Rooney, Vlasic, Sigurdsson, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Pickford, Williams, Sandro, Mirallas, Martina, Gueye, Klaassen. Referee: Vladislav Bezborodov (Russia). Hello world! So the eyes of the known universe turn to the winningly-titled Stadio Città del Tricolore. What a promising name! Fans of Italian-restaurant staple insalata tricolore would certainly want to flock to a city entirely dedicated to the triple pleasures of tomato, avocado and Mozzarella di Bufala, but tragically the name refers to the original and distinctly less tasty tricolore: the Italian flag, a clever red, white and green creation which was the idea of some Reggio Emilia-based bright spark back in 1797. Visitors to the city can also visit the Sala del Tricolore, a big room which is said to be where the very first tricolore was hung. Counterintuitively neither of the two major football teams who call the stadium home play in those colours: Reggiana wear red and white, and Sassuolo still use a version of the green and black kit gifted to them by visiting English side Lancaster Rovers back in the dimly-lit mists of time (read more here). Significantly less romantically, the stadium is often known these days as the Mapei Stadium, having sold its naming rights to the well-known producer of adhesives, thinsets and sealants for buildings. This is Everton’s third visit to Italy. In 1963 they lost 1-0 to Internazionale; in 1975 they lost 1-0 to Milan; and in 2008 they lost 2-0 to Fiorentina.

Stop right now. Turn back. You will be stuck in an overheated room, chained to a table for an absurd length of time and stopped from proper work. Worse, we are now told that just sitting there is a killer. It shortens life. You will die. According to Public Health England, we are so addicted to meetings that we don’t realise the threat they pose to ourselves and our organisations. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, told this week’s annual meeting that sitting in meetings “haemorrhages productivity”. It slows metabolism and affects the body’s capacity to regulate its sugar and thus blood pressure. This leads to obesity, diabetes, cancer … and death. So don’t do it. Don’t go. The Get Britain Standing campaign agrees. It says that sedentary office activity is now as dangerous to health as smoking. It takes an hour of exercise to eliminate the toxins built up in one round-table session. Meanwhile, the Columbia University Medical Center this week produced a no less alarming statistic. After tracking 8,000 individuals in all walks of life, it concluded that inactivity for 13 hours a day (including sleep) makes “risk of death” 2.6 times more likely than it is for inactivity of less than 11 hours. The best meeting is spent walking, like in The West Wing. (The fact that all West Wingers seem on the verge of a heart attack is apparently irrelevant.) Mike Loosemore of the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health rather desperately advises regularly standing up and getting a glass of water. Neanderthals must be laughing themselves sick at what Homo sapiens has to do just to survive. While we can take that with a pinch of salt, it feeds a wider meetings malaise. All the revolutions of the internet – Skype, Facebook, Twitter – have not diminished humankind’s craving to gather in tedious conclave. Executives ruthless towards workplace productivity are careless of their own offices. Meetings are the cocaine rush of the corporation. I am told there are scores of executives at the BBC, an institution famously addicted to the meetings culture, who are so high on the stuff that they spend the entire day in meetings, and return home with no one any the wiser, except those who pay their salaries. It is half a century since C Northcote Parkinson first addressed the meeting as social anthropology, yielding his celebrated “coefficient of inefficiency”. It calculated that a meeting of just five people was “most likely to act with competence, secrecy and speed”. Few such bodies exist because five swiftly expands to nine: and two of the nine tend to be “merely ornamental”, people whom no one has the heart to exclude. Above nine, said Parkinson, “the organism begins to perish”. Once the meeting reaches 20 people, it may as well go on to 100, since by then most of those present are not contributing. They are spectating, talking to each other, squabbling or forming lobbies. Nowadays many are peering at their phones or tablets – pretending to take notes, or frantic not to fall asleep. All are praying for “any other business”. Management research on meetings is uniformly hostile, yet like most research it has not the slightest practical effect. A recent study by Microsoft, America Online and Salary.com found that the average person works only three days a week. The rest of working time was regarded as wasted, with “unproductive meetings” heading the list. Workers on average regard a third of any meeting as pointless. Minnesota University’s “decisions” guru, the psychologist Kathleen Vohs, has shown that most executives have a limited stock of “cognitive resource”. It depletes over time, like physical energy. People get impatient, they tire and take worse decisions. Curiously, they leave feeling exhausted, despite hours spent doing nothing at all. Four-hour board or “strategy” meetings are probably disastrous to the firm, inducing torpor, claustrophobia and misjudgment. Yet still recruits arrive from management schools and consultancies, brilliant zombies doped to the eyeballs in presentations “delivering strategic solutions going forward by thinking out of the box”. They are like chateau generals, kept well away from the front line, versed in the parlour games of the articulate classes. They are for coffee and biscuits, not the watercooler. Nothing is likely to cut this flab. The meeting has become the ceremony of executive importance: who calls it, who chairs it, who presents to it, who is invited and who is not. Its status is a classic cause of office “fomo” – fear of missing out. It soon develops its Harlequinade, the bad jokesmith, the unstoppable talker, the maddening interrupter, the toadies, bad-mouthers, extroverts and those who just sit in silent despair. None is producing goods or services. In short the meeting is the office as religion. Its sacraments, creeds and acolytes are found in agendas, minutes and note-takers. Its liturgy is the canticle of the PowerPoint. The modern office even has its ritual sanctuary, the “meeting room”: 11.00 for matins, 2.30 for vespers. Describing meetings as “secret killers of productivity”, Forbes magazine recently suggested they be simply banned, or held “only on Wednesdays” – all other decisions to be taken in absentia. Anyone who needs to be consulted – the “coordination” role of meetings – will find out soon enough. If not they don’t really need to know. The few brave organisations that have experimented with this drastic step report phenomenal improvements in workrate. One worker who said that if he missed a meeting, “my boss would probably kill me”, was told: “In that case he probably should.” The number, length and size of meetings must be a sound Parkinsonian indicator of an organisation’s productivity or decay. The FTSE or the government should publish an annual league table of meetings per employee per week. It would illustrate the thesis by economist Joseph Schumpeter that all organisations have a natural lifecycle: they grow, they fatten, they ossify into meetings, and they die – unless funded by the state. I bet Apple had few meetings in the early Steve Jobs days, but I bet it has thousands now. If so, as Parkinson warned of all who broke his laws, sell the shares. As for that meeting, skip it – and live. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/14/recalling-peter-halls-sensational-swansong","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:53:25Z","webTitle":"Recalling Peter Hall’s sensational swansong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/14/recalling-peter-halls-sensational-swansong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/14/recalling-peter-halls-sensational-swansong","fields":{"headline":"Recalling Peter Hall’s sensational swansong","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Michael Billington describes “a certain sadness” in Peter Hall’s later years (‘He left British theatre infinitely richer than he found it’, 13 September). But there was nothing sad about his Indian summer at Kingston. Sir Peter revelled in his role as chancellor of Kingston University, of which he was immensely proud. He loved the ceremonies, but more than anything he relished the chance to spread some of the privileges of his own Cambridge education through his uniquely creative rapport with his vice-chancellor, Peter Scott. And at Kingston’s Rose Theatre he helped shape his ideal of a teaching theatre, where actors and academics would work side by side. For Hall, the Rose was Prospero’s island, where the music he learned from George Rylands could be fused with the rigour taught by FR Leavis. Crucially, this “wide and universal theatre” was not the Globe, with those pillars he famously deplored. When he blessed the house with As You Like It in 2004, reviewers were dismayed that his chilling vision was not the comedy they liked. But Hall insisted Shakespeare’s forest was a place of terror; and his 2010 A Midsummer Night’s Dream took critics aback by its starkness, and the fierceness with which Judi Dench’s Titania decried climate change in the mask of an aged Queen Elizabeth. So, there was no sad falling off in Peter Hall’s Kingston swansong. But equally, he did not go gently into his good night.

In a key development to a controversy that is threatening to go to the top of the FA, the Guardian can reveal Spence has given a written statement to the organisation alleging that on her first England callup, at the China Cup in October 2015, she was left upset and offended by Sampson asking her, a mixed-race player, how many times she had been arrested. Spence has also had a private meeting with senior FA officials to give her version of events and is understood to have expressed surprise that the two inquiries which have cleared Sampson of any wrongdoing – one an internal review and the other a three-month independent inquiry, carried out by the barrister Katharine Newton, on behalf of the FA – did not think it necessary to speak to her. As the Guardian revealed this week, the two inquiries also chose not to interview any of the other players present at the meeting where Sampson is alleged to have turned to a mixed-raced player, then 22, and said: “Haven’t you been arrested before? Four times, isn’t it?” Aluko has described the inquiries as a “farce” and the Professional Footballers’ Association has accused the FA of holding an internal review that was “not a genuine search of the truth” and “a sham which was not designed to establish the truth but intended to protect Mark Sampson”. Spence’s decision to back Aluko leaves English football’s governing body under mounting pressure to abandon its previous stance that the issue was finished at a time when the culture, media and sport select committee is preparing to summon senior FA executives on 17 October to explain the holes in the process. Although the FA is not making any comment, it has become apparent in the past few days there is a growing feeling within the organisation it has made significant errors during a controversy that has led to calls from Kick It Out, the PFA and the shadow sports minister, Dr Rosena Allin‑Khan, for another inquiry. The FA is also likely to come under pressure for Newton not to be involved in any new process. At the same time Sampson may face a more in-depth investigation into Aluko’s allegations – repeatedly denied by the manager – that he told her to be careful her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus to a game at Wembley. Aluko was paid an £80,000 settlement, including a confidentiality clause, while the sum total of the FA’s investigation into that matter appears to have been asking Sampson whether it was true and receiving his denial. Aluko told the Guardian in an exclusive interview on 21 August she felt she had lost her 11-year, 102-cap England career as a result of reporting a number of grievances about Sampson and the FA’s credibility has come into question because of what appear to be other shortcomings in the investigation process. The original explanation for not interviewing Spence was the FA did not know her identity, with Aluko being blamed for apparently “refusing” to help. Yet Aluko, a qualified sports lawyer, supplied evidence that clearly states it was a mixed-raced midfielder who was raised in south London, played for Chelsea and on her first England camp. Spence, to put it into context, was the only mixed-race midfielder on that trip. The FA has also been forced to admit it delivered its initial findings to Aluko, effectively throwing out her complaints about bullying and victimisation, before it had spoken to at least one of the key witnesses. Newton’s report did say the barrister had seen a video, filmed by FATV, of the China Cup meeting and that it did not show Sampson making the alleged comment to Spence. Aluko’s camp have requested the video to check if it is the correct meeting, or if it has been edited, but the FA has declined to pass it over. Sampson has insisted his “conscience is clear”, saying the two players are not telling the truth, but in his first press conference since the controversy blew up he appeared to contradict the evidence he gave to Newton’s inquiry. “We’re very concerned about what we’ve seen,” Damian Collins, the select committee chairman, told the Guardian this week. “When you look at the case of Eni, as well as the concerns that Lianne [Sanderson] has raised, it would be impossible to believe that a male figure who was such a senior figure in the England team would have been treated in the way that Eni has been. There would have been a lot more serious investigation into the allegations that have been made.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/14/the-role-of-renewables-in-the-uk-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:54:06Z","webTitle":"The role of renewables in the UK energy mix | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/14/the-role-of-renewables-in-the-uk-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/14/the-role-of-renewables-in-the-uk-energy-mix","fields":{"headline":"The role of renewables in the UK energy mix","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your excellent editorial on the reducing cost of offshore wind power (13 September) is timely in identifying the increasingly futile case for new nuclear build. It does, however, repeat the fallacy that nuclear power “is a zero-carbon technology”. The carbon emissions involved in building such immense structures, in mining and transporting uranium, and in the transport, reprocessing and storage of waste, contribute to a considerable carbon burden. Estimates vary considerably, but studies suggest that the emissions from nuclear generation could be one-10th of those of fossil fuels, but twice those of wind power. Furthermore, the need for a continuous supply is of only limited use when consumption patterns become distorted by, for example, the increased need to charge electric vehicles overnight, as your leader identifies. What is needed now, alongside continued investment in the latest generation of renewable production, is increased investment into a wide range of storage technologies, and further research and investment into the production of renewable heat. Tackling the energy challenge is plainly within our grasp as new technologies come to the market. The challenge now is not a technological one, it is a political one. Sadly, that is a political challenge which our current government seem unable to address. Ian Hill Cockermouth, Cumbria • Yes, yes to more wind farms. But why do our politicians continue to ignore or reject the potential of enormous tides that rise and fall conveniently close to a huge proportion of Britain’s population – indeed, precisely as close as Hinkley Point? Nearly every time a picture of Hinkley is shown there is a strip of water in front of it, the Bristol Channel, home to the second-highest tidal range in the world. Twice every day that enormous body of water rises and falls between 11 and 14 metres. That represents energy of a similar order to that which may, eventually, and at enormous cost and perpetual taxation transfer to French and Chinese companies, be produced by Hinkley Point. Marine turbine technology is not experimental, nor potentially polluting. A smaller tidal barrage has been operating successfully on the Rance, near St Malo in France for nearly 50 years. It is clean, the energy is free and perpetual, there is no noxious waste and the birds seem to have adapted quite well. Will Taylor Tiverton, Devon • To replace the UK’s current nuclear generating capacity with offshore wind turbines like those planned for Triton Knoll, and at similar spacing, would require a sea area equivalent to a 1.6km wide band around the entire coastline of the UK. This assumes perfect power storage, loss-free transmission and an optimistic through-life load-factor of 27%: real figures would almost certainly increase the required sea area. Is the UK population ready for the environmental impact such a programme would create? Tim Chittenden Past president, The Nuclear Institute • With reference to your editorial, you might find it easier to offer a few more-favourable words about Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by regarding it as a (partial) replacement for the UK’s seven AGR stations, some of which have been in service for more than 40 years but all of which will reach the end of their working lives in a decade or two. As base-load generation, their replacement if not by new nuclear stations will necessarily be 100% by gas-fired plant. Think how much that will contribute to reducing national carbon dioxide emissions. Jim Waterton Glasgow • You rightly report the welcome news that future offshore wind power projects will produce electricity significantly cheaper than future nuclear power. But there are other established non-carbon methods that are even better. Significantly cheaper still for consumers are onshore grid-connected wind power (now effectively banned by government planning policy) and onsite locally sized self-generation, generally from solar photovoltaic panels, but also from site-dependent wind turbines and mini-hydro. In addition, there are the cost-saving possibilities of battery storage and of local energy cooperatives. Of course, the renewables options produce variable power because they draw from the natural environment with its diurnal and inter-seasonal characteristics. Consequently as an integrated resource they are not “intermittent”, which implies suddenly ceasing. Individual renewables generator variations average out when combined together with grid connection. This average is predictable from UK weather forecasts and certainly not “intermittent”. However the generation from nuclear stations is indeed “intermittent”, with total and sudden outages from predictable refuelling and unpredictable transmission failures. It is impossible that UK renewables could ever have the unwanted intermittency and cost characteristics of nuclear power. Dr John Twidell Horninghold, Leicestershire • It’s great to see your editorial on wind power – with offshore wind costs plummeting, solar costs halving in the last five years, renewable evolution is ramping exponentially. Germany, the strongest economy in Europe, has just broken green energy records by generating 35% of power from renewables in the first half of 2017. But here, sadly, inconsistent feed-in tariffs have meant a rush of investment then near collapse of the solar market. And we are still stuck on a large nuclear subsidy, even to the extent of distorting the UK energy market, backing an expensive technology come what may – finding ourselves in the surreal situation of planning the largest construction projects ever built on UK soil (Hinkley, Moorside and Sizewell), and contemplating buying reactors from bankrupt and disgraced companies using technologies that have failed wherever they have been built. The nuclear industry says that future UK energy should be nuclear and renewables – but because nuclear is so eye-wateringly expensive, the real choice is actually nuclear or renewables. And the reality is that, in an even market, renewables just make more economic sense. Dr Paul Dorfman UCL Energy Institute Prof Steve Thomas Greenwich University Duncan Bayliss UWE • As Rupert Jones says (Hurricane Irma has devastated British territories – so why such little aid?, 12 September), the UK government needs to be faster at responding to emergencies. But we also need people power to respond faster internationally to the underlying causes of those emergencies. Adapting to the risks of climate change needs to become a global system of assistance, ready and on call. This can be led by governments. Reducing the risks of further climate change needs new global campaigns of action, to bring governments into line. This can be led by civil society. The cooperative sector worldwide, with one billion members, is supporting reconstruction in hurricane-hit islands and flooded coastlands. A new financial appeal across the UK’s 7,000 coops has been launched this week with founding support by the Co-op Group. At the same time, cooperatives worldwide are campaigning for deep cuts in emissions, putting this into practice in our own businesses, and for a step change in energy policy. There are now 250 UK cooperatives helping to generate renewable energy or support energy saving. Emergencies like the hurricanes in the Americas or the floods in Asia are prompts not just for government action but also for a new spirit of self-help and mutual aid.
