MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee were stunned by the admission from Marion Sears, who was giving evidence after Persimmon angered shareholders earlier in the year by handing its chief executive Jeff Fairburn a £75m bonus. “The average … I don’t have that figure to my finger tips,” Sears told MPs, when asked by the committee chair, Rachel Reeves, what average pay was. “You’re chair of the remuneration committee at Persimmon aren’t you? And you don’t know what average pay is, as chair of the remuneration committee?” asked an incredulous Reeves. After the meeting had concluded, the Labour MP tweeted that Sears’ lack of knowledge was a disgrace. She added in a statement: “Executive pay at Persimmon is a tale of corporate greed and incompetent pay management, financed on the back of a tax-payer funded housing scheme [help to buy]. “Persimmon paid out huge bonuses to the men at the top of the firm and yet this morning we have heard that Persimmon are unable to tell us how much average workers at the company are paid.” A spokesman for the firm later confirmed the average salary at the firm is £35,600. During the bruising session, Sears also appeared confused about the sum Fairburn received last year, at first answering “£675,000”. Prompted by Reeves to give the total pay figure, she said it was “about £45m”. The total figure shown in the 2017 annual report and accounts was £47.1m. When asked by Reeves whether or not Persimmon was a living wage employer, Sears said yes, but then went on to clarify that the FTSE 100 firm was not accredited by the living wage foundation. “If Persimmon can pay their chief executive £45m, they must ensure they pay all their staff the living wage,” Reeves said. “As a committee, we shall continue to take a close eye to the issue of corporate pay and examine what impact government action, such as pay-ratio reporting, and new regulatory guidance is likely to have on delivering fair pay.” Persimmon was subject of a major shareholder revolt in April over a £75m bonus handed to Fairburn. Fairburn collected the first £50m worth of bonus shares on 31 December and will collect the remainder of his long-term incentive plan share award on 1 July. He had been due to collect a total of £110m worth of bonus shares, but agreed to forgo 50% of the second half of the award following intense criticism. Despite anger over the level of pay, the policy was narrowly approved by shareholders as nearly a third abstained from the vote and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against. Sears conceded to MPs that the pay row had become a debacle and admitted Persimmon had made mistakes. She said: “We would have handled it better if we’d have had earlier and more joined up communication with shareholders. I think our communication was right in the end but it was late and that wasn’t good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/08/black-panther-best-tv-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T10:59:09Z","webTitle":"This week’s best home entertainment: from Black Panther to Flowers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/08/black-panther-best-tv-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/08/black-panther-best-tv-this-week","fields":{"headline":"This week’s best home entertainment: from Black Panther to Flowers","bodyText":"Black Panther Last year’s monster-grossing Marvel mega-hit, Black Panther is as politically charged as it is entertaining.

The contract required a £500 deposit, followed by another £500 six months later and then the third £500 a year before the wedding. We have already paid £1,000 but the venue insists this is non refundable. I don’t believe it has incurred any costs and is reselling the date. HL, Crossgates, Fife The Vu, via its solicitors, insists that the charges stand because they are stated in the contract. “Typically, wedding bookings with our clients are made approximately two years in advance,” it says. “Within a shorter booking period the demand is reduced and our clients may require to discount their price. The deposit retained gives our clients the flexibility to offer such a discount.” It also gives The Vu flexibility to pocket the money if it manages to resell the date at full price. The Vu may be on shaky ground. In February, Trading Standards in Scotland announced the results of an investigation into wedding venue contracts and found that unfair terms are a “regular occurrence”, especially non-refundable deposits and excessive cancellation charges. A blanket “no-refunds policy”, which does not take into account individual circumstances, may be unenforceable under the Consumer Rights Act. The Competitions and Markets Authority has also warned events organisers that deposits should be a small percentage of the total booking price and customers should not forfeit large advance payments if they cancel with due notice. The Vu says it cooperated with Trading Standards officers as part of a review of its contract terms last year, and that it is confident its terms and conditions are fair. West Lothian Council confirms that officers visited the venue. “We offered advice on potential unfair contract terms in relation to significant amounts to be paid upfront by customers,” it says. Officers have also since contacted The Vu over your complaint. “We advised that any contract term which sought to withhold significant sums, unless direct losses have been incurred, could potentially be deemed unfair. “Ultimately, it is for the courts to decide if a contract is unfair, and we understand that both parties have been taking legal advice.” If you need help, email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Both the UK and the EU are determined to avoid a hard border – physical infrastructure, officials, checks – between Northern Ireland and the republic after Brexit. The government believes the key to doing this is a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement, but the EU fears Theresa May’s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and ECJ jurisdiction make such a deal unlikely. It also thinks there is no time to conclude one (it could take many, many years) before the transition period ends in December 2020. The government has proposed two customs solutions: a partnership, under which Britain would collect import duties on the EU’s behalf, and a high-tech “max-fac” alternative, but the EU has rejected both as unworkable. So Brussels has insisted the UK sign up to a legally binding “backstop” clause, or fallback option, to ensure there is no hard border. What did Britain sign up to? Back in December, the UK agreed that in the absence of any other solution, Northern Ireland would remain in “full alignment” with the EU’s single market and customs union rules in all relevant sectors. But after the DUP’s 11th-hour intervention, it also guaranteed no border in the Irish Sea – sowing the seeds of its current dilemma. The legal text that followed, drawn up by the European commission, stipulated that until a workable solution was found, Northern Ireland would be part of a “common regulatory area ... and customs territory” with the EU to ensure free movement of goods across the Irish border. May dismissed this as unacceptable because it implied creating a customs and regulatory barrier between Northern Ireland and the UK and promised to publish a counter-proposition, which the government has now done. So what is the UK’s backstop proposal? In essence, the UK’s proposal is for the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union for a limited period after the end of the transition period – so it would leave the EU in March 2019 and the single market in December 2020, but stay in the customs union for longer. The idea is “to apply a temporary customs arrangement ... between the UK and the EU” that would allow the UK to sign free trade deals with other countries (but not implement the parts of them relating to tariffs, rendering them largely pointless). The proposed UK backstop “will only be in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced”, which the government “expects” to be the end of December 2021 at the latest. So is this the answer? Hardly. First, there is no clarity on who calls time on the backstop and when. This is a problem: pro-Brexit ministers and MPs would like the UK to be able to declare it over unilaterally, so those trade deals can kick in. But the EU (including Ireland) did not agree in December, and is unlikely to agree now, to a time limit that could end with the Irish border problem still unresolved: a temporary backstop is not a backstop. The UK document is therefore a fudge: it tries to set a time limit without actually setting one. But the EU also points out that the UK undertook to maintain full alignment for Northern Ireland with the relevant rules of both the customs union and the single market, and this paper only addresses the former. There is no agreement, either, on whether ECJ jurisdiction will apply during the backstop period. Finally, the EU is unwilling to accept the whole of the UK remaining in the customs union and single market without the obligations of membership. Why is all this important? Because under the agreed terms of the Brexit negotiations, there can be no withdrawal agreement until every part of the deal is agreed. That means that without a legally binding backstop clause there can be no transition deal, no outline accord on the future relationship – and no withdrawal agreement. And without a withdrawal agreement, Britain crashes out of the EU in what almost all experts agree would be a catastrophic no-deal Brexit in March 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/08/oceans-8-girl-gangs-female-crime-movies","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"Stealing screen time: Ocean's 8 and the rise of female crime gangs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/08/oceans-8-girl-gangs-female-crime-movies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/08/oceans-8-girl-gangs-female-crime-movies","fields":{"headline":"Stealing screen time: Ocean's 8 and the rise of female crime gangs","bodyText":"In 1924, a 19-year-old girl in a seal fur coat strolled into a Brooklyn grocery, asked the clerk for a dozen eggs, and pulled out a gun. The newspapers went wild for the Bobbed Haired Bandit, and they mourned when Celia Cooney’s string of brazen thefts put her in jail. How dull. Cooney was the first famous female crook of the Hollywood age, a symbol of a major cultural shift where women left the home to earn an independent living just like a man. (Even illegally.) Consider Cooney the wicked godmother of the all-female thieves in Ocean’s 8, a sequel to the hit heist franchise that stars Sandra Bullock as George Clooney’s ex-felon sister, Debbie Ocean. Together with Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina and Rihanna, she schemes to slip a $150m diamond necklace off actor Anne Hathaway’s neck at the Met Gala. Gary Ross’s slick comedy is designed for fabulous gowns, not factual accuracy. According to the FBI, while male thieves scheme in packs, criminal women tend to work either with a boyfriend or alone. Still, Hollywood has drooled over girl gangs ever since, well, 1954’s Girl Gang, an exploitation flick about a Fagin-esque mobster who hooks beauties on heroin to manipulate them into doing his evil will. Fierce, yes – feminist, no. Soon after, schlock legends Ed Wood and Roger Corman got into the act with the B-movie nasties The Violent Year and Teenage Doll, which at least let brutal women call the shots. Like Rebel Without a Cause, these drive-in movies tried to tap into larger themes about nihilism and bad parenting. Unlike James Dean, the actors were cast for their ability to fill a push-up bra, and their films mainly marketed to men with taglines like: “See what happens behind the locked doors of a pajama party!” These trash flicks claimed to be ripped from the headlines, promising audiences that real life wild women stalked the earth – and if you were lucky, you could be their next victim. The iconic Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! makes that pledge upfront. Its opening narrator swears: “This rapacious new breed prowls both alone and in packs, operating at any level, any time, anywhere, and with anybody. Who are they? One might be your secretary, your doctor’s receptionist – or a dancer in a go-go club!” Faster, Pussycat! director Russ Meyer knew his three buxom thieves were on the wrong side of the law, but the right side of the 1960s culture war. Sure, they’ve barged into an old man’s house armed with knives and cleavage to loot his hidden fortune. But to audiences, the coot deserves it for sniping: “Women! They let ’em vote, smoke and drive. Even put ’em in pants! And what happens? A Democrat for president!” Alas for Faster Pussycat! lead Tura Satana and her fellow femme fatales, they usually ended the film dead. Just like the hardliner judge who feared Cooney could inspire a generation of bombshell bandits, these early B-movies couldn’t let criminals go free. Not that actual women were running headlong into a life of sin. Today, only 7% of bank robbers are female, which makes real life lady villains so rare that many do get turned into flicks that can truly claim they’re ripped from the headlines. Take the 1999 Kingwood stick-up spree where four middle-class high school girls grabbed rifles and robbed a string of fast-food restaurants in Texas. “We kept saying: ‘I can’t believe this,’” the arresting officer told People magazine. “It was like a movie.” Two years later, it was: the teen comedy Sugar &amp; Spice, in which a clique of cheerleaders sticks up a bank in order to fund their best friend’s accidental pregnancy. The girls coordinate their plan with Barbie dolls and study Point Break like a blueprint. As ringleader Marley Shelton chirps: “All we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.” This time, the ladies live. So do the spoiled snots in The Bling Ring, based on the true story of a pack of gossip magazine-obsessed girls who break into celebrity mansions to steal Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan’s designer threads. Unlike the earlier exploitation flicks, today’s girl gang films are less interested in punishment or titillation. (Unless they’re the critically panned 2004 groaner Taxi, which concocted a posse of bank-robbing Brazilian supermodels headed by Gisele Bündchen just to watch them strip their disguises down to bikinis.) Instead, directors like Sofia Coppola are interested in the satire of a cabal of superficial kids stealing from people who aren’t much different. The joke is that no one deserves designer loot – and when chief troublemaker Emma Watson gets caught, she convinces the media that crime was merely part of her “spiritual journey”. To Coppola, society is the ultimate mark. On the opposite end of the moral spectrum, F Gary Gray’s 1996 thriller Set It Off is an attack on how capitalism consistently finds ways to pay women less money than men, particularly women of color like leads Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Vivica A Fox and Kimberly Elise, who play four janitors desperately trying to scape together a living wage. To them, holding up a bank is fair revenge – banks and bosses have forever skimmed from their paychecks, too. In Set It Off, ladies steal simply because they don’t have better options, as though the promises of Celia Cooney’s generation of working women never came to be. Twelve years later in Mad Money, another semi-biographical flick riffing on the 1992 Loughton Bank of England thefts, where a female janitor at an incinerator convinced her co-workers to smuggle £600,000 in set-to-be-destroyed bills, woman are still weighing the cost benefits of being wives, serfs or crooks. When Queen Latifah (yes, again – she also stars in Taxi), asks Diane Keaton what she calls trading sex for money, Keaton quips: “A good percentage of marriages.” What separates these all-girl gangs from all-guy heist flicks like Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects and Lock, Stock &amp; 2 Smoking Barrels is the sense that men go looking for a fight. Women in these films, however, are used to fights coming to them: a world that demeans their work, limits their opportunities, hooks them on smack, and forces them to single-handedly support their children. Crime is merely the best of bad choices. Even Tura Satana is just looking for a better way to make cash than go-go dance for goons – and you sense she’s been putting the con on men since puberty. Kidnapping and robbery are just the next level up. Oceans 8 is the first all-female flick that makes crime look glamorous. Finally, Sandra Bullock’s girl gang is allowed to be smart, capable and sexy – a rare combination in an already rare illegal career path, which is what convinces her the ladies can get away with the jewels. As Bullock smirks: “We will not be the prime suspects.” Soon, however, women like them will. Ocean’s 8 is launching a new trend in ladylike larceny. Next year, Elizabeth Moss, Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish will team up for DC adaptation The Kitchen, about a cabal of 1970s wives who take over a gangster syndicate when their husbands are sent to prison. Before then, Viola Davis and Michelle Rodriguez lead a four-lady team of bandits when their spouses are slain in Steve McQueen’s Widows. “The best thing we have going for us is being who we are,” swaggers Davis in the trailer, “because no one thinks we have the balls to pull this off.” If their crime wave is a bigger success than Celia Cooney’s drugstore muggings, maybe they’ll inspire more real-life girl bandit gangs – who in turn will inspire even more movies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/10/katharine-whitehorn-grateful-men-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T04:59:42Z","webTitle":"To Katharine Whitehorn, from two grateful men | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/katharine-whitehorn-grateful-men-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/katharine-whitehorn-grateful-men-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: to Katharine Whitehorn, from two grateful men","bodyText":"A shame that your feature on the wonderful Katharine Whitehorn included no eulogies from men (“Dear Katharine… This is how you changed our view of the world”, Focus).

With more of Whitehorn’s gift for examining self as well as others, we might now be living in a less divided world. Steve Gooch Robertsbridge, East Sussex While I agree with the comments of your contributors to the piece on Katherine Whitehorn, I did feel there was a gap: the grateful male. My thank-you for her work goes back to her little volume, Cooking in a Bedsitter. My mum gave me a copy when I left home in 1970. The simplicity of her approach and language led me into cooking so easily that the joy of preparing good food remains with me to this day. However, so enthusiastic was I that I overlooked her beginner’s index. With no understanding of what a clove of garlic was, I chopped up two bulbs of garlic for her spaghetti bolognese recipe. For two days, my flatmate and I found lots of space in the busy pub we frequented. Ian Lowrie Brighton NHS reform, part II Seb Taylor (Letters: “A blueprint for NHS reform”) asks: “Who will pay?” and gives one answer: “Proportional contributions should be drawn from all constituencies, through an amalgam tax…” But there is a more radical and just solution. A general tax rise would be unnecessary if we elected a government that cared about the NHS, a government determined to end the obscenity of tax havens, offshore loopholes, non-dom farce and sweetheart HMRC/business deals. HMRC’s leadership has to be shaken up, its workforce doubled or tripled, employing people with tenacity, not in awe of the powerful, given real teeth to do their job of tax collection, not forgetting investigation into “accountancy” firms specialising in aggressive tax-avoidance schemes. That government must also legislate for worker representation on the boards of major companies and financial institutions in order to bring some sanity to the level of boardroom pay. Coupled with Mike McGrath’s suggestion (also Letters) of scrapping Trident, we would suddenly find enough revenue to enable a well-governed Britain to become a society to be proud of. Eddie Dougall Walsham le Willows Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk A level playing field for all The general secretary of the Independent Schools Council believes that schools “having a broad social mix which reflects our society is incredibly important” (“Private schools ‘abuse charity status’ by giving discount to richer families”, News). How incredibly naive. Of course it’s “incredibly important” but it’s the sector she represents that not only fails to meet the wishes of many of its original founders but also perpetuates the grossest of current educational inequalities. It’s “incredibly important” that the independent sector is not just reformed but abolished altogether. Colin Richards Spark Bridge, Cumbria Breaking silence on abortion Jess Phillips writes that her decision to have an abortion was not a big deal (“I had an abortion and I will keep fighting for this right for all”, Comment). In the course of a two-year study into the Abortion Act (1967), we have found just one example of an MP being similarly prepared to talk publicly about a personal decision to end a pregnancy. In 1966, in the debates leading to the introduction of the act, Edward Lyons MP told parliament how he and his wife had decided to terminate her pregnancy following her exposure to rubella. MPs’ reluctance to speak about this aspect of their lives reflects a wider silence and stigma. While abortion may be a very common medical procedure, Phillips is the first MP to break this silence in over five decades. That is certainly a big deal. Professor Sally Sheldon and Dr Clare Parker (University of Kent), Dr Gayle Davis and Dr Jane O’Neill (University of Edinburgh) All praise to the director Anyone reading Rachel Cooke’s article about A Very English Scandal would be led to conclude that Russell T Davies’s scripts had somehow magicked themselves into three wonderful TV hours without benefit of director (“A Very English Scandal, a timeless portrayal of the human heart”, Comment). In fact, for supervising the excellent performances, the visual reproduction of the UK in the 60s and 70s, the witty music and graphics and the pace of editing, we have to thank Stephen Frears. Karl Sabbagh Bloxham, Oxfordshire Time to move on, Germaine I agree with Barbara Ellen (“Germaine, your shock-jock musings just alienate today’s young feminists”, Comment). As a 64-year-old feminist, I feel Germaine Greer has little understanding or empathy for the devastating life change rape inflicts. It is a criminal act, not “bad sex”! She and Jilly Cooper are reflecting the paradigm of the 60s, believing the patriarchy that men need sex and women just have to give. Disappointingly, it feels like she’s back to the time of blaming the woman for the rape and for complaining. As a woman who marched against violence, I am proud to see my two daughters and their generation carry the mantle for all those women who went before, still fighting. So please, Germaine and Jilly, start listening to younger women and move on. Janet M Ferry Newcastle upon Tyne Not so splendid isolation Interesting that Conservative Brexiter Crispin Odey cites Elizabeth I as a role model (“‘Replace May with Gove to sort out Brexit’ – Tory donor”, News). During this period of isolation from Europe, the country was essentially broke and Elizabeth was forced to rely on pirates (“privateers”) to steal Spanish gold. When the armada arrived, the queen ran out of money to pay the sailors and worried that if the Spanish landed, the local militias would fight each other rather than the enemy. Deja vu, anyone? Will Fuller Lewes, East Sussex Erring on the side of caution Nick Cohen (“The unsavoury alliance between oligarchs and London’s top lawyers”, Comment) refers to lawyers Anthony Julius and Geraldine Proudler when he says: “I’m sure in private they love investigative journalism, freedom of expression and the right to hold the powerful to account. Perhaps the firms to which they belong love money more.” I commend Nick for the necessary bravery required in making any such statement. My inkling, however, is that he is being unnecessarily polite. Anthony Douglass Durham Sob stories Come on, Barry Glendenning, a list of “the most ridiculous and embarrassing circumstances imaginable” that result in copious male sobbing has to include the final episode of Friends (“There’s no shame in football turning into the crying game”, Sport).

Rozzi, who was 13 at the time, had just been raped by his priest, the Rev Edward Graff, and remembers thinking in that moment, as he ran through a field, that he would take his terrible new secret to his grave. When he got home and was peppered with questions by his mother – a Sicilian from Messina who sensed something was wrong – he lied and said Graff had dropped his towel in front of the boys. He did not tell her about the things he came to understand as an adult – that Graff had groomed him for months, by secretly talking to him about sex, plying him with alcohol and showing him pornography. It had all culminated in his vicious rape by Graff in a shower, where Rozzi can still recall staring at the tiles and wondering if he should stay or run. Rozzi did not, in the end, take his secret to his grave, and nor did hundreds of other victims. This month, the state attorney general in Pennsylvania is expected to release an 884-page report that will detail decades of clerical sexual abuse and cover-ups by the Roman Catholic church in six of Pennsylvania’s eight Catholic dioceses. The report has not yet been made public, but has been shared with the bishops in the six dioceses: Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton. The report, which followed a grand jury investigation, comes two years after a separate state inquiry into another Catholic diocese, Altoona-Johnstown, found that hundreds of children had been abused by more than 50 priests in the last few decades. The results of the latest investigation could reignite a debate over the church’s poor handling of sexual abuse cases, even as Pope Francis has sought to come to grips with another clerical abuse scandal in Chile, where all of the country’s bishops recently offered their resignation. In a letter to the Chilean bishops that was leaked to the media, Francis accused the Chilean hierarchy for lying about clerical sex abuse, destroying evidence and moving priests even when there was evidence of previous wrongdoing. The acts were examples of “grave negligence”, Francis said. Rozzi, who is now a state legislator and has been a staunch advocate for the rights of sexual abuse survivors, said he had not yet seen the grand jury report, but expected it to list hundreds of priests, and hundreds of their victims, and how the church covered up abuse. In his own case, Rozzi later learned that Graff, who has since died, was moved from parish to parish until he ended up in a Catholic-run rehabilitation centre. After being released, he is believed to have abused more children in Texas. “It is going to be the worst grand jury report in American history on sexual abuse cases, because it is going to be expansive,” Rozzi said, adding that it would also include testimony by priests and nuns about sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of other priests. “It will be the same stories over and over again. Of sexual abuse, of rape and cover-up,” he told the Guardian. The Vatican declined to comment. Rozzi said he expected that the report would also disclose new details of efforts by elected officials and community leaders to try to block legislation that would support abuse victims. So far, efforts by Rozzi to pass legislation that would allow previous victims to sue the church have ended up being blocked following lobbying campaigns by the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, which Rozzi said has in the past unleashed 39 lobbyists to lobby 50 state senators. The question Rozzi is asking now is will the church change its approach now that Francis has expressed deep regret over the previous inaction in Chile? The efforts to block new laws on behalf of survivors has been led by the conservative archbishop of Philadelphia, Charles Chaput. A spokesman for the archbishop did not immediately comment. “We are asking the pope to intervene. I would love the opportunity to talk to Francis and let him know what is going on, and for him to do what is happening in Chile, and to ask those bishops in Pennsylvania to resign,” Rozzi told the Guardian. Rozzi said the latest example of the church’s obfuscation came recently, when he was told that some bishops – who were not named by the court – had made a request that the release of the grand jury report by blocked. Their request was denied. The diocese of Allentown – one of the six – said it was not involved in the effort. In a statement, it said it welcomed the release of the report. “This story needs to be told,” the diocese said in a statement on its website. For Rozzi, the pain of his past can feel too much to bear, a fact he has discussed openly with his family and in an emotional interview with the Guardian. “It is time for them to accept responsibility and say we are going to turn the corner and do what is right and take care of our own,” Rozzi said. “All this has led to the destruction of our faith and physical and mental problems we live with for the rest of our lives. I can tell you it is not getting better, it is getting worse, as I get older.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/11/poor-peoples-campaign-protest-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:00:18Z","webTitle":"Activists channel Martin Luther King with new national climate campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/poor-peoples-campaign-protest-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/poor-peoples-campaign-protest-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Activists channel Martin Luther King with new national climate campaign","bodyText":"The Poor People’s Campaign’s attempt to stage a “moral revival” across dozens of US states echoes much of its 1968 antecedent – a guttural cry to shake America from a miasma of racism, poverty and militarism. But the modern version has also opened up a new battleground – the environment. Last week, as several hundred protesters tried and failed to gain entry to the Kentucky statehouse, concerns over healthcare roiled the crowd. But the campaigners also decried the pollution of air and water by the state’s mining industry, which has sickened residents and contributed to a sprawling, existential crisis – climate change – that was barely on the horizon when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. “The police were blocking us from the statehouse, which tells us that even people with black lung aren’t welcome there,” said the Rev William Barber, a North Carolina pastor and a rousing progressive voice who has taken on King’s mantle in the campaign, referencing the disease suffered by some coalminers. “We understand the connection between systemic racism, voter suppression and ecological devastation. They are interlocking injustices and we can’t ignore any of them.” Black majority churches are increasingly speaking out on environmental issues, jolted by reams of evidence showing that people of colour are far more likely than whites to live next to sources of harmful pollution such as coal plants and landfills. The toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan, as well as high-profile pipeline protests such as the one staged by the Standing Rock tribe in North Dakota, have also helped install the environment as a central plank in the Poor People’s Campaign. This has set up a theological collision with some evangelical conservatives who view the Earth as a resource for humans to exploit. “God has blessed us with natural resources. Let’s use them to feed the world. Let’s use them to power the world,” Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and devout Christian, said last year. Under Pruitt, the EPA has moved to roll back dozens of regulations aimed at maintaining clean air and water. Barber is derisive of this attitude, which he says stems from a disastrous misunderstanding of a passage in Genesis in which God gives man “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth”. “Dominion in this sense means to care for, not destroy,” Barber said. “The first commandment is to take care of creation. To destroy creation is fundamentally irreligious. It’s a violation. It’s a sin. Pruitt says he believes in God but you’ve never seen him pull out scripture that shows Jesus said we must help corporations poison the water. “You get white so-called evangelicals who say they are against abortion but say nothing about environmental devastation that is destroying lives and stunting children. The president may have chosen the worst person to run the EPA but ultimately Earth is the only place we have to live. A lot of people of faith are now articulating that not taking care of Earth is an affront to basic theology.” Barber, a 54-year-old man who walks with the aid of a cane due to an advanced type of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, grew up with an acute appreciation of clean air and water. A pulp mill near his North Carolina home “filled the air with all sorts of smells and toxins”, Barber recalls. His father, also a pastor, helped workers at the mill get adequate insurance to help pay for cancer treatments. Since then he has helped galvanize his flock against toxic waste dumped in rivers in North Carolina and Virginia, visited black families in Alabama who endure raw sewage in their back yards, headed north to see the retreating ice in Alaska and allied with the Apache tribe over concerns a copper mine will taint their drinking water. “This is real for me,” Barber said. “Where there’s pollution a community will get a cold but poor people will get pneumonia. The love of money is the root of all evil and it’s the root of all environmental devastation. It’s a dangerous self-destruction.” The Poor People’s Campaign is demanding the US shifts to 100% renewable energy, curbs oil and gas drilling and ensures clean drinking water for its citizens. These goals stem from an environmental movement that King did not live to see or fully embrace. But there is evidence King was cognizant of what was at stake, praising the beauty of the world and lamenting that “cities are gasping in polluted air and enduring contaminated water”. Just five months before he was shot, King’s famous speech A Christmas Sermon on Peace contained key ecological touchstones. “All life is interrelated,” he said. “We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality.” Last year, Barber met with Pope Francis, who has perhaps now eclipsed Al Gore as the world’s most famous environmentalist. The pope’s 2015 encyclical called climate change “a global problem with grave implications” and warned the Earth is “beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth”. Francis added that Christians who believe that God “invites us to subjugate the Earth” are mistaken. There are allies closer to home, too. Black pastors have started to organize various outreach efforts to engage their communities on issues such as climate change and energy efficiency. “We focus on the election, we focus on poverty, we focus on Black Lives Matter,” said the Rev Kip Banks, a senior pastor in Washington DC. “Equally important is the environment.” While stressing the urgency of climate change can be a hard sell, the presence of heavy industry, asthma-ridden children and foul smells is immediately apparent to the communities that are burdened with them. “We are called upon to care for the Earth, not deplete it,” said the Rev Leo Woodberry, who spearheaded a campaign to halt a proposed wood pellet mill in the small North Carolina town of Hamlet, a majority black area already surrounded by a cluster of industrial plants. “African Americans are far more likely to have asthma, our children are more likely to die than white children,” he said. “People stand up in church and say they need a respirator. We are pushing and pushing and pushing so that something is done about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/07/bank-of-england-interest-rate-setter-hints-at-rise-in-august","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T15:39:28Z","webTitle":"Bank of England interest rate setter hints at rise in August","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/bank-of-england-interest-rate-setter-hints-at-rise-in-august","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/07/bank-of-england-interest-rate-setter-hints-at-rise-in-august","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England interest rate setter hints at rise in August","bodyText":"The chances of an August rise in interest rates have increased after one of the most cautious policy setters at the Bank of England signalled support for higher borrowing costs. Sir Dave Ramsden, one of Threadneedle Street’s deputy governors, said the economy seemed to be coming out of its early 2018 soft patch at a time when wage pressures were mounting. Ramsden, one of only two members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee to vote against last November’s quarter-point increase in official interest rates to 0.5% said that in the absence of further tightening of policy, inflation would breach the government’s 2% target. In a speech in London, Ramsden said the low level of earnings growth had been key when he adopted a wait-and-see approach to higher interest rates in November. However, he added that wage growth had been rising steadily for the past six months. “The period of unusually subdued growth in wages appears to be coming to an end.” The Bank decided against raising rates in May, despite strong hints of a move, after a run of weak economic data in the weeks ahead of the MPC’s meeting. Ramsden said the evidence since the meeting appeared to confirm the committee’s view that the slowdown would prove temporary. “It is still early days. We are still only two-thirds of the way through the second quarter, less far through the second quarter data cycle, and only a month has passed since our last MPC meeting. “Even so, the data we have had so far suggests our interpretation of the slowdown in the first quarter as temporary looks to be being borne out. Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys. That included the latest services PMI [purchasing managers’ index] output balance, representing 80% of the economy. So far at least our May judgment looks on track. “Looking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC’s best collective judgment as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust. I expect GDP growth to resume at a steady but unspectacular pace and demand to continue to rotate away from consumption and towards trade and investment.” Ramsden said that even this subdued pace of growth would be enough to exceed the Bank’s new lower speed limit, which has been lowered as a result of the economy’s feeble productivity performance in the decade since the financial crisis. Unemployment was on course to fall to 4% and a small margin of excess demand would open up. Ramsden said that without the three quarter point rate rises expected by the financial markets over the next three years inflation would stay persistently around 2.4% and so be “materially” above its target. “This does not seem a desirable outcome. Inflation persistently above target and a sustained period of excess demand would represent a failure to meet our remit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/08/cbi-cuts-forecast-uk-economic-growth-brexit-concerns-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T05:01:02Z","webTitle":"CBI cuts forecast for UK economic growth as Brexit concerns linger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/08/cbi-cuts-forecast-uk-economic-growth-brexit-concerns-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/08/cbi-cuts-forecast-uk-economic-growth-brexit-concerns-eu","fields":{"headline":"CBI cuts forecast for UK economic growth as Brexit concerns linger","bodyText":"Britain’s leading employers’ organisation, the Confederation of British Industry, has warned the UK economy will shift down a gear this year and risks remaining in the slow lane because of Brexit. Cutting its growth forecasts for the year, owing to heavy snowfall in the opening months of 2018 and lingering fears over Brexit, the CBI said it expected the growth rate for the British economy to slow to 1.4%, from 1.8% last year. The rate of GDP growth is then forecast to fall further still, to 1.3% next year, as the UK leaves the EU. The downgrade comes as business groups become increasingly worried about the lack of progress being made by ministers in talks with Brussels, amid divisions between senior cabinet members. Business leaders fear there will be little progress made before parliament breaks for its summer recess next month. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, said companies needed to know how they would access the single market and customs union after Brexit. The summer recess is seen as an important cut-off point because ministers will need to go to Brussels with a clear plan for crunch talks in the autumn. “There’s a real danger” no progress would be made before the recess, she said. “The transition deal in March was a huge step forward but a lot of businesses are now saying they still need to know what’s happening after 2020 … We just haven’t had enough clarity on the customs arrangements and access to the single market.” Official figures show investment by businesses fell by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018, which is thought to have been triggered by the lack of clarity over Brexit, making companies wary about spending on major projects. Although the CBI forecast a return to growth in spending in the months to come, fuelled by investment in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, it warned uncertainty would continue to bite hard. Alpesh Paleja, principal economist at the CBI, said: “While many companies are turning their attention to AI, automation and streamlining operations to stay competitive, there is only so much that they can do when Brexit uncertainty continues to loom large.” While the outcome of the referendum has triggered a damaging slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, the employers’ body warned there would be little to cheer struggling retailers. Dozens of high street chains have announced plans to cut jobs and close stores across the country, including Marks &amp; Spencer and House of Fraser. Hard-pressed Britons reined in their spending amid weak wage growth and high levels of inflation, triggered by the sudden drop in the value of the pound immediately after the Brexit vote. But although the CBI said the worst of the squeeze was over, it expected spending growth to remain subdued. The business body forecast the contribution of consumer spending to GDP growth would fall by a third in 2018, and by a further 40% next year. Despite the sluggish growth rate, the CBI said the economy was probably still strong enough to withstand a rate rise from the Bank of England. Pointing to the return of real wage growth earlier this year, it forecast a rate rise from as early as August, with another two hikes for the cost of borrowing next year to reach 1.25%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-07T18:49:46Z","webTitle":"Sidney Poitier obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sidney Poitier obituary","bodyText":"Sidney Poitier, who has died aged 94, was the first black actor to win an Oscar in a leading role, in 1964, for his performance in Lilies of the Field. This simple story about a handyman helping German nuns build a chapel in Arizona was enhanced by its star’s humour and vitality. It led to a string of successes – To Sir, With Love, In the Heat of the Night and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (all 1967) – which made Poitier a box-office star and consolidated his growing fame and wealth. But Poitier’s greatest achievement – alongside his friend and occasional rival Harry Belafonte – was to help alter the racial perceptions that dominated not just Hollywood, but also society in general. His success came against seemingly insurmountable odds. He was born two months prematurely into extreme poverty in Miami, where his Bahamian parents, Evelyn (nee Outten) and Reginald Poitier, had gone to sell their tomato crop. The family remained in the US for three months before returning to Cat Island, where Sidney spent his early childhood. They moved to Nassau in a vain search for a better life. Sidney left school aged 13 to help support his family. A couple of years later, his parents sent him to New York to stay with an older brother. After a series of menial jobs, in desperation at the cold weather he joined the army – giving his age as 18. Having worked unhappily in a physiotherapy unit, he engineered a discharge, faking a psychiatric disorder. In an attempt to escape washing dishes for a living, he attended an audition at the American Negro Theater in Harlem where – virtually unable to read – he was firmly rejected largely because of a strong Bahamian accent. According to his autobiography This Life (1980), the turning point in Poitier’s mostly unhappy early years came with this rejection. For months afterwards he worked in restaurants and, through conversation and the radio, changed his speech so dramatically that on a second audition the group accepted him. He agreed to work as a cleaner in the theatre while doing his training. The tall, athletic and dazzlingly handsome Poitier was cast in an all-black production of Lysistrata in 1946, which was followed by another play, Anna Lucasta, and a role in a military documentary, From Whence Cometh My Help (1949), which introduced him to the screen. His Hollywood debut was No Way Out (1950); adding years to his age, he landed the role of a doctor who is racially harassed by a hoodlum. Despite good reviews, Poitier was hardly inundated with offers, since Hollywood was only just creating worthwhile supporting roles for black actors. He moved abroad for his next part, in Zoltán Korda’s rather ponderous version of Alan Paton’s novel Cry, the Beloved Country (1951), in which he played the Rev Msimangu in support of the veteran black actor and activist Canada Lee. The film was partially shot in South Africa, where Poitier was introduced to the horrors of apartheid, when he and Lee were housed outside town and segregated in all respects. A few minor roles followed, but Poitier mainly supported his wife, Juanita (nee Hardy), whom he had married in 1950, and children, by running a restaurant in New York. A turning point came when he was given the role of a student (cast 10 years below his true age) in Richard Brooks’ explosive Blackboard Jungle (1955). As a mixed-up kid, in a mixed-race school, he was at last in a hit movie – made famous by Bill Haley’s soundtrack, which featured Rock Around the Clock. He worked on the engaging Goodbye, My Lady (1956), directed by William Wellman and starring the child actor Brandon De Wilde, then Brooks cast him in Something of Value (1957), set in Kenya. But the parts were few and Poitier believed this stemmed from a political blacklist as well as racial discrimination. Another break came with A Man Is Ten Feet Tall (1957), an adaptation of a TV drama in which he had played the same role. His character, a dockworker, was something of a trademark Poitier part: good-hearted, tolerant (to a point) and a balance to the white lead (in this case, John Cassavetes). As Hollywood, rather than New York, belatedly tackled racial themes, Poitier gradually emerged as a star. After being noble in Band of Angels, and married to Eartha Kitt in The Mark of the Hawk (both 1957), which was funded by a religious group, he was offered a part in The Defiant Ones (1958). At the insistence of his co-star, Tony Curtis, Poitier shared top billing above the title – a breakthrough for the period. He and Curtis gained Oscar nominations for their roles as antipathetic convicts chained together and on the run, and Poitier received best actor awards at the Berlin film festival and from Bafta. A setback came with Porgy and Bess (1959), in which – contractually forced into playing Porgy – he was swamped by MGM’s lavish studio version of Catfish Row and Otto Preminger’s lumpen direction. In contrast, A Raisin in the Sun (1961) was a successful film of the groundbreaking play with which he had triumphantly returned to Broadway in 1959. Now in his 30s, Poitier achieved what other black actors only dreamed of – steady work in leading roles. The low-budget Lilies of the Field (1963) brought him not only an Oscar but also another award at the Berlin film festival. He became busier – to the detriment of his marriage, which ended in 1965 – with films including, that year, The Bedford Incident, in which he was cast as a journalist, a role that, significantly, did not depend upon his race. After a western, Duel at Diablo (1966), he played a teacher in the British-made To Sir, With Love, based on ER Braithwaite’s autobiographical bestseller. The movie proved a huge, unexpected, hit and Poitier, having negotiated a share of the profits to keep the budget low, became increasingly wealthy. That rather naive view of British school life was followed by two major successes. In the Heat of the Night offered him the role of Virgil Tibbs, the Philadelphia cop who falls foul of bigotry in a Mississippi town, where the racist southern sheriff (Rod Steiger) is at odds with the immaculate cool of the black detective. He and Steiger interacted superbly under the director, Norman Jewison. It was arguably Poitier’s best performance, but it was Steiger who got the Oscar nomination (and won). Stanley Kramer’s Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner completed a box-office hat-trick and further challenged race barriers. Poitier played a handsome doctor brought home by the daughter of a wealthy couple; his presence tests the parents’ liberalism, especially when the youngsters announce they are getting married. The movie is now routinely dismissed by critics as contrived and over-earnest. At the time, few considered it soft and Poitier soon found that it held the ring of truth when, after a long relationship with the black actor Diahann Carroll, he married the white actor Joanna Shimkus, provoking hostility from some quarters. Poitier co-wrote and starred in a romantic comedy, For Love of Ivy (1968), and followed it more controversially with The Lost Man (1969), co-starring Shimkus. A revamp of the classic Odd Man Out, it cast him as a black radical on the run – rather than the IRA fugitive of the 1947 original. Twice he revived his most famous role, in They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1970) and The Organisation (1971). Sandwiched between these mediocre works was Brother John (1971), in which Poitier was cast as an angel descending on an Alabama town to see whether racism had lessened since his mortal time there. One can see why he was tempted by gutsier roles. To escape the rut he turned to direction, taking over Buck and the Preacher (1972), starring as a freed slave with his pal Belafonte (stealing the movie) as a conman priest. The film humorously upended many cliches. Several of the films he directed were as the result of a newly formed company, First Artists, with Poitier, Barbra Streisand, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman each undertaking to make several films within a specified time. Only Newman and Poitier maintained their quota. In fact, Poitier was to direct eight more films, starting with the sentimental A Warm December (1973) and ending with the lamentable Ghost Dad (1990). Few were as enjoyable as his debut, although some – notably Uptown Saturday Night (1974), A Piece of the Action (1977) and Stir Crazy (1980) – were commercial hits. Their greatest, if oblique, value was in giving sustained work to fellow black actors. Towards the end of the 1970s Poitier moved to semi-retirement and his acting parts, including The Wilby Conspiracy and Let’s Do It Again (both 1975), were hardly satisfying. He narrated a documentary about his hero Paul Robeson and stayed off screen for several years. In 1988 he re-emerged in a brisk thriller, Little Nikita, playing an FBI agent on the track of spies. The film co-starred River Phoenix, with whom he reunited in the enjoyable caper Sneakers (1992). The same year he also received the American Film Institute’s life achievement award – the first black actor to receive the accolade. It ushered in another busy period, including To Sir, With Love II, made for television in 1996; a portrayal of Nelson Mandela in Mandela and De Klerk (1997), also for television; and the political thriller The Jackal (1997), in which he played the FBI’s deputy director. He published two more memoirs, The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography (2000) and Life Beyond Measure: Letters to My Great-Granddaughter (2008). In 2002, almost 40 years after his groundbreaking Academy Award victory, he was awarded an honorary Oscar for his performances on screen and “for representing the industry with dignity, style and intelligence”. This view was echoed not only in his numerous awards for acting. In 1974 he had been given an honorary knighthood; in 2009 he received, from Barack Obama, the US presidential medal of freedom; and in 2016 he was awarded the Bafta fellowship. He also served as the non-resident Bahamian ambassador to Japan between 1997 and 2007 and was concurrently the Bahamian ambassador to Unesco. A daughter from his first marriage, Gina, died in 2018. He is survived by Joanna and their daughters, Anika and Sydney Tamiia; and by three other daughters, Beverly, Paula and Sherri, from his first marriage. • Sidney Poitier, actor and director, born 20 February 1927; died 6 January 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/17/summer-review-karl-ove-knausgaard-seasons-quartet","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"Summer by Karl Ove Knausgaard – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/17/summer-review-karl-ove-knausgaard-seasons-quartet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/17/summer-review-karl-ove-knausgaard-seasons-quartet","fields":{"headline":"Summer by Karl Ove Knausgaard – review","bodyText":"It’s a slightly confusing situation for Karl Ove Knausgaard fans that while the sixth and final part of the My Struggle series has still to be published in English (due later this year), a whole different cycle – the Seasons quartet – has filled the intervening lull. The fourth book of that quartet is Summer, which again mixes diary entries and a selection of personal encyclopaedia entries ostensibly addressed to his youngest daughter, along with a piece of fiction set during the second world war and based on a story his grandfather told him, which he drops tantalisingly into his writing almost like an actor suddenly changing character. It’s been an uneven series, by turns showing Knausgaard at his finest, as a writer grappling to see the world with utterly fresh eyes, and his most banal, trotting out his familiar tropes of domestic duties and bucolic descriptions. For those of us who entered a kind of deep narcotic state before the mesmerising sensory overload of My Struggle, the Seasons quartet has been a bit like a methadone programme: keeping withdrawal at bay without ever quite hitting the spot. The last book, Spring, was the most revealingly autobiographical, and thus most Knausgaardian as we’ve come to think of it. It touched on the strains within his marriage, in particular with regard to his wife Linda’s bipolar depression, and Knausgaard once more subjected his own behaviour to candid and often unflattering analysis. Despite the uplifting note on which Spring concluded, the marriage that filled hundreds of pages of My Struggle and produced four children has since ended. Though there is no sense of its impending demise in Summer, Linda has scarcely more than a walk-on part, a silent presence in the margins, referred to mostly only by her absence. Summer begins with Knausgaard continuing his encyclopaedic summaries of things and concepts. Having in the previous books written mini-essays on such diverse subjects as thermos flasks, pain, jelly fish, sexual desire and manholes, he turns his singular attention to slugs, bats, fainting and electric hand mixers, which, he notes, unlike almost everything else human-made, resemble nothing else in nature. Cars are like beetles and vacuum cleaners like elephants’ trunks, but the electric mixer is made in its own image, a labour-saving device that is usually more effort than it’s worth. Knausgaard examines this idea and ends his essay with the image of jogging humans – the only creatures that run aimlessly. It’s a charming but head-scratching piece poised elusively between the absurd and the profound – a description that applies to most, if not all, the entries. They can be enjoyed for the ideas and images Knausgaard conjures seemingly out of nowhere, or at least out of such everyday material to which most of us give so little thought that nowhere might as well be their provenance. Why are slugs “repulsive, deeply undesirable and loathsome”? Because, Knausgaard suggests, they are naked and smooth like internal organs, “little lungs creeping around by themselves”. That essay ends with the writer cutting a big brown slug in half with a pair of sharp scissors, causing the slug to scream, “low and shrill”. The conceit of the series is that its prime audience is his youngest daughter. It’s a notion that is severely tested by so much of what Knausgaard wants to discuss and the manner in which he discusses it, but in one respect it works very well, because it enables him to unearth the mysteries of the commonplace with a kind of childlike awe. The essay on fainting concerns a scene I witnessed, which was Knausgaard collapsing at a literary party – not as a result of the usual cause at such gatherings, an excess of alcohol, but rather an excess of self-consciousness. It’s a recurring theme in his writing, which manages at once to be supremely self-conscious and gloriously liberated from authorial policing. If his daughter does ever read these books, she will learn – if she doesn’t already know – that her father is worried about how his teeth appear, that he is hopeless at small talk, that he fears his penis is too small (though it is actually “a little bigger than average”) – and that he’s also greatly troubled by why he would want to reveal such a private detail. He is also, she will realise, endlessly curious about the world.

She decided to stay off the site, because parents, she thinks, should not be friends with their children on Facebook. “Because I am Danish,” she explains. “I don’t think you should follow too closely what your children are doing on Facebook because they might want to have some free space where no mother is hovering over their shoulder.” Vestager does have an official Facebook page, an online diary of her life as the EU’s competition commissioner, one of the biggest jobs in Brussels. The page details work done – her recent announcement that the EU had settled a seven-year dispute with Gazprom, a record €2.4bn (£3.7bn) fine on Google in 2017. But there are also snaps from everyday life (reposted by staff from her Twitter account) – the wide blue skies of Jutland or traditional homemade New Year cake (kransekage) – a tower of marzipan decorated with EU and Danish flags that she baked for a staff party. Some European lawmakers would like this non-Facebook user to investigate the mighty social network, which is used by a quarter of the world’s population. When Mark Zuckerberg donned a suit and tie to meet MEPs last month, he was asked whether he had created a digital monster. Facebook has “too much power” was the blunt verdict of the German centre-right MEP Manfred Weber, a close ally of Angela Merkel. Over at commission headquarters, Vestager is not rushing to judgment on whether Facebook has too much power. “It is difficult to answer in general because you would need first to have a theory of harm,” she says in an interview. “It is not a problem to be big in Europe. You are more than welcome to be successful. Sometimes people seem to think: ‘This is Europe, so probably they have some angry ideas about not being successful,’” she says, possibly in answer to US critics, who have accused Brussels of going after Silicon Valley’s biggest success stories. “A lot of people are using Facebook but the legal analysis is another thing,” she says, adding that an inquiry could only begin if the commission had substantial complaints or reasons to suspect abuse of a dominant position in the market. Other regulators, however, are taking a close look. Germany’s competition regulator concluded last year that Facebook abused its market dominance by gathering data on people without their consent. French authorities have said they may open investigations into Facebook and Google after an inquiry found that the two companies dominate the online advertising market. Facebook, which told the European parliament there were manyalternatives to its services, has described the German competition office’s report as inaccurate. Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Green MEP and one of the EU’s best-known privacy campaigners, would like to see Brussels open investigations. “Margrethe Vestager had a very good approach on getting on to market discrimination and unfair practices on the digital market. There is far too little on the challenges we are facing right now.” On his list of burning issues: Facebook’s use of non-Facebook users’ data, questions over Facebook’s compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, and the “illegal cross-use of data between Facebook and WhatsApp”. Facebook took over the messaging service in 2014 and promised antitrust regulators it would not match user accounts on the two platforms. However, it did exactly that and was fined €110m. “Everybody knew [this] would happen,” laments Albrecht, who thinks EU antitrust staff missed problems that would be thrown up by the merger. Vestager says the commission is following closely what the German cartel office is doing, “though there are differences between German law and European law and you cannot just copy-paste what is done in a German context”. Others would like EU antitrust authorities to think about the dangers that digital giants pose to democracy. “There is a competition problem in the dissemination of fake news,” says Agustín Reyna, the chief competition adviser at the European Consumer Organisation. Social media platforms “don’t have the economic incentive to stop fake news” he says because revenues depend on clicks and shares. Noting that the commission’s competition office has no inquiry into fake news, Vestager says she is concerned about the impact of social media. “One of my main worries is that we deactivate democracy because we retreat to our own private bubble and our private feed of things that we would like to hear accompanied by cat videos. If you don’t even agree on the world you live in it becomes very, very tricky to work out what problems you want to solve.” It is a theme she has spoken of at tech conferences around Europe, making her one of the few EU commissioners who is a name outside Brussels. Her profile, but above all her tough approach to Apple and Google, is rumoured to have made her Emmanuel Macron’s preferred candidate to become the next European commission president. Vestager, who has described Brexit as “unbelievably sad”, would be a more diplomatic figure than the current incumbent, Jean-Claude Juncker, known for his off-the-cuff jokes and unvarnished remarks. During Italy’s latest political crisis, Juncker infuriated Italians by saying the country needed “less corruption [more] seriousness”. Speaking before his remarks, Vestager played it safe: “It is not for us to interfere at all.” But the obstacles to the top role in the EU are formidable as the job is usually sewn up by the larger political groups on the left and right. For now, she will only declare that she would like another term as competition commissioner. If she had a second term “then we could get things done”, she says, sketching out a sweeping agenda. “Our economies are digitalising completely, everything: democracy, social relationships, agriculture, transport, health, public sector”. The task, she says, is “to figure out how to you make sure you have fair competition and that democracy still serves consumers when production and business models change as much as they will.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/08/big-tech-solution-problem-silicon-valley-digital-wellbeing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T08:08:47Z","webTitle":"Got a problem with big tech?

Big tech has the solution to that!","bodyText":"Do you find it hard to relax and switch off because you spend so much time on your phone? You just need to download another app. The popular New Zealand station Sleep Radio, which plays ambient music to help its listeners doze off, is now available on smartphones, to help people who use their devices late at night. Listeners have been tuning in from around the world. Meanwhile, Apple has announced a suite of new tools for the next iPhone operating system that allow you to set time limits on how much you use particular apps, and quieten the flood of notifications. Apple’s new system is called Screen Time, while Google, which plans similar features for its next Android phone operating system, speaks of “digital wellbeing”, a particularly sinister marketing buzzphrase. Is there a new kind of digitally enabled wellbeing that is somehow more exciting than boring old analogue wellbeing, of the sort you might experience while looking at a tree? I’d better install something that lets me experience it. Neither company, of course, really wants you to use its products any less. It was recently reported, indeed, that Apple is quietly looking to make more money from targeted advertising, since growth in iPhone sales has slowed. It is in the interest of both corporations to have you looking at ads for as many hours of the day as humanly possible. At the same time, they are aware of big tech’s increasingly tarnished reputation since the Snowden revelations and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Studies link social-media use to anxiety and depression, and a movement is growing in Silicon Valley called Time Well Spent, which calls for more humane design that reduces the time we spend on devices. (Earlier this year, citing Time Well Spent, Facebook changed its newsfeed in a way that supposedly encourages users to spend less time on the site while having more fun.) Rather than wait for sterner regulation to be foisted on them, Apple and Google are going on a PR offensive to seem concerned about their users. Rather than solving the underlying problems themselves, however, they are shunting on to us yet more soul-sucking digital management busywork. The real paradox here remains that of trying to help people be less addicted to products that are engineered to be as addictive as possible. Smartphones, social media sites and the like are full of design decisions – such as pull-to-refresh, or infinite scrolling – that actively hijack the brain’s reward system. They create what the behavioural psychologist BF Skinner, in his studies of animal conditioning, called a schedule of “intermittent reinforcement”, which he found was a very good way to maintain a particular behaviour in lab rats. Now we are all lab rats, desperately pawing the lever in our digital Skinner boxes in the hope of the next crunchy info-pellet. Even the mere knowledge that your smartphone might buzz with a new message while you are doing something else has been found to disrupt attention. Few people have the psychic fortitude to follow the example of the technology critic Evgeny Morozov, who locks his internet router and phone in a safe when he wants to do some work. Given all this, the promise that new functions in these machines will help us break our addictions might seem rather cynical. It’s as though every pack of cigarettes came with free nicotine patches. Still, what else are we going to do? The idea of just not using our tech so much is unthinkable. Better to trust that, as Homer Simpson said of alcohol, technology is the cause of, and solution to, all life’s problems. And the paradigm of tech actively helping you not to use it could profitably be extended to other areas. Tinder could do the drudge work of rejecting boorish suitors with an algorithm that writes your brush-offs for you. Uber could refuse to take you to the pub and suggest the walk would do you good. And rather than autoplaying the next episode in the series you are binging on, Netflix could sternly tell you it’s 2.30am, that you are slumped on the sofa covered in crisps and really should go to bed now, and then turn itself off. I could go on, but my laptop has just warned me that I’ve exceeded my sarcasm quota for the morning. • Steven Poole is the author of Rethink, You Aren’t What You Eat, Unspeak, and Trigger Happy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/07/dating-apps-sti-crisis-tory-cuts-sexual-health","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T14:09:00Z","webTitle":"Dating apps didn’t cause the STI crisis – it was cavalier Tory cuts | Nichi Hodgson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/dating-apps-sti-crisis-tory-cuts-sexual-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/dating-apps-sti-crisis-tory-cuts-sexual-health","fields":{"headline":"Dating apps didn’t cause the STI crisis – it was cavalier Tory cuts","bodyText":"When Public Health England (PHE) warned of a growing syphilis and gonorrhea crisis this week, the report initially seemed like the stern wake-up call needed to help the thousands of people around Britain currently unable to access sexual health services. Revealing a 20% increase in cases of syphilis in just one year and a 22% rise in those of gonorrhea, the report promised “new numbers and frequency of tests in populations at higher risk of infection, to promote early detection and treatment”. And action is vital. Local authority funding for sexual health services is at an all-time low (cut by £64m in the four years to 2017), six key London clinics were closed, and regional clinics are now facing their own cull, leaving some patients to travel 25 miles or more to seek help. But then came the twist. “Sexually transmitted infections pose serious consequences to health,” Gwenda Hughes, head of STI surveillance at PHE, told the Times (paywall). “It is likely to be a result of condomless sex. We’ve got these apps and they enable people to find partners much more quickly.” Apps, people. Damn those apps. If only you wouldn’t go online and make a connection, you could keep yourself clean of sexually transmitted diseases once and for all. If only you would, instead, embark on a long, chaste courtship and wait to make love to the partner you were to marry, you’d never find yourself struggling with syphilis, gonorrhea, or unwittingly passing an undiagnosed STI to your baby when pregnant. Right? Dating apps don’t cause STIs – lack of testing, poor education and a reluctance to use condoms do – which, by the way, is actively encouraged by some dating apps. The Inner Circle gives away Hanx condoms at its events. Grindr, which sends alerts reminding users to get tested for HIV, is in the process of exploring ways in which users can share their STI status. Sure, responsible businesses can help us lead healthier lives – but when government cuts are the real issue, why mention the apps at all? Technology can never replace clinical services, and a throwaway remark that insinuates apps are partly responsible for the rise in STIs lets the real villains off the hook. Young people may be having less sex than previous generations and waiting longer before they start, but it’s those aged 16 to 24, BAME individuals and men who have sex with men that are at the greatest risk of infection (hence Grindr’s efforts). Condom use is indeed down – while condom prices themselves rise. In fact, PHE admits that schemes to distribute condoms to young people only reach about 6% of those targeted. Yet clinics and education services that could get the message across about condom use and the importance of regular testing are ground down by year-on-year budget cuts. We know that more testing and greater condom distribution will keep more people safe. What we don’t know is where the money will come from. Despite the Department of Health’s own research showing that for every £1 spent on sexual health services, including contraception, the public purse saves £11, the government has so far not been forthcoming. This report is clear – we are facing a sexual health crisis. But let’s identify who is really culpable: a government with a cavalier and prudish attitude to our health, not a few million people on the digital quest for fun or – perish the thought – love. • Nichi Hodgson is the author of The Curious History of Dating: From Jane Austen to Tinder, and a sex and relationships broadcaster"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/07/westminster-decriminalise-abortion-northern-ireland-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T14:21:33Z","webTitle":"This is the cue for Westminster to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland | Elizabeth Nelson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/westminster-decriminalise-abortion-northern-ireland-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/westminster-decriminalise-abortion-northern-ireland-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"This is the cue for Westminster to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland","bodyText":"Goodness knows what Sarah Ewart must feel today. To have told publicly and repeatedly the heart-rending story of her own abortion in order to push for a change in Northern Ireland’s abortion laws, only to be told at the final hurdle that her partners in her campaign had no standing to support her case. That she may have won had she taken the case alone. She may well feel alone, just as so many women are when they travel from Northern Ireland to England and Wales for terminations. A technicality may seem like the worst reason to lose but today’s supreme court judgment on Northern Ireland’s archaic abortion laws is still a victory and another tool in the arsenal of campaigners. It should not, however, take another victim coming forward to tell her story, or take another court case, for change to come. Politicians must act. The supreme court judgment found that while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission did not have the legal standing to bring the case, its reasoning was correct: Northern Ireland’s restrictions on abortion in the cases of sexual crime or fatal foetal abnormality violate article 8 (right to private and family life) of the European convention on human rights. In stating clearly that the laws governing abortion in Northern Ireland are in breach of human rights, the court has leveraged more pressure on politicians to act. With Stormont lying stagnant, however, now is the time for Westminster MPs to legislate. On Tuesday, parliament held an emergency debate on repealing sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act (1861), the 19th-century law still governing abortion in Northern Ireland. There was widespread support on both sides of the house for both the debate and for a relaxation of the restrictions on abortion in Northern Ireland, while contributions from Northern Irish MPs ran like a feedback loop. This is a devolved matter, they said, and only Northern Ireland can tell Northern Ireland what to do. Many of their Conservative colleagues, including the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, were quick to join the devolution refrain, as their slim government majority still rests on the Democratic Unionist party and its insistence on continuing to oppress half of Northern Ireland’s citizens. More, actually, when taking into account its refusal to legislate for equal marriage as well as abortion rights. But human rights are not a devolved issue. MPs need to come to terms with this, as it is central to understanding why it is their responsibility and not down to politicians in Belfast. International human rights law makes it quite clear that it is the responsibility of the state party to the convention – the United Kingdom – to uphold and protect human rights within its jurisdiction. This includes the convention for the elimination of discrimination against women, whose committee also found that Northern Ireland’s abortion restrictions are in contravention of that same convention. And the supreme court made quite clear today that abortion law in Northern Ireland breaches human rights. Therefore, it is the duty of Westminster to act if Stormont will not – or cannot. Moreover, the Offences Against the Person Act (1861), when it was initially passed, applied to the entire UK (and Ireland). The 1967 Abortion Act merely provides defences against being prosecuted for having an abortion, under certain circumstances and still requiring the assent of two doctors. Rather than an extension of this act, campaigners want the decriminalisation of abortion across the UK, devolution or no. Devolution is not a valid reason for the denial of human rights for people who may become pregnant. It is not an excuse for oppression. It is not a cloak of invisibility to pull over our eyes when a small number of our elected representatives happen to be propping up an already cruel Tory government and don’t wish for the world to see the harm they are perpetuating in Northern Ireland. Why wait for devolution, when it is not a valid defence anyway? Why make more women leave their homes and their people to access healthcare, free or not? Why force us to continue to tell our stories publicly (as MPs Heidi Allen and Jess Phillips did on Tuesday, joining the chorus of hundreds who did so during Ireland’s repeal campaign) in order to win our rights? Like it or not, Westminster is the guarantor of human rights in the UK and it is incumbent upon MPs to translate Tuesday’s words into tomorrow’s actions and to finally uphold the human rights of women in Northern Ireland and across the UK by decriminalising abortion. • Elizabeth Nelson is an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/07/poundworld-asks-courts-to-appoint-administrators-in-bid-to-avert-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T14:52:36Z","webTitle":"Poundworld prepares to appoint administrators in bid to avert collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/poundworld-asks-courts-to-appoint-administrators-in-bid-to-avert-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/07/poundworld-asks-courts-to-appoint-administrators-in-bid-to-avert-collapse","fields":{"headline":"Poundworld prepares to appoint administrators in bid to avert collapse","bodyText":"Poundworld is preparing to appoint administrators as the struggling discount chain makes a last ditch attempt to avoid collapse. On Thursday the retailer, which has 5,000 staff, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator. The filing temporarily shields Poundworld from its creditors, giving bosses 10 working days to come up with a restructuring plan for the 355 store chain. Poundworld’s problems first surfaced in April when its owner, the American private equity firm TPG Capital, was said to be considering a plan to launch a CVA, an insolvency procedure that would enable it to reduce rents and close about 100 stores. Poundworld was acquired by TPG Capital for £150m in 2015 but it has struggled in the wake of the Brexit blow to sterling that pushed up the cost of imported goods. Last month, TPG used a CVA to close nearly 100 branches of its ailing restaurant chain Prezzo. In May it emerged that TPG had decided to cut it losses and was putting Poundworld, which started in 1974 as a market stall in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, up for sale. However with no deal done by Monday’s deadline, the company is using the moratorium provided by the court filing to try and put together an eleventh hour deal ahead of its next rent payment date, which is 24 June. Poundworld’s difficulties come as a string of retailers and restaurants seek to exit high street outlets in the face of rising costs and a squeeze on consumer spending. House of Fraser announced plans on Thursday to close 31 stores, putting a further 6,000 jobs at risk. Mothercare, New Look and Carpetright are all closing dozens of stores after creditors approved CVAs. The burger chain Byron and Jamie’s Italian restaurants have also closed outlets using the process. There may be some hope for Poundworld staff as turnaround firm RCapital is said to be discussing a rescue deal with TPG. The return of Chris Edwards, the company’s founder who sold out to the private equity firm, has also been mooted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/07/lush-removes-posters-undercover-police-spies-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T16:31:06Z","webTitle":"Lush removes police spies posters after 'intimidation of staff'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/07/lush-removes-posters-undercover-police-spies-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/07/lush-removes-posters-undercover-police-spies-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Lush removes police spies posters after 'intimidation of staff'","bodyText":"The cosmetics retailer Lush has removed posters highlighting the misconduct of undercover police from the windows of all its stores after saying that shop staff had been intimidated by former officers. The chain told of the posters’ removal on Thursday, saying it needed to protect staff in its 104 stores. The move came less than a week after it started the campaign to publicise the alleged wrongdoing of undercover officers who had infiltrated political groups. The Lush campaign was criticised by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and others, as being anti-police, poorly judged and potentially damaging to large numbers of officers who had nothing to do with the alleged wrongdoing. As part of the campaign the retailer put up posters of a model dressed both as apoliceman and an activist, with the slogans “Police have crossed the line” and “Paid to lie”, alongside fake police tape. There have been allegations that people disliking the campaign have been going into stores and intimidating staff to make them take down the posters. On Saturday, a day after the start of the campaign, Lush said some of its branches had removed the posters following “intimidation of our shop staff from ex-police officers and unhelpful tweets from those in high office”. Lush said in a statement on Thursday: “For the safety of our staff we have suspended the window.” It is unclear if the posters will be reinstated or replaced with another image at a later stage in the campaign, which is due to end on 18 June. The campaign, which includes a video, continues on its website. Working with groups campaigning for the victims of the undercover police, Lush is seeking to draw attention to the criticism of a much-delayed public inquiry that is examining the activities of police spies since 1968. One of the groups was Police Spies Out of Lives, which supports women who were deceived into intimate relationships with undercover officers. A spokeswoman for the group said: “We condemn the sort of threats that some Lush staff have experienced in the last few days.” She added that many members of the public had come into Lush stores and offered their support for the campaign. Following the criticism a large number of politicians, lawyers, union officials, victims, and a whistleblower, have defended Lush. Two former wives of undercover officers and the son of a police spy who abandoned him have also supported the retailer. Dave Smith, a trade unionist who was spied on, said he had seen that the displays had “been blanked out due to threats to staff”. He added: “All workers are entitled to a safe working environment – intimidation, abuse and threats are totally unacceptable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/07/how-luka-modric-and-dejan-lovren-got-caught-up-in-croatian-corruption-world-cup-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T15:30:46Z","webTitle":"How Luka Modric and Dejan Lovren got caught up in Croatian corruption case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/07/how-luka-modric-and-dejan-lovren-got-caught-up-in-croatian-corruption-world-cup-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/07/how-luka-modric-and-dejan-lovren-got-caught-up-in-croatian-corruption-world-cup-football","fields":{"headline":"How Luka Modric and Dejan Lovren got caught up in Croatian corruption case","bodyText":"On Wednesday afternoon, Zdravko Mamic, considered the most powerful figure in Croatian football, was found guilty on a set of charges that includes making illegal personal profits on player transfers from Dinamo Zagreb. The county court in Osijek ruled that the players in question, namely Luka Modric and Dejan Lovren, were unlawfully paid 50% of the transfer fees that Dinamo received for their services from Tottenham Hotspur and Lyon respectively, only to forward most of that money to Mamic, who was a Dinamo executive at the time, and his family. So how they do it? Mamic signed personal contracts with many players during their early development years, obliging them to share their earnings with him. In most cases, those players were represented by Mamic’s son Mario, a licensed agent. Meanwhile, acting as club executive, Mamic would put clauses in the players’ contracts specifying the split of any transfer fees between them and the club. Once they received that money, they would pay Mamic off. That much has not been disputed, even by Mamic’s defence. What the prosecution set out – and, according to the court ruling, managed – to prove was that in the case of Modric and Lovren those clauses were added and backdated after the players had been sold. Mamic was sentenced to six-and-half years in jail. His brother Zoran, head coach at the United Arab Emirates club Al Ain FC, received four years and 11 months. Damir Vrbanovic, the former Dinamo executive and now the executive director of the Croatian Football Federation, was given three years. For the ruling to become final it has to be confirmed by the Superior Court and that could take years. The defendants, who have denied all charges, also have the right to appeal, but Croatian law specifies that jail terms are effective immediately for any sentence of five years or higher. None of the three men were present in court to hear their sentences. In fact, Mamic was already in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he fled on the eve of the verdict. He holds dual citizenship and the country is not obliged to extradite him. Just after the sentence was announced, he held a press conference in his new home there, stating he has no intention of coming back. “I am not a coward – but not a masochist, either,” Mamic told the reporters, stating that he will fight the ruling. For years Mamic held key positions both at Dinamo and in the football federation, although he was forced to officially withdraw from them during the court case. Over time, he weaved a web of influence spanning far beyond football. He has friends in high places – politicians, judges, owners of media conglomerates, even police officials. The Croatian Football Federation has declined to comment on the verdict until it is final and Vrbanovic, shockingly, gets to keep his position there. Among the many questions regarding how the verdict will affect Croatian football, its influence on the national team, due to travel to the World Cup in just a few days, is one of the most intriguing. Modric, the national team’s captain, has already been charged with perjury in the Mamic case: during the investigation he asserted that the money split clause was added to his Dinamo contract only after he had been sold to Tottenham, but he changed his testimony in court saying the investigators had confused him and that the annex to his contract was signed much earlier. The trial date has not been set but the Mamic ruling supports the contention that Modric was not telling the truth, and if found guilty the Real Madrid midfielder could be facing six months to five years in jail. Lovren, who faced Modric in the Champions League final in Kiev last month, is being investigated for giving a false testimony as well and is expected to be charged. Both Modric and Lovren refused to comment, but one can only imagine what this means for the mood in the squad heading to Russia, where they are in group that includes Argentina, Nigeria and Iceland. Speaking on Wednesday, Mamic said he would “admire” Modric and Lovren if they “can now proceed to play at the World Cup”, before asking: “How will they find the strength when they know what the state has done to me?” There are others in Croatia’s World Cup, including Sime Vrsaljko and Mateo Kovacic, who had similar contracts with Mamic. And then there is Andrej Kramaric, the highest-profile case of a player who refused to sign with Mamic. Rumours of a lack of togetherness in the squad have been present for years, despite the federation’s extremely protective stance and a very limited access to players for the reporters, and it seems even more unlikely that they will come together around a joint cause in Russia. Domestic fans have been warning about corruption and wrongdoings in Croatian football for years, sometimes resorting to desperate measures such as interrupting matches, the most famous example of which took place during the Euro 2016 group game against the Czech Republic in Saint-Etienne.

Nothing, it seemed, could be too outre; be it cannibalism, self-immolation or a hapless scheme to steal a parcel of turf from Buckingham Palace’s lawn. The Paper Lovers returns to the present day and imposes an entirely new form of restraint, being set in an unnamed southern English city that seems “ordinary in every way except for the fact that it happened to have one of the world’s finest gothic cathedrals in the middle of it”. That might equally serve as a description of the book itself, which goes out of its way to appear almost unremarkably suburban and domestic, yet has a huge and unavoidable spiritual crisis tearing through its centre. In a key scene the protagonist, Arnold Proctor, pays a visit to the cathedral. As a middle-aged university lecturer, minor poet and committed atheist, his appreciation of the building is purely aesthetic. Today, however, he has come here to pray. Attempting to summon up some scraps of belief, Arnold reflects that the ancient stones have become “a solid expression of the agony of time … Something of that pain was now in his own body. The idea came into his mind that his own flesh and the flesh of the cathedral were entwined in some way.” So what can have brought an intellectual sceptic such as Arnold to his knees? A simple transgression of the seventh commandment would appear to be the answer – following two decades of untroubled marriage to Polly, who runs a shop in the cathedral close selling hand-crafted paper, Arnold has fallen madly in lust with Vera, a mainstay of his wife’s sewing circle who also happens to be a practising Christian. The story yields all the expected verities of middle-class infidelity: furtive afternoon assignations scheduled between lecturing and childcare commitments; slightly disappointing trips to nearby seaside resorts; the perpetual fear of discovery. What sets the novel apart is the particularity of Woodward’s observation and the stealthy insinuation that Arnold’s embrace of a lover might be leading him towards a wholly unexpected love of God. Vera’s spirituality initially strikes Arnold as a disincentive, yet she seems to possess the luminous penumbra of a Renaissance martyr floating on a cloud of pheromones. When she first attends a needlework session in Arnold’s living room he is particularly attracted by her scent: “The gorgeousness of her smell seemed to give her a halo, to make her shine, radiate. Indeed the scene before him was like a religious image, a depiction of an epiphany, the Adoration of the Sewing Maidens.” It is only later that he realises why this vision should have had such a profound effect: “It wasn’t the feminisation of the living room that had so disconcerted him, but its desecularisation. She had raised a little chapel in the heart of his own home.” Woodward’s way with metaphor reminds you that he, like Arnold, is a poet academic who cannot help noticing tea bags “puffed up with air like the anoraks of drowned trainspotters”, or “a miniature Manhattan of condiments” lined up in a greasy spoon. And the narrative takes a surprising turn when a troubled young poet calling himself Martin Guerre launches a one-man protest outside Polly Proctor’s stationery shop. The fact that he is dressed in a paper suit attracts little notice in a cathedral city inundated by twee street entertainers. But Martin (or Ryan, as he turns out to be called) bears a grudge, having been spurned by the small press that Arnold and Polly run as a sideline, producing limited edition pamphlets on artisan-crafted paper. Rather disconcertingly, Martin/Ryan’s poems describe a tortured allegory in which a boy made out of paper suffers unrequited longing for a figure closely resembling Polly herself. This introduces a discordant element to an outwardly conventional novel, but it is at least in keeping with the baroque turn of imagination that characterised Woodward’s earlier books. The writing is at its most lyrical in the passages reserved for Polly’s fascination with paper-making: When she lowered a frame into the pulp it sank into an impenetrable morass of broken-down matter, and when she lifted it out a perfect rectangle of paper held within the frame, dripping. It had to be treated as carefully and as respectfully as new-born life. If she thought about its origins, from the unstitching of the carbon-dioxide molecule to the felling of an elderly tree, it seemed a miracle more wonderful than anything dreamt up by religion. As a confirmed nonbeliever, Polly is ultimately more appalled by her husband’s faith than his infidelity. Woodward has crafted a subtle allegory of obsession and redemption in which the mysteries of paper-making closely resemble the Christian sacrament itself.

Japanese media said on Thursday the cabinet was preparing to approve the training programme as early as next week, in response to several high-profile sexual harassment cases, including one involving a senior bureaucrat at the finance ministry. Junichi Fukuda resigned as vice finance minister in April after he was accused of making sexually inappropriate remarks to a female TV reporter. He has denied claims published in a weekly magazine that he asked the woman if he could touch her breasts and suggested that they have an affair. The finance minister, Taro Aso, drew criticism for suggesting that Fukuda might have been entrapped and saying that sexual harassment was “not a crime”. The training programme could be approved as early as next week at a cabinet meeting on female empowerment headed by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, the Mainichi Shimbun said. Under the proposal, the cabinet office will monitor attendance at the training sessions and make it clear that participation is a precondition for promotion. Victims of sexual harassment will also be able to file complaints against government officials via independent counselors, the newspaper added. Abe has made increasing the number of women in the workplace a key part of his economic growth strategy, but Japan ranked bottom among G7 countries in the World Economic Forum’s latest global gender gap report. Abe has come under pressure from Seiko Noda, the minister responsible for women’s empowerment, to introduce legislation making sexual harassment a punishable offence, but Kyodo news quoted sources as saying that the government had yet to decide on her proposal. A recent survey revealed that dozens of women working for Japanese newspapers and TV networks have been sexually harassed, with government officials, police officers and MPs cited as the perpetrators in about a third of the cases. The foreign ministry said this week it had suspended Tadaatsu Mori, the director of its Russian division, for nine months following allegations that he sexually harassed a woman. On Monday, Kunihiko Takahashi, the mayor of a city near Tokyo, resigned following harassment allegations by several female employees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/07/turnbull-would-love-to-see-facebooks-zuckerberg-face-australian-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T03:59:44Z","webTitle":"Turnbull would 'love to see' Facebook's Zuckerberg face Australian MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/07/turnbull-would-love-to-see-facebooks-zuckerberg-face-australian-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/07/turnbull-would-love-to-see-facebooks-zuckerberg-face-australian-mps","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull would 'love to see' Facebook's Zuckerberg face Australian MPs","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull would “love to see the boss” of Facebook appear before Australia’s intelligence committee, as parliament grapples with new security threats wrought by global internet and social network giants. After coming to terms on the government’s proposed foreign interference and espionage laws, which are expected to have bipartisan support when the joint committee hands down its report later on Thursday, attention has turned to potential backdoor information sources. The Australian reported that Facebook is one of the big targets of the committee, after it was discovered the social network had made a deal with Chinese tech companies, including Huawei, which allowed information to be shared. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Facebook entered partnership deals with the Chinese firms Huawei, Oppo, TCL and Lenovo, and in a blogpost published on 3 June acknowledged that the firms were able to access Facebook data to create “Facebook-like experiences for their individual devices or operating systems”. Huawei in particular has been a flashpoint for Australia’s intelligence agencies and has been banned from involvement in government projects, including the national broadband network, amid concerns about its links to the ruling Chinese communist party. Now the intelligence committee wants answers on what was allowed to be shared and why. Asked whether Mark Zuckerberg should appear before the Australian inquiry, as he did at a US Senate committee, Turnbull said he would “love to see the boss”. “Naturally, he is the founder, but the important thing is everyone is paying a lot of attention to the issue of privacy,” the prime minister said. “And, of course, the question of whether people really know what is being done with their personal data. “And I think, you know, these social media platforms have developed relatively recently. You’ve got to remember it – Facebook – was only founded in 2005. It’s not a long time ago. “But they’ve become dominant in every respect, in the way people use them in their lives … So it’s important that we keep a very close eye on this and make sure that if people’s data is being used, it is being used in a way that they understand they have been able to consent to, and consented to with full information, knowing precisely what they are signing up for.” The government is inching closer on legislation that will force tech companies to allow access to encrypted messages when national security is considered at risk, with Angus Taylor due to head to Silicon Valley and meet with US tech giants.

Officers from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) found the carcasses on a property at Tubbut, which is on the edge of the Snowy River national park near the New South Wales border in East Gippsland. Guardian Australia understands that the eagles are alleged to have been poisoned. Four other protected species were also allegedly killed. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The penalty for deliberately killing the animals, which are a protected species under the Victorian Wildlife Act, is a fine of up to $7,928.50 or six months’ imprisonment. An additional penalty of $792.85 is applicable for each additional bird killed, which could push the maximum fine in this case to more than $90,000. A spokesman from DELWP said the matter was still under investigation and that charges had not yet been laid. “DELWP is taking this matter very seriously,” he said. The department has asked community members with any information about the alleged poisoning of birds of prey to report it to Crimestoppers. East Gippsland is a hotspot for wedge-tailed eagles, which are the largest bird of prey in Australia with a wingspan of up to 2.8 metres. Local landowners, who are reluctant to speak publicly about the issue for fear of reprisal, have told Guardian Australia that as many as 10 pairs have been seen at one time wheeling over the area the valley in which Tubbut lies. Photos posted publicly on Facebook and tagged Tubbut in April showed a dead wedge-tailed eagle alongside the carcass of a lamb, from which it had apparently been feeding. Guardian Australia does not allege that the person who uploaded the photo is the subject of a DELWP investigation. Wedge-tailed eagles have historically come into conflict with farmers for feeding on livestock, particularly lambs. Various Australian governments had bounties in place to encourage the killing of wedge-tailed eagles until the 1970s, when they were protected under law and numbers began to recover. They are now the most abundant large eagle species in the world. Victorian authorities have only issued three permits to kill wedge-tailed eagles in the past 10 years, resulting in the deaths of 12 birds. Sean Dooley from Birdlife Australia said the stigma against wedge-tailed eagles for killing livestock was unwarranted because they primarily ate carrion, or preyed on animals that were already very weak. “They’re primarily scavengers,” he said. “When they are seen at lambs, the lamb has probably already died.” Dooley said the number of eagles allegedly killed in this case was “disturbing,” and said that killing pairs of eagles to remove the species from the area was “an exercise in futility” because juvenile eagles would move into the vacant territory. The investigation into the eagle killings comes almost 12 months after DELWP issued a warning to farmers who were allegedly killing the birds in north-eastern Victoria. About 20 birds had reportedly been killed over a number of years in the same area in Yea, which is on the other side of the Great Dividing Range from Tubbut."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/20/fracking-labor-pledges-to-tighten-regulations-to-protect-water-resources","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T18:00:19Z","webTitle":"Fracking: Labor pledges to tighten regulations to protect water resources","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/20/fracking-labor-pledges-to-tighten-regulations-to-protect-water-resources","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/20/fracking-labor-pledges-to-tighten-regulations-to-protect-water-resources","fields":{"headline":"Fracking: Labor pledges to tighten regulations to protect water resources","bodyText":"Regulations on unconventional gas development across Australia would be tightened up if Labor wins the next election. Labor’s shadow minister for the environment Tony Burke says the party, if elected, will keep the commitment it took to the 2016 election to broaden the “water trigger” to include other forms of unconventional gas extraction. The current water trigger, introduced by the Gillard government in 2013, assesses water resources as a matter of national significance only in relation to coal seam gas and coal mining. It means that much of the country isn’t covered by the legislation, even though the process used to extract shale and tight gas is similar to that used for coal seam gas mining. “Anyone from an environmentalist through to a local farmer can see that that’s a glaring omission,” Burke said. “Underground hydrology is incredibly complex, and you really need to have a robust scientific process to understand what the impacts might be. “It could be that it all stacks up, but at the moment, without the water trigger being extended, those checks to see what the impacts are simply aren’t being done at a national level.” Burke said concerns about the impacts of mining developments on water resources were not limited to the east coast and the Great Artesian Basin. The Greens, who pushed for shale and tight gas to be included as part of the water trigger when it was introduced, said “anything that mandates closer examination of impacts on water or anything else is always welcome”. But the party’s environment and biodiversity spokesman Andrew Bartlett said there were other issues that also ought to be considered, such as greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts of projects on climate change, as well as the effectiveness of Australia’s existing environmental protection framework. “Anything that looks more closely at water and climate issues is good, but I think there are much wider things to be looked at,” he said. “We’re pushing for an overhaul of environmental laws.” Conservationists, scientists and regional communities are calling for renewed consideration of water protections at a national level, amid growing concerns about the legislative scope of the water trigger as well as the 2017 revelations of systemic non-compliance within the Murray-Darling Basin framework. Burke’s comments come after the Northern Territory Gunner government’s decision to reopen up to half of the territory to the unconventional gas industry, pending the implementation of some 135 recommendations from an inquiry into fracking. Up to 90% of the territory’s water supply comes from ground water and the bulk of its gas resource is shale, to which the water trigger doesn’t apply. One of the architects of the original water trigger, former independent MP Tony Windsor, says he would not have a problem with Northern Territory developments being captured by the water trigger, but he was wary that making the trigger too broad could render it meaningless. “There’s been a number of attempts to either remove or make meaningless the water trigger,” Windsor said. “If you apply the water trigger to every water resource everywhere, the practicalities of doing that make it meaningless anyway. “If you make every water reserve subject to it, they’ll [the government] just hand it back to the states.” The effectiveness of the water trigger is one of the terms of reference for the current senate inquiry into water use by the extractive industry. A statutory review of the trigger in 2017 found it was operating effectively within its legislative scope, including the application of independent scientific expertise to the consideration of the impacts of coal and coal seam gas mining on water. The Coalition does not support expanding the trigger and, in response to questions, environment and energy minister Josh Frydenberg said: “The effectiveness of the water trigger legislation was independently reviewed in 2017. No legislative changes were recommended.” But environment groups, who have been calling for tougher environment assessments in relation to water as part of broader reforms to Australia’s system of environment laws, said an expansion would be welcomed. Additionally the final report from the Northern Territory’s fracking inquiry specifically recommended the water trigger be expanded to apply to onshore shale gas. The territory’s chief minister Michael Gunner has promised all 135 recommendations of the fracking committee’s recommendations will be implemented in full. If followed through, this would require the current government to change its position on the water trigger. “The federal government were very enthusiastic when the moratorium was lifted but actually extracting that gas is going to be dependent on them,” said Jimmy Cocking, CEO of the Arid Lands Environment Centre. Evan Quartermain, Humane Society International’s head of programs, said the trigger’s current scope was too narrow. “While the 2017 statutory review found the current water trigger to be operating effectively within its legislative scope, its focus is too limited and should be expanded to assess significant impacts on key water resources beyond coal or CSG projects,” he said. “Recent revelations of alleged water theft, poor monitoring, systemic non-compliance and possible corruption have shaken public faith in Australia’s water management framework and strong oversight is clearly needed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/indonesia-plastic-rubbish-religious-leaders-join-fight-to-cut-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T00:26:00Z","webTitle":"Preaching against plastic: Indonesia's religious leaders join fight to cut waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/indonesia-plastic-rubbish-religious-leaders-join-fight-to-cut-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/indonesia-plastic-rubbish-religious-leaders-join-fight-to-cut-waste","fields":{"headline":"Preaching against plastic: Indonesia's religious leaders join fight to cut waste","bodyText":"Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest marine polluters, has decided to get religious – literally – about reducing plastic waste. The government has announced it will join forces with the country’s two largest Islamic organisations, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, using their extensive networks across the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation to encourage consumers to reduce plastic waste and reuse their plastic bags. Together the two Islamic institutions have more than 100 million followers. As part of the initiative, religious leaders will visit prayer groups across the country to preach about the importance of reducing plastic waste, explain how plastic waste can worsen the severity of natural disasters such as floods and landslides, and encourage consumers to switch to traditional bags, made from materials such as rattan and bamboo. “We have local wisdom about these things in Indonesia,” Fitri Aryani, from NU’s disaster mitigation and climate change agency, told the Guardian, “In the past we had more environmentally friendly practices and used traditional bags. We want people to return to that, to the times of their grandmothers when people would go out and not use so much plastic.” Environmental awareness and recycling programs, including teaching students how to make “eco-bricks” from discarded plastic, which have been run in several NU Islamic boarding schools in East Java for the past two years, will now be rolled out to the organisation’s wider networks. Globally, Indonesia is the second-largest contributor to marine plastic waste after China. Indonesia currently uses a whopping 9.8bn plastic bags per year, many of which end up in the country’s rivers and oceans, according to data from the Indonesian environment and forestry ministry. Indonesia has committed to cut its plastic waste by 70% by 2025. NU last month introduced “Ngaji Sampah,” or “Sermons on Waste.” The religious sermons are broadcast online once a month and use Islamic principles to promote sustainable consumption and environmental awareness. Levels of awareness about recycling and the environmental damage wreaked by plastic are low in Indonesia, where plastic packaging is ubiquitous, and the practice of burning plastic waste is common. A shocking video filmed earlier this year that showed a diver off Bali swimming through a deluge of rubbish caught the attention of the government, and has since been cited by the environment minister. Rosa Vivien Ratnawati, director general for waste management at Indonesia’s environment ministry said the government believes the declaration signed this week will have a widespread positive impact. “These are the two biggest Islamic organisations in Indonesia, and they have structures that go down to the village level so this initiative to reduce plastic bag waste will impact all their members,” said Ratnawati, “That is tens of millions of people throughout Indonesia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/07/moped-enabled-crimes-london-police-called-to-430-a-week-in-past-year","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T23:48:15Z","webTitle":"Moped-enabled crimes: London police called to 430 a week in past year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/07/moped-enabled-crimes-london-police-called-to-430-a-week-in-past-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/07/moped-enabled-crimes-london-police-called-to-430-a-week-in-past-year","fields":{"headline":"Moped-enabled crimes: London police called to 430 a week in past year","bodyText":"Police in London dealt with an average of more than 430 crimes committed using mopeds per week over the past year, it has emerged in the wake of a series of high-profile muggings in the capital. However, while the figures represent a sharp increase on the previous 12 months, police said moped crime has been falling steadily since last July and there were significantly fewer instances in the past four months than in the previous four. In the 12 months to May 2018, there were 22,025 such crimes, or about 423 on average per week, while in the previous 12 months there were 14,699, or about 282 on average per week. Yet the figures also show that scooter-enabled crime has more than halved in London since it peaked in July last year. In May, police recorded 1,154 incidents in which a scooter, moped or motorcycle was used to commit a crime, a fall of more than 55% since July 2017 when 2,593 offences were recorded. The news comes as a woman remains in a critical condition in hospital after she was attacked during a moped robbery in north London on Monday evening. The 24-year-old was punched by the pillion passenger after two men on a moped approached her, stealing her mobile phone and bag. The same day, comedian Michael McIntyre was robbed by moped thieves armed with hammers as he waited to pick up his children from school. The 42-year-old was forced to hand over a watch during the robbery after the windows of his black Range Rover were smashed with hammers. The Met has employed a range of new tactics to combat the surge in scooter-enabled crime over recent years, which has exploded from 827 incidents in 2012 to more than 23,000 in 2017. The police introduced slimline motorcycles that can drive down narrow streets, plus remote-control activated spikes and a fluorescent DNA spray which stays on skin for up to eight weeks in October last year. A new campaign to encourage drivers to lock, chain and cover their scooters and motorbikes has also been launched. More than 15,000 were stolen last year in London, accounting for about half of all vehicles stolen in the capital. Since the start of 2018, the Met has recorded a 22.2% reduction in scooter theft, but thousands of motorcycles were still stolen. Speaking at the police crime committee at City Hall on Wednesday, Met assistant commissioner Martin Hewitt said: “We are prioritising our resources where there is the greatest risk, harm and threat to communities. Moped-enabled crime is a huge priority and we’ve seen significant reductions.” The recent spike in moped crime has been felt mainly in London, but other areas are not immune. On Tuesday, thieves on mopeds forced a driver from his car at knifepoint on a residential road in Birmingham and stole the Ford Fiesta. A West Midlands police spokeswoman said: “We were called to an armed robbery on Beechwood Road , Birmingham at around 3pm yesterday afternoon [5 June]. “It is believed a number of people on mopeds, armed with knives, threatened a driver before making off in a stolen Ford Fiesta. Police arrived at the scene within minutes, but the offenders had already fled the scene.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/thursday-briefing-carry-on-liquidating-at-taxpayers-expense","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T05:30:28Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Carry on liquidating, at taxpayers' expense","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/thursday-briefing-carry-on-liquidating-at-taxpayers-expense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/thursday-briefing-carry-on-liquidating-at-taxpayers-expense","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Carry on liquidating, at taxpayers' expense","bodyText":"Top story: Carillion advisers ‘pocket millions’ after collapse Good morning again. I’m Warren Murray and here are the stories that matter. Accountants and lawyers will earn £70m managing the fallout from the collapse of Carillion, according to the National Audit Office, with taxpayers expected to foot a bill of more than £150m from the outsourcing disaster. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which earned £17m in fees from Carillion in the decade before its demise, now stands to make £50m more from managing the insolvency. Lawyers will pick up a further £20m slice of costs. The business committee chair, Rachel Reeves, said PwC’s bill was further evidence of a lack of competition among the so-called big four accounting companies. “They make a killing in fees advising struggling companies how to turn them round and then they pocket millions tidying up when that advice fails. On Carillion, taxpayers are left to foot the multimillion-pound bill for corporate failure.” Tens of thousands of subcontractors are owed more than £2bn by Carillion but they are slated to get just £164m. More than 2,300 staff were made redundant and a further 3,000 face uncertainty. Finding placements elsewhere for more than 1,000 of Carillion’s former apprentices is costing £12m. * * * Touchdown – Britain’s first four F-35 stealth fighter jets flew into RAF Marham in Norfolk last night, two months ahead of schedule. The officer commanding 617 squadron, Wg Cmdr John Butcher, landed the first one. “It was a good flight across from the United States. The weather was in our favour and it felt absolutely brilliant bringing the jets back here today,” he said. The UK’s £9.1bn programme to buy 48 of the F-35s, the world’s most advanced fighter jet, over the next decade has come under fire over capability and expense. Reports have suggested that the effective cost of each plane is as much as £150m. The jets will be jointly flown by the RAF and the navy. Five more are expected to arrive by late July or early August. * * * ‘She is unbelievably committed’ – Jeremy Hunt has told the Guardian that Theresa May is planning a significant funding boost for the NHS to coincide with the 70th anniversary of its creation, which falls on 5 July. The health secretary has asked for something in the order of the 4% annual increases it enjoyed before the Tory-Lib Dem coalition came to power in 2010. But the Treasury believes anything above 2% to 2.5% is unaffordable. Hunt has become the longest-serving health secretary with five years and 273 days in the job. In a detailed interview he has told Denis Campbell that Britain’s decision to leave the EU has contributed to NHS’s staff shortages; and that he is unlikely to be able to fulfil his pledge to boost the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020. The total number of family doctors has fallen by just over 1,000 since Hunt made the promise in 2015. “This is not a pledge that we’re abandoning because it’s a very, very important pledge for the NHS and with general practice. It’s just taking a bit longer than I had hoped,” Hunt said. * * * Mary Wilson dies – Jeremy Corbyn has led tributes to the widow of former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson. Mary Wilson, who was an accomplished poet, died yesterday aged 102. Mary Baldwin worked as a shorthand typist in a factory on the Wirral before meeting Harold Wilson, who became prime minister 24 years later. She published two volumes of poetry, Selected Poems and New Poems, in the 1970s and was friends with Jon Betjeman. “A wonderful poet and a huge support in Harold’s General Election victories,” said Corbyn last night. * * * End of Dacre era – The Daily Mail’s editor, Paul Dacre, is to step down in November after 26 years. Dacre will remain with the company as chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers.

The pheromones can either be extracted from the plants and used in traps, or the plants themselves grown alongside the crops they protect. They are specific to individual species and promise to avoid the harm done to all insects by neonicotinoids, which the EU has banned from outdoor use. Nicola Patron, from the Earlham Institute UK, says the project is important not only for British agriculture, but farmers in Africa where, for example, the armyworm has become resistant to existing insecticides. “There is an urgent need for a solution because otherwise people will starve,” Patron said. Lunchtime read: Toke and gesture Canada is headed down the road to legalising marijuana, with the government saying it could be decriminalised by August. Many pro-cannabis campaigners are critical of the Trudeau government’s plans to strictly regulate the industry, including selling it through government stores, jailing those who sell without a licence and criminal penalties for minors found in possession. New rules are being rushed out across the provinces in preparation – including rights for landlords to ban its use or cultivation on their properties and prohibitions on public consumption. “It’s not legalisation, it’s monopolisation,” says activist Ian Campeau. Existing dealers, who currently enjoy a lax enforcement environment, doubt it can work. Some lament that it marks the end of cannabis as a counterculture phenomenon. Meanwhile the Marijuana party is trying to work out what it will do with itself. Sport Danny Rose revealed he has had depression, which he believes was triggered by the treatment of a knee injury coupled with family tragedy. The England left-back also said that fears over racism at the World Cup led him to tell his family to stay away from Russia. Meanwhile, Gareth Southgate intends to maintain England’s bold attacking approach and has warned his defensive midfielders Jordan Henderson and Eric Dier that only one of them may start at the tournament. Tyson Fury used the final press conference before his comeback against Sefer Seferi to suggest that a world belt could be back around his waist far sooner than anticipated. John McEnroe expects Andy Murray to play at Wimbledon but would be surprised if the two-time champion has much more than a decent run there. And Philadelphia Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins, who has been a central figure in the NFL protest movement, has stood silently in front of reporters and displayed hand-written cards about the protests, gun violence and social injustice in the US. Business Asian shares have risen to a fresh two and a half month high, supported by sound economic fundamentals, while expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) could start to wind down its stimulus boosted the euro and global bond yields.

Now his death – while sitting alone at a table of the ubiquitous Canadian coffee chain – has cast a spotlight on the toll the city’s housing crisis is taking on Vancouver’s most vulnerable. Believed to be in his 70s and known to his friends as Ted, the man was a familiar figure at the Tim Hortons in the city’s downtown. Friends described him as a kind and easygoing man who had lived out the past decade at the 24-hour coffee shop, sleeping and eating at a table near the washroom. Witnesses said he may have spent hours slumped at his table last week, unresponsive, before a passerby alerted staff. “It is a nearly unimaginable scenario,” said Jeremy Hunka of the Union Gospel Mission. “To have somebody dying for hours in a public restaurant at a table, where customers are drinking their coffee, coming and going, and nobody is noticing this person’s dying breath.” His death has prompted renewed scrutiny of the link between the city’s red hot property market – where the average cost of a detached home hovers around C$1.8m ($1.4m) – and levels of homelessness that have soared to record highs in recent years. The number of homeless in the city is continuing to grow at a pace of about five people a week, said Hunka. “We need more housing, more supports, and more compassion.” In Ted’s case, he had been struggling to cover the cost of food and housing on a limited government pension. “He had worked all his life, but at low-paying working-class jobs,” said Judy Graves, an advocate for the homeless. She met Ted about four years ago, after he had already been diagnosed with cancer. For much of his life he had managed to scrape by, but an unexpected expense left him suddenly scrambling. Eventually he was left him without a roof over his head, she said. Ted, who had never been involved with drugs and wasn’t a big drinker, was terrified at the prospect of seeking help in the city’s Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, where most of the city’s shelters and affordable housing are located, said Graves. “And so he pretty much decided that he was just going to stay at the Tim Hortons where he still looked like a working-class guy, he blended into the population that came and went in that restaurant,” she said. “The wait list for senior’s housing is so long, he would have been dead before he got in, anyway.” Located a few blocks from Vancouver’s general hospital, the restaurant became his refuge as his body battled cancer, leaving him riddled with pain. While others patients were discharged to the comfort of their homes and into the care of friends and family, a lack of support for homeless people meant Ted had little option but to return to the Tim Hortons after being discharged. “That became his little home,” said Graves. It’s a story playing out across the country, as 24-hour fast-food restaurants replace shelters, she said. “I’ve been in all major cities across Canada and the picture is exactly the same. In the middle of the night, there are people sitting in fast-food places because there’s nowhere safe for them to go.” Vancouver’s rocketing housing costs have taken a particularly grave toll on those living on fixed incomes in the city. The number of homeless who are 55 years and over has soared from 10% in 2005 to 23% last year, according to the Union Gospel Mission. Many of them wouldn’t survive if it weren’t for the shelter offered by fast-food restaurants, said Graves. “I’m so grateful to those 24-hour restaurants because they’ve stepped up with old-fashioned neighbourly compassion and kindness in the way that the rest of society hasn’t.” In a statement, Tim Hortons said it was reviewing the details of the incident. “Like other members of the community, we were saddened to hear this news,” it said. “The individual was a regular at the restaurant and will be missed.” The fast-food sector – along with shopkeepers, transit officials and others – has been left to shoulder the responsibility of caring for those living on the streets, said Julian Somers of Vancouver’s Simon Fraser University. “We are forcing the issue into any place that has a bit of capacity to exercise some generosity, some warmth, some safety,” he said. “You get a guy like Ted, who is not only homeless and very ill, but he’s put one and one together and realises that nobody cares about him,” he added. “So he’s just going to live out his days, knowing that he’s sick and more or less resigned to eventually, probably dying in the Tim Hortons that he called home. It’s an incredible indictment of our society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/how-to-eat-risotto","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T13:56:17Z","webTitle":"How to eat: risotto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/how-to-eat-risotto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/how-to-eat-risotto","fields":{"headline":"How to eat: risotto","bodyText":"Baby food to its detractors and, even to its biggest fans, an ugly splodge of a dish, the subject of this month’s How to Eat, risotto, has nonetheless overcome such criticism to embed itself in the typical British cook’s mid-week repertoire. Yet the very reason for risotto’s popularity – its simplicity and apparent endless versatility (“If you cook your risotto well, then whatever other ingredients you use, it will work,” as the chef Ernst Van Zyl once put it, wrongly) – explain why this potentially delicious confection of butter, parmesan and amylopectin starches is regularly botched. What should be a viscous pottage of savoury pleasure is often nervously prettified and reinvented using bizarre ingredients, to its obvious detriment. Much as the mantecatura is essential to beat a creamy finish into a risotto, HTE is here to browbeat some sense into those who think strawberry risotto is a reasonable concept, and not a recipe for disaster. Yes, there are several savoury fruit risottos in iconic Italian cookbook, The Silver Spoon. But so what? The Italians may have invented risotto but (cf. the English and football), that does not mean they will always know what is best for it. Che cosa risotto? As ever, HTE defers to Felicity Cloake and senior Democratic politicos in matters of preparation and, self-evidently, outside Italy, risotto has morphed from a dainty primo to a big old bucket of a main course. But HTE must insist on two other points: 1) Risotto is made with stubby, short-grain rices, not any old pearl barley, spelt or bulgar wheat grains, much less orzo pasta. 2) Sensitive aesthetes that they are, chefs often feel the need to gussy up or hide risotto. They scatter it with cosmetic toppings or secrete it away under a handsome wodge of protein (lamb loin, sea bass fillet, chicken breast), as if it can operate as a component part of a meal. It cannot. Risotto is a self-contained meal. One within which all the constituent ingredients should be chopped and mixed so that you get a little of everything in each moist mouthful. That does not happen if you serve a piece of protein on a bed of risotto. Inevitably, you end up eating large pieces of meat with a smidgen of rice, almost as a condiment. It is a literally and metaphorically unbalanced approach. Osso buco, which, crucially, utilises a meltingly tender piece of meat, is the exception that proves the rule. Presentation That urge to gentrify risotto leads to various clangers. Adding some crunch on top: walnuts, pine nuts, pangrattato or other fried breadcrumbs, is a welcome textural fillip. Far less welcome are prissy parmesan wafers stuck in like rabbit ears, unnecessary dainty toasts served on the edge of the bowl or (ye gods!) amaretti biscuits crumbled on top. Generally, all such additions – the drizzles of olive oil or, worse, bullying truffle oil; swirls of pesto or gremolata; endless flurries of chopped parsley; chives crossed like a medieval warning sign – add nothing and often actively detract from the dish. Broadly, whatever you top your risotto with should also be included in it, be it nuggets of scallop or grated lemon zest, glistening wild mushrooms or batons of asparagus. Any toppings should reflect the risotto’s internal flavours, and must be distributed sparingly to ensure that they do not upset the rice:veg and/or protein ratio which should be 2:1 or more, in volume. This is a soupy rice dish. The rice must lead. Bowl or plate? Risotto is butt-ugly, but that is no reason to actively exacerbate its lack of visual sass. There are many admirable aspects to how closely wedded even high-end Italian food is to the nation’s peasant-cooking origins, but Italy’s eschewing of anything approaching “plate design” is perverse to the point of being self-defeating. While we tease our food into tweezer-tight, Insta-ready perfection, the Italians are still very much dumping stuff on plates. Take it or leave it. Flavour over beauty. You shallow idiot. The risotto is a classic in this regard. The confrontationally black squid ink risotto nero is the most extreme example, but, more generally, Italy tends to serve its risottos on flat or very shallow plates where it lies in an indiscriminate splat, as attractive as fresh cat sick. Even Michelin star chefs are at it. HTE once ate Marco Stabile’s “remembering my father” risotto, a dun-coloured dish of “forest flavours” which, thankfully, tasted far better than it looked. It would have benefited enormously, however, from a bit of colour in its cheeks and being served in a bowl. This spreading out of risotto on a plate – seen as a sacred law by some chefs – is justified on the basis that, when eaten from the outside in with a fork (question: who wants a fork’s prongs repeatedly scraping and clanging on porcelain as you eat?), this allows the risotto to cool readily, so that its flavours can shine through. That is readily achievable by simply eating from the outer edges of a bowl and/or blowing on your food to cool it down. With the added bonus that when eaten from a deep bowl (using a round soup spoon, not an oval dessert spoon), a risotto looks far more attractive and actively invites you to dig down into it. As opposed to a plate, a bowl conveys warmth, fullness, plenty. It promises cosy satiation through carbs. Ingredients There is a school of thought that, like pizza, risotto is a blank canvas on which you can apply any number or type of ingredient. If Ofsted inspected that school of thought, it would be deemed to be failing. It would be put in special measures. The head would be forced to eat a Thai-style or paella-inspired risotto and warned that, philosophically, they are fostering such hooliganism. You want to make bibimbap, egg-fried rice or jambalaya? Go ahead. They are fine dishes. But do not crossbreed them with risotto. Chaos will ensue. Instead, a risotto needs rules: 1) Beyond the basics of a classic risotto bianco (rice, stock, butter, onion, optional garlic, wine, parmesan), a risotto should include no more than two “extra” ingredients. You want those individual flavours to shine through in a complementary way. Anything more complex can quickly become a muddle. 2) Surprisingly, given how vehemently many observers object to the addition of cream (“Sacrilege! Blasphemy!”), several risotto recipes in The Silver Spoon include it. Authentic or not, HTE believes that a risotto’s creaminess should be achieved via starch, butter and cheese, not the addition of cream, mascarpone or a soft goat’s cheese, all of which can easily mask flavours and turn this into a heavy, overly rich, one-note dish. 3) In terms of ingredients, they must either provide a pleasant contrast to the texture of the rice (still al dente vegetables; vegetables roasted to achieve a lightly crisp edge), or in their slipperiness (mushrooms; flaked fish), elide smoothly with it, while remaining distinct. Dense, fibrous protein (eg chicken breast) or naturally sludgy, stringy vegetables (eg aubergine, spinach), are problematic here. In one of his cookbooks, Gennaro Contaldo talks of how “nice and mushy” pumpkin is in a risotto. HTE raises an eyebrow at this, to the point of muscle spasm. Those extra ingredients should not be on the point of disintegration. You should not be able to slurp a risotto. It should retain some bite. 4) With a few exceptions (prawns, mushrooms), all those ingredients should be chopped into diminutive pieces, 2cm square and smaller, so that they are evenly distributed throughout the risotto. 5) Do not put fruit in a risotto. Has HTE tried all the fruit risottos? No. Has it tried any fruit risottos? No. It is just one of those things, like golf, Liam Gallagher’s solo material or “spice”, that HTE knows, instinctively, without trying it, to be a malign force in the world. 6) Do not use any sort of blue cheese in a risotto. Blue cheese is not cooking cheese. When warm, its flavours go haywire, it becomes shrill and aggressive, sweaty and fetid. It stinks up the place. Like a stumbling drunk. 7) Do not use mint in savoury foods. Ever. Anything but the faintest hint, anything above a barely audible whisper, is like emptying a tube of Colgate into your mouth. Some nice things to put in a risotto Asparagus, peas, broad beans, fennel, lemon zest, chorizo and other fatty, coarsely ground sausages, bacon, Jerusalem artichoke, finely shredded radicchio, pumpkin and other squash (hard roasted; see also parsnips), courgette, celeriac, beetroot, cauliflower, wild mushrooms, seafood and smoked fish, pesto, soft herbs. Bad things to put in a risotto Squid ink (turns a risotto into a sticky, briny bore), spinach (like a hot wet rag in a risotto), aubergine, blue cheese, mozzarella (here, it becomes a kind of inescapable ectoplasm), tomatoes (incapable of maintaining your attention as the main flavour), fruit, truffle oil, prosciutto, varieties of cabbage (dull and inevitably left in large pieces so it flaps hot stock all over you, as you eat), scallops and crab meat, both expensive, delicate ingredients wasted in a risotto, dense meats such as duck, chicken, pork, lamb, beef. Cooked and woolly or smoked and jellified, salmon lacks the definition to distinguish itself in a risotto. When Evenings-only, when you can fully give yourself over to the ensuing carb-coma. So, risotto, how do you eat yours?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/11/trump-kim-summit-negotiators-north-korea-us-john-bolton","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T09:26:16Z","webTitle":"Meet the negotiators for the North Korea summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/trump-kim-summit-negotiators-north-korea-us-john-bolton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/trump-kim-summit-negotiators-north-korea-us-john-bolton","fields":{"headline":"Meet the negotiators for the North Korea summit","bodyText":"As Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un prepare for their historic summit in Singapore, both leaders have brought a host of courtiers to advise on the particulars of any agreement. The North Korean side is steeped in experience negotiating with Americans, while the US officials are a mix of Trump confidants and the small circle that hammered out the details leading up to the summit. The North Koreans Kim Yong-chol The four-star general and vice-chairman of the ruling Workers’ party’s central committee is the most senior North Korean official to have met Trump, hand-delivering an oversized letter from Kim that secured the 12 June summit. He has been at Kim’s side during his meetings with the South Korean and Chinese presidents, Moon Jae-in and the Xi Jinping. Observers say he is about 72 and has worked on relations with South Korea for decades, serving all three members of the ruling dynasty and leading a military delegation in talks between the neighbours as far back as 1989. He has never been shy about sharing his hawkish views and threatened to turn the US into a “sea of fire” with nuclear missiles in 2013. Despite swapping his military uniform for a black suit in the latest round of diplomacy, Kim Yong-chol remains fiercely loyal to his leader. He has been accused by South Korea of masterminding an attack that killed 46 sailors in 2010, and for shelling a border island, killing four. After the attack on the ship, the US put him on a sanctions list that prevents him from entering the country. He was granted a waiver from the US government for his White House visit earlier this month. He was also suspected of orchestrating the hack on Sony Pictures in 2014. Kim Yo-jong Kim Jong-un’s sister has emerged in recent months as a top official, sitting next to the leader during his inaugural meeting with Moon in April. She is vice-director of the party’s propaganda and agitation department and was the centre of attention at the Winter Olympics earlier this year. Her appearance, smiling and chatting freely at the opening ceremony, presented a softer side of a state better known for nuclear weapons and human rights abuses. She is reportedly the brains behind crafting Kim’s image as a man of the people: posing for photos with children at resorts, hugging soldiers and striking up an unlikely friendship with the former NBA star Dennis Rodman. In the paranoia-filled world of North Korea’s leadership, family members are more likely to be trusted and her views are likely to be given serious weight in policy discussions.. Ri Yong-ho Ri has been involved in the last two rounds of negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear programme, which both ended in failure. He helped work out the details of a deal for a nuclear freeze in the 1990s and was chief negotiator during the six-party denuclearisation talks that stalled a decade ago. He has been the foreign minister since 2016, a position earned through his skill in dealing with Americans. He is the mouthpiece of the regime and statements by two of his deputies caused Trump to temporarily cancel the 12 June summit. Ri has delivered several fiery statements, calling Trump “President Evil” in a speech at the United Nations and suggesting Pyongyang could detonate a nuclear weapon over the Pacific Ocean. But his strong public language is reportedly far from his true nature. He has been described as softly spoken and self-deprecating, is known to have a sense of humour and speaks fluent English. As foreign minister he has travelled more widely than most North Korean officials and he previously served as ambassador to the UK, Sweden and Zimbabwe. The Americans Mike Pompeo The secretary of state has been the main US architect of the summit, having flown twice in secret to Pyongyang to meet Kim. The first trip was in late March, when he was still CIA director, and even after his move to the state department the CIA has been the lead agency in pursuing contacts with the North Koreans. In the course of setting up the summit, Pompeo has mellowed. In July 2017, he was advocating regime change. When contacts began, he initially insisted that North Korea carry out complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament swiftly and all at once before it received any reciprocal benefits. He has since become increasingly flexible, in line with Trump, who abandoned the demand for all-in-one disarmament after Kim Yong-chol’s visit. The former army officer, congressman and ultra-hawk has emerged as a relative dove, personally invested in the success of the summit. John Bolton Bolton’s arrival as national security adviser has made almost everyone else appear dovish by comparison. A veteran of the George W Bush administration, in which he was a prominent cheerleader for the Iraq war, Bolton is a unilateralist on most foreign policy. In his memoir, he relishes recounting his success in torpedoing state department efforts to maintain contacts with Pyongyang. His claim in a television interview that the Trump administration would follow the “Libya model” in dealing with North Korea came close to derailing the summit, reportedly to Trump’s fury. He was not invited into the Oval Office when Kim Yong-chol visited, but he is travelling in the president’s party to Singapore. If Trump agrees to step-by-step, open-ended disarmament with Kim, it may be hard for Bolton to stay in the administration, as he has always insisted that acquiescence in a phased approach was the mistake made by previous administrations. Conversely, if the summit fails, Bolton’s influence on North Korean policy may rise, at Pompeo’s expense. Andrew Kim The top Korean specialist in the CIA has emerged in recent weeks, becoming a regular presence at Pompeo’s shoulder in talks with the North Koreans. He accompanied him on his two trips to Pyongyang, and was in the Oval Office when Kim Yong-chol visited. Born and educated in South Korea, he is the cousin of that country’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, who stunned the world in March with his announcement of the Kim-Trump summit. In May last year he was brought back from a short-lived retirement to run the CIA’s new Korea mission centre. Known as a hawk on North Korea, before the thaw with Pyongyang began he is reported to have been involved in planning air strikes, in case Trump gave the order to attack. Sung Kim Negotiations began with the North Koreans when there was no US ambassador in Seoul. The diplomatic hole has been filled by Sung Kim, the current envoy to the Philippines and a former US ambassador to Seoul, who was involved the last time a deal was struck with Pyongyang, in 2005. He has led the US team in negotiations with North Korean officials in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea. He knows his opposite number, the vice-foreign minister Choe Son-hui, from the 2005 talks. Allison Hooker The lead Korea specialist on the National Security Council, Hooker accompanied Sung Kim to the DMZ talks. Like the ambassador, she is one of the small handful of officials in the Trump administration with previous experience of dealing with North Korea. In 2014, during the Obama administration, she accompanied the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, to Pyongyang to negotiate prisoner releases. Her presence on the US delegation to the Winter Olympics, which coincided with a delegation under Kim Yong-chol, sparked the initial speculation that contacts were being quietly restored between Washington and Pyongyang."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/07/scooters-littering-city-streets-shout-at-people-unlock-me-or-ill-call-the-police","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Scooters littering US city streets shout at people: 'Unlock me or I'll call the police'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/07/scooters-littering-city-streets-shout-at-people-unlock-me-or-ill-call-the-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/07/scooters-littering-city-streets-shout-at-people-unlock-me-or-ill-call-the-police","fields":{"headline":"Scooters littering US city streets shout at people: 'Unlock me or I'll call the police'","bodyText":"The stories of Americans calling police on people of color who are just going about their daily lives have gone viral multiple times, and prompted a national debate about everyday racism. So one has to wonder what a Silicon Valley startup was thinking when it programmed its electric scooters to yell at people: “Unlock me to ride me, or I’ll call the police.” A female voice from within Lime’s e-scooters shouts the threat to anyone who tries to fiddle with the rides without downloading the app and paying. The company has also set their rides to blast cartoonish robot noises so loud that heads turn on busy city streets. The threat immediately repeats on high volume and is the first and only sound the scooter makes. The words blare after less than a minute of a person standing on and exploring the buttons of the scooters, which Lime has been dumping on sidewalks throughout the US with little warning and without government approval. There’s no evidence that the obnoxious feature actually leads to an automated call to police. Asked about the Lime scooter’s threatening message – which a Guardian reporter discovered while standing on one of the newly arrived scooters in Oakland – local officials in numerous cities expressed a range of disdain and confusion. “Oh my God,” said the Oakland councilmember Rebecca Kaplan after watching a video of a scooter screaming in a public plaza blocks from city hall. “Having a random voice yelling out, ‘I’m going to call the police on you,’ it’s really scary.” Her city recently received national attention after a white woman called police on a group of African Americans barbecuing, one of many recent accounts to spark widespread outrage about racial profiling in the US. “This is not only an annoying noise, this is a threat to people. For black people, that can really be experienced as a death threat,” said Kaplan, who is crafting legislation to regulate the scooters and now plans to add a proposal to prohibit loud noises and threats. “Why would they call the police? And could they call police?” said Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman with the city of Denver’s public works agency, who said she had not heard anything about police threats from the scooters. Lime recently ignored Denver’s orders to remove the dockless scooters from sidewalks. “That doesn’t sound like a great idea to me … Is this supposed to be funny?” Aaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor, said it was no laughing matter for some of his constituents: “I’ve gotten plenty of complaints from residents and shopkeepers who are pissed off about the noise as well as the police state intimidation tactic. It’s kind of ironic they go and plop them in the middle of the sidewalk, and then these things start abusing people.” Police spokespeople in Oakland and Berkeley – two northern California cities that have seen more scooters on the streets after neighboring San Francisco banned them – said their agencies had not heard anything about Lime’s police messages. A San Jose police spokeswoman said she was unaware of any notifications the department receives from the company. A police spokeswoman in San Francisco, where the scooters have become the latest flashpoint in the tech culture wars, said she was unsure if Lime had a system to “live” track potential crimes, adding: “You’ll have to ask the company.” On Wednesday night, a Lime spokesman, Jack Song, said the company had “updated” its “anti-theft alarm” in a new model, which no longer has any message. The company was gradually phasing out the old versions, he said. The scooters, Song added, had not alerted police, but Lime had “worked with law enforcement on incidents of vandalism”. Repeatedly touching a scooter for 10 minutes in Oakland on Wednesday afternoon did not result in a response or call to police. The threat, however, played on loop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/07/phil-neville-sings-praises-of-lucy-bronze-before-qualifier-in-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T11:00:40Z","webTitle":"Phil Neville says England’s Lucy Bronze ‘could play in the men’s game’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/07/phil-neville-sings-praises-of-lucy-bronze-before-qualifier-in-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/07/phil-neville-sings-praises-of-lucy-bronze-before-qualifier-in-russia","fields":{"headline":"Phil Neville says England’s Lucy Bronze ‘could play in the men’s game’","bodyText":"Phil Neville has claimed Lucy Bronze could hold her own in men’s football. The England women’s coach offered his assessment before the Lyon right-back captains his team in a World Cup qualifier in Russia on Friday. “She’s phenomenal,” Neville said. “I always say to people that I think Lucy could play in the men’s game, I really do. She’s got that much quality.” Bronze is regarded as the world’s best right-back in the women’s game and will take over as captain with Steph Houghton having undergone knee surgery. The 26-year-old defender moved from Manchester City to Lyon last summer and recently won the Champions League, in addition to the Ligue 1 title. “Going to Lyon and training with some of the best players in world football has challenged Lucy,” Neville added. “It’s taken her game to a different level.” Given that England are well placed in their group – six points in front of third-placed Russia – with three games remaining, next summer’s finals in France seem within touching distance. Neville is anxious to get his hands on the trophy and maintains that would mean infinitely more than chart-topping world rankings. The Lionesses stand second in Fifa’s table but Neville is relatively unimpressed. “People make a big thing about rankings but being first or second in the world doesn’t mean much if you don’t actually win anything,” he said. “Rankings aren’t that important to me. I want a winners’ medal.” The former Manchester United and Everton full-back said that back in September, when Mark Sampson’s England thrashed Russia 6-0 at Tranmere, he did not envisage presiding over the return fixture. “But I’ve got to say the last five months have seemed like three days,” said Neville, who took over in January. “I’ve loved every minute. The girls are incredible. I feel blessed and inspired every day.” Which is not to say it has been plain sailing. Aware of the players’ collective disappointment at Sampson’s tumultuous sacking – “Mentally our girls have had probably their toughest ever season,” Neville said – the coach has worked hard on winning hearts and minds. Casey Stoney’s presence at his side helped smooth the transition but the former England captain turned coach is bound for a new role, managing Manchester United’s embryonic women’s team in the second tier of the revamped women’s pyramid. Although she departs with Neville’s blessing – “One of the main things I said in my job interview was that I want to develop female coaches,” he said – United’s re-emergence threatens to present him with dilemmas next season. With the plan being that Stoney choreographs immediate promotion to the top tier, United are understood to be offering highly attractive wages to persuade players from clubs in the all-professional Women’s Super League to step down a level. Dare Neville risk taking women from a predominantly part-time second-tier league to France next summer? “Yes,” he said. “I can consider Championship players for the World Cup. It’s not ideal but I will go to Championship games next season and judge players on an individual basis. I don’t judge players on whether they’re in the best WSL teams. I see them as individuals. I judge them on concentration, intensity and quality on the ball.” He regards the top division’s shift to fully professional status as exerting a “massive” bearing on the England side’s potential. “The pool of possible internationals good enough to get into my squad will grow,” said Neville, who may replace Stoney with Sunderland’s coach Melanie Copeland. “There’s about 30 players in that pool now but I’d prefer it to be around 40, I’d be more comfortable with that. “I want to widen the pool. In the past, England players have maybe had the comfort of knowing what the next squad is going to be before it’s announced but I’d like there to be more uncertainty. More competition for places means the standard goes up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/07/clyde-hopkins-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T14:26:02Z","webTitle":"Clyde Hopkins obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/07/clyde-hopkins-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/07/clyde-hopkins-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Clyde Hopkins obituary","bodyText":"The painter Clyde Hopkins, who has died aged 71, produced fine works that were exhibited in various galleries around the UK, as well as in the US and Europe. He was also a visiting artist in many art schools during the 1970s until becoming head of painting, then of fine art, at Winchester School of Art in 1982. From 1990 to 2006 he was head of painting at Chelsea College of Art and Design, London, and he retired as emeritus professor at the University of the Arts London. Clyde’s students adored him: they knew he was a real artist, sensed his deep appreciation of the absurd, and in his company they heard wit, wisdom and piercingly perceptive advice, usually offered with a grin. I taught at many places alongside him, but it was at Chelsea that I fully understood his skill and tact at pulling together the disparate strands emerging in art schools at that time. He saw into us all, without our noticing it, and was gentle with whatever he found. He was born in Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, to Paul Hopkins, a headteacher, and his wife, Ivy (nee Hill). He went to Barrow-in-Furness grammar school for boys and then took a degree in fine art at Reading University in the mid-1960s. After graduating, like many of his circle of friends he was a peripatetic part-time lecturer, paid by the hour in art schools and universities across Britain. We travelled the country, visiting fine art departments as far afield as Canterbury and Hull, trying to remember which London station to get to in time on any particular morning. This meant that for half the week Clyde could be in his studio. He and I were studio neighbours in Greenwich, south-east London, for 20 years, and through the partition in the summer months came the sounds of a Test match on the radio, or the music of Glenn Gould or Brownie McGhee. In those days, before Clyde became the first of our group to take on a “proper” full-time job at Winchester, he was making large, loosely worked, dark paintings, which were shown widely and to great acclaim, including at the Serpentine and Hayward galleries in London. Very gradually these became flatter, crisper, brilliant in hue, with increasingly complex structures, in oil paint applied with obsessive enjoyment. By the time we moved to new studios in Deptford in 1995, the intensity of his style was absolutely his own, and it became richer and more extraordinary as the years went by. Clyde is survived by his wife, the artist Marilyn Hallam, whom he married in 1969 after they met as student contemporaries at Reading University."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/06/wealth-within-grenfell-borough-is-irrelevant-inquiry-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T18:08:38Z","webTitle":"Wealth within Grenfell borough is irrelevant, inquiry told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/wealth-within-grenfell-borough-is-irrelevant-inquiry-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/wealth-within-grenfell-borough-is-irrelevant-inquiry-told","fields":{"headline":"Wealth within Grenfell borough is irrelevant, inquiry told","bodyText":"The fact the borough containing Grenfell Tower has some of the most expensive property in the world should not be exploited to suggest the council callously mistreated its poorest residents, the inquiry into the disaster has been told. “That the council should be seen as the public face of the disaster is entirely understandable,” James Maxwell-Scott QC, representing the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, argued on Wednesday afternoon. “The council is the owner of Grenfell Tower. The council is very sorry that the residents of Grenfell Tower suffered a terrible tragedy. “The council knows that what its councillors and officials did, knew, did not do and did not know will be exposed to intense scrutiny [in the pursuit of] justice.” Maxwell-Scott said, however, that the wealth within Kensington and Chelsea had been used to create a fictitious belief that it was somehow relevant to the cause of the fire. “As the evidence unfolds, [the question will arise] was this something unique that meant it could only have happened here or could it have happened in any other borough with high-rise buildings?” There was nothing unique about the borough, he said. It was the tower’s operator, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), that had entered into contracts with organisations that arranged the refurbishment, Maxwell-Scott explained. The council had repeatedly increased the budget for the work, rising from £6m in 2012 to £10.3m in 2014. “Those are not the decisions of a council determined to build on the cheap.” The council monitored KCTMO’s performance, he added, acknowledging that it was “clear that the cladding system did not satisfy the building regulations”. James Ageros QC, representing KCTMO, told the inquiry that the aim of the refurbishment had been to improve energy efficiency by adding external cladding and installing a new heating system. The cladding system had been shown to the council several times in 2014 and a mock-up was installed on the tower at one stage. The use of combustible cladding had been contemplated since the beginning of the refurbishment project in 2012, he said. It had been seen by a range of technical bodies including those responsible for building control and safety. “Numerous high-rise residential buildings in both the public and private sector were clad in similar materials,” Ageros added. Stephen Hockman QC, representing Arconic Architectural Products, which make the aluminium-faced panels that covered the external insulation cladding, said the core material in its tiles was “obviously combustible”, but the supply of the panels was entirely lawful. It was up to purchasers, however, to decide whether to use the panels for a particular project and whether they could be “safely and appropriately” used, he said. Assessment of their compliance with fire safety standards “was not undertaken by the manufacturer”. Additionally, he said, the fire engineering assessment “does not necessarily require that every element be non-combustible or of limited combustibility”. James Leonard, counsel for the fire safety advisory firm CS Stokes, said its owner, Carl Stokes, had inspected Grenfell Tower in 2012, 2014 and twice in 2016. External walls of buildings, he told the inquiry, had never previously been considered to be subject to fire safety orders. To do so now, he said, would be perverse. “It has never been custom and practice,” he said, to consider the external walls as part of the common parts of the building."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/08/tommy-cash-little-molly-track-of-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Tommy Cash, the 1975, All Saints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/08/tommy-cash-little-molly-track-of-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/08/tommy-cash-little-molly-track-of-week","fields":{"headline":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Tommy Cash, the 1975, All Saints","bodyText":"Tommy Cash Little Molly Essentially a meme-era update on Aphex Twin’s Windowlicker video, Little Molly finds the surrealist Estonian rapper’s moustachioed visage fused on to the bodies of a troupe of hula-hooping gymnasts, bored schoolgirls with high ponytails and a double-denim 80s nightmare.

In the course of a long story in which the new coach tried to draw the line between “banter” and “abuse”, Langer said “in Australia sledging is actually a good word”, “a fun part of the game” and said he loves to sledge his own family. “If I play Uno with my daughter there’s lots of banter, we sort of sledge each other but we don’t abuse each other,” Langer said. “And when I play golf with my mum and dad we sort of sledge each other. But there’s a difference between banter and abuse, and abuse is not good. There’s no room for abuse anywhere.” Australia’s captain, Tim Paine, explained that his team are still going to sledge England but they will do it more politely. “We’re certainly about banter and making the opposition uncomfortable, making them feel our presence, but the abuse is no longer part of the way we go about it.” The team “want to be more respectful”, said Paine on the eve of a one-day friendly at Sussex, “but certainly I’m sure you’re going to hear us talking through the stump mic and see us talking on the ground”. The captain added: “But it’s up to me and Justin and our senior players to make sure that we stay on the side of banter and not abuse, because when I’m captain and Justin is coach that’s not going to be acceptable.” All of which, it has to be said, rather misses the point that it was not the team’s banter that got them into trouble in South Africa last March so much as their blatant cheating. Paine described the upcoming one-day international series as a chance to “show the cricketing world where we have made some changes”, but then said that fixing the team culture did not need “huge changes”, that it was just a matter of “crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s on some things that had started to slip over a period of time”. Paine said it was simply a question of “living our values and living our behaviours and keeping everyone in our group, players and staff, accountable”. Back on semantics, Langer explained that “culture is the buzzword at the moment”. He added: “Cultures are just behaviours, so we’ve got make sure our behaviours are really good on and off the field. If you’ve got good behaviours then you’ve got good cultures, and an environment for all our young blokes to thrive and become as good players and as a good people as they can become.” He does not go in much for written codes of conduct. “We can put [out] all the fanciest mission statements and values, we can have all the fanciest posters up on the wall, but if you don’t live them then they’re like toilet paper, mate. That’s the truth.” Paine said the team are “looking forward” to the stick they will get from the English fans during the ODI series. “We’ve spoken about this, we think it’s going to be pretty full-on. We expect that when we come to England we cop a bit of a ribbing, and this time we come with probably a bit more of a reason for them to do it,” he said. “We’re looking forward to it to be honest. We’re excited about it and that probably just adds a bit of extra spice and I think it will make it all the more memorable when we go home.” Australia have brought in Ricky Ponting as an assistant coach for the series. The former captain has twice been an assistant coach for Australia’s T20 side and has just finished his first IPL season with the Delhi Daredevils. Langer also had a good word for James Sutherland, who announced on Wednesday that he was resigning after 17 years as Cricket Australia’s chief executive. It means Australia have lost their captain, coach, and CEO in the past three months. Their head of integrity, Iain Roy, who led the investigation into the ball-tampering scandal, has also been made redundant. The former head coach Darren Lehmann, the man who said he was “ultimately responsible for the culture of the team” caught tampering, has now taken on a new role developing young players at the national academy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/07/oprah-winfrey-museum-exhibition-career-history","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T10:00:40Z","webTitle":"Watching Oprah: exhibition dedicated to star who 'chronicled an ever-changing America'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/07/oprah-winfrey-museum-exhibition-career-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/07/oprah-winfrey-museum-exhibition-career-history","fields":{"headline":"Watching Oprah: exhibition dedicated to star who 'chronicled an ever-changing America'","bodyText":"The first thing that becomes apparent walking into the new Oprah Winfrey exhibition at the National Museum of African American History and Culture is that Winfrey isn’t there. No photos, no quotes or memorabilia, no clips from her decades-long career. That’s notable given that it is a first of its kind dedication to one of the biggest personalities in American culture at the nation’s premier museum dedicated to the African American experience. One of the world’s wealthiest women and a self-made billionaire who grew up wearing potato sacks in the Jim Crow south, Winfrey is still relevant decades after she first came on the screen – with some even calling for her to run for president now. But the story on display in the new temporary exhibition, Watching Oprah: The Oprah Winfrey Show and American Culture, which opens its doors to the general public on 8 June, is one that’s bigger than Winfrey– and her story is huge. As exhibit co-curator Kathleen Kendrick put it to the Guardian: “It’s about Oprah, but you don’t see Oprah.” Rather, the exhibit, a story told in three sections, opens by connecting her to other women and black leaders who helped pave the way, and provide the context for her rise. The first room features quotes from Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president, as well as the lilting strains of the Supremes, the all-black women’s pop trio that helped break barriers for black women in entertainment. “The museum takes seriously the notion that it does history and culture and I wanted to find concrete examples where we could explore the impact of culture,” Lonnie Bunch told members of the press gathered for a first look on Wednesday. Bunch said Winfrey has in some ways replaced Walter Cronkite as one of the most trusted people in television. But Winfrey’s story, unlike Cronkite’s, isn’t confined to Washington’s Newseum, a tribute to the media business. Rather, she’s being featured alongside the greatest black progressives of American history including Ida B Wells, Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman. It is, in other words, less about an individual than a cultural change. (Asked why Winfrey wasn’t in attendance, Bunch brushed it off. “This isn’t about that,” he told the Guardian, adding that he wasn’t sure when she was coming to see it.) Instead the exhibition places Winfrey and her show squarely in the context of the America of her youth in 1950s rural Mississippi, examining how that America helped inspire her. Such contextualizing is consistent with the way that Winfrey herself tells her story. She frequently quotes the late poet Maya Angelou saying: “I come as one but I stand as 10,000.” It’s also about encouraging viewers to make personal connections, like those made by Carolivia Herron, who teaches classics at the historically black Howard University, and who, while contemplating a photo of the singer Nat King Cole, recalled how her family used to rush into the living room to marvel at the spectacle of a black man on television. Though it was Herron’s local radio show that got her into Wednesday’s unveiling, she was most interested in it as an educator, telling the Guardian “the idea of a hero being a conduit for a whole culture rather than what she does in and of herself” had already inspired future lesson plans. Oprah Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi, where her ancestors had been enslaved. Born to a single mother, she lived for some time with her grandmother, but her gifts were shown early when she landed an on-air radio job while still in high school. From there she embarked on a career in news that would take her to Baltimore and eventually Chicago, but along the way she found the rules of journalism didn’t let her be who she was. “I’d cover a fire and then I’d go back and try to give the victims blankets, and I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night because of all the things I was covering during the day,” Winfrey said in a 2008 speech at Stanford University. Her powerful emotional intelligence made her a better fit for talkshows, where she would fast become a household name, first rivaling and then surpassing Phil Donahue, the reigning king at the time. She started with his brand of confrontational television – jilted lovers, surprise pregnancies – but found greater success in inspiring her audiences rather than shocking them. “I am no longer going to be used by television, I am going to use television,” she told the Stanford students. That ability to inspire, as well as her business success, is why some liberals are now looking to her as a potential savior in the darkness of the Donald Trump era. And after a rousing Golden Globes this speech earlier this year, in which she accepted a lifetime achievement award, she dominated not just the cultural but political news cycle with calls for her to run for president. (The final item on display was her black Golden Globes dress.) “Our president is giving her state of the union,” prominent black feminist writer Roxane Gay tweeted during her speech. Winfrey has none of the traditional qualifications for the highest political office in the land – but neither does Trump. And then again, not many people end up with museum exhibits dedicated to them before they run for president (Winfrey has repeatedly splashed, if not quite poured, cold water on the idea). Kendrick and her co-curator Rhea Combs worked with a team of scholars – across African American studies, gender studies, religion and sociology – to identify specific objects that would help them convey her life. One room displays a room full of photos from Winfrey’s green room. On another wall, the living room-style furniture from her talkshow is displayed, along with clips from famous segments, like when she interviewed then senator Barack Obama, her friend and fellow Chicagoan whom she would help turn into the first black president of the United States. Also displayed are diaries she’s kept since age 15, which chronicle everything from her travails with boys in high school to thoughts on gratitude for her astronomical success. The temporary exhibition isn’t the only thing in the museum dedicated to Winfrey, who has donated generously to the museum, which was decades in the making and finally opened in 2016 on the National Mall to unprecedented crowds and rave reviews. But Bunch says the museum’s decisions were made independent of such considerations. “We drew a very hard bright line to show that this was not a show done for Oprah, done by Oprah,” he said. Bunch hopes Winfrey will help keep the museum drawing crowds even after the initial boom. “We want them to find new insights into both the TV show, but also into a woman, an African American woman who has chronicled an ever-changing America, and I would argue, has contributed mightily to a changed America,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/06/tyson-fury-comeback-sefer-seferi","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T21:30:24Z","webTitle":"Tyson Fury insists he is ‘sharper than ever’ for comeback against Sefer Seferi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/tyson-fury-comeback-sefer-seferi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/06/tyson-fury-comeback-sefer-seferi","fields":{"headline":"Tyson Fury insists he is ‘sharper than ever’ for comeback against Sefer Seferi","bodyText":"By Tyson Fury’s standards it was a sedate affair. There was no playing for laughs by dressing as Batman or exposing a belly flopping apologetically over his belt, as he did for his fight against Wladimir Klitschko. Instead, the former WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight champion used the final press conference before his comeback to suggest something far more intriguing – that a world belt could be back around his waist far sooner than anticipated. Given Fury has not fought since bamboozling Klitschko in November 2015, most expected him to ease his way back. But his promoter, Frank Warren, is hoping the WBA champion Manuel Charr will be at ringside for Fury’s bout against Sefer Seferi in Manchester on Saturday night – opening the way for negotiations for a fight by the end of the year. “Seferi went 10 rounds with Charr, who is now the WBA regular heavyweight champion,” Warren said. “If Tyson stops the guy – and I think he will – that will be better than that champion has done and we hope he will be there on Saturday night.” Fury, meanwhile, did not discount the possibility of meeting Charr next and notably built the Lebanese fighter as a worthwhile champion, even though he holds the WBA regular belt rather than the “Super” version worn by Anthony Joshua. “People keep going on about this regular belt, but Charr is a bona fide heavyweight champion,” Fury said. “When [Alexander] Povetkin had it he was the world champion and Russia had its first world heavyweight champion. When David Haye had it it was a world title. But since poor old Manuel Charr’s had it, it’s a piece of shit. “That’s everyone’s opinion. But as far as I’m concerned the WBA Super title is a paper title made up in 2011 for Wladimir.” Yet with his very next breath Fury claimed that if he did win the belt against Charr he would immediately relinquish it. “If I win a world title before the end of the year, I’ll be a two‑time world heavyweight champion and then I’ll vacate it,” he said. “Then I’ll win it and become a three‑time champion and then vacate them again and win them back again, just to prove I can become a four-time world heavyweight champion and better than anyone before.” Since Fury’s fight he has struggled with his mental health, blown up to 28 stone and tested positive for cocaine as well as the performance‑enhancing drug nandrolone, for which he accepted a backdated two-year ban last December. Fury refused to address those problems directly, instead insisting: “I am not here to dwell on the past, that is behind me and I am here to move on.” He promised, though, that he was “sharper than ever” after losing eight stone, and said facing Joshua or the WBC champion Deontay Wilder held no fears. “I could fight anybody in the world on Saturday night,” Fury said. “I wouldn’t be boxing Seferi if I didn’t think I could go out on the same night and fight Joshua. I’m never going to be a show dog, I’m a proper fighting man, a tough battle-hardened veteran. I’m more experienced than any of these fighters. I haven’t studied anyone because they’re all one-trick ponies, coming forward, looking for one big punch. Unfortunately that doesn’t work with me. You’ve got to have more than that.” However, Fury denied he would have it all his own way against the Albanian Seferi, who has won 23 of his 24 fights, even though most have been at cruiserweight. “I could have picked someone a lot easier. But I need plenty of rounds. I have been out nearly a thousand days. I know he is tough, has a lion’s heart and will come to win.” Fury, who turns 30 in August, also dismissed suggestions there might be any nerves on his comeback in front of his home crowd in Manchester. “Not at all. I feel like I have been a goldfish trapped in a tank and now I am being released back into the river where I belong.” Fury knows Seferi is a minnow by heavyweight standards and that far more dangerous sharks lie in wait. But every iota of his body language suggested he fully believes he can not only swim with them but toy with them, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/06/rafael-nadal-quarter-final-rain-reprieve-diego-schwartzman","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T18:25:07Z","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal given quarter-final rain reprieve against Diego Schwartzman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/rafael-nadal-quarter-final-rain-reprieve-diego-schwartzman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/06/rafael-nadal-quarter-final-rain-reprieve-diego-schwartzman","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Nadal given quarter-final rain reprieve against Diego Schwartzman","bodyText":"Rafael Nadal can still win this French Open, but he will have to carry the late momentum of his rain-interrupted fightback against the redoubtable Diego Schwartzman into the resumption on Thursday if he is not to be the author of his own exit from a tournament he virtually owns. For a worryingly long time on day 11, pessimists were calculating that a less than stellar final here between two players outside the top 10, Schwartzman and Marco Cecchinato, was a slim possibility. Cecchinato, the world No 72 who bundled the former champion Novak Djokovic out of the tournament on Tuesday, gets his chance to go forward on Friday, when he plays Dominic Thiem in the first semi-final. A win is not impossible for the Italian. Nadal, meanwhile, gave substance to the speculation when Schwartzman, the robust Argentinian world No 11, rocked him out of his comfort zone to break his Paris run of 37 unbeaten sets. When play was abandoned under storm clouds about the time most Parisians head for their evening meal, Nadal had repaired much of the damage inflicted on him in the first set, which Schwartzman won 6-4 in and hour-and-a-quarter. He broke the Spaniard three times – then twice in the second. But Nadal, as he has done so often, averted catastrophe after a 53-minute interrompu for rain, when he returned trailing 3-2 and a break to grind his way to a 5-3 lead. He had the ball in his hand at 30-15 when they left Court Philippe‑Chatrier for the last time. On Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Juan Martín del Potro and Marin Cilic were locked at 5-5 in the first-set tie-break after squeezing in 71 minutes of tennis. Nadal raised minor concerns when he had both wrists wrapped between sets, although Alex Corretja, once Andy Murray’s coach, reckoned they were to soak up sweat rather than wrap an injury. Perhaps. Whatever his woes, most of them were provided by Schwartzman, whose aggression caught him out time and again. Nadal, who is reaching for his 11th title here, insists wisely there are no certainties in sport. But even he must feel he has the pedigree to subdue this uplifting challenge from one of the sport’s toughest competitors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/07/windrush-legal-illegal-migrants-caribbean-deportation-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T09:47:01Z","webTitle":"The Windrush deportations were wrong – and so are all the others | Luke de Noronha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/windrush-legal-illegal-migrants-caribbean-deportation-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/07/windrush-legal-illegal-migrants-caribbean-deportation-uk","fields":{"headline":"The Windrush deportations were wrong – and so are all the others","bodyText":"We now know that nearly 1,000 flights were booked to deport people to the Caribbean in the 12 months up to March.

We should remember that behind every illegal immigrant is a real person, and behind each enforced removal a complicated story. When I met deported people in Jamaica, the lines between deserving and undeserving, citizen and migrant, Windrush and illegal, became a lot more fuzzy. In September 2016, a charter flight carrying 42 deported Jamaican nationals landed in Kingston. I spoke with some people who were on it. Their accounts of the flight and their forced separation from loved ones were profoundly distressing. Take Darel (not his real name). I met him a few days after he had landed, and he was disoriented and frightened. He spent most of the time on his phone – calling his children, partner and his mother back in west London, where he is from. “Every night I talk to my kids. They’re crying every minute. Sometimes I just feel like I want to kill myself right now – being away from my family and sleeping on the floor, when I had my nice house and my kids and my routine.” Darel moved to the UK when he was seven years old, and was deported 25 years later. Crucially, he was the primary carer for his four children, all of whom are British citizens. Of course, Darel arrived in England well after 1973, and so he was not a Windrush migrant. Indeed, he even had a criminal record. Darel’s only offences were for possession of marijuana and overstaying his visa (as a child), but they were enough to justify his banishment. Darel might have won his case, with a decent lawyer, but cuts to legal aid and the slashing of appeal rights do the Home Office’s dirty work when it comes to meeting deportation targets. So Darel was an illegal immigrant, but what does it mean to call him an “immigrant”, least of all an illegal one, when he was brought to the UK aged seven? When does a person stop being foreign, and is this a question of law, culture or good character? Who should decide? These questions are of the gravest consequence for Darel and others in his position, and I met tens of people like him in Jamaica: people who looked and sounded British, at least by my definition, and yet had been subject to the most extraordinary punishment. The question of foreignness, and of who counts as British, was central to the Windrush scandal. Indeed, a consensus emerged that the Windrush generation were citizens who had been treated like illegal immigrants. However, the point is that the Windrush generation were turned into illegal immigrants, and this is precisely how immigration control works. There are no sharp divisions between legal migrants over here and illegal immigrants over there, neither in law nor in everyday life. In fact, I often met people in Jamaica who didn’t know that they had had irregular immigration status until it was too late. Crucially, immigration control carves through families and communities. While politicians might be invested in drawing the hard distinction between those who arrived before 1973 and those who did so afterwards, it is not clear that Caribbean communities can divide themselves up like that. Those who arrived from the Commonwealth before 1973 – ie the Windrush generation – are not a distinct group outside of legal definition. Indeed, Windrush migrants share their lives with people who migrated after 1973 and, thus, with illegal immigrants. UK immigration controls, which have been designed to restrict the migration of Commonwealth migrants, have turned newer migrants into illegals and then criminalised transnational family connections. Migration cannot be turned off like a tap, and 1973 is not a legitimate cut-off point. This is not to negate the wrongdoing caused to Windrush migrants, but rather to expand our field of vision. Of the hundreds of people deported to the Caribbean last year, some will have been Windrush migrants, and these people deserve justice. They should be allowed to return to their homes in Britain. However, so should people such as Darel. Calling a human being illegal cannot justify their indefinite detention, violent expulsion, and permanent exile – no matter when they migrated. I am sure Darel’s British children would agree. • Luke de Noronha is a writer and academic researching deportation from the UK to Jamaica"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/06/alice-johnson-kim-kardashian-trump-commutes-sentence-drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T17:23:19Z","webTitle":"Trump commutes life sentence of grandmother after Kim Kardashian meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/alice-johnson-kim-kardashian-trump-commutes-sentence-drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/alice-johnson-kim-kardashian-trump-commutes-sentence-drugs","fields":{"headline":"Trump commutes life sentence of grandmother after Kim Kardashian meeting","bodyText":"Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of a woman serving a life sentence for selling drugs, following a lobbying effort by Kim Kardashian that saw the celebrity meet with the president in the Oval Office. On Wednesday, the White House announced that it had commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old great grandmother who was convicted of cocaine trafficking in 1996. Johnson, a first time, non-violent offender, had gained prominence when Kardashian started lobbying on her behalf. The reality television star visited the White House last week where she posed for a picture with Trump. He later retweeted Kardashian when she expressed her hope that the president would grant Johnson clemency. Kardashian hailed the news in a tweet on Wednesday, writing “best news ever!!!”. She went on to thank Trump, his son-in-law and aide, Jared Kushner, and “everyone who has showed compassion &amp; contributed countless hours to this important moment for Ms Alice Marie Johnson. Her commutation is inspirational &amp; gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance.” In a statement announcing the commutation, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said: “Ms Johnson has accepted responsibility for her past behavior and has been a model prisoner over the past two decades. Despite receiving a life sentence, Alice worked hard to rehabilitate herself in prison, and act as a mentor to her fellow inmates.” Sanders added: “While this administration will always be very tough on crime, it believes that those who have paid their debt to society and worked hard to better themselves while in prison deserve a second chance.” The White House has backed a bipartisan prison reform bill which passed the House but is currently mired in the Senate due to concerns from Chuck Grassley, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee, that it fails to include sentencing reforms to help non-violent drug offenders such as Johnson. Johnson is the second person commuted by Trump since taking office. The first was Shalom Rubashkin, a chief executive of a meatpacking company, who was convicted on charges of fraud and money laundering in 2009 and sentenced to 27 years in jail. Trump commuted his sentence in December 2017 after Rubashkin served eight years in prison. Unlike a pardon, a commutation does not expunge a criminal conviction. It simply reduces the punishment. The commutation comes as Trump has been more freely using his constitutional power to pardon. In the past month, he issued a posthumous pardon to boxer Jack Johnson who was convicted in 1913 for transporting a woman across state lines for “immoral purposes” and pardoned far-right provocateur Dinesh D’Souza for knowingly violating campaign finance laws. He has also mused about granting a commutation to the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell an appointment to the US Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama, and a pardon for the cooking and lifestyle personality Martha Stewart, who was convicted of lying to federal investigators over stock trading."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/10/the-boy-downstairs-review-sophie-brooks-sweet-natured-love-on-the-rocks","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"The Boy Downstairs review – a sweet-natured story of love on the rocks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/10/the-boy-downstairs-review-sophie-brooks-sweet-natured-love-on-the-rocks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/10/the-boy-downstairs-review-sophie-brooks-sweet-natured-love-on-the-rocks","fields":{"headline":"The Boy Downstairs review – a sweet-natured story of love on the rocks","bodyText":"Starring Zosia Mamet as Diana, a shopgirl and aspiring author, this feature debut by writer-director Sophie Brooks will no doubt be compared to Lena Dunham’s TV series Girls (in which Mamet also featured). In fact, it has more in common with the films of Nicole Holofcener, whose Walking and Talking seems like a reference point. Having moved back to New York after three years in London, Diana lands an unrealistically dreamy sublet in a tasteful Brooklyn brownstone, only to find that her ex-boyfriend, Ben (Noah Baumbach regular Matthew Shear), is – as the film’s title warns – the boy who lives downstairs. Cutting between flashbacks of their relationship as it buds, blossoms and eventually wilts, and their present-day awkwardness, it offers a valuable insight into how young women can be just as bumbling, emotionally inept and ambivalent about commitment as men. There are flashes of wit too in the well-observed supporting characters, such as best friend Gabby’s on-off man interest, who asks as a cringey litmus test if she likes Radiohead, though Diana herself isn’t especially well drawn. We never really get a sense of her as a writer outside of elaborate montages that see her hunched over a MacBook, but Mamet is as honest, vulnerable and exacting as she can be in her scenes with Shear. What’s most intriguing is Brooks doesn’t use the romcom format to conduct abrasive social satire, as seems to be the trend within its indie sub-genre. Instead she’s earnestly aiming for (and squarely hitting) something more unapologetically sweet-natured."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/06/customs-backstop-we-expect-a-time-limit-stresses-david-davis","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T19:37:17Z","webTitle":"Brexit: David Davis plans revolt over customs backstop plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/06/customs-backstop-we-expect-a-time-limit-stresses-david-davis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/06/customs-backstop-we-expect-a-time-limit-stresses-david-davis","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: David Davis plans revolt over customs backstop plan","bodyText":"Theresa May is facing a dramatic cabinet showdown with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, over the government’s final backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. As the inner cabinet meets at Downing Street to thrash out the final details of the customs fall-back plan, Davis is expected to push for a firm end date to be included in the agreed text. Davis did not rule out resigning if the government’s proposals did not have his explicit approval. “That’s a question I think for the prime minister, to be honest,” he told reporters after a speech at the Royal United Services Institute. It leaves the prime minister battling to restore cabinet unity over her customs plans before she flies to Canada later today for the G7 meeting of world leaders. The clash with Davis came as Downing Street also attempted to head off a series of damaging rebellions in next week’s key Brexit votes, by holding talks with leading Tory MPs who voted to remain in the EU. May has publicly committed to a time-limited backstop, but No 10 sources ruled out agreeing to a specific date in the text, suggesting that it would be unworkable. Cabinet sources confirmed that a four-page draft of the backstop proposal circulated to ministers had prompted the fresh row because it did not include a legally enforceable date. Just hours later Davis claimed that discussions over the document were still carrying on. “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment,” he told reporters during a Q&amp;A after his Whitehall speech. “It has been through one cabinet committee, is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive tomorrow.” He added: “I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time-limit on the backstop proposal.” Davis helped to clinch agreement on the backstop in the cabinet Brexit subcommitee last month, in the face of objections from other leave supporters, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Johnson subsequently warned that the prime minister should ensure she delivered a Brexit deal that avoided use of the backstop. “Brexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire. We want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it,” he said. Davis is understood to believe that offering a deal without a specified end-date would limit his leverage, in talks with Brussels, to negotiate alternative arrangements for keeping the border open. Some Brexiters were irked by the fact they only received the draft of the detailed backstop proposals on Wednesday, claiming other key cabinet members, including the chancellor, had been given longer to consider its wording. Britain signed up to the idea of a backstop in the deal reached with the EU27 in December but May rejected a draft later presented by Brussels that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market. The EU27 has been waiting for the government to publish its alternative draft backstop proposal, which is expected to include all of the UK temporarily applying the EU’s external tariff – a plan that would limit the ability of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, to strike new deals with non-EU countries. No 10 sources said the backstop, which would keep the whole of the UK in key areas of the customs union until a permanent solution to the Irish border problem could be found, would be published today after the meeting. Downing Street played down the row, saying the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary. “It’s important that it’s time-limited even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” a source said. Allies of the Brexit secretary denied he was considering resigning. When news of the backstop plan emerged last month it infuriated hardline Conservative backbenchers who feared that it could become the post-Brexit norm. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, went so far as to question whether the government remained committed to delivering Brexit. Leading Brexiters told the Guardian, however, that they would not be “causing a fuss” about the backstop before next week’s Commons votes. But one warned that No 10 should expect renewed pressure over the date once votes were passed. The Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, told MPs that the EU withdrawal bill would now be debated over two days – next Tuesday and Wednesday – but there would still only be 12 hours set aside. A series of Tory rebel remain MPs, including Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve, and Antoinette Sandbach, were seen entering No 10 for talks. The latest clash between May and her Brexit secretary comes after the pair also disagreed about the timing of publication for a white paper setting out key areas of the government’s Brexit plans. Davis was keen to produce a detailed document before the European council at the end of June, but May is more cautious. She refused to give an answer, when asked by Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister’s questions, when it would be published. After his speech, Davis said: “In debates in Whitehall between fast and slow, I normally vote for fast. That’s probably a given. But what she said today is exactly right – that the white paper will be published when it’s ready, it’s up to quality, and is exactly what we need to say. It will not delay the progress of the negotiations.” Any plan that involves a special status for Northern Ireland is anathema to May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist party, who reject the idea of any differential in treatment between the region and the rest of the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/06/andres-babis-reappointed-czech-pm-push-end-impasse","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T17:47:57Z","webTitle":"Andrej Babiš reappointed Czech PM in push to end impasse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/andres-babis-reappointed-czech-pm-push-end-impasse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/06/andres-babis-reappointed-czech-pm-push-end-impasse","fields":{"headline":"Andrej Babiš reappointed Czech PM in push to end impasse","bodyText":"Andrej Babiš, Czech Republic’s scandal-plagued acting prime minister, has been reappointed in an attempt to end months of political deadlock by strong-arming reluctant opposition MPs into forming a government with him. Babiš was officially rinstalled in a ceremony at Prague castle presided over by Miloš Zeman, the populist Czech president, who appeared to be attempting to use the possibility of a coalition with a far-right grouping to force the Social Democrat party (ČSSD) into agreeing a deal. Babiš’s appointment, for the second time in six months, came a day after large crowds of demonstrators gathered in Prague and other Czech cities to protest against the prospect of a government led by him. A billionaire businessman and Czech Republic’s ssecond-richest man, Babiš has been unable to form a stable administration since his Action of Dissatisfied Citizens party (ANO) won last October’s parliamentary election because mainstream parties have been unwilling to serve under him on grounds that he faces criminal fraud allegations. Despite reservations, the Social Democrats last month agreed to enter a coalition on condition that Babiš resign as prime minister if convicted of the charges, which relate to a €2m (£1.75m) EU subsidy. He denies any wrongdoing. Last year he referred to the allegations as a “pseudo-case” and as a political plot against him. The agreement is subject to approval in an internal members’ ballot, with the result due on 15 June. If confirmed, it would produce a minority coalition dependent on parliamentary support from the Communist party (KSCM), enabling it to wield political power for the first time since the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended its 41-year rule over what was then Czechoslovakia. By pre-empting the outcome of the Social Democrats’ poll, Zeman, who was narrowly re-elected in a bitterly fought presidential contest in January, appeared to be trying to intimidate members to stop them rejecting the coalition deal. “He is trying to tell them that Babiš will be prime minister no matter what and if you don’t approve the coalition with him, he will have to enter one with the far-right and the communists,” said Jiří Pehe, a Czech political analyst who is director of New York University’s campus in Prague. Zeman, who has gained a reputation for fierce anti-Muslim rhetoric, has openly touted a government consisting of ANO, the Communists and the anti-immigration Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD), led by Tomio Okamura. Last year Okamura hosted a conference of far-right leaders attended by Marine Le Pen, leader of the French Front National, and Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom party. The Slovak-born Babiš has so far baulked at striking such a deal, fearing it would damage his standing in the EU."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/10/lesson-from-big-tech-latest-events-they-know-were-on-to-them-google-apple","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"The lesson from big tech’s latest PR events?

They know we’re on to them…","bodyText":"In the bad old days of the cold war, western political and journalistic institutions practised an arcane pseudoscience called Kremlinology. Its goal was to try to infer what was going on in the collective mind of the Soviet Politburo. Its method was obsessively to note everything that could be publicly observed of the activities of this secretive cabal – who was sitting next to whom at the podium; which foreign visitors were granted an audience with which high official; who was in the receiving line for a visiting head of state; what editorials in Pravda (the official Communist party newspaper) might mean; and so on. The Soviet empire is no more, much to Putin’s chagrin, but the world now has some new superpowers. We call them tech companies. Each periodically stages a major public event at which its leaders emerge from their executive suites to convey messages to their faithful followers and to the wider world. In the past few weeks, two such events have been held by two of the biggest powers – Google and Apple. So let’s do some Kremlinology on them. Google kicked off this year’s ceremonies with its I/O conference for developers on 8 May. As usual, the big event was the traditional “keynote” by the Great Leader, in this case Sundar Pichai. His theme was the great benefits that will accrue to humanity from artificial intelligence (AI), a field in which, coincidentally, Google happens to be a world leader. So AI will enable us to analyse retinal scans, which might enable us to better predict a person’s likelihood of having heart problems. It will help us to do clever things with our photos, train our children to say “please”, while the company’s new custom-designed AI chips will make machine-learning even faster than ever. Mr Pichai demonstrated a striking application of this tech: an AI that could make restaurant bookings by phone while engaging the restaurateur in human-sounding verbal exchanges. All of which went to prove that Google’s sole desire is to create technology that will make our lives easier and better. Last week, it was Apple’s turn to take the stage. It would be interesting to know what a visiting Martian anthropologist would have made of the spectacle of grown men (and sometimes women) talking like semi-literate teenagers in order to extol the wonders of technology. Everything, you see, is “fun”, “amazing”, “incredible” and possibly even “fantastic”. This year, the Apple event was all about software. (To the disgust of hardened geeks, there was nothing about new laptops, tablets or phones.) But the dominant message was clear: Apple’s “incredible” new iOS and Mac operating systems would make our lives even easier than they were yesterday. Siri (the company’s AI-driven virtual assistant) would morph into a strange blend of digital butler, concierge and personal assistant. One was reminded of the adage that tech progress mostly means that what only billionaires had 10 years ago, everyone can have today. What would a latterday Kremlinologist make of all this? Well, first she would notice the interesting internal tensions that were manifest in both events. The Google boss’s hymn to AI was designed to divert attention from the fact that the technology will destroy jobs and vastly increase algorithmic power – and therefore the power of the companies that wield it. She would also note that growing public concerns about the addictiveness of Google products was implicitly recognised. “People feel tethered to their devices,” said Mr Pichai, so the company is developing ways to help people “switch off and wind down”. Likewise, a new feature of the Android operating system will show people how much time they spend on their smartphones and there will be some kind of tool for reminding YouTube addicts that they need to take a break. Over at Apple, our Kremlinologist would have spotted the same tension. On the one hand, the company is hellbent on making its devices more and more integral in the daily lives of its customers. On the other, it too has been reading the runes of growing public disquiet about social media. So it’s now trumpeting tools it has devised for warning users about addiction. Strangely, though, this doesn’t seem to apply to Apple devices. As American journalist Farhad Manjoo observed: “Though Apple acknowledged the darker side of society’s obsession with the digital world, it didn’t go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame.” Yep. There’s now a neurotic undertone to these public celebrations of tech superiority. To understand what lies beneath it, all we need to remember is Kenneth Tynan’s shrewd definition of neurosis as “a secret you don’t know you’re keeping”. So what is this secret that’s bothering the new masters of our universe? Answer: they’re worried that we’re coming for them, just like we once came for JD Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and JP Morgan. And it couldn’t happen to nicer folks. What I’m reading #FaceWho? Papua New Guinea has banned Facebook for a month in order to research the social network’s effects on the population and to crack down on fake accounts. But as the Guardian noted, the vast majority of the country’s citizens don’t use Facebook much, so it’s difficult to see what the government will learn from the experiment.

For two years, he ran with the mutts, begging for food that he distributed among them and curling up with them at night to protect himself from the harsh climate. The police tried several times to apprehend him, only to be thwarted in their attempts by his snarling posse. Eventually, he was packed off to a children’s shelter. He stopped growling and went back to speaking. “He appears to be just like any other Moscow child,” wrote Michael Newton in his book Savage Girls and Wild Boys: A History of Feral Children. “Yet it is said that, at night, he dreams of dogs.” The story, which was first reported in July 1998, has been fictionalised in works including Eva Hornung’s novel Dog Boy and the play My Life with the Dogs by the theatre company New International Encounter. But it is Hattie Naylor’s stark, haunting play Ivan and the Dogs that has inspired a new film from the British director and artist Andrew Kötting. Lek and the Dogs uses Ivan’s story to complete Kötting’s Earthworks trilogy, each instalment of which features the character Lek, played by the French actor and performance artist Xavier Tchili. The 2001 film This Filthy Earth was caked in mud and grime, while Ivul, from 2009, took place largely in the treetops. The new picture burrows beneath the earth, tracing the subterranean-dwelling Lek/Ivan on a journey into his “disrupted” mental landscape and a past fraught with trauma. Kötting riffs imaginatively on the material, amplifying its resonances and peculiarities on every level: visual, audio and philosophical. He stitches archive footage into the fabric of the film, making its texture amorphous, mottled and strange; locations range from French caves to a chalky Chilean ghost-town. The spine of the picture, though, is that enduring story. “It’s Romulus and Remus or The Jungle Book,” Naylor says. “It’s an archetypal story that’s embedded in us. And it works, I think, because it taps into our own confused relationship with animals and our own wildness, that question of whether it’s still there in us. The play has done particularly well in places where there has been a very recent collapse. It’s been all around Brazil. The poverty, the abandoned animals, they can still see it and feel it.” It was Newton’s book that introduced Naylor to Ivan. “There was very little information to go on, so in my version he leaves because he is hearing his stepfather beat up his mother. Then I researched what was happening to kids at that time. They were being abandoned, just like dogs were, because there was simply no money. Society was collapsing.” Naylor met Kötting in the 80s, when they were students at the Slade School of Fine Art. “We found each other in the basement, messing around with sound,” she recalls. She later named her theatre company after his 1996 debut feature, Gallivant, a warped and beguiling documentary in which the director travels the coastline of mainland Britain in the company of his grandmother and his seven-year-old daughter, Eden, who has the rare genetic condition Joubert syndrome. Lek and the Dogs, though, is Naylor and Kötting’s first collaboration. “He sort of destroyed my play,” she laughs. “But it’s an amazing piece of work. He’s an auteur, isn’t he? A one-off.” There is no disputing that. I travel to St Leonards in East Sussex, where Kötting lives. He meets me at the station, wheeling a bicycle and wearing a patched blue “upcycled” shirt made by his wife, Leila. He is 58, stocky and strong, with a ruddy face and spiky hair. As we eat fish and chips on the seafront, his eyes are darting and alert, always on the lookout for a telling detail. He points out the violent flapping of the deckchair fabric (“If I were filming you, I’d want to record that”). He gestures to a yellow buoy on the horizon, which he uses as a marker on his regular swims out to sea, and the bolthole in the distance that belongs to his friend and collaborator Iain Sinclair. Their projects together include Swandown, in which they piloted a swan pedalo from Hastings to the Olympic Park, and Sinclair’s book London Overground, about the pair’s perambulations around the “ginger line”. We repair after lunch to Kötting’s studio in Hastings Old Town. Paintings by Eden, who is now 30 and an accomplished artist, hang on the walls and from the ceiling. The nerve centre is a shed he has assembled inside the studio and into which he retreats to do most of his editing and tinkering, playing around with footage and sound design. It was Naylor, he says, who kept him on track as they wrote Lek together. “She was always banging on about story. ‘We can’t just be looking at stuff, we’ve got to respect the story.’ I gave up reading novels years ago. I lose interest. I’m not attracted to the linear. Collage is so much more satisfying. You can jump in and out and it still makes sense. It holds itself together. But I knew there was something in Hattie’s play that I could use as a springboard.” The director has always relied on “the angels of happenstance” as part of his creative process. Many of the visual coups in Lek and the Dogs were accidental: the discovery of a pile of abandoned shoes in the desert; a pet cemetery that Kötting came across after his preferred ending of Lek playing Pied Piper to a pack of dogs proved impossible to shoot. Most startling are the wriggling, foetus-like creatures seen at the start of the film. I had taken them to be animatronic or stop-motion models. Not so, says Kötting: they were newborn baby loir (dormouse-like creatures) that dropped on to Eden’s desk while she was drawing in the family’s other home in the Pyrenees. “I went in there because I heard her laughing and calling me: ‘Papa, papa!’ I thought: ‘What the fuck are they?’ I got my camera and left it running. They were dead, but every now and then they would twitch. I hadn’t even started thinking about Lek at that point. Manna from heaven.” When he came to grade the footage for the film, he made sure it matched the tone of Tchili’s whitened skin as he scampers on all fours through the desert. The picture has an apocalyptic air that seems uncomfortably pertinent. “We’ve got the enemy now, haven’t we? Before, there was Thatcher. Now, it’s Brexit, North Korea, whatever. This is what happens. We build toward a climax and then it all peters out. I don’t know. I’m no Pollyanna, but I’m optimistic. In five years, we’ll all still be blundering along. There’ll be a few more traffic jams on the motorway. The film does resonate, though. Did you know they’re slaughtering dogs left, right and centre in Moscow at the moment? Thousands of them, ahead of the World Cup.” He shakes his head. Although we cover a lot of subjects, Kötting shows his only flickers of boredom when I ask what happened to Ivan later in life. “Who knows? He evaporated. Maybe he’s a drunk. Or maybe he’s playing football for Russia.” In fact, Ivan’s trail went cold very soon after the initial story broke. “There are a few photos of him online,” says Naylor. “But it all seemed to be suppressed by Russia. They claimed it didn’t happen. The last I heard, he joined the sea cadets at 17 and managed to readjust to society.” Kötting is content to let this sleeping dog lie. “I’m happy not knowing. The myth is the important thing. That and the fact that it’s true. We all need our mythical figures – Muhammad, Jesus, Robin Hood, Valerie Singleton – and Ivan is one of them.” • Lek and the Dogs is released on 8 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/08/sophie-willan-funniest-thing","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T13:00:12Z","webTitle":"Sophie Willan: ‘The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten?

Taking its steer from the weekly sessions in the UK parliament, the hour-long session on Wednesday marked the first time a German chancellor had been required to interact directly with opposition MPs. Under the new format, which was agreed to by the coalition government that assumed power in March, questions and answers were limited to a maximum time of one minute each. A three-colour system – green for go, yellow for 30 seconds left, and red for stop – helped steer the proceedings under the watchful eye of the Bundestag’s speaker, Wolfgang Schäuble. Journalists and other spectators who filled the visitor gallery looked on with glee, hoping that the new addition would make for a spectacle a good deal livelier than the average Bundestag assembly. Standing for the full 60 minutes, Merkel delivered her answers with ease; no doubt there would have been more squirming had follow-up questions been allowed. “What a shame it’s now over,” she smirked after Schäuble called time. “But I’ll be back.” She has four months to prepare for the next Kanzler Fragestunde – or chancellor’s question time – which is scheduled to be held three times a year. The first 20 minutes of the first session were focused on the G7 summit being held in Quebec this week, which Merkel admitted would be difficult owing to burgeoning strains between the US and other members over steel and aluminium tariffs, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. She rejected the suggestion, made by a member of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, that Russia should be invited back into the G7 fold having been banished after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Merkel also dismissed calls by the same party for her resignation over her refugee policy, which saw almost 1 million refugees enter Germany in 2015, saying that the country had “acted very responsibly in an exceptional situation”. The jokes were few and far between. A far-left Die Linke politician quipped that Donald Trump revealed more to Playboy than he did to his allies, and Merkel teased the Social Democrats that they were not in a position to criticise policies they had supported in opposition. All in all it lacked genuine confrontation or drama. The furniture of the Bundestag does not lend itself to such behaviour. The room is airy and spacious, without the cramped intimacy of the House of Commons, which forces eye contact and encourages the cut and thrust between political opponents. Merkel chose not to go to the central lectern, standing shyly in front of her seat. Other topics ranged from diesel emissions and rent hikes, to the number of women in parliament and child poverty – offering a broad overview of what concerns the average German. Meanwhile over in London, as one German commentator observed, PMQs was fixated on one topic: Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/07/high-street-woes-a-list-of-lost-shops-and-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T12:51:02Z","webTitle":"High street 2018: a tale of lost shops and at least 35,000 jobs at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/high-street-woes-a-list-of-lost-shops-and-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/07/high-street-woes-a-list-of-lost-shops-and-jobs","fields":{"headline":"High street 2018: a tale of lost shops and at least 35,000 jobs at risk","bodyText":"A string of retailers and restaurant groups have fallen into administration this year, from Toys R Us and Maplin in March to Poundworld last month. A number of struggling retailers and restaurateurs, including Mothercare, Carpetright, Byron and Prezzo, have resorted to company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) to close outlets and lay off staff. A CVA is a form of insolvency that enables a business to renegotiate deals with their creditors – mainly landlords being asked to accept lower rent payments for stores.

Tony Squirrell, 74, said it had been terrible to be apart from his wife, Joan, 64, and claimed that criminals were given better accommodation than they were offered when they were made homeless. He said: “I have been to war and seen some horrible things but nothing has taken its toll on me like this. I was in the army so I’ve slept in worse, and I take things in my stride. But it’s my wife I’m worried about. “Veterans in our society are not treated well. In America they do such a lot for them but here we get nothing.” The Squirrells, who have lived in Bridgwater, Somerset, for more than 40 years, were forced to leave their rented home five weeks ago because the landlord wanted to sell. About 1,700 people are on the housing list of Sedgemoor district council, which is Conservative-controlled. The Squirrells were among the 36 placed in the gold – high priority – band. The council offered the couple an emergency housing place. But Squirrell said: “We went to have a look and when I looked through the window, I took one look at the beds and thought: ‘My wife isn’t sleeping on that.’ “We’re not criminals but they’re treating us worse – if we had gone out and robbed a bank we would have better beds and three meals a day.” Joan added: “It was disgusting. There were stains all over the mattresses and we would have had to share a bathroom with other people.” The council also offered to help set them up in rented accommodation but the couple believe this will be too expensive and worry they may be moved on again. The Squirrells had lived in a two-bedroom house in Bridgwater for three and a half years, until they had to move out at the end of April. They were previously living in a retirement home, also in Bridgwater. Their daughter, Tracey Snow, said: “They have spent all their savings on rented accommodation over the past five years. They haven’t got any money left, they can’t rent privately anymore.” Snow said the couple were paying approximately £565 a month for their most recent home, and £500 a month for their previous home. She said: “They have spent so much money on renting, it’s ridiculous. And it’s going to be worse now, because renting prices have gone up. “Mum still works part-time [at a medical supply firm] in Taunton. She’s got to the stage now where she wants to retire, but with this going on at the moment she feels she can’t.” Joan finds it hard to climb stairs due to a lung condition, but the council says it has very few bungalows on its books. She moved in with their son but her husband, who served with the Royal Corps of Transport, bedded down in his shed. He spent four nights there before the charity Help 4 Homeless Veterans found him temporary accommodation. “The veterans’ charity have done more for us in 24 hours than the council has done in months,” said Squirrell. Help 4 Homeless Veterans has found a room at a bed and breakfast for the couple, but it is only available until Monday. Sedgemoor council said it had worked hard to help the couple. “At present, the council does not have any empty one-bedroom bungalows; there is a severe shortage of council-owned bungalows,” a spokeswoman said. “We have lost a lot of council-owned property under the right-to-buy scheme and, with funding regulation, we are unable to replace these homes. We have 1,700 active applications on the housing register with many being elderly and vulnerable. “Temporary accommodation has been made available to Mr and Mrs Squirrell, which they have refused. We have also offered help to secure privately rented accommodation in a location of their own choice, which they have refused. “We will continue to work with Mr and Mrs Squirrell to help them secure a solution to their housing needs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/07/spanish-police-arrest-man-alleged-head-drug-smuggling-gang-la-linea-de-la-concepcion-gibraltar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T16:24:13Z","webTitle":"Spanish police arrest alleged leader of drug-smuggling gang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/spanish-police-arrest-man-alleged-head-drug-smuggling-gang-la-linea-de-la-concepcion-gibraltar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/07/spanish-police-arrest-man-alleged-head-drug-smuggling-gang-la-linea-de-la-concepcion-gibraltar","fields":{"headline":"Spanish police arrest alleged leader of drug-smuggling gang","bodyText":"Spanish police have arrested a man alleged to be one of the biggest drug-smugglers operating on the violence-ridden stretch of southern coast close to Gibraltar. The man, named in media reports as Antonio Tejón, is one of the two brothers who head the Castañas gang, which allegedly brings huge quantities of hashish over from Morocco on powerful speedboats. He was detained in the early hours of Thursday after a 19-month search. More than 100 police officers and customs agents were involved in the operation, which took place in La Línea de la Concepción, a town close to the Gibraltar border. “After numerous investigations, officers learned that the suspect often visited a house in the town and [they] set up a surveillance team to gather information,” the national police force said. “The operation was complicated by the area where the suspect was found, which is a neighbourhood of narrow streets inhabited by his associates.” According to the statement, officers had to move quickly because of the limited time the man spent at the house, the security measures he had put in place, and the presence of “third parties”. The police said the man had been on the run since the end of 2016, when a major investigation resulted in 30 arrests and the seizure of one tonne of hashish, €350,000 (£310,000) in cash, 16 vehicles, three semi-rigid boats and a number of guns. The area around the town known as the Campo de Gibraltar has been a smuggling hub for centuries. Recent years have seen a surge in trafficking – and in clashes with police officers. In April last year, 100 people threw stones at police officers as they tried to seize a consignment of hashish on a beach. Four months ago, 20 masked men stormed the hospital in La Línea to free a suspected drug trafficker, while a group of off-duty Guardia Civil officers was attacked by a crowd armed with baseballs bats and broken bottles in nearby Algeciras in mid-May. Unions representing local Guardia Civil and national police officers have called for urgent reinforcements to address the security situation amid fears it could escalate further. Community leaders, meanwhile, say the Campo de Gibraltar, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in Spain, needs investment in both jobs and education. Juan Ignacio Zoido, who was interior minister until last week’s change of government, had insisted the authorities were making progress. Last year, police seized 145,372kg (320,490lb) of hashish in the region and 11,785kg of cocaine, while an elite Guardia Civil unit has been redeployed to the area."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2018/jun/07/how-back-up-holiday-photos-without-using-laptop-cloud-wifi","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T11:00:41Z","webTitle":"How can I back up my holiday photos without using a laptop?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/jun/07/how-back-up-holiday-photos-without-using-laptop-cloud-wifi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2018/jun/07/how-back-up-holiday-photos-without-using-laptop-cloud-wifi","fields":{"headline":"How can I back up my holiday photos without using a laptop?","bodyText":"We take thousands of photos on our caravan holidays, and I like to back them up every day or so. At present, I take a laptop and an external hard drive, so I have a copy on the laptop in the caravan plus a copy on the hard drive in my car. Is there a way to make backups from SD cards to hard drives without carrying a laptop? I should add that many of the caravan sites we visit do not have wifi, so cloud backup is not practicable. Graham Backing up photos used to be a problem for people taking exotic holidays. I thought it had gone away, thanks to advances in technology. First, SD storage cards have got bigger and faster. Unless you are a professional sports photographer shooting sequences of RAW images, it takes a long time to fill affordable 64GB or 128GB SD cards, or even larger cards. You can easily carry 1TB without even noticing. (Video photographers may still have problems.) Second, laptops have become smaller and lighter over the past decade, and they generally have much better battery life. It wasn’t fun backpacking a 2.5kg laptop plus charger, but 1kg alternatives have been around for at least a decade. And since you have a caravan, I wouldn’t have thought the weight mattered. In my case, the 11.6in laptop is much lighter than the DSLR, extra-wide zoom, prime lens and flashgun. If you’re using a compact camera with a vintage laptop, things might be different. However, you could always buy a mini-laptop with a 7in screen, such as the GamePad GPD Pocket, GPD Pocket or Mini PC. Third, wireless connections are now widely available. I cede to your superior knowledge of caravan sites, but I expect you pass through small towns that have free wifi. Even if it’s too slow to do complete backups, you could always upload copies of your top three photos of the day. You could also use a 3G or 4G wireless connection to upload photos. This can be worth it to pro photographers who buy data-only sim cards for the purpose, but it’s an expensive way to back up holiday snaps. SD solutions In general, I think the best solution is to buy lots of large SD or microSD cards and carry a small laptop. This is what I do. However, not all old equipment can handle large cards. Check the manuals or search online to find out how big an SD card your camera can handle, and whether your laptop can read it. If it can’t, a little USB adapter will probably solve the problem: I use an Anker adaptor that can work with two cards – one microSD and one SD – at the same time. When SD cards appeared, they used Microsoft’s FAT12 or FAT16 file system, so they could only store up to 2GB of data. However, SDHC cards, which use FAT32, can store up to 32GB, while SDXC cards can store up to 2TB using exFAT. With storage capacities above 16GB – typically 32GB, 64GB and 128GB – it’s rarely worth the effort of deleting photos. Just stick a new card in when the old one is full, and reformat it later if really necessary. If camera capacity is the bottleneck, you could back up your camera’s small SD cards to large SDXC cards, or microSD cards. SD cards are not impervious to damage: I have one that no longer works after getting crushed in my wallet. However, they’re probably safer than external hard drives, especially the ones not designed for travelling. SD cards don’t break when you drop them. Hello, Gnarbox! People have been looking for a ways to back up CompactFlash and SD cards for many years, but I didn’t notice any making an impact on the consumer market. That changed with the Gnarbox, which raised over $500,000 on Kickstarter in 2015. The company now has three products, and the Gnarbox 2.0 SSD is on the way. It’s on track to raise more than $1 million on Kickstarter, and will ship to the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, among other places. Pre-launch prices range from $299 (128GB) to $699 (1TB). The Gnarbox is actually a very small computer with its own processor and memory. The clever bit is that it’s controlled from a smartphone app, so you get some of the benefits of a laptop without the size, weight or screen. Of course, the need for a processor and memory pushes up the price. A 128GB Gnarbox costs £329.99 at Amazon.co.uk while 256GB jumps to £449.99. By contrast, you can buy a 256GB SD card for £78.46. The Gnarbox can solve the storage problem for members of the GoPro-using, drone-flying, smartphone-addicted post-laptop generation. But you can buy devices that do more for less. EHDs with SD slots Several companies have launched external hard drives (EHDs) with SD card slots. Some of them also have wireless connectivity. Unfortunately, I haven’t tried any, so I can’t comment on their performance or their usability. However, the need for extra software and electronics is bound to push up the cost of storage, compared to bare drives, and you’ll still have to sacrifice other features you’d get by using a laptop instead. Sanho targets serious amateur and professional photographers with portable backup devices that include a small screen. The HyperDrive Colorspace UDMA3, for example, includes a 160GB hard drive – user-replaceable up to 2TB – and a 3.5in 320 x 480-pixel screen for £379.90. It supports USB3, and a built-in USB-2.0 OTG host enables it to connect directly to some cameras and camcorders. (OTG stands for “on the go”.) Built-in wifi allows connections to smartphones via iOS and Android apps, and to laptops via browsers. Plug it in to your PC’s USB port and it appears as a normal external hard drive. One cheaper alternative is Western Digital’s My Passport Wireless Pro: an external USB3 hard drive with an SD card slot and built-in wifi. WD claims it does “one-touch SD card copy”. It also has a USB2 port that can connect to cameras and other devices (I assume via OTG), and it can create a local hotspot that can support up to eight devices. US prices on WD’s website range from $149.99 for 1TB of storage to $219.99 for 4TB. On Amazon.co.uk, the 4TB version is the best value: £203.39 at the time of writing. The 1TB model costs £162.10. (US prices don’t include sales taxes; UK prices include VAT.) However, the My Passport Wireless Pro has as many one star reviews as five star reviews, and the bad reviews would certainly put me off. As one reviewer says: “Good concept. Implementation less than perfect.” Feel the RAVPower Based on reading a mind-numbing volume of Amazon reviews for numerous products, I think your best bet is Sunvalley’s RAVPower FileHub Plus, which is dead cheap at £39.99. It is not a storage device. It is a wireless travel router, a DLNA-compatible media streamer, and a 6000mAh external battery pack that will recharge your smartphone. All these features could be useful to a caravan family. It also includes an SD card reader, so you could use it to copy an SD card from your camera to your current external hard drive, or other device, without using your laptop. Of course, you will need the smartphone app to run the operation. A wedding photographer says that, in his opinion, it’s “a better option that the WD Passport Pro”. Another photographer bought one for the same purpose “but couldn’t get a stable connection”. He concluded: “Suffice to say, lesson learnt, laptop will be the primary backup source.” Still, the RAVPower has 73% 5-star reviews, and looks worth a try if you need any of its other functions.

Peter Isola, an expert in gaming law and regulation who joined the board as a non-executive director in 2016, stepped down after the gambling operator came under pressure from shareholders at its annual meeting in Gibraltar on Wednesday. At the meeting, nearly 44% of shareholders voted against the firm’s remuneration report for 2017 and 42.6% opposed the re-election of Isola as a director. All resolutions were passed. Last year, the company saw off a similar pay revolt, when more than 45% of investors failed to support its pay policy. Shareholders objected to the large payouts the company has awarded its chief executive, Kenneth Alexander, and the non-executive chairman, Lee Feldman. Alexander has received £45m in share options since 2016, while Feldman has picked up share options worth £22.5m, thanks to a scheme linked to the firm’s share price, which recently hit an all-time high. GVC has recently taken over Ladbrokes Coral to form a £5bn gambling company, the second biggest in the UK after Paddy Power Betfair. The group, which also owns Foxy Bingo, is due to join the FTSE 100 index of leading companies on Monday. The chair of GVC’s remuneration committee, Jane Anscombe, said the committee was “of course disappointed” by the vote on the remuneration report. “We acknowledge this feedback and thank those shareholders who have already spoken with us and explained their reasons for not being able to support this resolution,” she said. “We have sought to balance the views we have heard from shareholders with the clear need to appropriately reward and retain our successful management team, and we are committed to continuing this dialogue with our shareholders.” Shareholder advisory groups had urged investors to vote against GVC’s pay awards and Institutional Shareholder Services had also advised a vote against Isola’s reappointment. Britain’s corporate governance code states that a non-executive director’s independence could be “potentially impaired” by holding a so-called “material business relationship”. Isola is a senior partner at the Gibraltar-based legal firm Isolas and his independence was questioned because Isolas was paid more than €300,000 (£263,000) for advisory work it carried out for GVC in 2017 and 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/08/access-to-disability-pension-slashed-by-more-than-half-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T18:00:49Z","webTitle":"Access to disability pension slashed by more than half, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/08/access-to-disability-pension-slashed-by-more-than-half-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/08/access-to-disability-pension-slashed-by-more-than-half-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"Access to disability pension slashed by more than half, data shows","bodyText":"The government has dramatically cut access to the disability support pension in the past eight years, cutting the approval rate from 63% to about 30% this financial year. Successive governments – both Labor and Liberal – have implemented policies to tighten access to the payment, which supports those with a physical or intellectual impairment that hampers their ability to work. Data provided by the Department of Human Services shows 24,809 of about 84,000 claims have been granted so far in the current financial year. That is a grant rate of 29.53%. The rate dipped to its lowest recent level in 2015-16, when just 26,842 of the 106,000 applications were approved – roughly one in four. It is a huge reduction from 2010, when about 63% of pension applications were approved. The Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) says the policies are driving people with a limited capacity to work either into poverty or on to the poverty-level Newstart. Single recipients of the DSP get about $$826 per fortnight. The single rate for Newstart is about $545.80. The Acoss executive, Cassandra Goldie, said one in four people on Newstart now had only a partial capacity to work. “These policies increase rates of poverty in Australia,” Goldie said. “Being forced to live on Newstart is obviously devastating for people who are living with a disability, often acquired in the workplace, and who are struggling to find a job. “We must urgently increase the rate of unemployment payment by at least $75 per week so that it does not leave people destitute. “We must ensure people who need the DSP receive it. And we must do better in employing people with a disability.” The payment is one of the larger components of the social security budget. It accounted for about 10.6% of social security spending in 2016-17. The policies were aimed at curtailing the expenditure by restricting the number of new recipients coming onto the scheme. A report by the parliamentary budget office in February found new compliance and assessment measures introduced by the Gillard government in 2012 caused a “sharp decline” in eligibility. In 2015, the Coalition introduced its own crackdown on the DSP. It forced new claimants to be assessed by a government-appointed doctor. The national social security rights network found earlier this year that the policy was making life far more difficult for claimants.

Here’s our news stories on the House of Fraser store closure plan: After suffering technical problems that delayed that start of trading by an hour, Britain’s stock exchange has ended the day calmly. The FTSE 100 just closed eight points lower at 7,704 points. Retailers had a mixed day; Marks &amp; Spencer lost 1.1% while Next dipped by 0.4%. Oil companies had a better day, though, with BP the top riser (up 2.2%). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, explains why energy stocks were in demand: Oil rallied hard across the session, jumping 1.5% and recouping losses from the previous session. Buyers came flooding back into the oil market as concerns over supply issues in Venezuela overshadow fears that OPEC could be on the verge of easing oil production cuts. With 2 weeks remaining until the OPEC meeting in Vienna, we are expecting an increase in volatility as investors weigh up the probability of an increase in production against the increasing supply problems in Venezuela and Iran. Oil stocks such as BP and Shell traced the price of oil higher. Here’s some instant reaction to Dave Ramsden’s views on the UK economy: The pound has crept a little higher, up 0.15% at $1.343, but frankly sterling has been volatile all day (as Theresa May and David Davis have tried to hammer out an agreement on Britain’s Brexit backstop plan). Newsflash: A senior Bank of England policymaker has declared that the UK economy is emerging from its recent soft patch. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is telling an audience in London that recent data supports the bank’s view that the slowdown earlier this year was temporary. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) resisted raising interest rates in May, and Ramsden’s comments suggest a rate rise could come in August. Ramsden says: “It is still early days. We are still only two thirds of the way through the second quarter, less far through the second quarter data cycle, and only a month has passed since our last MPC meeting. “Even so, the data we have had so far suggests our interpretation of the slowdown in the first quarter as temporary looks to be being borne out. Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys. That included the latest services PMI (purchasing managers’ index) output balance, representing 80% of the economy. So far at least our May judgement looks on track. “Looking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC’s best collective judgement as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust. I expect GDP growth to resume at a steady but unspectacular pace and demand to continue to rotate away from consumption and towards trade and investment.” Ramsden is seen as a dovish member of the MPC, having opposed last November’s rate hike. Another reason why landlords are unhappy about House of Fraser’s move: House of Fraser’s attempt to use a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to close 31 stores and cut the rent on some others will annoy some landlords. Matthew Weaver, partner at Radcliffe Chambers, explains why property owners are losing patience with this legal manoeuvre: Landlords are becoming restless in the face of numerous CVAs proposed and entered into by retailers in which they are faced with significant decreases in the rent being charged and, in some instances, closure of stores which still have significant lease periods left on them – thereby reducing or removing income for the landlords. Typically, landlords of profitable stores are treated reasonably well in CVA proposals but those of loss-making stores are offered very little. This flexibility to treat different landlords differently (i.e. repaying the majority of some landlord debts under a CVA but very little of other landlord debts) has angered landlords generally as has the fact that CVA proposals often treat other creditors (suppliers for example) much better and do not impact on the rights of secured creditors (such as banks or other funders). In addition, other businesses (most notably Next) have indicated that they are now sick and tired of competitor businesses using CVAs to reduce overheads, giving them an obvious competitive advantage. Next has stated that it will begin to negotiate a “CVA clause” into its new leases whereby its rent will be reduced in keeping with any reduction under a CVA of a business trading nearby to their stores. This will only increase the anger of landlords. There is a view that retailers are using CVAs to gain a commercial advantage and there is a growing air of cynicism about them. This is not helped by the subsequent administration or liquidation of a number of high-profile retailers that have entered into CVAs which have failed, asking the question of whether the CVA was ever an appropriate step to attempt in the first place. Plymouth City Council are disappointed that their local store faces the axe: One male shopper on Oxford Street tells us: “It’s a bit of a shock.” He hoped that the newly refurbished House of Fraser store near Victoria station in London would stay open. “I don’t really do online shopping. I like the personal touch.” Otherwise he said he would probably switch to Debenhams or John Lewis. Christopher Scott, who hates shopping and had come to House of Fraser’s Oxford Street shop for his “one big shopping trip of the year” was indifferent to the store closure, although he added: “I got a winter coat from House of Fraser [in the past]. It’s quite good.” But he was also wary of online shopping, saying clothes often don’t fit if you don’t try them on. Shoppers at House of Fraser’s Oxford Street branch say they were shocked and saddened to hear of the flagship store’s closure. Pamela Emmanuel, who has a House of Fraser loyalty card and has been shopping there for more than 20 years, told us: “I’m shocked that they are closing this one because it is Oxford Street. There are still so many people that don’t do online shopping. I like to come and try things on.” She said she had an inkling when the department store stopped selling the Petite range of clothes that she liked, and could not get an appointment at the nail bar which she thought was shutting. Lala Ahmadova, who has been shopping at House of Fraser since she moved to London from Azerbaijan 10 years ago, said: “It’s sad people are going to lose their jobs. It’s something like BHS – it’s another shop that has been here for a long time.” She said the retailer sells some brands that you cannot buy elsewhere on the high street, such as Hallhuber womenswear and Timberland Kids. House of Fraser employs 990 people directly and through its concessions at the two London stores that are due to be shut, in Oxford Street and the City. A member of staff working in beauty knew about the store closure but said he had not been told about his future. Jeanne Bateman from Norwich said: “I’m a big high street shopper. I’m very sad to see so many big high street names closing down. I feel sorry for us the shopper, and very sorry for the people who work here.” Her daughter Catherine Wilamowska agreed, although she added that because she lives in a small village she does all her shopping online. Another regular House of Fraser shopper, Sille Jeeawon, said: “I will be very sad. I like what they sell.” She said she would go to Debenhams once the Oxford Street shop shuts its doors. Shoppers in Birkenhead, Merseyside, are unhappy that their local House of Fraser is earmarked for closure. Doreen Gibson, 81, from Greasby, Wirral, told the Press Association that she and her friends would miss the department store badly – and blamed young shoppers for buying on the Internet... “We’ve been coming here every two weeks for 25 years. We meet our friends and have a coffee in the restaurant and a bit of shopping. “It is devastating. They are all shopping online now, all the younger ones, that’s what’s ruining it all. Some people still like to go and see what they are going to buy. “Honestly, it’s really, really terrible news.” After crunching the numbers, we can report that at least 35,00 jobs are at risk - or already cut - across Britain’s retailers and restaurant chains since the start of this year: Despite the Father’s Day offers that are heavily advertised in the street-level window displays, the Frasers store in Edinburgh was quiet on Thursday morning, as the unexpectedly warm weather encouraged shoppers outdoors, my colleague Libby Brooks reports. Staff at the store, one of two owned by the retailer on Princes Street, the city’s main thoroughfare, had been told not to speak to the media. Each till point has issued with contact details for the press office at headquarters, but many staff privately expressed shock at the news that the store would be closed in early 2019, affected 127 jobs, with some close to tears. Others expressed anger that, although the proposed closure of 31 stores was already public knowledge, they had heard about the closure of their own store from the morning news bulletins rather than from management. One described an “atmosphere” in the days leading up to the announcement, but remained surprised at the decision. Window-shopping with his partner on a day trip from Fife, David Bell said that if upmarket retailers like Frasers and its sister store Jenners along the street were failing to make a profit, then it was further evidence that shoppers were moving online. “The high streets are suffering everywhere, even Kirkcaldy where we’re from has so many closures. In a place like Frasers they are charging 50% more than you’d pay online and they still can’t make a profit. Shopping online is not just convenient, it’s so much cheaper.” Looking up at the prime site on the corner of Princes Street, opposite the Waldorf Astoria, he asked: “What will they do with the building now? It’s been here forever but I can’t think who would want to take it over.” In the Pride of Scots gift shop next door to Frasers, Abdul Manan blamed the location of the store for poor footfall. “People don’t come to this end of the street. It’s really the wrong location. They go further up Princes Street, where the Scott Monument is. Jenners is in a really good spot.” Here are a few of the House of Fraser stores facing the axe, if the company’s creditors approve its restructuring plan. Another UK company, the AA, is facing its shareholders at its annual general meeting. Investors are angry about the pay packages handed to bosses, and demanding (in vain) answers about the dismissal of the former chairman. Some more mundane issues are also on the agenda, as my colleague Rob Davies reports from the AGM: At the AA annual meeting, chairman John Leach has said the company will not be answering any questions about former chairman Bob Mackenzie, who is suing the company for £225m after he was sacked over an assault on a colleague at a country hotel. Despite finance chief Martin Clarke having voluntarily given up a bonus earlier this year, 24% of voting shareholders have rejected the company’s pay policy, although not all votes are in yet. Chairman John Leach says some shareholders are concerned about the uncertainty around performance conditions attached to company bonus plans. In the absence of any questions on Bob Mackenzie, one shareholder has raised two equally scintillating matters. The first is a request that the motor industry sue the government over the impact of potholes. The second is that there be gluten-free biscuits at future AGMs. One of House of Fraser’s (many) problems is a failure to engage with millennials. Amelia Brophy, head of data products at YouGov, explains how the chain has lagged behind nimbler retail rivals, and failed to impress younger shoppers: “YouGov BrandIndex data underlines how House of Fraser’s brand perception has declined over the past year. Its Impression score (whether someone has a favourable impression of the brand) among the general public has declined from +23 last May to +19 now. Its score among younger consumers, those in the 18-34 age bracket, is even lower, at +17. This is been mirrored by shifts in the brand’s Quality score, which, among the general public has fallen from +32 to +29. However, the key is the brand’s Value score, particularly among younger customers. Overall, it has a rating of just +1, way behind online rivals that have outflanked it. Among 18-24s its score is -4, well below other stores such as H&amp;M (+31), Asos (+27) and Boohoo (+14).” Patrick O’Brien, UK research director at GlobalData Retail, reckons Marks &amp; Spencer could benefit from House of Fraser’s retrenchment: M&amp;S is also cutting back on stores, with more than 100 expected to close over the next few years. Typo alert: That last headline should have said ‘Poundworld’, of course, not ‘Poundland’. Now fixed, sorry for any confusion.... It’s turning into another black day for UK retail, with reports that budget chain Poundworld is on the brink of administration. Poundworld could file for administration today, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk across the UK. The company, which made a loss of £17m last year, has been trying to find a buyer for some time, but without success. It has 355 stores, and faces a quarterly rent bill in less than three weeks. Press Association has more details: Sources told PA that the notice will give Poundworld time to structure a deal, which could be undertaken through a pre-pack administration, with private equity firm R Capital, former owner of Little Chef. The administration will be handled by Poundworld’s advisers Deloitte. Poundworld, which is owned by TPG Capital, had previously rejected offers to sell through a pre-pack but all options are now being considered. Sky News’s Mark Kleinman also fears that Poundworld will join the swelling ranks of UK retailers forced into administration. The Labour Party have accused the government of neglecting Britain’s struggling retail sector, while it struggled to get to grips with Brexit. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Shadow Business Secretary, points out that more than tens of thousands jobs are being lost this year: “In the first three months of this year 21,000 jobs were lost in the retail sector. Today another 6000 jobs are at risk as House of Fraser confirms store closures across the UK. “While the Cabinet is in chaos over Brexit their lack of focus on our high streets is leading to mass job losses, failing one of the biggest employers and industrial sectors in the UK, which is why Labour has called on the Business Secretary to publish a retail sector strategy to safeguard jobs. “The next Labour government will support retail by placing it at the heart of our industrial strategy. It’s time for the Tories to step up to the challenge of rescuing our high streets.” The rising use of CVAs by cash-strapped retailers is hurting Britain’s landlords, warns Daniel Stern, commercial property litigator at Manchester-based law firm Slater Heelis. Stern says there is a ‘rescue culture’ at the heart of insolvency regimes, allowing retailers to go into administration, shed unprofitable operations, and then emerge stronger. “Only 75 per cent of a company’s creditors need to approve a CVA which is then legally binding on all unsecured creditors, including landlords, regardless of whether the landlord agreed the proposal. “This effectively means property owners must accept lower rents to help a tenant avoid financial collapse. As landlords are often pension and investment funds this is having a knock-on effect on the ordinary man in the street. The Huffington Post have helpfully listed the 28 House of Fraser stores that are staying open if the CVA is agreed. They are: Gateshead Metro Centre, Huddersfield, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield Meadowhall, Sutton Coldfield, Bluewater, Croydon, London City, London Victoria, London Westfield, Richmond, West Thurrock Lakeside, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Cirencester, Exeter, Guildford, Maidstone, Norwich, Reading The Oracle, Rushden Lakes, Edinburgh (Jenners), Glasgow, Loch Lomond Shores (Jenners), and Belfast. Victor Garcia Capdevila of credit rating agency Moody’s believes the store closure plan should give House of Fraser some breathing room to tackle its problems. Capdevila says: “Store closures will allow House of Fraser to reduce its rent bill and exit long-dated lease agreements in unprofitable locations. This should facilitate and accelerate the transformation of the company into a more effective multi-channel retailer while alleviating liquidity challenges that have necessitated cash injections from its owner over the past few months.” Moody’s currently has a Caa1 rating on House of Fraser’s debt. That’s a ‘junk’ rating, implying a substantial risk that the company might not repay its borrowings [Caa1 is the 17th highest rating, only four above default]. House of Fraser says it has put another £1m into its pension fund to secure the backing of its pension trustees for its CVA restructuring plan. In other news, Britain’s housing market is still in sluggish mode, according to the latest survey. House prices rose 1.5% in May from the month before, following a sharp drop of 3.1% in April, says Halifax, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group. The average price of a home is now £224,439. This means prices grew just 0.2% in the three months to May from the previous quarter, while the annual rate slowed to 1.9% from 2.2%. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said: “Both of these measures have fallen since reaching a recent peak, in the final months of last year. These latest price changes reflect a relatively subdued UK housing market. After a sharp rise in January, mortgage approvals have softened in the past three months. Whilst both newly agreed sales and new buyer enquiries are showing signs of stabilisation having fallen in recent months.” The Cardiff branch of House of Fraser, which is earmarked for closure in today’s plan, is opening late today (presumably because staff are being briefed about the situation?). This store is one of the biggest department stores in Wales. It dates back to the 1850s, when James Howell opened a department store there. Howells was acquired by the House of Fraser group in the 1970s. The store closures announcement is awful news for thousands of House of Fraser staff. Some will have discovered their job is being eliminated as they headed to work this morning. Four stores in the West Midlands are closing, for example, as Simon Penfold of the Birmingham Express and Star explains: It will mean more than 1,100 people losing their jobs across the West Midlands. The Beatties store in Wolverhampton employs 279, 150 work at Telford, 83 at Shrewsbury and 688 at the House of Fraser store in Birmingham. Some staff learned of the news through Twitter before they even got to work today. Here’s our retail correspondent Sarah Butler on today’s news: House of Fraser is to close 31 stores, more than half of its UK chain, putting a further 6,000 retail jobs at risk and dealing another hammer blow to British high streets. The struggling department store group’s Oxford Street flagship in London and outlets in cities including Birmingham, Cardiff and Edinburgh are among those facing closure. The drastic cuts form part of a rescue plan that will also lead to the company moving out of its head offices in London and Glasgow. The 31 outlets would close by early next year under a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that enables a business to rearrange deals with landlords. Creditors are set to vote on the deal, which includes reducing rents by 25% at 10 other stores, on 22 June. The House of Fraser chairman, Frank Slevin, said: “The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. “So while closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.” More here: House of Fraser’s creditors will vote on today’s proposal on 22 June. As well as shutting 31 department stores, the company also wants to shave 25% off the rent of another 16 stores. If landlords agree, then these 16 stores (plus another 10) will remain open and keep trading, the company says. Back to House of Fraser.... and ITV News’ Joel Hills reports that some landlords will oppose the plan to shut 31 stores. Back in the City, London’s stock market failed to open at 8am. The London Stock Exchange are blaming ‘technical’ issues, and have just managed to get trading running. It’s a highly unusual development - the last such outage occurred in 2011 (updated). Hopefully we’ll find out what went wrong soon.... Alex Williamson, chief executive of House of Fraser, has promised to support the 6,000 staff who could lose their jobs: “Today’s announcement is one of the most important in this company’s 169-year history. “We, as a management team, have a responsibility to take necessary steps to ensure House of Fraser’s survival, which is why we are making these proposals. I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all my colleagues at House of Fraser for working tirelessly throughout this difficult period. We are fully committed to supporting those personally affected by the proposals. Assuming today’s plan is approved, the 31 stores earmarked for closure up and down the country will shut in early 2019. John Pal, retail expert at Alliance Manchester Business School, says retailers such as House of Fraser are facing a ‘perfect storm’. Rising business rates, competition from internet rivals, and over-capacity on the high street are making some stores unviable. Pal says: “News that House of Fraser is to close stores comes as no surprise as many retailers grapple with stagnating sales and increasing running costs. Once the training budget has been cut, over-time slashed and overall headcount reduced, in both head offices and in stores, it’s time to focus on the big costs of which stores are a main one. Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says today’s store closures reflect the move away from high street stores and onto internet shopping: “News that House of Fraser is to shut its Oxford Street store and 30 others is a huge statement of intent. The closure of such an iconic flagship store signals the massive restructuring task at hand. “Department stores are incredibly expensive to operate and the last few years have seen costs spiraling upwards from business rates, rents and National Living Wage. These traditional retail business models that hold huge fixed costs are simply becoming unsustainable for some retailers. “The announcement to close such a significant number of stores highlights the unyielding shift towards online shopping and the overcapacity concerns faced by a significant proportion of the market. The retailer will need to push forward right-sizing initiatives and utilise any excess space to sweat assets more effectively in a move become fit-for-purpose in today’s digital age. Economics journalist Dharshini David agrees that UK retailers are suffering from ‘desperate’ times: Today’s grim announcement follows weeks of talks between House of Fraser’s owners - China’s C. Banner - and its lenders and landlords. House of Fraser needs 70 per cent of its creditors – including landlords – to back the plan filed this morning. If they don’t, then the entire company would probably collapse into administration. That would put 17,000 jobs at risk across its 59 stores. Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, say the company needs to shut more than half its stores, or face collapsing altogether. “The retail industry is undergoing fundamental change and House of Fraser urgently needs to adapt to this fast-changing landscape in order to give it a future and allow it to thrive. “Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business. “So whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.” House of Fraser is shutting these 31 stores under a company voluntary arrangement. It’s effectively a deal between a struggling firm and its creditors under which underperforming stores are shed. Under the CVA, House of Fraser is looking to cut the rent on these 31 stores to just 30% for the next seven months - and then shut them down. Accountancy firm KPMG is managing the process. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, says a CVA is needed to keep House of Fraser operating in today’s tough retail environment. “The CVAs proposed by House of Fraser give the business a vital lifeline to avoid administration by renegotiating the lease terms of its UK-wide property portfolio, as part of a wider restructuring. The business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.” NEWSFLASH: Retail chain House of Fraser has announced plans to shut more than half of its UK and Ireland stores, in a move that will cost up to 6,000 jobs. House of Fraser is planning to close 31 of its 59 stores across the UK and Ireland, under a restructuring plan filed at the Court of Session in Edinburgh this morning. The list of stores includes House of Fraser’s flagship site on London’s Oxford Street, as well as at towns and cities across the country. Here’s the list of stores that will close over the next few months: Altrincham, Aylesbury, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Camberley, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chichester, Cirencester, Cwmbran, Darlington, Doncaster, Edinburgh Frasers, Epsom, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Hull, Leamington Spa, Lincoln, London Oxford Street, London King William Street, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Plymouth, Shrewsbury, Skipton, Swindon, Telford, Wolverhampton, Worcester.

Back in the UK, Thames Water is handing £65m to customers as part of a £120m package of penalties for failing to tackle leaks: Germany’s economy ministry is trying to sound upbeat - pointing out that the country’s factories still have a decent backlog of orders to plough through: “To what extent uncertainties play a role, especially from the external environment, is difficult to assess. However, the order backlog in the manufacturing sector is still very high.” Carsten Brzeski, ING’s chief economist for Germany, is disappointed by the 2.5% decline in German factory orders last month. He agrees that it suggests Germany’s economy has weakened this year. Normally, an increase in new orders after three consecutive drops looks as safe a bet as predicting tomorrow’s sunrise. However, it seems that today the sun did not rise for German industry. It will get harder and harder to explain these monthly drops with one-offs like the weather or the timing of holidays. In fact, evidence is piling up that the soft patch at the start of the year has been more serious than previously thought. For the time being, we remain cautiously positive. In absolute terms, order books are still richly filled, assured production is high and inventories have been reduced recently. All boding well for industrial activity in the coming months. However, today’s disappointing new orders reading sends a clear warning that nothing should be taken for granted. Good morning , and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. German factory have suffered their fourth drop in monthly orders in a row, raising fresh fears over the strength of Europe’s largest economy. Industrial orders slumped by 2.5% in April, new figures from the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) show. On an annual basis, order numbers in April were 0.1% lower than in April 2017. March’s data has been revised down too, to show a 1.1% drop in demand. The decline was driven by a 4.8% drop in domestic orders, while new orders from Germany’s eurozone neighbours tumbled by almost 10%, Destatis reports. Capital goods orders (for machinery etc) fell by 5.6% month-on-month in April, while consumer goods orders fell by 2.2%. Intermediate goods orders rose by 2.5%, though. The data is much worse than expected - economists had forecast a 0.8% rise in orders for goods with “Made In Germany” stamped proudly on them. This decline suggests that the German economy has made a faltering start to 2018, perhaps dragged back by fears of a trade war triggered by Donald Trump’s tariffs. Experts are warning that Germany’s factories have made a ‘horrible’ start to the second quarter of 2018 - a worrying sign for its economy, and the wider global economy too.

The report, by the Centre for Tourism and Regional Opportunities at Central Queensland University, says towns should now develop “new tourism experiences” to compensate for lost visitors and the likelihood of further damage to the climate-threatened reef. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning At Cairns, domestic visitor numbers and revenue from interstate tourism were down in 2016 and 2017. A survey of domestic tourists at Cairns airport found that, at the start of 2016, the third most common reason for visiting the tropical north city was to see the reef. By the third quarter of that year – after news reports that the marine heatwave was causing the biggest coral bleaching event in history – the reef dropped to 12th on that list. The survey conducted by CQU found that visitors to Cairns “were generally aware that coral bleaching was occurring through media reports and that there was a high and increasing level of concern about the bleaching events”. “This result suggests that if further coral bleaching events occur in the near future the destination’s target markets will quickly become aware of the event and may base purchase decisions on concerns about the level of reported damage. The danger for the destination is that repeated bleaching events will form a pattern in the mind of consumers and may generate a long-term negative image.” The Great Barrier Reef, which is the largest living structure on the planet, features heavily in Australian tourism promotions. It remains the top reason for international tourists to visit Cairns. The report says the likelihood of further and more severe coral bleaching events was “alarming” for tourism businesses in areas such as Cairns, Port Douglas and the Whitsundays. “If predictions of further and more severe bleaching are correct, these destinations will face a future of declining tourism interest, at least for those groups of tourists who rank the [reef] as the key motive for visiting the affected destinations,” the report says. “Further coral bleaching may lead to a significant decline in international tourism, with resultant economic impacts.” In the Whitsundays, where the tourism industry is better insulated from damage to the reef by more resort-style experiences and swimming beaches, visitor numbers have been skewed by damage caused by cyclone Debbie. Tony Fontes, a Whitsundays-based dive operator, said there was “no doubt” the drop in tourist numbers had been caused by climate change and the resultant coral bleaching. Fontes says some tourism businesses had “put their head in the sand” about bleaching and refused to admit there was a problem, mainly out of fear that negative publicity would discourage visitors. “In 2017 when the bleaching moved further south, the tourism industry started to become a little more proactive than what they used to,” Fontes said. “By hiding and not admitting that we’ve got a problem, that’s not helping. They’re starting to come together and advocate for better action, better late than never. “We’ve exploited the reef forever as tourism operators. Very few of us have ever given anything back to the reef. Not enough of us are standing up to back the reef.” The report was focused on local actions that could be taken to support the tourism industry.

The bill, which had previously passed through the parliament’s upper house, establishes 150-metre “safe access zones” around abortion clinics and proposes potential jail time for people caught harassing people within the zones. It will also make it an offence to record or distribute a recording of a person inside the exclusion zone without their consent. NSW joins Victoria, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory in enacting laws to ban harassment of women seeking abortions or other reproductive advice. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The bill was co-sponsored in the upper house by Nationals and Labor MPs, and on Thursday it was introduced into the lower chamber by the Nationals MP Leslie Williams, who said it was “not about abortions” but “respecting the rights of others”. She said so-called sidewalk counsellors – people who confront women seeking abortions outside reproductive clinics – were “abhorrent” and “unacceptable”. “I understand that the self-appointed sidewalk counsellors referred to may engage in this activity with the best intentions, believing they are providing advice in the best interests of the woman,” she said. “However, they are untrained and they are unqualified and are clearly providing counsel with a predetermined outcome – that is stopping women having an abortion. “They are ignorant of the woman’s circumstances and background and are indiscriminate when it comes to who they target with their views and their intimidating behaviour.” The bill passed through the lower house with the support of the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, who did not speak on the legislation but helped secure its passage by giving Coalition MPs a conscience vote. The deputy premier, John Barilaro, also supported the bill, drawing from personal experience in explaining that 27 years ago he travelled from Queanbeyan to Sydney with a partner for her to seek an abortion. “Can you imagine being confronted by protesters in any shape, way or form when you actually attend [a clinic]? You’re scared, the fear is already inside of you, you don’t know if you’re making the right decision [but] the decision is made,” he said. But the bill still faced opposition from Berejiklian’s ministry. The treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, a devout Catholic, said the National party “should know better” than to support the legislation. He said the bill was an attempt to “silence those who refuse to turn a blind eye to the value of both mother and child”. It was, Perrottet said, an attempt to “remove from public spaces any trace of the witness that is a daily reminder of the dignity of human life”. Exclusion zone bills in Victoria and Tasmania are the subject of challenges in the high court, and Perrottet predicted the NSW legislation would also be challenged. The bill, he argued, could be “unconstitutional”. The NSW and federal governments have joined the Victorian defence of the law. The minister for women, Tanya Davies, who has previously said she is “pro-life”, voted against the bill. Harassment, intimidation, threats and abuse of women seeking abortions “must stop”, she said. But, she contended: “Not all women are being provided with all the options available to them when they consider their choice.” Sidewalk counsellors, Davies said, could allow women to “make a fully informed decision”. The Liberal MP Damien Tudehope, a member of the hard right, sought to move a number of amendments to the bill but eventually it passed with a comfortable majority. Jenny Aitchison, the shadow minister for women, led the debate for Labor. She said women made the decision to access an abortion “from all perspectives, from all socioeconomic backgrounds, from all faiths and belief systems, from all situations and locations, and for all reasons” and the bill was about allowing them “to act in accordance with their own consciences”. “We are must respect the right of a woman to make a decision without someone who has no knowledge about her personal circumstances, judging her, showing her terrible images, photographing her or even acting in a way that would make her feel badly about the choice that she has made,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/07/tiny-shrimp-could-influence-global-climate-changes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"Tiny shrimp could influence global climate changes | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/07/tiny-shrimp-could-influence-global-climate-changes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/07/tiny-shrimp-could-influence-global-climate-changes","fields":{"headline":"Tiny shrimp could influence global climate changes","bodyText":"When we think of global warming and climate change, most of us ignore the impacts that animals have on the environment. Climate affects animals, but is the reverse true? Can animals affect the climate? I don’t know how to answer that question definitively, but I was fortunate enough to read a very recent paper from a top fluid dynamics research team from Stanford. The team, led by Dr. John Dabiri, is well known for their work on bio-inspired flow. Part of what they study is the influence of living organisms on fluid flow, especially flow of water in the oceans. This team’s recent work deals with something called aggregate motion of swimmers and it was published in Nature this year. The researchers wanted to know what happens when thousands (or millions) of small creatures swim in a single direction. Can the wakes they create add up to a larger scale motion and can these motions affect the ocean waters that they swim through? The team fabricated large tanks and filled them with water and Artemis salina (a species of brine shrimp). Using LED lights they were able to get the shrimp to swim upwards and downwards in the tank, replicating their daily vertical migrations. In the oceans, the vertical motion is hundreds of meters, but in the experiment, the shrimp swam upwards and downwards just a few meters. Before the shrimp began their motion, the researchers measured the water stratification. That is, less dense water tends to rise to the top while heavier, more dense water sinks. In the oceans, as well as in experiments, the water density is dictated by its saltiness and the temperature. The authors discovered something amazing. After tricking the shrimp to swim upwards and downwards in the tank, the water stratification changed greatly. The shrimp brought heavier water upwards and lighter water downwards. While one or even a few hundred shrimp may not change the water structure, thousands of shrimp moving together can. A video of upward aggregate shrimp motion is shown here. Fluid motion from a single shrimp is shown here. What the researchers also discovered was that shrimp, because they are dense, find it more difficult to swim upwards than downwards. Consequently, they have to create a strong propulsion jet when they swim upwards and virtually no propulsion jet when traveling downwards. Since these small propulsion jets are additive, shrimp cause much more mixing as they rise through the ocean waters compared to their descent. At the end of the day, the effect aggregate motion and turbulent mixing increased the normal mixing capacity of the water by a thousandfold. I asked Dr. Dabiri about the importance of this project and he told me: Ocean dynamics are directly connected to global climate through interactions with the atmosphere. The fact that swimming animals could play a significant role in ocean mixing – an idea that has been almost heretical in oceanography – could therefore have consequences far beyond the immediate waters where the animals reside. What would be really interesting to know is how this vertical mixing may affect the heating of the planet. By stirring up ocean waters, do the shrimp help bring cool water to the surface and carry hotter waters under the surfaces? And, if this is occurring, how large is the impact on a global scale?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/07/move-to-renewables-a-good-thing-says-nationals-agriculture-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T18:00:49Z","webTitle":"Move to renewables a 'good thing', Nationals' David Littleproud says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/07/move-to-renewables-a-good-thing-says-nationals-agriculture-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/07/move-to-renewables-a-good-thing-says-nationals-agriculture-minister","fields":{"headline":"Move to renewables a 'good thing', Nationals' David Littleproud says","bodyText":"The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, says the climate is changing and the transition in the energy market – with renewables displacing traditional power generation sources – is “exciting, not only for the environment but for the hip pocket”. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the Queensland National said the climate had been changing “since we first tilled the soil in Australia” and he does not care whether the change is due to human activity or not. While some colleagues in the National party have long queried whether humans are contributing to global warming, and have been openly hostile to the advance of renewable energy, Littleproud said: “I’m not losing any sleep on that, whether you want to prove it is manmade or not – I want to be pragmatic. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The climate has been changing since we first tilled the soil in Australia and the reality is farmers have been adapting to it,” the agriculture minister said. “Farmers are always at the cutting edge of science and technology, and they’ve been adapting since we first tilled the soil here. “I believe the climate is changing. Whether it is manmade or not, I don’t really care. The reality is we are seeing disruption, particularly with renewables, and we are going to see cleaner air. I try not to live in cities, you do feel the effects ... so it’s a good thing that renewables are coming on. “In fact, in my own electorate [of Maranoa in south-west Queensland] I’ve got all of the above. I’m about to have one of the largest solar farms in the southern hemisphere, one of the biggest wind farms in the southern hemisphere. I’ve got geothermal and I’ve got four coal-fired power stations. Two of those are super critical. “The disruption that’s happening with the technology, moving towards renewable energy, particularly in storage for base load, is exciting. I think it is a good thing.” While some government colleagues have championed prolonging the life of coal-fired power plants, Littleproud said economics rather than a culture war would ultimately determine Australia’s future energy mix. “Economics will win out in the end and if base load power can be stored in particular, that’s an exciting thing for the environment and everyone’s hip pocket.” Littleproud has been on the road for much of the week with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visiting drought-affected regions of New South Wales and Queensland. The south-east of Australia this year has experienced record high temperatures during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities. In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier-than-average conditions across large parts of the country. It suggests winter rainfall is likely to be below average for NSW, South Australia, northern Victoria and western parts of Western Australia. Turnbull this week said there was “no doubt that our climate is getting warmer”. He said the farming community needed to concentrate on becoming more resilient and focus on adaptation to a climate that was getting warmer and drier. Littleproud said there was a place for both mitigation strategies to try and reduce the most damaging impacts of climate change, and also for adaptation. “No matter whether you mitigate or adapt, the climate is going to change and we’ve got to move with it,” he said. “You have to use the best science available at the time – you mitigate as best you can ... listen to the scientific evidence, because this should be predicated on science not emotion. “If there are mitigation efforts to lessen the impact, then we should explore those, but we have to continue to adapt as we have since we first inhabited Australia.” He said he was currently working with state counterparts in the agriculture portfolio to develop “a national strategy around climate change adaptation”, which would include better collaboration across state borders, more research and development, including developing more drought-resistant grains and fibres, and looking at the genetics of livestock, and “understanding the weather better”. Asked whether some Australian farmers were hanging on in areas made unviable for agricultural production because of the impact of climate change, Littleproud said: “I think ultimately the market and economics determine that. “I honestly believe, having been a bank manager that sat around farmers’ kitchen tables, the greatest custodians of the land are farmers because their profit and loss is intrinsically tied to the health of their land. They don’t make a quid unless their environment and their farming is at its best.” He said farmers in drier areas were deploying active strategies, like reducing their stocking densities, and some farmers he had met in regional Queensland this week were also engaged with traditional owners about land management. “They’ve learned how to manage that land, in some ways learning from how Indigenous Australians manage the land and techniques they’ve used,” he said. Asked whether he accepted that agriculture and transport industries had to reduce their emissions to ensure Australia met its commitments under the Paris agreement, Littleproud said emissions reduction had to be “responsible”. The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed by 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014. Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because ageing coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream. “We’ve still got to be able to reduce the bills,” Littleproud said. “We’ve got to make sure the transition is done with people being able to turn their heaters on, and farmers turning their pumps on. “I think we are already reducing emissions. We’ve made a commitment under the Paris agreement and we are moving towards that in a sensible and methodical way. “As disruption happens in the technology space, [emissions reduction] will increase. In my own electorate, people are self-sustaining through solar. The reality is that type of disruption is happening and that is an exciting thing not only for the environment, but for the hip pocket.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/10/toni-collette-hereditary-interview-i-dont-like-horror-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T08:00:46Z","webTitle":"Toni Collette: ‘I don’t like horror films – I’m too petrified’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/10/toni-collette-hereditary-interview-i-dont-like-horror-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/10/toni-collette-hereditary-interview-i-dont-like-horror-films","fields":{"headline":"Toni Collette: ‘I don’t like horror films – I’m too petrified’","bodyText":"Toni Collette is starring in what’s being billed as the most terrifying horror film in years, and she doesn’t even like horror films. Or, rather, she doesn’t know whether she likes them, because she’s too scared to watch them. We’re discussing how her new film, Hereditary, by first-time director Ari Aster, operates beyond the horror genre, bringing in other psychological dimensions, and I mention how The Shining, one of the major influences pumping through Hereditary (along with Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, and The Babadook) wasn’t just about horror either, when Collette interjects: “I haven’t seen that.” I must have gaped, because she laughs and says: “I don’t like horror films.” She says she bought The Shining DVD years ago but it’s still got its wrapper on. “I’m just too petrified to watch horror films!” But you’re OK about starring in them? “I look for challenging work, and this was so complicated, layered, dense and honest. And unusual. It felt really original, even on the page. That’s what I hope for in life. And it rarely comes along.” Full of praise for Aster (who also wrote the script), Collette accepts that Hereditary is a horror film, “but it isn’t just a horror film. It’s this kind of beautiful fragile story about people living with huge amounts of emotional pain.” In the film Collette plays Annie, an artist who makes macabre “real-world” doll’s houses, and who along with her family descends into a nightmare prompted by the death of her sinister mother. Also starring Gabriel Byrne, Ann Dowd, Alex Wolff, and Milly Shapiro, it premiered in January at midnight at the Sundance film festival to great acclaim, sparking instant Oscar-buzz for Collette, which seems long overdue. In what looks to be a huge year for her, she is also starring in the hotly tipped BBC/Netflix series Wanderlust this autumn, as a therapist who re-evaluates her life following a near-death experience. Since grabbing international attention in only her second role, 1994’s enduringly charming Muriel’s Wedding, Collette has starred in a wide variety of films including 1999’s The Sixth Sense (another horror film that isn’t just a horror film), Little Miss Sunshine, About A Boy, Emma, Japanese Story, and Glassland, as well as television series including United States of Tara and Tsunami: The Aftermath. She has also appeared in Broadway musicals, including The Wild Party for which she was nominated for a Tony award. (Collette also sings with her band, Toni Collette &amp; the Finish, featuring her husband Dave Galafassi on drums, though that’s stalled for the moment: “I’m too busy with my day job.”) However, despite garnering numerous prestigious awards and nominations, (including an Emmy and a Golden Globe for United States of Tara), there’s been no nod from the Academy since she was nominated for best supporting actress for The Sixth Sense. Perhaps Hereditary will change all that. Collette is long-renowned for her expressiveness, with a particularly strong suit in “everywomen” who turn out to be anything but – it’s almost as though her molecules reassemble for every new role. In Hereditary she goes all out, emoting brittle, grief-stricken, broken, resolute, angry, frustrated, and everything in between. When I speak to Aster on the phone, he says that choosing Collette was “a no-brainer. She always struck me as a chameleon, disappearing into whatever role she was in.” Aster also liked the fact that Collette hadn’t done anything like Hereditary before: “Everyone knows that Toni is wonderful and amazing, but it’s seldom that we’ve seen her really tear apart the scenery in the way that this film demanded. She’s playing someone very tortured and conflicted, and really jumps off at the deep end. I told her that I was looking for a kamikaze performance, and she delivered.” We meet at a central London hotel, where Collette, 45, is enduring what must be a packed, exhausting publicity schedule, and, despite her reservations about horror, seeing Hereditary again at London Sundance (good luck to her – towards the end it becomes too full-on and gory even for my tastes). When Collette gets up from her seat to greet me, it’s a lightning flash of huge blue eyes, wide distinctive smile, biscuit-tan and sandy blond hair. Her striking clothes, including a Victorian-style top and long sculptured skirt, lend her a wonderfully sub-gothic air, a bit like a sun-kissed Miss Havisham. (“No,” she says, later, “I was never a goth.”) Engaged, friendly, open, with an unexpected splash of new age beach hippy in the mix, there’s just one point toward the end of our conversation when Collette becomes distracted and fidgety. I’m starting to wonder whether she dislikes the questions (or me), when she suddenly slaps her hands on her knees, and cries: “I REALLY have to pee! I’m so sorry, I had a bunch of waters. Would you please excuse me?” She dashes out of the room, returning a little later, restored to her chatty self. Elsewhere, a couple of times, a flicker of jet-lagged weariness pinches her features. When I ask if she’s looking forward to returning to her native Australia (to her home, in Sydney, with Galafassi and their two children, daughter Sage, 10, and son Arlo, 7), she mock-dramatically sags her shoulders, and hisses “Yes-sss!” with a ferocity that seems only partly in jest. One intriguing thing about Hereditary is how dominant, disparate, and sometimes dislikable all the female characters are. If anyone takes on the soothing nurturing “caretaker” role, it’s Byrne. Collette’s Annie is far from the generic “good (bland) mom” figure so often seen in films. “I love that,” says Collette. “It just turns this kind of idyllic idealised myth of what it is to be a mother completely on its head. She’s so real and multilayered. It’s so rare to play a woman that feels as complicated as she does.” Collette has played several on-screen mothers – what kind of mum is she in real life? “Well, I think there’s no one way of being, we are all many things. Also, life has changed, so those things keep changing too. So it’s hard to say without simplifying one of the most profound relationships one can have. And I try to bring that message to all the mothers that I play – yes, they’re mothers, but they’re whole complex creatures on their own.” And her children? “My kids are the most important people in my life, I’m entirely in love with them. But I don’t own them, they’re not reflective of me. I just try to guide them, to support them, be there, give them as much as I can, without being in any way dogmatic or didactic. And I learn from them, it’s entertaining. They’re very much their own people.” She smiles: “If you start to break anything down, it becomes more and more complicated, doesn’t it?” Collette was raised with two brothers, in a suburb of Sydney, as part of a close-knit working-class family. “I can’t imagine my life without my parents,” she says. “They’re such a huge part of who I am, and they’ve overcome so much, and been so selfless.” Collette’s maternal grandmother died giving birth to another child, and Collette’s father was sent to Vietnam. “A lot of people still don’t know that Australians were involved in that war,” says Collette. “And he was drafted, he wasn’t in the army – he had the wrong birthday, and suddenly he’s got a gun on his back and heading off. It was terrifying, and he was just a teenager.” Did her father ever talk about it? “A little bit, as much as he felt able. It still affects…” She pauses: “With vets, it still lives with them, you know. It’s in there.” She presses her hands to her chest. “The body absorbs so much. It lives with you.” One odd feature of Collette’s childhood was when she convinced everybody that she had appendicitis, which ended with her having an operation to remove the healthy organ. “Some people say, ‘Oh, that was your first role’, but it was nothing to do with acting. My mother had told me that her appendix was removed when she was 11, and I thought, ‘Well, I’m 11 now, I’ll give this a shot’, and it just kept going. Then it was too late.” It sounds almost like Munchausen syndrome, but Collette says that she didn’t fake the symptoms: “I felt pain in my stomach, and it just kind of escalated. Obviously, I didn’t understand what I was doing, I was 11.” Now she just finds the whole incident mortifying: “I’ve always thought that I’m not one of those cliched actors who got into it because they need attention. But perhaps there is an element of that? How embarrassing!” Her parents allowed her to leave school at 16 and pursue acting, which sounds brave of them, and very determined of her. “They were really concerned when I decided to leave school and be an actress. Can you imagine hearing that from your teenage daughter? That’s a horror film in itself!” She’s described her youthful self as having “crazy” amounts of confidence. “I had this knowledge within me that this is it, this is what I need to do. I was just very strong-willed. I didn’t let any negativity or fear get in the way. I was so clear and positive about what I was trying to do. It didn’t mean that I didn’t feel nervous or inadequate. But a door would open, and I put a foot in, and suddenly the door was completely open, and it just kept happening.” Was it blind confidence, in a way? “Yeah, but that’s fine, it got me going. If I was in the same position now, I know more about life and the world, and I wouldn’t make the same decisions, but at that point there was something so pure about my bravery.” This single-mindedness led to Collette’s breakthrough in Muriel’s Wedding, and an international career. (She lived in London for a while, and says she still views it as her second home.) People still quote Muriel’s Wedding dialogue at her – in fact, I nearly do (“You’re terrible, Muriel”), but I restrain myself – it could be the 10th time she’s heard it today! But Collette says it never gets irritating. “I’m so fond of that experience and that character. It’s 25 years ago! When you go into a film, you connect to something and hope for the best. But to have that kind of reaction for what seems to be for ever is incredible.” In her 20s, early success, on top of the usual stresses of being a young woman, threatened to overwhelm her, and Collette developed bulimia and suffered panic attacks. In retrospect, she thinks there was just a lot of change going on in her life, perhaps too much. “For most people, change can be very confronting.” She found the publicity side of her job particularly difficult: “I was unformed, a baby, working on instinct, and suddenly I had to form ideas and have opinions on everything, and not just conversationally and privately, these things were plastered everywhere. I had to grow up very quickly.” I’d read somewhere that losing the weight she’d gained to play Muriel triggered her bulimia, but Collette thinks not: “I don’t think it was in a direct response to putting on weight for the film. Anything like that is more about control. My life did feel a little… fast. And I guess that was my way of pathetically trying to deal with it.” Well, that happens. “It does happen – it’s really common. And I’m sorry for the person that I was then. It just feels like another human being.” She suffered panic attacks for several months. “But I haven’t had them since. You know how I was talking before about how the body absorbs everything? So, even if you can’t look at something, or address things in an open way, it does catch up with you. Your body will go: ‘Hello, I’m here, you do need to look at this!’ I think that’s what panic attacks are. I wouldn’t wish one on my worst enemy.” What does a panic attack feel like? “Erm, you basically feel like you’re dying. It’s not just being a little bit nervous, it’s deep, deep anxiety.” When I say it sounds as though it was a very dark period for her, she demurs: “Not all of it. I wouldn’t paint it that way. That was part of my life, but I was also having the time of my life. I was in my 20s, that’s what that decade is for, I guess.” Collette also developed a penchant for shaving her head, but that seems to be more of a positive thing: “I’ve shaved my head five times in my life. I find it very cleansing.” Is it a style/fashion thing? “Not at all. It’s for me. It feels like a clean slate. I did it for a friend’s fashion show, I did it for a film, I did it for two films actually. But the first time I did it, I turned 25, I was in Mexico, I’d had probably too much tequila, and I walked past a barber, and I looked at this guy, I looked at his chubby fingers, and I thought: ‘I trust him, I’m going in!’ So, it was on my 25th birthday, I decided to shave my head.” She grins: “The third or fourth time I shaved it, it was about three days after meeting my husband. I think it was, like: I’m just going to see how he reacts. It was like a test. Which is ridiculous.” It was a test he obviously passed? “Yes!” Was it your way of saying: this is me, unadorned? “Yeah, I suppose so.” When I ask if she has any tattoos, she confirms that she has several. Would you say that you’re impulsive, in a good way? You like to stir things up, just for yourself? She looks thoughtful: “Yeah, I think it’s good to do that.” Certainly, there seems to be a key element of not so much impulse as instinct in how she chooses roles. She says that it’s always the writing that first attracts her, but aside from that, “it’s beyond something cerebral. If I start to think about it too much, and I’m on the fence, umm-ing and ahh-ing, then I know it’s not for me. Because it’s usually very immediate, a visceral gut knowledge that…” She makes her eyes pop fiercely. “I’ve got to do it.” Didn’t you once say that if you couldn’t act, you would wither and die? “That was probably a very old thing that I said. I think, initially, I used acting as a way to express myself. I was very good at seeing other things very clearly, and I saw myself less clearly. And there were times when I felt overwhelmed by my own emotions. So acting became a way of accessing those emotions and doing something positive and creative with them.” A form of catharsis? “It is catharsis. But that was when I was much younger. My relationship with acting has changed, and deepened, and continued to change. That’s inevitable.” Collette was speaking out about issues such as body image and female representation in Hollywood long before the recent explosion with Harvey Weinstein and MeToo/Time’s Up. She tells me she’s always enjoyed working with female directors (“I just wanted to work with great directors of either sex”). Has she ever experienced harassment in the industry? “No.” Would she define herself as a feminist? “I would say that I’m both a feminist and a humanist. I believe in equality, I always have. So, the idea that this behaviour has been occurring…” She sighs. “It’s not a new thing. But it’s just so incredible, and it’s so necessary, and actually exciting, that people are speaking out about it now. It takes a conversation for there to be action and change.” Collette feels that it’s bigger than her industry, it’s society at large. “There’s a huge imbalance – and there has been for longer than my lifetime.” She also thinks that there’s been a genuine change of attitude in Hollywood. “You need awareness to be able to make a change, and you can’t help but be aware of it now.” What about unrealistic beauty/body image ideals – this idea that, with women, it’s first and foremost about the visuals? “Well, that’s bullshit! I’ve never believed that. And I think, if that’s been the notion, which I know it has, it’s an archaic notion now.” It’s at this point that Collette decides that she needs to wee, bustling out of the room in her voluminous skirt. When she returns, we discuss President Trump. “Who knew this was going to happen? I mean, wow, it’s just a really incredible moment in time, isn’t it? You can hardly believe it. How is this person getting to that position? It’s hugely frightening – it’s an absolute doozy!” We also talk about antipodean female politicians, including how New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s pregnancy seemed to draw criticism that she wouldn’t be able to do a proper job. “What kind of idea is that? It’s so archaic. It has nothing to do with someone’s ability at work. I don’t think that [attitude] exists in one part of the planet, it’s everywhere,” says Collette. “It’s a sexist, ageist world… It is changing. Just not fast enough.” As the interview winds up, we discuss her future projects, including Wanderlust written by British playwright Nick Payne, which will air on BBC One this autumn, in which she plays a woman whose brush with death makes her question her life, including her commitment to monogamy. “But it’s beyond that – it’s about what’s informing her decisions. So, even though I’m playing a therapist who’s very astute and aware, she has her own awakening of sorts. It’s a perfectly woven psychological web,” says Collette with relish. These days, she would work in Australia all the time, if she could, just for family reasons. She’s often described herself as “nomadic”. Is that grating a bit now? “It’s not grating. We’re all adaptable. My family has moved around so much, but we know that home is Sydney. It’s just a feeling, you can’t help it, there’s only one home. And my parents aren’t getting any younger. My tribe is there, and there’s a kind of calling to return.” Collette has her own production company, writes, adapts material, and has her eye on directing. “I want to be involved earlier in the creative process,” she says. “As an artist, and even as a human, you need to challenge yourself and grow. You never stop learning. It keeps me curious, open, awake and alive. All of those exciting good things.” But acting still challenges her? “Of course!” she says, widening her eyes. “It’s still self-expression, you still have to make it feel honest for the audience to believe it. It’s a matter of empathy and understanding. I think, if anything, that’s what drives me – trying to understand what life is. It’s all a mystery.” Hereditary is in UK cinemas from Friday, and out now in the US and Australia"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/06/mcc-unveil-new-designs-for-compton-and-edrich-stands-in-lords-masterplan-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T11:42:46Z","webTitle":"MCC unveils new designs for Compton and Edrich stands in Lord's masterplan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/mcc-unveil-new-designs-for-compton-and-edrich-stands-in-lords-masterplan-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/06/mcc-unveil-new-designs-for-compton-and-edrich-stands-in-lords-masterplan-cricket","fields":{"headline":"MCC unveils new designs for Compton and Edrich stands in Lord's masterplan","bodyText":"The MCC has unveiled the new designs which will form the next phase of the masterplan to redevelop Lord’s – the new Compton and Edrich stands.

Launching the 2018 fringe programme with 3,548 shows, the most in its history, the event’s chief executive, Shona McCarthy, said: “Whether this is your first or your 50th time visiting the fringe as a performer or audience member, this is a place where new discoveries wait around every corner.” With venues ranging from a “pianodrome” constructed of 55 recycled pianos in the Royal Botanic Garden to a comedy club hosted in a chicken coop, the programme includes 1,900 premieres, including debuts from the Hi-de-Hi! star Su Pollard, the IT Crowd’s Katherine Parkinson and the singer and actor Jason Donovan. The Guardian Weekend columnistBim Adewunmi will present her first play, The Hoard, about the relationship between three sisters. The Assembly Rooms will host Once Seen on Blue Peter, starring former presenters Peter Purves, Janet Ellis, Peter Duncan and Mark Curry along with surprise celebrity guests as they celebrate the world of children’s entertainment. US comedy performers include the spiky Janeane Garofalo, and Judah Friedlander, in the follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2017 Netflix standup show satirising American exceptionalism. As usual, subject matter is eclectic, but emerging themes are sex and consent, including the comedian Ayesha Hazarika’s take on where feminism finds itself in the wake of #MeToo, while a clutch of shows explore the 70th anniversary of the NHS, and mental health. The mixed media performance A Fortunate Man is inspired by John Berger’s exploration of the life of a county doctor 50 years ago, while the director Jeremy Weller’s Where It Hurts shares Edinburgh residents’ experiences of the NHS. The festival will have a particular focus on street theatre, with a new street events arena on the Royal Mile hosting more than 250 shows a day. There are also plans to trial cashless donations for street performers at four stages, after buskers raised concerns that their takings were declining as fewer people carry loose change. McCarthy also emphasised the need to tackle the rising cost of attending the festival. The Fringe Society’s Blueprint document, also published on Wednesday, which lists the priorities in the run-up to the festival’s 75th anniversary in 2022, was proof of “big ambitions to make the fringe more affordable,” said McCarthy. Plans to reduce the long-term cost of performing and visiting the fringe include addressing the cost of accommodation in the city, freezing registration fees until at least 2022, reducing box office commission and exploring affordable ticketing options. McCarthy said she was exploring partnerships with local universities that have empty halls of residence, and was keen to pilot a host-an-artist scheme with Edinburgh residents. The fringe is also working with the tourist body Visit Scotland to map accommodation beyond the city centre and transport provision. This dovetails with a wider move to expand the fringe beyond the city centre: the festival programme will include a map of Leith after the area, which is emerging as an arts hub, had a significant growth in venues last year. Accessibility is another priority, and the festival will provide free sensory backpacks for children and adults on the autism spectrum for the first time. They will include a fidget toy, earplugs and a list of relaxed performances. Earlier this year, the fringe was caught up in a funding row involving Creative Scotland, which was criticised for a series of unexpected choices, leading to the resignation of two board members from the arts body. The fringe was one of those removed from its network of regularly funded organisations, losing £70,000 annually. McCarthy said the Fringe Society was still working to plug the funding gap. “It has been an additional pressure and I do think that the Fringe Society is suffering from an impression that it is this big corporate beast and somehow less in need of public support.” But she insisted: “We have rebuilt our relationship with Creative Scotland and have two live applications [for different funding streams] with them currently.” Edinburgh festival: 10 shows to see Cold Blood A dance show with a difference: the beautiful moves are made by three performers’ fingers, which waltz around miniature props and are filmed live and projected on to a huge screen. Trojan Horse After shows about the Chilcot inquiry and the 1985 Bradford City fire, the documentary theatre company Lung presents a piece based on the inquiry into a fake plot to Islamise Birmingham schools. Jordan Brookes Expect the unexpected: at last year’s fringe, Brookes’ discombobulating set had audiences in stitches before he even made his proper entrance. What Girls Are Made of Cora Bissett, who directed the award-winning fringe hit Roadkill, takes the stage with a live band to look back at her teenage success fronting the Scottish indie rock band Darlingheart. Home The absurdist artist Geoff Sobelle (The Object Lesson) and brooding troubadour Elvis Perkins invite the audience to move into an entire house that is slowly constructed on stage. Ahir Shah An Edinburgh comedy award nominee in 2017 for his scorching set about Brexit, the sharp standup brings a new show, reflecting on visiting India for the first time as an adult. After the Cuts In one of several shows marking the 70th anniversary of the NHS, Gary McNair’s dark comedy imagines what would happen in a future without it. Underground Railroad Game This upfront investigation of race relations in the US, styled as a school lesson that spirals into madness, was named one of the best American plays in recent years by the New York Times.

In a note to colleagues, the Victorian secretary of the socialist left, Mathew Hilakari reported late on Wednesday the faction had missed out on the final delegate position “as a direct result of the industrial left giving two votes to the right”. The vote switch has increased the size of the right’s delegation at the national conference, with the Victorian right delegation now numbering 47. The socialist left will send 28 delegates, the industrial left 10, and there will be two non-aligned. With both factions chasing every vote given the numbers are finely balanced, and with the right intent on securing the numbers to control the outcome of key votes at the national conference, Hilakari was scathing about the backroom manoeuvres, which have been triggered by a power realignment in the state. “This will have a real impact on how progressive our national platform will be, and embolden the right in their agenda,” he said in the note to colleagues. “It will also mean that there is less chance that the left will pick up the last spot on the national executive, and may give the right a significant majority in this key party decision making body”. “As it stands the left in Victoria will send two less national conference delegates than last time”. Spurred by the left faction almost securing control of the last ALP national conference in 2015 for the first time since the mid-1980s – a development that made the last federal conference hair-raising for Bill Shorten to manage – the right factions in New South Wales and Victoria have launched a major organisational effort spearheaded by the NSW party secretary, Kaila Murnain, and the assistant national secretary, Sebastian Zwalf. Whether the right is able to control the conference in its own right, or seek support from the CFMEU delegation during politically controversial votes, hinges on the outcome of delegate selection underway in Queensland. But while the right is benefiting from Victoria’s internal left brawl, splits between power brokers from the right is also causing behind-the-scenes angst on Bill Shorten’s home turf. The former federal minister-turned gaming advocate Stephen Conroy has nominated for the preselection committee in Victoria – a development which has prompted criticism from within the right. Conroy has made it known that he will not seek to return to the ALP national executive given he is executive director of the industry association Responsible Wagering Australia. But some are critical of his decision to remain on the preselections committee, which he has sat on for two decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/06/northern-rail-workers-strike-rmt-train-guards","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T10:04:02Z","webTitle":"Northern rail workers to strike over plans to abolish train guards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/northern-rail-workers-strike-rmt-train-guards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/northern-rail-workers-strike-rmt-train-guards","fields":{"headline":"Northern rail workers to strike over plans to abolish train guards","bodyText":"Workers employed by crisis-stricken Northern rail are to stage three strikes later this month as their union capitalises on recent travel chaos to fight plans to abolish train guards. All Northern conductors, conductor instructors and train driver members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) have been instructed to strike for 24 hours on Tuesday 19 June, Thursday 21 June and Saturday 23 June. The strikes will begin at one minute past midnight and run until 23.59 each day. The announcement was greeted with dismay by some passengers, who have become used to the grim regularity of delayed and cancelled Northern services. “This is like the kitchen being on fire in a restaurant and the cooks refusing to help put it out,” said one member of the 3,000-strong Facebook group Northern Resist, where travellers share their woes. Others believed the strikes could force a welcome change. “I hate to say it but these strikes couldn’t come at a better time! I feel RMT are going to put the final nail in Northern’s coffin,” said another passenger. The RMT will seek to leverage the widespread disruption caused by last-minute timetable changes and overrunning engineering work to win their long-running battle to keep guards on trains. Northern’s owner, Arriva Rail North, a subsidiary of the German national railway Deutsche Bahn, wants to operate driver-only services with automatic doors – a move the RMT says will “shred safety culture in same way they’ve shredded timetables”. RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “RMT will not stand aside while the threat to axe safety critical guards from Northern services remains central to the company plans. This company has reduced the timetable to total chaos and the union will not allow them to slash the safety culture to ribbons in the same fashion. “It is a tribute to the determination and professionalism of RMT members on Arriva Rail North that they have remained rock solid for over a year now in what is a clear-cut battle to put public safety before private profit. “German-owned Northern rail wants to run half a million trains a year without a safety critical guard on board in a move that would wreck both safety and access ‎to services and they should listen to their front-line staff and pull back from that plan immediately. “RMT has agreed arrangements in Wales and Scotland that enshrine the guard guarantee. If it’s good enough for Wales and Scotland to have safe rail services it should be good enough for the rest of Britain.” Richard Allan, Northern’s deputy managing director, said: “Northern is working extremely hard to stabilise and provide certainty in delivering a reliable train service on those parts of our network affected by recent very significant disruption and cancellations. “We have apologised repeatedly and extensively to customers, are working urgently on our additional customer compensation offer, and our energy and focus is on providing a better service for customers. “The May timetable problems and the latest RMT strike action will not deter us from delivering our modernisation plans for customers - £500m of new trains which are currently under construction, better stations and more services by 2020. “We are still prepared to guarantee jobs and pay reviews for conductors until the end of our franchise in 2025, with the Government guaranteeing jobs beyond that, but both guarantees depend on RMT ending its strike action.” Earlier this week, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said Northern could be banned from bidding for future franchises if a review finds it to have been negligent or at fault for the recent weeks of rail chaos. On Wednesday South Lakes MP Tim Farron announced he will be leading a walk from Windermere station to Oxenholme station on Saturday from 2pm to protest at the temporary closure of the Lakes Line by Northern Rail and the government. Farron, the former Liberal Democrat leader, will be stopping at each train station along the route to gather more signatures for his “Sack Northern” petition which calls on the government to strip the rail company of both the Lakes and Furness Lines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/06/the-the-review-royal-albert-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T12:00:13Z","webTitle":"The The review – long-awaited return reopens brilliant teenage diaries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/06/the-the-review-royal-albert-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/06/the-the-review-royal-albert-hall-london","fields":{"headline":"The The review – long-awaited return reopens brilliant teenage diaries","bodyText":"Most returning artists are allergic to the notion that they are making a comeback, preferring to parrot the line that they have never really been away. Such reticence does not remotely affect Matt Johnson and the The, who have named their current UK and US tour the Comeback Special. Then again, it would be hard for Johnson to deny the extent of his recent indolence. The The’s last live gig was at a David Bowie-curated Meltdown in 2002, since when they have released the sum total of two singles, while Johnson has sporadically made music for film soundtracks and art installations. This high-pressure return is rendered more difficult by the death of Johnson’s father four days earlier, with the singer confessing online that only “massive financial implications” have prevented him from cancelling these shows. The standing ovation as he dedicates the gigs to his dad indicates mass empathy and support. The The have always been a vehicle for Johnson, who began his career in 1979 writing songs of intense personal turmoil before shifting his gaze to global geopolitics. The latter material dominates the first half tonight, with songs such as 1989 single The Beat(en) Generation wrapping their political message in the velvet glove of a gorgeous melody. The twitchy Johnson retains a gravel-voiced gravitas, and his band are taut and kinetic on barbed missiles such as Armageddon Days Are Here (Again). Yet the earnest social-commentary material can pall, and it’s not until the The dip into Soul Mining, the 1982 album that Johnson wrote as a callow youth, that the crowd rise from their seats as one. With its fragile synthpop essays that sound like precocious teenage diary entries, the album was a masterclass in adolescent angst, and the rapt This Is the Day reunites tonight’s largely middle-aged audience with their inner Adrian Moles. The sublime encore, the halting 1982 single Uncertain Smile, remains the essence of youthful infatuation. The The really shouldn’t leave it 16 years until their next tour.

Kelly faces a strong challenge from Liberal party state vice-president Kent Johns, a liberal moderate, for the seat of Hughes. Kelly, who was reportedly part of the “Monkey Pod” diners who gathered in support of Abbott after his ousting in 2015, has held the seat since 2010. Last week, Abbott used his regular slot on Sydney radio 2GB to warn the party against allowing Kelly to lose preselection, saying it would be an “absolute disaster”. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The only way we can win the election is if we have harmony inside our party and we sure ain’t going to have harmony if Craig Kelly gets rolled,” he said. On Wednesday he used that same slot to increase pressure on Turnbull to personally intervene and tell Johns, who is believed to have the numbers, to back off. Abbott claimed it was an “ethical” issue. “Now, office bearers, senior office bearers, have an absolute duty to support sitting members, not to challenge them,” Abbott said. “I think there is an ethical issue here, a fundamental ethical issue. How can someone hold down a position of vice-president of the Liberal party and at the same time, not support a sitting member, particularly a sitting member like Craig Kelly who is doing a good job? “I hate to say this, but I think this is an issue for the prime minister. He was quite properly, very quick out of the blocks to support Ann Sudmalis, the member for Gilmore, a terrific person, I support her, and that is as it should be. “But we just can’t afford to have a sitting member of Craig Kelly’s quality under challenge like this if we are to have the best chance of winning the next election, notwithstanding all the mistakes that Bill Shorten is making. “We still can’t afford to lose a single seat if we are to stay in government, so I do think this is something the prime minister needs to involve himself in.” Turnbull has written a reference for Kelly, something he also did for Jane Prentice, who lost her preselection battle for her Queensland seat despite her position as an assistant minister. A spokesman for the prime minister said Turnbull supported all sitting members. But Abbott said words were not enough. “I think there are a few phone calls which need to be made,” he said. “When I was the party leader, from time to time, I had to make phone calls and have meetings on these kind of internal party matters and you just cannot afford not to support – with actions, not just words – a sitting member of Craig Kelly’s quality.” After losing Prentice, one of the few women within the party room, and reigniting the gender debate within the Coalition ranks Turnbull and Scott Morrison stepped in to save Sudmalis from a challenge she was expected to lose. Despite the intervention Sudmalis’s challenger, a local real estate agent, announced he would still stand against her, but without the support of his backers, was not expected to have the numbers to win. Nomination forms for Liberal seats were due last Friday, and votes are expected to be held in the coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jul/02/home-im-darling-50s-women-domesticity-katherine-parkinson-laura-wade-tamara-harvey-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T13:40:02Z","webTitle":"Recipe for disaster: what's behind the rise of 50s-style domesticity?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/02/home-im-darling-50s-women-domesticity-katherine-parkinson-laura-wade-tamara-harvey-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jul/02/home-im-darling-50s-women-domesticity-katherine-parkinson-laura-wade-tamara-harvey-interview","fields":{"headline":"Recipe for disaster: what's behind the rise of 50s-style domesticity?","bodyText":"Judy Martin is a proud, archetypal 1950s housewife. She waves her husband, Johnny, off to work in the morning and welcomes him in the evening with a cocktail and his slippers. Except Judy – the heroine of Laura Wade’s new play Home, I’m Darling – lives in modern-day Welwyn Garden City and used to have a high-powered job. The play sprang from ideas about “fetishised domesticity”, says Wade. “Things like Bake Off were just starting to bubble up, and that cupcake culture seemed to be in the ascendant. There was something comforting about those nostalgic ideas of home life and I was curious why people needed that.” She was also fascinated by people who wear vintage clothes and go to retro festivals and car shows. “I’ve always been interested in tribes and the idea of someone who felt they were out of kilter with the way the modern world works. All of those ideas seemed to coalesce in the idea of someone who genuinely believed they would belong better in the 50s than now.” Wade wrote the play for the actor Katherine Parkinson (known on TV for The IT Crowd and Humans); its director, Tamara Harvey, was also involved from the beginning. Harvey and Wade are friends from university, and the three have worked together before – Harvey directed Parkinson in Wade’s Kreutzer vs Kreutzer in 2015. Harvey and Wade worked together on 16 Winters at the Bristol Old Vic and Young Emma at the Finborough, London, while Parkinson was in Wade’s 2006 play Other Hands and in her microplay Britain Isn’t Eating made by the Royal Court and the Guardian. When we all meet at the National Theatre, it’s clear they are good friends: laughing, teasing each other, asking each other questions. “I feel like [Judy is] propelled by a deep fear and disenchantment with the modern world,” says Parkinson. Her childhood, comprising an idealised image of her absent father and growing up in a feminist lefty community, has encouraged Judy to create an ordered, fantasy adult life. “It’s a way of controlling her environment. And also, to justify the stay-at-home life without children, she needs an extra angle to occupy her time.” So Judy lives in a suburban museum, with a fridge that often doesn’t work but at least is authentic. “One of the things that really got my brain going was the idea you could be nostalgic for a time that you weren’t there for,” says Wade. “It’s not like going back to something you fondly remember, but there’s something about it that makes your blood sing.” There is a scene in which Judy’s mother, exasperated, says: “You want to know what the 50s were like, from someone who was actually there? The 50s were terrible.” The sexism, the fact that rape didn’t legally exist in marriage, the cold, and the grey food. “Laura and I went to talk to my nan,” says Harvey, smiling, “and she was brilliantly pragmatic about it. She was like, ‘It was grim.’” Judy says she is a feminist because “this is what I’ve chosen”. That idea of feminism as individualism, rather than a collective effort to improve all women’s live, is “a dangerous corner of thinking”, says Wade. “If it’s focused on individual choices at the point where that forgets the idea of community or sisterhood, I find that problematic. I think we’ve seen less of that very recently with Time’s Up and Me Too. I think there’s more community spirit, which is a really important move forward, and I hope that sticks. Focusing on your own individual choices ignores the impact beyond you. It’s not empowering, and it also ignores the experience of other women who are not like you.” The play was written before #MeToo, with its explosion of women talking about their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, though there is a scene that feels right of this moment. The challenge, says Harvey, was to make sure “it doesn’t look like you’ve just gone, ‘Ah, Me Too, I’ll write that in.’” The theatre world, like Hollywood and other industries, has had to face numerous allegations of sexual harassment. Has this changed the atmosphere on sets? It’s tricky, says Parkinson. People have become more aware of the way they behave, but “the people in our industry who are more creepy, for want of a better word, and manipulative, I don’t think they would ever know what they were doing. I don’t think it’s always conscious. I think it’s brilliant that the conversation is going on, but I don’t think everybody will go, ‘I was behaving like that and I’ll stop doing it now.’” As an actor, she says, “you want the eye of the director on you, you want them to find you appealing and up for the work, and you want to facilitate. It’s really complicated, and I feel now at the age of 40 that I don’t feel like I have to play some games that maybe I did play.” And, says Wade, “it’s not just about the confidence to bat off the approach but what the approach says about how you are valued – for your looks, your sexuality, your sexual availability – and what impact does that message have on women? You absorb that even if you say a strong no and everybody moves on.” It would help, of course, if there were more women in senior positions within the theatre: a recent survey found just a fifth of theatres in England have female artistic directors. Harvey, who is artistic director of Theatr Clwyd, has a three-month-old baby, who has sometimes been in rehearsals with her. “Let’s not kid ourselves – it’s lunatic,” she says with a laugh. It has been possible, she says, because Theatr Clwyd and the National Theatre in London, where the play will be staged next, have been supportive, and she has family and professional help with childcare. (She also has an older child; Wade has two children, one of whom is nine months old; and Parkinson also has two.) “I guess what’s great is that I am hitting that moment when the industry is waking up to the fact that, unless we get better at making it possible for people to have kids, deal with childcare, then we just lose swaths of people – and people with really important experiences,” says Harvey. “If we are making your life possible as well as your work, that will mean the room is a more creative, fruitful, joyous place.” A campaign group, Parents and Carers in the Performing Arts (Pipa), was founded in 2016 to address the issues faced by parents, disproportionately mothers, and help change attitudes and working practices. Its study last year found 81% of self-employed people in the industry had turned down work because of caring responsibilities. It’s about changing the culture, says Wade, to one “in which it’s OK to be open about your obligations. I’ve had the feeling before of not wanting to say, ‘I can’t do that because that is the time when I need to pick up my child’; feeling a bit embarrassed that you’re being unprofessional when actually you’re attempting this amazing juggling act.” Parkinson remembers when she had a small baby, a director dismissively told her to arrange childcare for a last-minute rehearsal, even though her baby had never been left with anyone apart from Parkinson and her husband. “I remember feeling quite ashamed of that,” she says. There are numerous practical steps, says Harvey, including shorter working days and advance scheduling of rehearsals so people have time to find childcare. She went to a Pipa meeting and someone raised the possibility of job shares for actors. “Nothing should be off the table,” says Harvey. She points out that in physically demanding shows such as musicals, it’s not unusual to have different actors perform on different nights. “It’s just nobody has dared to say, ‘Can I do it because of kids?’” What’s difficult to overcome, says Harvey, is the idea that all this scheduling and working around other commitments “can feel in conflict with the perceived creative artistic impulse. But actually in any act of creativity, there is also a rigour. I was always struck when Laura and I lived together that she would be up first thing in the morning, at her desk, irrespective of whether she felt the creative impulse. That’s been part of it for me as well, giving myself permission to be organised without feeling like being organised means I’m less of an artist.” Wade agrees. “I think age plays a part in that, getting comfortable with the idea that…” She smiles. “I used to feel like I wasn’t a proper writer because I didn’t do it at three o’clock in the morning with a bottle of red wine.” • Home, I’m Darling is at Theatr Clwyd, Mold, until 14 July, then at the National Theatre, London, from 24 July to 5 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/06/the-end-of-history-play-london-church-gentrification-st-giles-in-the-fields","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T15:16:38Z","webTitle":"Play staged in central London church explores parish's gentrification","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/06/the-end-of-history-play-london-church-gentrification-st-giles-in-the-fields","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/06/the-end-of-history-play-london-church-gentrification-st-giles-in-the-fields","fields":{"headline":"Play staged in central London church explores parish's gentrification","bodyText":"In William Hogarth’s celebrated print Gin Lane, the church of St Giles-in-the-Fields rises above a scene of squalid depravity, in a parish where one building in four was reckoned to be a gin shop. Its slums were infamous even in 18th-century England, its criminals safe from the law through a maze of passages and tunnels known as the Rookery. A “St Giles cellar” became a synonym for abject poverty: in the centre of the Hogarth image, a woman stupefied with alcohol has let her baby slip from her arms, and it falls into a cellar gin shop. The church’s history dates back to its founding in 1101 as a hospital for lepers, but is about to open its doors to The End of History, a site-specific play reflecting the rampant gentrification of the parish. Gin is still drunk but with artisan tonic in myriad trendy bars and cafes rather than reeking cellars, and the church spire is now overshadowed by the sweet-wrapper towers of the Renzo Piano-designed flats and offices complex. Locals mourn the loss of the area’s rackety but distinctive character, the gradual elimination of affordable housing, the death of the small corner shops and independent specialists, and the recording studios, clubs and music shops of Denmark Street, AKA Tin Pan Alley. The rector of St Giles, the Rev Alan Carr, has invited the actors to reflect on the process that has changed the area almost beyond recognition. Drama, he believes, is sometimes the best way to understand what is happening. “Going back into past events can enable us to see clearly what matters, what is perhaps being lost, and what is being altered in a very subtle way.” The End of History – a phrase coined by the political theorist Francis Fukuyama – is the fifth production from High Hearted Theatre, specialists in original site-specific work. It is written by the Brazilian-Australian Marcelo dos Santos and directed by Gemma Kerr. Dos Santos says the church garden is one of the few public spaces where the area’s disparate groups – residents, homeless people, drug users and office workers eating their lunch – find common ground. “Even there, I think, many people are barely aware of the church, because it’s so huddled now among the surrounding developments,” he says. “It’s a contested space. It was a community, with a lot of social housing, but it is being absolutely engulfed by development. There’s so much building work going on it’s really hard to walk through the area. The pavements are disappearing.” With original music by Ed Lewis, the play stars Sarah Malin, who was recently directed by Katie Mitchell in Anatomy of a Suicide at the Royal Court, and Chris Polick, of the physical theatre company Wilderness. They play two London strangers divided by age, employment and sexual orientation, who meet by chance on the worst day of their lives. “It should really be the end of history with a question mark,” Dos Santos says. “We want to be reflective, not despairing. This area has seen so many waves of change, now with swaths being bought up and redeveloped by foreign investors – but is this the end of the story, or could this all change again?” • The End of History is at St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, until 23 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/06/football-transfer-rumours-caglar-soyuncu-to-liverpool-or-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T07:54:31Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Caglar Soyuncu to Liverpool or Arsenal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/06/football-transfer-rumours-caglar-soyuncu-to-liverpool-or-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/06/football-transfer-rumours-caglar-soyuncu-to-liverpool-or-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Caglar Soyuncu to Liverpool or Arsenal?","bodyText":"The Mill loves the World Cup. The history, the colour, the stories, the triumphs, the disasters … they’re all very well. But the best thing about the World Cup, of course, is that it’s Football’s Biggest Shop Window, a giant six-week Selfridges display crammed with unheralded Serbian centre-halves and little-known players from the South Korean leagues. It’s a bit disappointing, then, with that cavalcade screaming into view, that Wednesday’s fluff largely focuses on a host of players who aren’t going to be there. Freiburg and Turkey defender Caglar Soyuncu is the latest name to interest the set-menu of super-clubs. On this occasion Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City are all in line for the strapping 22-year-old. In other tug-of-war news, Manchester United and Barcelona have each grabbed an end of Sevilla defender Clément Lenglet and are heaving with all their might. He has a €35m release clause and will have the summer off having missed out on Didier Deschamps’ France squad. Liverpool have long been monitoring Gent winger Moses Simon, who would have been part of Nigeria’s World Cup plans were it not for pesky thigh-twang. The Belgian club are asking for a mere £10m. Salomón Rondón and his satisfyingly matching acute accents wants out of West Brom. Chelsea, Tottenham and (slightly more realistically, you feel) West Ham all have itchy fingers ready to trigger his £16m release clause. James McClean may also be leaving the Hawthorns, but the Baggies have told Stoke where to go with their derisory £4m offer. Valencia right-back João Cancelo is a £35m target for Premier League new boys Wolves despite being unable to squeeze past 83-year-old Bruno Alves and into the Portugal squad. No prizes for guessing who his agent is. Christian Benteke’s summer goes from bad to worse. Having been left out of the Belgium squad for the jamboree in Russia, the striker is now surplus to requirements at Crystal Palace In Championship news: Leeds are on the trail of Vitória Setúbal’s Frederico Venâncio and Norwich are close to signing Emi Buendía from Getafe.

Scotland may not have qualified for the World Cup, but a former Hamilton Academical defender has turned the tournament on its head. Russia 2018 officially kicks off tomorrow, with the hosts taking on Saudi Arabia at 4pm BST. Simon Burnton will be in charge of the liveblog from around 8am. Thanks for your company today, happy World Cup Eve! Spain sacked Julen Lopetegui after he agreed to join Real Madrid. Fernando Hierro has replaced him as caretaker manager. Canada, USA and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Marcus Rashford missed England training with a slight knee strain. Let’s cook! And so to my stomach, which is rumbling with hunger after being tipped off about this little project. Sam, the head designer in our US office, and his girlfriend Shannon have cooked a meal for each of the 32 countries at the World Cup, and will be publishing recipes during the tournament. If you want to give your palate its very own Josimar moment, follow the blog here. The Danish Smørrebrød looks magnificent. The actual football starts tomorrow. These are the fixtures for the first three days of Russia 2018 (all times BST) Thursday Russia v Saudi Arabia (4pm) Friday Egypt v Uruguay (1pm) Morocco v Iran (4pm) Portugal v Spain (7pm) Saturday France v Australia (11am) Argentina v Iceland (2pm) Peru v Denmark (5pm) Croatia v Nigeria (8pm) And you can peruse a full fixture list here. Who needs managers? “If Spain go on to have a great World Cup will it mean the end of the cult of the manager?” wonders Dave Soare. “Will England organise a game show two weeks before the lads fly out to decide who is going to take them to the second round in Qatar?” What I love about that email is that you think you’re joking. Nothing to see here! The press are still diligently attempting to get Hierro to slag off Lopetegui “We don’t have time to feel sorry for ourselves or think about other things. Our objective is to fight for a World Cup – we’ve been two years preparing for this. We must show maturity.” Hierro “If I was not convinced of the power of this team, I would not be here. They are very nice guys and very good football players. It hasn’t been an easy for anybody but I am convinced they will do their best.” Hierro continues “My job is just the match against Portugal, and then the next match and then the next match. We don’t think about what’s coming in the future or beyond the World Cup. [When asked if he was disappointed with Lopetegui’s behaviour] I’ll be honest with you: it would be a big mistake if we think of the past rather than the future. My head is very relaxed and I only have to face what’s coming in the future. The World Cup only comes every four years so we need to focus.” More from Hierro “I have told the players that I have been in their position. I know the kind of challenges they face. They have come here to fight for a World Cup. Everybody has huge expectations and our focus must be our football, not the problems off the field. We have to fight for that.” Fernando Hierro and Luis Rubiales are chatting to the press Hierro: “The whole team is with us. We have already prepared for this match and we need to be consistent. From here until the end of the World Cup we don’t have much scope to change, we need to follow the work that has been done in the past year. This is a fantastic group of players who had an awesome qualification – I have asked them to simply be themselves and follow their personality on the field.” Spain The caretaker coach Fernando Hierro is due to meet the press in a few minutes. I bet he’s the personification of joie de vivre right now. Mwah-ha-ha department AS reports that Real Madrid’s press release yesterday has saved them €2m – that was the buy-out clause in Julen Lopetegui’s contract. One day to go! This time tomorrow, the 2018 World Cup will be 15 minutes old, and the score will almost certainly be Russia 0-0 Saudi Arabia. “Hi Rob,” says Karam Filfilan. “Personally, I can’t wait for Russia v Saudi Arabia tomorrow. As a half-Saudi, I’m looking forward to the novel idea of going up against a country more disliked than us. Also, I still haven’t gotten over our disastrous defending when leading Tunisia 2-1 on our last world cup appearance in 2006, which allowed Big Sam’s Radhi Jaidi to nut the equaliser in injury time.” As today’s events have confirmed, you could tell a comprehensive history of the World Cup by focusing entirely on players managed by Sam Allardyce. “As an American, I was pretty disappointed to hear the US, Mexico, &amp; Canada won 2026,” says Mikey O’Donnell, who has at least changed the acronym. “Joining the exclusive club of Russia and Qatar the same week your president cozies up to a North Korean dictator and picks a fight with Canada surely isn’t something to celebrate. Plus Morocco would’ve been a blast.” Japan are the latest subject of our award-winning World Cup team guides. Brazil No news from the 2018 camp, so why not enjoy a bit of the old nostalgia? A bit of pre-tournament chaos didn’t do them too much harm in 1986. “Hi Rob,” says Abhu Tyagi. “If Spain were Pakistan, I would put money on them winning this World Cup. This is exactly the kind of thing that would happen to Pakistan before a major cricketing tournament.” Ha, that’s so true. But if it was really Pakistan, they’d also lose their first two games, sneak through on three points and thrash everyone by at least four goals in the knockout stages. “There is no loyalty in football generally,” says Ruth Purdue. “I think the Spanish FA have made a mistake and possibly disrupted what could have ended in glory. I hope I am wrong as this Spanish squad is something special.” I don’t think it’s what he has done so much as the way it was done. The more I think about it, the more I admire the Spanish FA president and former Hamilton Academical defender Luis Rubiales for placing such emphasis on integrity. I’m still not sure it’s the correct decision but, in what has become a thoroughly disgusting sport, his stance is kind of refreshing. Spain There has been no public comment from Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked this morning. I wonder if part of him is tempted to tell Real where to stick their job. Fernando Hierro, his replacement, is due to be shouted at by the press in just under an hour. There’s nothing much happening out in Russia, so it’s time for more visual entertainment. Some Championship news Marcelo Bielsa, who led Argentina to the last 32 at the 2002 World Cup, is set to take over as coach of Leeds United. Apropos very little, look at this glorious piece of skill from Preben Elkjær against England in 1982. Spain have sacked Julen Lopetegui after he agreed to join Real Madrid. Fernando Hierro will replace him as caretaker manager. Canada, USA and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Marcus Rashford missed England training with a slight knee strain. “Portugal won Euro 2016,” says Matt Dony, “because Aaron Ramsey got suspended.” You’re still listening to this on loop two years later, aren’t you? “Croatia have to be at risk,” says Stu Morphet. “Ongoing scandals in the FA and two players facing perjury charges is not ideal prep for a World Cup....” Yes, that’s a really interesting group. It’s an immutable law of World Cups that any group including a Scandinavian team is tough to predict. “Germany,” says David Boyes. “Just a hunch, but they basically have the same team with the same long serving manager. Will things be a bit stale, have they already peaked? Though it’s not a difficult group, neither is it an easy one.” I know what you mean, in that Sweden are capable of putting a spanner in anyone’s works with a 1-1 draw, but I can’t see it. Germany and Brazil invariably win their group and I think that’ll happen again, which would be bad news for England as it would mean certain defeat to one or the other in the quarter-finals (if they get that far). It’s interesting that a few of you fancy Portugal to go out in the group stages. I’m still not really sure how they won Euro 2016. “Even before all this nonsense today with Spain, I commented somewhere on the Guardian that it’s not beyond the realms that both Portugal and Spain end up not going through from their group,” says Richard Dennis. “Iran, the best side in Asia, by a fair old amount, and Morocco are a very complete team. Portugal do not inspire me with confidence, and nor do Spain. So, in answer to your question, I give you two answers instead, and both from the same group no less!” Good one. Next you’ll be telling me Brazil will lose 7-1 to Germany in the semi-final. At almost every World Cup in my football-watching lifetime, a big team has gone out in the first round: the Soviet Union in 1990, Colombia in 1994, Spain in 1998, France, Portugal and Argentina in 2002, the Czech Republic in 2006, France and Italy in 2010, Spain, Portugal and Italy in 2014. Who do you think it will be this year? I wouldn’t be shocked if it was Argentina. They have a slippery group: Iceland, Croatia and Nigeria. France’s group is not the easiest either - Australia, Peru and Denmark - and it’s not beyond the realms that England could go home too soon. Tunisia are a decent side. So, to summarise: it’ll be a Tunisia v Denmark final on 15 July. Saudi Arabia There’s another Spanish coach in Russia. Juan Antonio Pizzi, who played his part in another Spain World Cup shambles 20 years ago, is in charge of Saudi Arabia. They will meet Russia tomorrow in the opening match of the tournament. England Here’s a weird thing: England are at the World Cup, and even jaded hacks are wishing them well. Sachin Nakrani explains why. “This is a Panini treasure trove,” says Adam Hirst. All the Panini you could ever eat… Togo, Tahiti, Scotland… Personal Memory-Inducing Favourite: the Spain 82 stadiums.” España 82, please. Show some respect on today of all days. It’s a little quiet at the moment, with no managers sacked in the past three hours, so here’s a summary of today’s main news: Spain have sacked Julen Lopetegui after he agreed to join Real Madrid. Fernando Hierro will replace him as caretaker manager. Canada, USA and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Marcus Rashford missed England training with a slight knee strain. “Atonement!” Here’s more on the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by Canada, USA and Mexico. Iran In the rich history of football, coaches have used thousands of things to stir their players into action. But this might be the first time a bland statement from a shoe manufacturer has been used as a motivational tool Thanks Baz, hello again. Let’s proceed straight to this visual feast. All change! Like Fernando Hierro itching to get into Julen Lopetegui’s chair, Rob Smyth is fed, watered and rearing to take over. He will keep you updated with all the World Cup news that’s fit to print (and plenty that isn’t) throughout the afternoon, so don’t touch that dial. 2026 World Cup: “It’s been announced that USA, Canada and Mexico will be hosting the 2026 tournament after getting the nod at this morning’s Fifa conference in Moscow. Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo has a question: “does the world cup going to three countries mean all three automatically qualify?” he asks. It’s a good question and the answer at the moment is that nobody knows whether all three will qualify automatically as hosts, or if a single auto-bid will be dispensed. That will probably be decided at the next congress, in 2019. With 48 teams slated to take part in 2026, I suspect Fifa might let them all in. Canada, obviously, invariably struggle to qualify, while Mexico are the only country of the three represented at this year’s tournament after America somehow managed not to qualify ahead of Panama. Spain press conference: According to Spanish newspaper AS, Spain’s new manager Fernando Hierro is scheduled to address the media in the Krasnodar Stadium press room in Sochi at 4.30pm (BST). That ought to be a lively presser. Saipan revisited: There are echoes of Roy Keane being sent home from Saipan around this morning’s Spanish shenanigans, although there appears to have been little or no dithering in the Spanish version. After Keane was sent some (many in Ireland still maintain he left of his own accord and it’s true that he left Mick McCarthy with little choice but to send him home), various politicians and broadcasters intervened to try and make everyone involved see some “sense” and “think of the children”. Spain have moved quickly to replace Julen Lopetegui with their own technical director Fernando Hierro. Eric Dier has allayed any concerns over his fitness prompted by a heavy strapping on his left thigh at England’s open training session at Spartak Zelenogorsk Stadium. The Tottenham Hotspur player, who is competing with Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph for the defensive midfielder role, confirmed he had been suffering from a minor injury but has now recovered fully. “I am fine,” he said. “It is just a superstition more than anything now. It’s just because I’ve had a problem with my leg and it’s cleared up now. But I was wearing the strapping before, and I just haven’t stopped wearing it yet. I will, eventually.” Marcus Rashford was the only member of Gareth Southgate’s 23-man party who missed the team’s first session at their base in Repino on the Gulf of Finland, with the Manchester United striker having suffered a kick to his knee prior to the squad’s departure from St George’s Park. He is expected to conduct some gym work back at the team hotel this afternoon and should be in contention for Monday’s opening group game against Tunisia in Volgograd. Speaking of Sid: Our man who’s an authority on all things Spanish is not one for sitting on the fence and has some seriously strident opinions on the sacking of Lopetegui. From the vaults: Following this morning’s news from the Spain camp, I got a kick out of re-reading this interview our own Sid Lowe conducted with Julen Lopetegui back in 2016. In it, the now former Spain manager fondly recalls his days playing with Mark Draper. I wonder does Fernando Hierro fondly recall his days playing alongside Kevin Nolan and Nicky Hunt? More on Spain: It’s been confirmed that Fernando Hierro will take charge of the Spanish football team for the duration of the tournament after the shock dismissal of Julen Lopetegui. Hierro is Spain’s technical director and the two men were spotted walking around Spain’s training ground just a few hours ago, in very deep and occasionally animated conversation. I wonder what they were talking about? Happy World Cup eve, one and all – Barry Glendenning here to provide some cover while Rob Smyth stretches his legs after a long stint in the hot-seat. It being the calm before a perfect storm that’ll be begin when Russia take on Saudi Arabia tomorrow, it’s been a quiet day with very little news of any significance. Well, very little news of any significance apart from Marcus Rashford sitting out England training with a minor knee injury, the USA, Canada and Mexico getting the 2026 World Cup and … eh ... oh yeah, only SPAIN DECIDING TO SACK THEIR MANAGER JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THEIR OPENING GAME OF THE TOURNAMENT. Stay tuned and we’ll keep you updated with developments from the Spanish camp as they unravel. If you’ve been in a digital detox pod for the last few hours, Julen Lopetegui was sacked this morning. I need some lunch, so World Cup Bazzer is going to step into the hot seat for a little while. I’ll leave you with today’s headlines. Spain have sacked head coach Julen Lopetegui two days before their first game. Canada, USA and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Marcus Rashford missed England training with a slight knee strain. “With Lopetegui, an important clue is the reference to him needing to manage a team ‘of all Spaniards’,” says John Johnson. “In a highly sensitive time when the question of exactly who are Spaniards is a critical question (Catalan separation), you can’t have the national coach simultaneously being the manager of the club team (Real Madrid) most identified with everything anti-Catalan. At least, not if you want to keep your Barcelona players happy, and want to project *some* sense of Spain as a unified country. It was the right decision, but either way it will reinforce the sense of arrogance and entitlement many Catalans feel towards the rest of Spain. Unbelievably stupid move from Lopetegui.” Yes, good point. I still think there should have been a way for him to continue, but it’s easy to say that when you’ve never lived in Spain. Spain “Your post at 11:54 suggested to let the situation marinate for another 24 hours before sacking Lopetegui,” says Richard Firth. “However, that would have put them even closer to the kickoff for the Portugal game which might have made them look even more ridiculous had they still decided to sack him.” True, but it would have given them a greater chance of making the right decision, which is all that should matter. I’m not sure 24 or 48 hours’ notice makes much difference, but an extra 24 hours’ thought might have done. That said, the more you read about it the more you think the Spanish FA president and former Hamilton Academical defender was unlikely to change his mind. Some more lunchtime reading Ambassador, etc. Shouldn’t you be doing some work? Oh. The Fiver! In today’s Super Soaraway World Cup special, the Fiver considers… a Spanish shambles. A heads-up As an Important Journalist, I’ve had a preview of a BBC documentary that will air on Sunday evening. It’s called Managing England: The Impossible Job, it’s brilliant, and you should watch it. And some lunchtime viewing (this is great) Lunchtime reading “I’m surprised,” begins Edouard Guidon,. “that no-one has mentioned the precedent of the French national manager, Jacques Santini, committing himself to manage Spurs just before Euro 2004, a decision which was disastrous for absolutely all concerned...” But not for Gift Grub. Here are the headlines on another slow news day. Can’t the World Cup just start already? Spain have sacked head coach Julen Lopetegui two days before their first game. Canada, USA and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Marcus Rashford missed England training with a slight knee strain. The 2026 World Cup will have 80 matches: 60 in the USA, 10 in Mexico and 10 in Canada. 80 matches! Who’d be a golden goose? The hell with it: while we’re plugging work from elsewhere... Our own Daniel Harris has been Lopeteguing with the New Statesman – here’s his typically brilliant World Cup preview. Why Americans should support Mexico at the World Cup “If Mexico are co-hosting, does this mean ‘The Wall’ will need extra doors?” says Alan Phoenix-Bates. “How’s this going to work? Observation: nobody seems to ask questions like “How’s this going to work?” these days.” That’s because nobody gets that far – they just throw crowd-pleasing rhetoric around and argue in vague terms until everyone gets bored and moves onto something else. Here’s more on the news that Canada, USA and Mexico will host the 2026 World Cup. Fifa might want to change the order of the three nations before they come up with an acronym for the tournament. Spain: who’s to blame? “There’s a real sense of outrage in Spain about Florentino Perez’s latest stunt and Lopetegui’s perceived lack of respect to the national team. Rubiales is probably reflecting the mood of the nation more accurately than the players. I don’t see that he could have done anything else. Fergie was right: I wouldnae sell Madrid a virus either.” He sold them the best bloody footballer of the last 30 years though! But yes, the more I think about it the more I think that, at worst, the former Hamilton Academical defender and Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales was put in a horrible position. I still think he should have let it marinate for another 24 hours, but Lopetegui’s naivety almost beggars belief. All that said, we probably shouldn’t rush to judgement until some of the facts are in, or even all of them. Yep. Morocco have missed out, and the World Cup will return to North America for the first time since 1994. The English model I bet Lopetegui could use a pint of wine right now. Justice for toxic masculinity! “Noticed you’ve mentioned Rubiales’ ‘wounded male pride’ several times over the course of the blog,” says Chris Zacharia. “Had a female FA chief sacked Lopetegui, and journalists had rushed to label it ‘female jealousy’, they would have rightly been questioned for their choice of terminology. Even if Rubiales did do it out of ‘wounded pride’, what makes it ‘male’ as opposed to simply human?” Spain It seems likely that Lopetegui will be replaced by his former assistant Fernando Hierro and/or the under-21 coach Albert Celades. Your suggestions for emergency Spain manager include Michael Laudrup, Sam Allardyce, David Moyes, Rafa Benitez, Zinedine Zidane and Matt Dony (the last one, admittedly, came from Matt Dony). Hamilton Academical latest “I think it’s a bit unfair to put all the blame on Rubiales - this whole story is a complete shambles,” says Benedek. “Why did Real Madrid need to announce their new manager two days before the World Cup? Why couldn’t Lopetegui and/or Real at least inform the Spanish FA of the ongoing negotiations, considering the recently signed contract extension? What did Rubiales think before firing Lopetegui two days before their first game? What’s the plan? The incompetence of everyone in this story is so unbelievable I can’t stop smiling.” Yes, that’s fair – the former Hamilton Academical defender isn’t the only villain here. If reports are accurate, Lopetegui has been stunningly naïve and Real Madrid have been, well, Real Madrid. But ultimately Rubiales seems to have put his male pride before his country. “As an Irishman, I remember the genuine shock of ‘manager’ Roy Keane leaving the squad in 2002 but arguably the team did better than expected following all that faff (notwithstanding the stupid way we went out to Spain),” says Colin Ward. “ Anyway, though nothing placed yet I had pretty much finalised my outright betting for the tournament and my nap was a Brazil-Spain final. A question for you and any interested readers: is this craziness likely to completely derail Spain’s chances, or might it somehow galvanise them? I want to make sure I invest my £1.50 wisely. And maybe it’ll transpire in a couple of weeks that Rubiales got concussion following his meeting with Sergio Ramos. Look out for the Spanish FA’s president dropping another clanger in the next 20 minutes.” With a lesser team I would expect it to ruin them, but Spain are so full of winners that it might be different. Which is to say: I haven’t a clue. You’re welcome! You’re a handsome devil, what’s your name? While the world tries to take in the news about Julen Lopetegui, here’s a bit of light relief. Spain have sacked head coach Julen Lopetegui on the eve of the World Cup. The Spanish FA president cited his elephantine ego the manner of the announcement that Lopetegui would join Real Madrid after the tournament. Spain, who play their first group game against Portugal on Friday, will announce a replacement this afternoon. Marcus Rashford misses England training with a slight knee strain. “Hi Rob,” says Paul Fitzgerald. “You’d think Ramos would’ve been able to twist Rubiales’s arm on the matter.” Spain “I can’t make head nor tail of this decision, but it does make me feel a little better about Brexit,” says Alan Phoenix-Bates. “Any news on Jaffa Cakes?” Not yet. Mary Berry’s 11am press conference has been put back an hour. “Why don’t the Spain players just refuse to play unless he is reinstated?” says Andrew Hurley. “Would be a rare case of footballers showing courage, and the Spanish FA would have to back down.” I suspect they’ll just get on with it like the Ireland players did when Roy Keane was sacked in 2002. There is no news yet on who will manage Spain in their first World Cup game IN TWO BLOODY DAYS’ TIME. It’s a staggering demonstration of masculinity, toxic from Luis Rubiales, who has probably flushed a World Cup campaign down the toilet to soothe his wounded male pride. Julen Lopetegui sacked as Spain head coach Here’s our breaking news story on the astonishing developments in the Spain camp. Here’s the Spanish FA president and former Hamilton Academical defender Luis Rubiales explaining the decision “We have to decided to fire the national coach. What we have achieved in getting here is due in great part to him, and we must thank him and wish him luck. The Spanish national team is the team of all the Spaniards. We only found out just five minutes before the announcement that he was leaving for Madrid. There is a way that you must act. Julen has worked in a great way with the team, but we cannot accept how he has acted in this case.” This is an astonishing development, just 29 hours before the start of the World Cup. To compound matters, it sounds like the players were strongly against the move. But the former Hamilton Academical defender Luis Rubiales, now Spanish FA president, was not for turning. Oh my. Justice for Italia 90! “Oh, and you’re absolutely correct about Brazil 2014 too,” says my new BFF Shaun Lawson. “Started really well, died a death - just not in the same extremes either way as Japorea ‘02. 2014 being the best World Cup this century simply means it was the smallest lump in the cesspit. The last genuinely good World Cup from a purist’s point of view was 1986; though just like you, Italia 90 will always be the Daddy for me, and those who whine about it miss the point of that tournament completely.” Yes, I think that last point is really important (and is demonstrated brilliantly in Simon Hart’s definitive book about the tournament). I’d argue the last great World Cup was 1982, but I wouldn’t foam all over QWERTY at the suggestion of 1986. “It’s not the same guy at the helm as then - but this is the same ridiculous Spanish FA which didn’t even give Atletico Madrid the league trophy in May 2014, because the then president was ‘travelling’,” says Shaun Lawson. “The Spanish FA has bent over backwards for Real Madrid throughout its entire history - and NOW it suddenly has a problem? It’s exactly as you just said: masculinity, toxic.” I’m seriously starting to wonder whether it’s time to make men extinct. Spain It’s all speculation, but... it now sounds like Lopetegui is staying, thanks to a successful intervention from Nobel Peace Prize winner Sergio Ramos. Justice for Brazil 2014! “Knock-out stages of Brazil 2014 were better than some remember,” says Richard Sillett. “Well, the last 16 was anyway. Germany-Algeria and Brazil-Chile tense and exciting, USA-Belgium was nuts, and then we had that James Rodriguez goal in the game against Uruguay. Is that what we’re really asking of a knock-out round? A quarter-final stage that’s a non-non-event?” I know I’m being old-fashioned but I recall a time when more than a few of the knockout games had a pulse. That said, so much of this is personal – Italia 90 will always be my favourite World Cup, and most people loathe it. Brazil 2014 was objectively the best World Cup of this century - but contrast the knockout games with France 98, which had three classics as well as drama, shocks, genius and all the other stuff you need to hand in an argument like this. Russia Tomorrow’s opening match involves the two lowest ranked teams at the tournament: Russia (70th) against Saudi Arabia (67th). It’s not just Bodega fans who are asking, ‘How did this happen?’ Spain “Rob,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “There are many things in life I do not understand: Brexit for one, how my dog Stella knows when I even think the word ‘sandwich’ for another. But I truly don’t understand the fuss over Lopetegui taking a job that starts after the World Cup. Is this all just because it’s Real Madrid or what am I missing here?” See masculinity, toxic. We don’t know for certain but reports suggest the president Rubiales has taken the huff because it was all done behind his back. Random phrases from Sky Sports News’ World Cup coverage, part 1 in an occasional series “Word of warning: if you thought you’d heard the last of the infamous Vuvuzelas, think again!” Unsubscribe. Spain The key man in this shamb- sorry, story is former Hamilton Academical defender Luis Rubiales. He is the president of the Spanish FA whose nose has apparently been put so far out of joint by Real Madrid’s announcement that he now wants to sack Lopetegui. The players, it says here, are pleading for a bit of common sense and dignity. When Sergio Ramos is playing the good guy, you know things have gone awry. Colombia were the most exciting team at the 2014 World Cup. This year they have many of the same players – and the tournament’s best kit. Oh, and they could well face England in the last 16. Here’s our frankly brilliant team guide. Spain Julen Lopetegui’s press conference is scheduled to start now, but I’m not sure a decision has been taken on his future. This is a magnificent shambles. Some more brunchtime reading for you I suppose the counter argument is: Spain were pretty crap anyway, as we saw two years later. But I wasn’t in and amongst the camp, so I have no idea how much it affected morale. “Enjoying the live blog,” says Ed Gutteridge, lining up the inevitable ‘but’, “but ‘the first really exciting World Cup since France 98’?? After Brazil 2014, the actual, funnest, best ever one?! Madness.” Were you awake for the knockout matches? The group stages were fun, I’ll let you have that one. But with one once-in-a-lifetime exception, the business end was pretty dull. The Knowledge: Panini special! I had a lot of fun – too much fun, if I’m honest, too much danger – researching this week’s Knowledge. I wonder if this year’s album has the correct Spain manager. Spain “Lying in bed, listening to Radio Marca, the very big possibility of Spanish coach Lopetegui getting the sack two days before their first World Cup game,” says Frederick Stinger. “Real Madrid make themselves bigger than the Spanish team, belittling Spain as a country, not to say marking Lopetegui for life. Rubiales the new Spanish representative for world football is steaming angry so we might see the B team manager take over. Punters change your bets!” Lying in bed you say? Random phrases from Sky Sports News’ World Cup coverage, part 1 in an occasional series “Now what you’re looking at there is salted bread...” If anyone knows the inventor of the mute button, please kiss them on my behalf. Spain coach Julen Lopetegui’s morning press conference was put back to 1030 BST amid rumours that he is to be sacked on the eve of the World Cup Real Madrid announced yesterday that Lopetegui would take over from Zinedine Zidane after the World Cup Marcus Rashford has missed England’s training session with a slight knee strain Germany Thanks to my man Daniel Harris for sending this interesting link to an interesting link. One day to go department “Might just be me reading the blog through my own lens of excitement,” says Stuart Morphet, “but you’re definitely a little giddy and excited aren’t you?” Yup. If you can’t get giddy and excited the day before another World Cup that will eventually let you down with a load of low-scoring knockout games, then when can you! But seriously folks: I have a strange and not entirely explicable feeling this might be the first really exciting World Cup since France 98. The plan is for Marcus Rashford to do some training later at the hotel, presumably in the gym, after he sat out today’s group session because of a whack to the knee sustained in training before the squad flew to Russia. The sense is that he will be fine for Monday’s game against Tunisia. Spain latest Having scoured Twitter, I can confirm that: Julen Lopetegui will be sacked as Spain coach Julen Lopetegui will not be sacked as Spain coach Jaffa Cakes are definitely cakes Jaffa Cakes are definitely biscuits Spain If Lopetegui is sacked, it doesn’t necessarily mean Spain have no chances of winning the tournament. Obviously it wouldn’t be ideal, but many teams have emerged from chaos to excel at World Cups - and in some cases win it. Iceland Now, if Iceland aren’t your first of second team at this tournament, you have my pity. Nick Ames has spoken to their manager Heimir Hallgrímsson “Hi Rob,” says Conor Plunkett. “Pretty sure Roy Keane worked for the Saipan tourist board as well.” That was why he was sacked, wasn’t it? VAR department “Do you think that the use of VAR will be a total nonsense, or will it be a welcome addition?” asks Will Morrison. “I can just imagine the kerfuffle if Russia are awarded a questionable late penalty tomorrow evening, then VAR overrules the decision.... It would take a brave official to make that call.” I will be very surprised if it isn’t a total shambles. Even if you ignore arguments about the soul of the game, the officials have nothing like enugh experience for it to be used in a tournament of this size. There are also too many undefined grey areas. Don’t be surprised if somebody headbutts or punches a referee. As you say, if basic errors are made in relatively minor games, what will it be like when the stakes are stratospheric and/or Vladimir Putin is running amok in your subconscious? By using it so soon, football is trying to run before it can crawl. England A bit more reading (come on, keep up). Simon Burnton has been speaking to members of recent England squads, including Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard, to find out what can be learned from previous World Cup failures. Here’s Sean O’Mahony “Conor Plunkett (9.31) is asking if you’re having a moment because you’ve now stated twice that Roy Keane was manager of Ireland in 2002. Do some research mate.” Ach! Sorry, you’re right, that’s my mistake: I should of course have said he was the player-manager. England A bit more reading for you. The ever excellent Dominic Fifield speaks to the frequently excellent Kyle Walker about his new role with the Royal Challengers Bangalor- sorry, as an RCB. “It’s not Roy Keane,” says Will Donovan. “Roy Keane wasn’t the manager.” Well… England In other news, here’s Daniel Taylor on the cyberthreat to England’s players. “Hi Rob,” says Conor Plunkett. “Just wondering if you’re having a moment with the whole Roy Keane thing. He may have thought he was the manager but big Mick put him in his place.” No, no moment. ROY KEANE. Spain latest Julen Lopetegui’s press conference, scheduled for 0930BST, has been delayed by an hour. There are rumours that the Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales wants to sack Lopetegui, and that other board members are trying gently to point out what an overreaction that would be. England Marcus Rashford will miss today’s training session, which starts in a few minutes, with a slight knee injury. I was going to say it doesn’t sound like much to worry about, but knees are notoriously untrustworthy. At this stage, though, there is no suggestion he’ll be unavailable for the Tunisia game on Monday. The Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales was supposed to be at Fifa’s congress today but left hotel apparently looking very panicked to fly to Spain training base late last night. On Tuesday evening he was in Metropol hotel in central Moscow, in lobby bar, very relaxed, talking about the Spanish federation. Then it appears news of Lopetegui’s move to Real Madrid reached him. He swiftly made his exit from the hotel, looking very panicked, apparently to catch a flight to Spain’s training base. The Russia World Cup is soooo 2018. If you want to find out who will be hosting the 2026 World Cup, click away now. An email! “Hi Rob!” says Drew Gough. “Very much looking forward to days upon days of rolling MBM coverage for Russia 2018, in a way I suspect the crew at Guardian Towers is not. Honest question for you: I know it’s the first game of the tournament and all, but has there ever been a less attractive opening fixture than Russia-Saudi Arabia?” No. You’re welcome! Obviously some of the games have turned out to be stinkers - West Germany 0-0 Poland in 1978 wasn’t one for the weeks, never mind for the ages - but I can’t recall a fixture that looked less appealing beforehand. And I’ve lived through every World Cup. Spain latest I should stress that there is no official word that Julen Lopetegui is to be sacked as Spain manager, so it may be just another Twitter fiaschoax. We’ll find out in the next half hour or so. Who was the last manager to leave this close to a World Cup? Roy Keane in 2002? A bit more breakfast/brunch reading: here’s Martha Kelner on VAR and offside issues. There’s going to be an incident, isn’t there. How do you top a disaster like Spain’s Brazil 2014 campaign? Well... While we wait to discover precisely what state Spain are in - Julen Lopetegui is due to meet the friendly media in just over half an hour - here’s some breakfast reading for you. Spare a thought for those who tipped Spain. Oh hang on, nobody did. Kick off is 31 hours away, but it’s time for the first OMG! of the 2018 World Cup Hello, good morning and welcome to our liveblog of the day before the World Cup! There will be plenty going on - not least in Camp Spain, where Julen Lopetegui will be meeting the press at some stage. Yesterday afternoon, Real Madrid showed their usual sensitivity by announcing that Lopetegui will become their new manager after the World Cup. It’s not necesarily a barrier to success - remember ‘PSV Off Bungler Bobby’ in 1990 - but nor is it a recommended course of action in the Little Book of Team Morale. As well as shoving some Spanish articles through Google Translate in an increasingly frantic manner, we’ll bring you the latest news from all 32 teams. Okay, not all of them, how many fingers do you think I have, but the ones who do or say anything interesting. England are training this morning, possibly without the injured Marcus Rashford, and there will be much else besides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/13/var-2018-world-cup-global-perspective-video-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T09:26:49Z","webTitle":"Will VAR help the World Cup?

Fans from around the world have their say","bodyText":"VAR was first trialled in a match between two MLS reserve sides two years ago. Now it’s being used at a World Cup. Is this really a good idea? We asked our readers for their experiences of the system around the world. Not all of them are convinced. Australia When Fifa started selling VAR, they said it would cause minimum interruption and maximum benefit, with the main aim being to clear up howlers. I get the impression very little thought has gone into VAR. In Australia, it has been a total disaster. Crowds have dropped and fans hate it. I like the idea of giving managers three decisions per game with a maximum review period of 20 seconds and no longer. Canada I’ve visited Russian tea rooms before to have my fortune told. Given the long-standing tradition for this in Russia, it may be a more efficient way of deciding close calls this summer. Give the fourth official some soggy tea leaves and let him sort it out. It’ll surely go more smoothly than VAR. Jordan Devine India I’m for it, but only if it’s used only for critical decisions that will affect the outcome of a game – marginally offside goals, red cards. The game stop in these cases anyway so the “halt in play” argument used by detractors doesn’t hold water. The only issue is that the entire process is not displayed – like it is in cricket, for example. A more open process would be better. Ahitagni Montenegro I’m against the use of VAR in any league, especially the World Cup. To make a mistake is only human and referees are only human. New Zealand I’m for it, but fear it will create as much controversy as it eliminates. It should be limited to matters of fact: offsides, some handballs (whether the ball touched the hand, not whether it was intentional), was the ball in play, did a player fall when there was no contact, and so on. I don’t see the point in using VAR for subjective decisions because reviewing them on replay brings you no closer to a definitive answer – in the A-League in Australia there have been high-profile cases where it has taken us further from the commonly accepted decision. Peter Lye Nigeria Dortmund at Augsburg. Dortmund are awarded a penalty after two minutes of the alleged foul. Same weekend, Mario Mandzukic has a goal for Juventus at Atalanta disallowed for a foul, long after celebrating. And let’s not talk about Mainz v Köln. VAR is still in a work in progress, not least in terms of its timeliness, and that has evidently slowed down the game. Waiting for three minutes to know whether or not you can celebrate is a dampener, not everyone is Patrick Cutrone. No one wants to see a late dramatic goal in the World Cup semi-final delayed by VAR. As for the correctness of the decisions, check Ashley Young and his arm in the FA Cup final, proving it doesn’t erase debate. What’s the point of all my jibber jabber, you ask? I’m against VAR. Kia Poland The World Cup is meant to be the pinnacle of the game, not some testing ground for half-baked ideas. Stop tinkering with the rules and stop trying to fool anyone into believing that technology will solve any problems. Until there’s some dramatic AI development, football is going to be played and refereed by humans. It has been a travesty in Poland. On the final day of the Ekstraklasa season, Jagiellonia Bialystok entertained Wisla Plock in a crucial game for both sides. The hosts were still hoping to win their maiden title, but that would require a win and for Lech to beat Legia Warsaw. Plock went ahead after 35 minutes through José Kanté. Ivan Runje levelled things up just before the break, but Kanté struck again immediately after the restart and restored the away team’s lead. Or at least that’s what they thought, because the referee ran to the monitor and saw … something. I’m not really sure anyone, himself included, knows what he saw. Anyway, he disallowed the goal. One one can only wonder what would have happened if the perfectly legal, disallowed second goal had stood. Zee Portugal I’m in favour of it. The Portuguese league has used it this season for the first time and, while there are obviously kinks in the system, it’s been a positive experience overall. With time and experience, it will be greatly useful. So far, the biggest problems have been a certain inconsistency and, more importantly, referees still adapting to the VAR procedures. Most of the negatives that were anticipated – delays in matches, and players and supporters becoming unable to celebrate goals – have simply not happened. The idea that VAR would end spontaneous goal celebrations has been shown up as frankly absurd. Spain I’m for using VAR at the World Cup. This competition will be seen by people all over the world and it is good that it is improving. The world is changing and football will have to do the same. Sweden I’m for using it, but not as a default. The coach of each team should be given one appeal per game to use if they feel the referee has made an incorrect call. Only then should VAR be used. UK There is no need for VAR. The sport is not broken. Don’t fix it. VAR has reversed a few dodgy decisions, but it has also ruined the emotional immediacy of goals and big moments. No way is it worth the trade-off. It’s a disaster for emotional immediacy. Imagine “Agüerooooo” in the age of VAR. It’s a nightmare to contemplate diluting that moment while someone stares at a screen to make sure “we get the big decisions right”. Ben Aitkenhead Uruguay I’m for VAR, of course. From the Uruguay matches at the last two World Cups alone, VAR would have prevented: 1) Luis Suárez’s sending off against Ghana, since video referees would have spotted the two Ghana players who were offside (not the one who dived though). 2) Two of the Netherlands goals in the semi-final shouldn’t have stood: one for a foul and the other because Robin van Persie was offside. 3) Suárez biting Giorgio Chiellini. All these incidents were followed by protests, so not much time would have been wasted. Pablo Miguez USA Video technology has been introduced across the major professional sports in the US and has tended to cause more problems than it promised to reduce. It also disrupts the flow of games. The action comes to a grinding halt and the referees still tend to get the calls wrong. In MLS, VAR was touted as something that would be employed rarely and only for “clear and obvious” calls. Instead it has quickly become a crutch for poor referees who lean too heavily on VAR to correct missed or wrong calls after the fact. It has been a failure to date, no matter what the league, US Soccer or referees claim. I wouldn’t miss it one bit if they did away with it tomorrow.

That proved impossible and 15 households are still living in hotels. One family, the Rasouls, face staying in a hotel until November, a 17-month wait. The original 138 households in the tower and Grenfell Walk split into 203 units, and there is a shortage of affordable housing in the borough. In 2016 the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea sold off two council homes in the affluent south of the borough for £4.5m, more than it spent on the whole cladding system for Grenfell. RBKC has since bought 307 homes for £235m, mostly in north Kensington, Ladbroke Grove and Notting Hill, but 69 households remain in temporary accommodation. The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, said this week that “the pace has been too slow” and he is deeply concerned. Only 82 of the 203 households are in permanent new homes. The government blames the delays on the need to repair or adapt properties. The future of the tower Relations with the council were so poor earlier this year that some of the bereaved and survivors feared the tower would be replaced with new housing. In March, however, the government agreed the community would decide on “a fitting memorial to remember those who lost their lives”. Brokenshire said no decision had yet been taken on whether the tower will be demolished. That appears the most likely outcome, but any work is unlikely to start until next year after the police finish their investigations. A memorial garden is one idea often mentioned, and Latimer Road tube station appears likely to be renamed Grenfell. Mental health and trauma issues Almost 1,000 adults have been screened for post-traumatic stress disorder and several hundred have been treated. Children at seven state schools were directly affected by the death of pupils or staff, and 10 more were significantly affected. The council now employs 10 specialist educational psychologists to help them. The task now is to “help them to think about what’s helped them to stay strong and to cope and encourage them to listen for the stories of hope and courage, notice the kindnesses and emerging signs of resilience or recovery within the community,” said Helen Kerslake, a senior member of the team. Cladding nationwide The country faces a £1bn bill for re-cladding at least 311 residential towers, including 159 social housing blocks, with combustible plastic-filled aluminium panels similar to those used on Grenfell. Government tests declared the materials broke building regulations. Only 11 of these blocks have so far been re-clad in safer materials, and work has started on 100 others. After 11 months of lobbying by cash-strapped councils, central government agreed to pay at least £400m toward the bill. Legal disputes continue in the private sector over whether freeholders or leaseholders should pay and cladding remains in place on thousands of homes. The government has said it will take action if building owners do not step up. Building regulations Combustible cladding is still allowed on tall buildings in England and Wales. Arconic, the US company that made the Grenfell panels, withdrew them from the market two weeks after the fire, but others remain on sale. A government-commissioned review of building regulations that concluded last month triggered confusion. The reviewer, Dame Judith Hackitt, said there was no need to ban combustible materials, but ministers said they wanted to do just that. A consultation is about to start, which means the expected ban is unlikely to be implemented until the second half of the year. Hackitt proposed a wholesale change of the building regulations which prioritises safety, as in the aviation or nuclear industries, with heavy fines and jail for those in charge of buildings if they transgress. This will take much longer. Police investigations Scotland Yard has already identified two organisations, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, as suspects in relation to potential charges of corporate manslaughter. The investigation, however, is not expected to outpace the inquiry. A memorandum of understanding governing relations between the public inquiry and the police investigation has been published promising “maximum assistance” but anticipating legal difficulties. Met police revealed last week that the London fire brigade and its senior officers were facing investigation over the “stay put” policy that resulted in Grenfell Tower residents being told to remain in their homes as the fire spread. Several people have been arrested and charged with fraud for having obtained money and hotel accommodation after falsely claiming to have been survivors. Public inquiry The public inquiry is under way and could run into 2020. After eight days of emotional commemorations to 69 of the victims, it has already received more than 2,000 pages of evidence about the immediate cause and spread of the fire and the delayed evacuation. There has, however, been criticism of the failure of some of the companies involved in the refurbishment to provide full statements. Survivors and the mayor of London also want the venue moved from Holborn to closer to Grenfell. A second phase, beginning next spring, will focus on the run-up to the refurbishment and how the tower became such a fire risk. Under pressure from survivors, the prime minister agreed the inquiry should appoint two people to sit alongside the chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, to help him examine social and housing issues during this phase. Some survivors have called for the inquiry to consider whether the fire service and official response were influenced by racial discrimination. Core participant status has so far been granted to 533 individuals and 29 organisations, making it the UK’s largest ever public inquiry. Death toll In the immediate aftermath of the fire there was speculation that as many as 500 people had died. Detailed forensic work since then established that there were 71 fatalities including one unborn baby. The Grenfell Tower inquiry increased the figure to 72 to take into account the death of Maria del Pilar Burton, known as Pily. A long-term resident, she was one of the last people to be evacuated from the building and sustained burns injuries. Burton, who had been suffering from a chronic illness, died in January. The Met police are sticking to the 71 figure, saying “there is no evidence to link Mrs Burton’s death to the fire”, citing a coroner’s finding that she eventually died of a stroke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/13/tedx-kenya-kakuma-refugee-camp-hanno-brankamp","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T11:17:29Z","webTitle":"The cynical recasting of refugees as raconteurs can't mask the grim reality | Hanno Brankamp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/13/tedx-kenya-kakuma-refugee-camp-hanno-brankamp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/13/tedx-kenya-kakuma-refugee-camp-hanno-brankamp","fields":{"headline":"The cynical recasting of refugees as raconteurs can't mask the grim reality","bodyText":"The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has just co-hosted a festival, the TEDxKakumaCamp, the first-ever TEDx event held in a refugee camp. The talks were organised under the euphoric theme of “Thrive” and promised to tell “stories that uplift and inspire not just the communities that host them but the entire world”. This theme was in keeping with the TED brand, which typically consists of speakers narrating their personal journeys of discovery to inspire audiences. Rather than being held in a conference centre of a major world city, however, this event took place in one of Africa’s oldest and largest refugee camps, which houses nearly 150,000 people in north-western Kenya. Media coverage of TEDxKakumaCamp has been overwhelmingly positive. Al-Jazeera’s journalists, for example, simply asked a self-congratulatory Melissa Fleming, the UNHCR’s chief communications officer in Geneva and co-curator of the event, about her personal determination to make the grandiose spectacle happen. However, there is another, much less positive, way to interpret the event. This critique is not addressed at those refugees who had the courage and talent to tell their stories at TEDxKakumaCamp nor the thousands watching on open-air screens, cheering and hoping for a better tomorrow. Instead, it is aimed at the degree to which humanitarian organisations like the UNHCR have now wholeheartedly embraced neoliberalism’s most cynical narratives. Western humanitarian approaches to refugee camps have been going down the road of neoliberalism for several years. While there was once talk of dependency among refugees, today’s aid agencies advocate “self-reliance”, “self-governance” and “participatory approaches”. In their article Suzan Ilcan and Kim Rygiel describe a trend whereby displaced persons are increasingly encouraged to be “self-governing” and are expected to “refashion themselves as resilient, entrepreneurial subjects”. In this understanding, refugees should not look to politics or broken asylum regimes for solutions to their displacement and misery; they should look in the mirror. The arrival of TEDx in Kakuma is a very lucid expression of this philosophy. The TED format essentially fetishises and commodifies the art of inspiration and individual innovation. Although there are notable exceptions to the form, talks are known for promoting rags-to-riches tales under the implicit motto: if you don’t think of yourself as disadvantaged or oppressed, you can’t be. This message may resonate positively with many people living in refugee camps like Kakuma. But the problem with this rhetoric of resilience and entrepreneurship – particularly when promoted by the UNHCR – is that it makes false promises and diverts attention away from structural inequalities, discrimination and policies of containment. For many years, for example, Kenya’s government has shown refugees (especially those from Somalia) nothing but open hostility as it has threatened and conducted forcible returns. In 2016 it announced that it would close all camps and expel their inhabitants. It upholds a strict encampment policy, forcing the majority of refugees to reside in the inhospitable north. And in 2014, its authorities rounded up Somali refugees in Nairobi’s Eastleigh district, raiding homes and abusing women and girls. The situation in Kakuma refugee camp itself is only marginally better. Movement is restricted by a curfew, while Kenyan police conduct punitive operations in particular neighbourhoods, intimidating those who stand in their way. Furthermore, food rations are cut in half or reduced substantially almost every year as donor countries fail to meet their financial obligations to the World Food Programme (WFP). No amount of individual positive thinking is enough to escape these realities. Kakuma camp is a vibrant place, full of life, love, business, solidarity and creativity. On the surface, the TEDx event might therefore seem commendable. People who live in permanent situations of displacement should not be relegated to the status of “refugee victims”, but have their voices heard. However, doing this through TEDx as a media brand, which transports the values of neoliberal globalisation to the site of the refugee camp, is both cynical and harmful. The fact that the UNHCR organised this event shows the extent to which humanitarian agencies are abrogating the political responsibilities of states and instead using their influence, standing and resources to offer dubious entrepreneurial fixes. At a time when Europe and North America are trying to shut their doors to refugees – and many African governments feel confident to emulate these hostile policies – personal stories of transformation might make us feel good. But they are sadly full of false promises that only serve to spread the gospel of neoliberalism in the south. TEDxKakumaCamp might attract some additional donations for the camp operation, raise the profile of the crisis momentarily, and help erase memories of the UNHCR’s corruption controversies of last year. But the reality for Kakuma’s residents will hit hard once the dust settles, food rations are slashed again and police brutality resumes.

Last week, it was about the men, with Geraint Thomas giving the principality its best ever professional men’s result, winning the Critérium du Dauphiné. This weekend, women professional cyclists take centre stage, with the Ovo Women’s Tour finishing in Colwyn Bay on Sunday after a hilly run through Snowdonia, and a possible Welsh favourite in the field in Dani Rowe. Rowe, who hails from Hampshire but took Welsh nationality last year, finished a close second at the Women’s Tour de Yorkshire in late April, reflecting the progress since she made the switch from the track, where as Dani King she won gold at the London Olympics in 2012 and three world championships, all in the team pursuit. The Tour marks her third major target of the year after the Commonwealth Games, where she took a bronze medal, and Yorkshire; on the hilly course, she hopes at least to improve on her ninth place of last year, and perhaps take the first Women’s World Tour win of her career. That depends on how things pan out with her co-leader in the WaowDeals team, Marianne Vos, who has not raced since breaking a collarbone in April but has spent the last three weeks at altitude, where she “kept the same routine day in day out: train, eat, sleep”. “We have several cards to play. With Marianne it’s a really strong team, which is nice as it means the pressure isn’t all on me,” Rowe says. “She doesn’t know what form she’s in but having the best women’s cyclist of all time there to call the shots is fantastic. The team know this is a goal of mine, and Marianne is open to working with other riders, so we will have to take it day by day and keep our options open.” Now in her fourth season specialising in road racing, Rowe feels that this one has been something of a breakthrough. “I’ve been getting results and I’ve been there at the key moments in races, at the crux of it. This year I’ve been learning how to be a [team] leader rather than working for anyone else.” The 27-year-old has competed in all the four previous editions of the Women’s Tour, which set out from the start to push an agenda of equality by providing women with identical racing conditions – hotels, road closures and so on – as in the more long-standing men’s event. This year, the prize money is equal to that of the men’s race, which takes place in September. “The UK is leading the way in terms of women’s racing,” Rowe says. “This race is well-organised, it’s safe, it will be well-covered in the media, it’s on television every day. The communities get behind the race – the European girls are always amazed by the support – and seeing all the kids come out of the schools by the roadside every day gives me goose bumps. “The route looks good. I’ve had a look at stage five, it has a long climb but it’s 50 kilometres to the finish so I’d expect a small group to be together. If that was the finish [at the top] it would be completely different.” She expects a similar pattern on most of the five days, with select groups contesting the finish, particularly on stage three, the longest of the race. The 2016 winner, Lizzie Deignan, is absent as she is expecting her first child, but three former winners figure in the field: last year’s victor Kasia Nieuwadoma, Lisa Brennauer of Germany, and Vos, the winner of the first edition. Even without Deignan, a strong British entry reflects the way the sport has developed in the four years since the inaugural Women’s Tour. The sisters Hannah and Alice Barnes should challenge in the sprints although they may have to play a support role to Nieuwadoma in the Canyon-SRAM team, while Katie Archibald, an Olympic champion in the team pursuit is renowned for her all-round strength. Two UK-based teams compete: Storey Racing and Trek-Drops. The 102 riders face a route that heads from east to west across England and Wales and builds in difficulty, with the opening two relatively flat stages ending in Southwold and Daventry. Stages three and four are lengthy loops largely on rolling roads in and around the Cotswolds, ending in Leamington Spa and Worcester, while Sunday’s closing stage northwards through Snowdonia includes the 6.9km climb of Nant Gwynant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/14/doxxing-assault-death-threats-the-new-dangers-facing-us-journalists-covering-extremism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T14:41:47Z","webTitle":"Doxxing, assault, death threats: the new dangers facing US journalists covering extremism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/doxxing-assault-death-threats-the-new-dangers-facing-us-journalists-covering-extremism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/doxxing-assault-death-threats-the-new-dangers-facing-us-journalists-covering-extremism","fields":{"headline":"Doxxing, assault, death threats: the new dangers facing US journalists covering extremism","bodyText":"The truth business is becoming more dangerous for many American journalists. Two Sundays ago, the Portland Mercury reporter Kelly Kenoyer, 24, went downtown to cover a violent street protest. It was the first such protest she had worked as a journalist – Kenoyer didn’t begin her career until after the election of Donald Trump. Within minutes, she was being shoved and manhandled by a masked man aligned with the rightwing Patriot Prayer group. “I got close to record the argument he was having with [a] counter-protester and he stuck his middle finger up in front of the camera,” Kenoyer says, “then shoved me sideways with the same arm.” A bystander intervened on Kenoyer’s behalf, and he in turn was threatened by another Patriot Prayer protester. Then “someone shoved him into me and I fell backwards”, Kenoyer says. Kenoyer was shaken by the incident, but after a few minutes she steeled herself to continue her coverage. Soon after, she narrowly dodged a rock during an exchange of missiles on Portland’s waterfront. Both sides – rightwing activists and leftwing counter-protesters – were hurling stones and bottles, but the rock that hurtled by her came from where the rightwing group was. Kenoyer’s encounters were part of a long afternoon of violent brawling in the streets of downtown Portland. Each side of the protest was mostly concerned with the other, but reporters were frequently caught in the crossfire or even, like Kenoyer, specifically targeted. Other journalists were seen with tears streaming down their faces from pepper spray, or narrowly dodging fists and flying objects. For the most part, they were not beat specialists, but local reporters. In Portland, contentious and violent street protests have become standard fare on local news. This reflects a broader trend during the Trump era: rightwing groups stage incursions into liberal bastions like Portland, Berkeley and Charlottesville, and anti-fascist groups respond. The ensuing confrontations have resulted in violence, injury and, in Charlottesville, death. These situations are dangerous for everyone, including reporters. Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) recorded 44 physical attacks on journalists in North America. Alexandra Ellerbeck, the CPJ’s North America Program Coordinator, says that “the vast majority” of these attacks occurred during protests. Ellerbeck sees it as part of a sea change in the relationship between political activists and the press in the digital media era. “You used to be seen as neutral. You used to be seen as useful, because protesters were trying to get their message out. You used to be given some protection,” Ellerbeck says. “Now people can get their own message out through their own platforms. There’s less of an incentive to befriend the media. Journalists can be seen as a threat to protesters’ ability to control narratives,” she says. Ellerbeck also cites the “trickle-down effect” of rhetorical attacks on the media by politicians including Trump. She says that when CPJ counted Trump’s Twitter attacks on the media, they found more than 1,000 between his campaign announcement and January 2018. “There’s been a constant barrage of conspiracy-mongering and hate-mongering towards the press” by the president, Ellerbeck says. She says that harassment of journalists stepped up during Trump’s campaign, peaking just before the election, and has returned in waves ever since. Other politicians have been even more brazen – Republican congressman Greg Gianforte physically assaulted Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs in May of last year. Doxxing and death threats Last year, Kenoyer was also targeted by far-right threats on social media. In her first job at the Eugene Weekly, Kenoyer wrote a feature on antifascist activism in Oregon’s main college town. She sought to understand the impact of antifascist doxxing tactics on rightwing activists – in which private information is published online as part of an intimidation campaign – and tried to speak with a local far-right activist, Jacob Laskey. Laskey was imprisoned in 2007 after attacking a Eugene synagogue and planning violence against witnesses. He was released in 2015, bearing some fresh tattoos. In January 2018 he was jailed again, after an alleged stabbing for which he is now awaiting trial. In his brief time out, he was a prolific social media presence, tweeting, creating YouTube videos featuring far-right themes and billing himself as an “anti-Antifa supremacist”. Anti-fascist groups in Oregon monitored and exposed his activities, including burgeoning connections with other far-right figures and alleged organizing on behalf of the neo-Nazi group American Front. After an abortive interview with Kenoyer last October, Laskey dedicated a number of YouTube videos to attacking her and Eugene Weekly. In one, after ranting about antifa, Laskey says “Fuck Eugene Weekly, Kelly Kenoyers wrote this article”. A subsequent video showed copies of Eugene Weekly being burned by men who Laskey called “patriots”. Eugene Weekly beefed up its security arrangements in the wake of Laskey’s incoherent, but menacing, response. But the singling out of Kenoyer appears to be representative of an increasing tendency on the far right to mobilize online against any critical coverage. Recently, a significant part of the HuffPost newsroom had their private details released by far-right trolls. This came in the wake of a story by the HuffPost beat reporter Luke O’Brien about a hyperactive Twitter account, @AmyMek, which offers its 231,000 followers a steady diet of anti-Islamic invective and conspiracy theories. The piece says that @AmyMek had been retweeted and promoted by a range of rightwing luminaries, including Trump. O’Brien’s story detailed @AmyMek’s promotion of Islamophobic memes and conspiracy theories. It also exposed the identity of the person behind the account, Amy Mekelburg. In seeking to confirm his story, O’Brien contacted the WWE, the then employer of Mekelburg’s husband, Salvatore Siino. WWE fired Siino before O’Brien’s story was published. Before O’Brien’s story dropped, Mekelburg asked followers to contact HuffPost, which she accused of “viciously harassing” her and “endangering me and my family”. The first tweet in her thread pre-empting the HuffPost story was retweeted 16,000 times. Various rightwingers online felt that O’Brien had “doxxed” Mekelburg by revealing her as @amymek’s author. What followed was a concerted harassment campaign against O’Brien and his colleagues, where he and other journalists were actually doxxed, with their addresses and phone numbers published for the use of far-right trolls. O’Brien’s and others’ details were disseminated on 4chan, Twitter and a neo-Nazi podcast. HuffPost journalists received threats, including death threats, on social media. O’Brien’s Twitter account was itself reported for abusive behavior, and he was briefly suspended. Some tweets were explicit – one of hundreds sent to O’Brien read: “You take my job, I’ll take your life.” Other users tweeted marginally more oblique messages, like images of the Islamic State’s execution of US journalist James Foley. Several HuffPo reporters also got threats over the phone. A voice message instructed a reporter to “kill yourself” before the callers could find them. Another threatened to send people to a reporter’s house so they could be “gang raped or gang murdered”. Meanwhile, writers with connections to mainstream conservatism also appeared to promote the campaign against O’Brien and HuffPost. On the anti-Islam website Jihad Watch, Robert Spencer wrote a column inviting O’Brien to compare his actions to those of Nazi brownshirts, who were part of a movement known for attacking and shutting down what they called the “lying press”. In Spencer’s comments, readers made veiled threats. One wrote, “His victims, perhaps, are better people than he is, but I feel confident that there is someone out there with O’Brien in his sights.” Though previously banned from entering Britain, Spencer is a bestselling author, a regular commentator in conservative media, and last year he delivered a speech at Stanford University. ‘Day of the brick’ The response to O’Brien’s story ballooned into a more generalized campaign of threats against journalists. The so-called “day of the brick” campaign, which ran for about a week from 2 June, mobilised far-right resentment at O’Brien’s reporting, and encouraged people to scale up the threats. First promoted on a rightwing podcast, which foreshadowed O’Brien’s doxxing, the meme was inspired by the racist novel The Turner Diaries, a key text of the far-right movement. The book, which inspired domestic terrorists including Timothy McVeigh, envisages a “day of the rope” where “race traitors”, including journalists, are publicly hanged from lampposts in American cities. On social media and rightwing forums, posts with the #dayofthebrick hashtag depicted shootings and other forms of violence. As part of that campaign, a number of journalists received emails reading “all journalists will be hanged on the day of the rope”, accompanied by an identikit sketch of the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, altered with a half-face skull mask. The mask is the same kind favored by neo-Nazi groups like Atomwaffen Division. That group is associated with a range of violent crimes, including several murders. One of the reporters who received such an email was Kenoyer. It came just a day after her tangle with the protester in a Portland park. After she tweeted out a screenshot of the email, she says that other reporters got in touch about having received the same email, some from the same email account. As Kenoyer’s experience suggests, the vitriol and threats from the far right are disproportionately targeted at women, and anyone else whose identity departs from the alt-right’s ideal type – white men. Ellerbeck, the CPJ coordinator, says that gender identity, ethnicity and sexual orientation are all factors that affect a reporter’s “risk profile” for attacks. ‘Bullies choose particular targets’ David Neiwert has covered the far right since the 1990s, beginning at newspapers in the Pacific north-west, and continuing now with the Southern Poverty Law Center. He chronicled the long history of the radical right in a recent book. He says that in the rightwing upsurge of the 1990s, threats tended to be more isolated, and rightwing activists then were not staging confrontational protests in urban areas. “It was never like this in the 1990s,” Neiwert says, adding that protests like those in Portland are a more recent innovation. “A lot of the ethos of the current far right is taken from the Tea Party movement, who tried to disrupt anything they saw as a liberal proceeding.” The new willingness to engage in street protests is related to the changing demography of the radical right, Neiwert says. “In the 1990s they were not recruiting young men, they were mostly going after middle-aged guys. This movement is very much geared towards young men, and the anger that comes with youth.” And young men, he says, are better at using the internet to further their goals and attack their enemies. “The big difference is social media,” Neiwert says. “It’s a tool for harassing people with, and they use it.” Neiwert says that the far right “are bullies, and bullies choose particular targets”. He adds that while he has had equipment interfered with by leftwing protesters in the heat of protests, nothing on the left corresponds with the right’s targeted harassment. He says that ameliorating the heightened danger for journalists might require the profession’s “lone wolves”, like beat journalists and freelance reporters accustomed to working alone, to find ways to ensure one another’s safety. At protests, he says, “it would be helpful for journalists to cooperate to make sure we have each other’s backs”. Kenoyer, meanwhile, says she will continue to cover protests. In the wake of her experience in Portland, her main questions are professional and ethical. “How do I write about being attacked without becoming part of the story?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/15/gina-yashere-i-once-had-a-haircut-that-made-me-look-like-a-cotton-bud","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T13:00:17Z","webTitle":"Gina Yashere: 'I once had a haircut that made me look like a cotton bud'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/15/gina-yashere-i-once-had-a-haircut-that-made-me-look-like-a-cotton-bud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/15/gina-yashere-i-once-had-a-haircut-that-made-me-look-like-a-cotton-bud","fields":{"headline":"Gina Yashere: 'I once had a haircut that made me look like a cotton bud'","bodyText":"The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen … As a kid, I loved Kenny Everett.

Mark Blake, who was trained by Bob Higgins at Southampton before playing for Fulham and Shrewsbury Town, claimed the coach’s preferred players were known as “Bob’s boys”. Now 50, Blake said that as a boy Higgins spotted he had a love bite and told him he was going to be kicked out of Southampton as he had “breached the rules”. Blake also alleged he witnessed Higgins cuddling young boys in their football kits on his sofa before he took them to training and he made “uncomfortable” sexual comments to him while alone in his car. It is alleged that Higgins, 65, abused boys on football camps, in his car and at his home. He denies 50 counts of indecent assault against 24 boys. Blake is not one of the complainants. Blake, who signed a professional contract with Southampton aged 18, told Salisbury crown court Higgins gave youngsters preferential treatment if they got close to him. He said: “In some of the instances you would turn up at Bob’s house pre-training and see boys staying at his house. There was always a group of players that got closer to Bob. “With him it was not just measuring your performances on the pitch, you would be measured on your time outside training, being at his house early, building a close relationship with him, being one of Bob’s boys. “I would walk into his house and in the lounge would be one or two boys cuddling up to him in their football kits on the sofa. “It was blatant cuddling, they would be encouraged to lay there close up – there was a number of lads cuddling him.” Blake added: “In one instance I stayed over there, I was 14. I had a girlfriend at the time and it was made clear by Bob that having a girlfriend was not to be done – he said girls were a distraction. “The rule was you should not have a girlfriend. I turned up with a love bite and went back with him to his house. It was about a 45-minute journey in his car and he spent the first 20 minutes talking about it. “He told me because I breached the rules I was not going to be given any more opportunities at Southampton. He said ‘your career is over’. He said ‘football should be your whole focus’.” Blake said: “I told him I would leave her so I could focus on the club and he started making sexual comments; he asked if I had any particular questions about sex. “He tried to get me to cuddle up to him in the car, he had music on and made comments about sex. I felt uncomfortable. He had on Lionel Richie music.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/12/send-us-a-tip-on-picnic-spots-in-the-uk-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T16:49:46Z","webTitle":"Send us a tip on picnic spots in the UK for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/12/send-us-a-tip-on-picnic-spots-in-the-uk-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/12/send-us-a-tip-on-picnic-spots-in-the-uk-for-the-chance-to-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Send us a tip on picnic spots in the UK for the chance to win a £200 hotel voucher","bodyText":"What makes an ideal picnic spot?

A prescient man, Bigelow concocted a plan for a new cemetery on the outskirts of the city; one carpeted in flowers and designed to preserve natural beauty. After years of planning and lobbying wary townspeople, Mount Auburn Cemetery was founded in 1831, and Boston’s mourners began packing picnic baskets and taking carriages out to the country to be with their recently deceased. Though Mount Auburn owed a debt to European cemeteries built with similar intent, it was the first of its kind in the US, and soon a rural and garden cemetery movement took hold. Green-Wood Cemetery was founded in New York City in 1838, and in 1847, New York state passed the Rural Cemetery Act, which allowed churches and other entities to buy up tax-exempt land. Soon, New York City – and Queens especially, where more than double the number of people who live above ground are buried below it – was home to many sprawling cemeteries. The Evergreens. Cypress Hills. Calvary. The names go on. I spent a few hours touring the grounds of Green-Wood with Jeff Richman, the cemetery’s historian. The space is beautiful. Trees tower and curve and throw long spiralling shadows over tombs and headstones. It is redolent of wealth.Long-dead New Yorkers plotted an eternal rest in which they intended to occupy the same kind of space they demanded in life. Tombs became like houses, with wrought-iron fences and benches set in small gardens. Death for New York’s richest came at a high price – in terms of both money and space. At the time, it might not have seemed like a problem. Walt Whitman, reporting for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, toured Green-Wood and remarked on its beauty. “But how sweet and peaceful will be their slumbers!” he wrote, “How calmly will they rest in their silent mansions, till the night, the moonless night of death is passed.” During the tour, we passed Lot 44606, a benign stretch of ground dotted with burial markers. But, if you looked closer, you could see there used to be a road where these grave markers now stood. It looked too planned, like a new concrete condo in Brooklyn on a block of old brownstones. In a 2009 New York Times article, the cemetery’s researcher Kestutis Demereckas told writer Michael Wilson how he found space for new graves at Green-Wood. After covering various old paths or roads with new bodies, he laboured over old maps, trying to find small spaces where new plots could be dug. According to the article, the cemetery was going to run out of space any day. Any day is arriving fast. Richman said there was no limit to what the cemetery could do, whether by rearranging the grounds to make space for new arrivals or by talking with developers and trustees to rearrange the cemetery’s vision to cater to new customers. What he did not say was that the cost of a single grave plot in Green-Wood starts at $19,000. Indeed, nearly every cemetery in New York City suffers from the problem of decreasing space for a number of dead thatwill continue to rise relentlessly. Plot prices are rising and in-ground burials at certain cemeteries, such as Trinity Cemetery in Manhattan, are no longer allowed. Some people lucky enough to own plots in New York City are selling them on Craigslist. Not long ago, I walked with Vincent Carbone, who owns Carbone Memorials, an independent memorial service in Brooklyn, as he went to check on a job in The Evergreens. In the midst of all this change, tradespeople like Carbone have almost stopped existing, left floundering in the wake of a memorialisation business that has become less centred around independent shops and more concentrated on bigger, cheaper, more efficient corporations. I watched two of his contractors sandblast a decorative set of hearts into a new headstone that nearly touched another headstone. Everywhere I looked, headstones stuck together like kids in line for recess. Somewhere in the distance, the Jackie Robinson Parkway hummed, jutting right up to the cemetery’s expanse. Almost every New Yorker will pass above, beneath, beside or through a cemetery at some point in their given day. We are prepositionally related to the dead. Not just the recent dead, either, and sometimes not even the real dead. When I attended Fordham University, there was a common myth about the on-campus cemetery, which contained just a few dozen graves: that school leaders constructed it to block a highway from being built through the campus, that there were no bodies in it. Like all myths, it felt just odd and right enough to be true. In Soho in 1991, the city approved plans to build a $276m, 30-plus-storey federal building, before it found out that more than 400 bodies sat below it, in an old interment site known centuries ago as Negros Burial Ground. Though the city continued to build the tower, it altered the design and gave the burial ground historical landmark status and, later, a memorial. This wasn’t, and isn’t, a new problem for the city. Famous sites such as Washington Square Park, where many believe up to 20,000 people still lie buried in a potter’s field beneath its arch, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard all sit on old burial sites of poor, marginalised or disenfranchised groups. And then, perhaps most eerily present, there is Hart Island, the small, barren plot of land viewable from City Island in the Bronx. Here, Riker’s Island inmates are paid 50 cents an hour to bury the city’s poor and unclaimed dead in trenches, not plots. Babies, fathers and mothers alike. Out there in the Long Island Sound, away from the city’s view, inmates dig mass graves for people most people will never know lived. The forgotten, abused, cast-out and neglected bury the forgotten, abused, cast-out and neglected, away from the public eye. As if to add punishment to poverty, Hart Island cannot be accessed in the same way as a regular city cemetery. If, for example, a son wanted to visit his long-lost mother, who died in New York City, whose body went unclaimed, made an extended stay at a morgue, was operated on at a medical school and then found its way to Hart Island, that son would have to wait for the once-a-month family visit day. When he finally arrived on the island after a ferry ride, his mother’s grave would be located via a trench number, and that trench shared with over a hundred other bodies. I don’t doubt that Jacob Bigelow wanted the best for the people and city he loved, that he wanted to create a space of beauty for people who craved solace. But now, almost two centuries later, the very cemeteries that Bigelow inspired are overcrowded and often overpriced. When I went to Green-Wood, I stood and looked out toward the Statue of Liberty and tried to imagine what used to decorate my field of vision: green hills rolling into the water before disappearing. The day I stood there, the city came right up to the cemetery’s fence, and a group of union workers marched in a circle outside a business, striking for something they needed but weren’t being given. When burial space does finally, inevitably run out, the bodies of New Yorkers who are marginalised, poor and disenfranchised – or even simply not rich – will be the ones spending eternity somewhere other than the city in which they lived. There will be no room for them. It will be a kind of gentrification of the dead. When Carbone and I left the cemetery, he pointed at a mausoleum. “Trommer,” he said, indicating the family name on the tomb. “He used to own this brewery, straight ahead. It used to be right there.” Carbone pointed right in front of us. Now, there was a Popeye’s, a gas station. A block away there was Carbone’s memorial shop, clinging to survival, jammed underneath the rattle of a subway track. The city advances. The living need space, but what of our dead?

In the past 20 years, CEO pay has risen from 47 to 120 times as much as their average employee. Fixing these massive pay inequalities will require fundamental structural reforms, not more reporting. The proposed laws also require directors of all large companies to set out how they are acting in the interests of employees and shareholders. These requirements are the government’s response to a series of corporate scandals, but the measures look truly inadequate in the wake of Carillion’s collapse. If the government wants to fix the underlying problems, it should set out more ambitious reforms and a longer-term vision for the UK corporate governance framework. The UK’s “enlightened” shareholder model has clearly failed because the majority of shareholders are not enlightened, not engaged and only operate on a short-term basis. Company law should be amended to require directors to promote the long-term success of the company as their primary duty, with directors required to take account of the interests of workers, suppliers and shareholders. Stakeholder voice should also be given real weight on company boards through two-way engagement and workers being included in board-level decision making. It would be right, therefore, for the government to reinstate proposals to require companies to put elected workers on their board.

The format, in which the top two divisions are split into three tiers of eight – before the middle eight compete in the Qualifiers for the final four places in Super League the following year – has drawn much criticism since its introduction in 2015. While promotion and relegation will remain in a revised structure for 2019, clubs have approved a more traditional format from the start of next season. The only club to vote against the change was Leeds whose chief executive, Gary Hetherington, said it was “an absurd grab for power for the game by a small group of men who think they own the game”. Ian Lenagan, the Wigan owner, said: “We are committed to promotion and relegation. It’s not going to be four clubs in jeopardy any more – but one being promoted and one being relegated. We are planing for it to take effect for the beginning of 2019.” The new Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, said: “We have looked at a competitive structure that really isn’t working: effectively it provides too much uncertainty. “The job starts with building a positive working relationship with the Rugby Football League and that’s recognising Super League’s responsibilities to the wider game, too.” Eamonn McManus, the St Helens chairman, said: “After four years we don’t believe the Super 8s is the optimum structure which produces the optimum commercial returns. We do see tremendous opportunities for Super League and the wider game.” Lenagan also denied claims that Super League’s attempt to be more in control of its own destiny– which included the appointment of Elstone – was not a breakaway from the RFL, and said no matter what changes are made for 2019 the funding given to the lower leagues will be unaffected until at least the end of the broadcast deal which runs to 2021. “The RFL remains the governing body. The top tier of football is well focused and has been successful, as has the top tier in Australia, the NRL. We believe it is very important that there is sole focus is on Super League in order to grow the game significantly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/12/theresa-may-is-a-hostage-to-her-own-party-after-brexit-non-rebellion","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T20:08:30Z","webTitle":"Theresa May is a hostage to her own party after Brexit non-rebellion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/12/theresa-may-is-a-hostage-to-her-own-party-after-brexit-non-rebellion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/12/theresa-may-is-a-hostage-to-her-own-party-after-brexit-non-rebellion","fields":{"headline":"May is a hostage to her own party after Brexit non-rebellion","bodyText":"Theresa May has ultimately persuaded all but two of her MPs to back her in the decisive vote in Westminster but she increasingly appears little more than a hostage to the warring factions in a bitterly divided Conservative party. As the Brexit debate reached its fraught climax, she was holed up in the same House of Commons office, behind the Speaker’s chair, where she spent more than an hour last Thursday trying to convince David Davis not to resign. Dominic Grieve and his fellow would-be rebels were called in, just moments before the key votes, and offered personal reassurances by the prime minister over what happens next if MPs reject the government’s Brexit deal. That came after the embarrassing spectacle of government minister Robert Buckland effectively negotiating with Grieve, through a series of interventions in the rebel backbencher’s speech, in what Anna Soubry called “a peculiar sort of horse-trading” – and then literally negotiating with him, in whispered exchanges, as the debate went on around them. It wasn’t the plan. Just hours earlier, Downing Street had signalled the prime minister had no intention of accepting Grieve’s compromise amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, tabled by the former attorney general and aimed at ensuring ministers can’t “crash out of the EU by ministerial fiat”, as he called it. But the whips’ anxiety about the nail-biting parliamentary arithmetic increased significantly after the resignation of Bracknell MP Phillip Lee, who left his post on Tuesday morning to free his hand to vote against the government. In the event, Lee also accepted May’s reassurances, and abstained, making his one of the most short-lived and least-glorious parliamentary rebellions of recent times. So the government scraped through without a defeat – but not without paying a price. Rebels said May had assured them the government would accept two parts of Grieve’s amendment; and immediately open talks on a third, “part c”, which would allow MPs to direct the government if no deal is reached by February next year. As with last week’s set-to with Davis over the Northern Irish backstop, both sides of the Brexit culture war in the Tory party were almost immediately in dispute about what the climbdown meant – and who had won. At the very least, Grieve and his colleagues have succeeded in throwing up a series of new parliamentary barriers to a no-deal Brexit. The government would have to give MPs a vote on the next steps, if parliament rejects the Brexit deal – or if no deal has been reached by the end of November. Since there is certainly no majority among MPs for no deal, which all but a hard core of Brexit ultras believe would be disastrous, that now makes no deal extremely unlikely. A dispute quickly arose about the third clause of Grieve’s amendment, with Brexiters, including some ministers, quickly saying all that had been agreed was talks – and no government could agree to be “directed” by MPs. Which side won on Tuesday will become much clearer in the next few days, when the government amendment is tabled in black and white. And if either side, placated rebels or suspicious Brexiters, believe they have been betrayed, they could yet seek revenge on their beleaguered leader. And like so many other clashes in this hand-to-mouth hung parliament, Tuesday’s non-rebellion also had a wider significance. The antagonistic tone of much of the discussion underlined how exasperated many MPs have become, about what Grieve called “the irrationality of the debate on the detail of Brexit”, turbocharged by the bellicose front pages of the rightwing newspapers. And the fluidity of political loyalties in this fractious hung parliament was on clear display. The warmest congratulations for Soubry’s powerful speech came from backbench Labour MPs; while Matthew Pennycook, who led for Labour, couldn’t get through his speech without interventions from two grumpy MPs from his own party reminding him many of their constituents voted to leave. With each day that goes by, these cross-party alliances are loosening the bonds of loyalty that bind MPs on each side of the house to their party, and their leader. And if the rebels, in alliance with Labour, could have defeated the prime minister today, they can do it again. Ultimately, they appear increasingly likely to corral her into a considerably softer Brexit than she first laid out – if she is allowed to survive that long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/12/lionel-shriver-dropped-from-prize-judges-over-diversity-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T15:50:24Z","webTitle":"Lionel Shriver dropped from prize judges over diversity comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/12/lionel-shriver-dropped-from-prize-judges-over-diversity-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/12/lionel-shriver-dropped-from-prize-judges-over-diversity-comments","fields":{"headline":"Lionel Shriver dropped from prize judges over diversity comments","bodyText":"Lionel Shriver has been dropped from the judging panel for a writing competition run by magazine Mslexia, after the author slammed publisher Penguin Random House for its diversity and inclusion policies. Debbie Taylor, editorial director and founder of Mslexia, said that Shriver’s comments in a piece for the Spectator magazine were “not consistent with Mslexia’s ethos and mission” and would “alienate the very women we are trying to support”. Consequently, Shriver would no longer be a judge on their annual short story competition, she said. “Since our launch in 1999, Msxlexia’s raison d’etre has been to provide a safe space for all women writers – whatever their circumstances – to develop their craft. We actively encourage submissions from marginalised writers and frequently draw attention to the issues they face,” Taylor said. Shriver, a UK-based American writer who won the 2005 Orange prize for We Need to Talk About Kevin, made headlines after dismissing Penguin Random House’s goal to have a more diverse staff and author list by 2025 as a sign that the publisher was “drunk on virtue”. “From now until 2025, literary excellence will be secondary to ticking all those ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual preference and crap-education boxes,” she wrote. “We can safely infer from that email that if an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay transgender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published, whether or not said manuscript is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed-paper recycling.” Shriver’s comments were widely condemned over the weekend – one author called the piece “deeply embarrassing” – but gained support from journalist Toby Young. On Monday, Penguin Random House stood by its policy, saying: “We firmly believe that giving a platform to more diverse voices will lead to a greater richness of creativity and stories, rather than stifling them.” Taylor said that a new judge for the short-story competition, one of five writing contests Mslexia is running this year, would be announced shortly. In its 10th year, the Mslexia short story prize sees the winning author receive £5,000, a trip to a writing retreat and a day with an editor from publisher Virago. The winning story is published in the magazine. Shriver told the Guardian she stood by the position she had adopted in her column. “I am not anti-diversity, and I have no problem with the programme that PRH runs to encourage the development of a broader range of voices. But statistical targets perfectly mirroring the UK population in race, gender, class, ethnicity, and disability are quite another matter. She added: “The US has had much more experience with affirmative action (positive discrimination) than the UK, and the policy has had unfortunate consequences. Even the US has moved consistently away from numerical diversity targets.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/13/money-talks-fifa-world-cup-morocco-north-america-2026-infantino","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T17:07:32Z","webTitle":"Money talks for Fifa as Morocco pays price for Infantino’s expansion plan | David Conn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/13/money-talks-fifa-world-cup-morocco-north-america-2026-infantino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/13/money-talks-fifa-world-cup-morocco-north-america-2026-infantino","fields":{"headline":"Money talks for Fifa as Morocco pays price for Infantino’s expansion plan","bodyText":"Safe, rational and bountifully lucrative as the Fifa decision is to have the 2026 World Cup hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, it is also disappointing for romantics fancying another tournament in Africa – and laced with contradictions, too. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, looked opportunistically quick to immediately put himself forward for re-election next year, and he was followed by US president Donald Trump with a self-congratulatory tweet. Hosting World Cups and Olympic Games is openly a politicians’ prestige-burnishing project now, not only for Russia’s president Vladimir Putin or Qatar’s Emir, seeking soft power from hosting in 2022. There was a feeling before the world’s football associations gathered at the Moscow congress that more might sentimentally favour Morocco’s bid, but all the numbers were stacked in North America’s favour. As the joint bid officially put it, it has 23 “fully built, occupied, and operational” stadiums already, “150 existing world-class training facilities, millions of hotel rooms, and advanced infrastructure”. Most importantly flowing from that, of course, is a munificence of dollars promised from the tournament for Fifa, and therefore for the voting countries. The projections of revenues from Morocco, all 14 of whose proposed stadiums would have had to be newly built or renovated, were half the $14bn now promised from TV and stuffed stands in the US, and that is a language all the Fifa family understands. But it would be wrong to criticise this too readily as a basis for the decision, which England’s FA voted for too, given that the Qatar vote was so ridiculed partly because the tiny Gulf emirate had no stadiums ready and has had to undertake a vast construction project. The majority of the executive committee then, 15 of whose 22 members have since been found guilty or accused of corruption or ethics breaches (two more were already suspended), was derided and suspected for going against the “technical” assessment that Qatar was the least suitable country bidding. So the rationality of this decision has to be acknowledged, the congress of national FAs who now vote in the new system chose the bid assessed as far superior in the technical inspections. Yet basing the decision on the US’s financial and infrastructural superiority poses another important question, about whether any but the richest countries or those led effectively by dictators can now host sporting mega-events. Morocco came so far behind partly because Fifa’s nations under Infantino awarded themselves an expansion of the 2026 World Cup, from 32 to 48 teams. The logistical requirements are so huge, needing so many stadiums and training camps, to host 80 matches and so many supporters, it is difficult to see Morocco, a serial bidder, or other less privileged countries, having the opportunity. The English FA, which lost its £21m bid to host the tournament which starts on Thursday will consider this expansion to be in its favour, as it ponders bidding again, for the 2030 tournament. As for the contradictions, one was couched in the joyous statement by MLS, welcoming the vote as “a monumental step in our collective mission to further advance the game of soccer in North America”. Fifa and the US football crowd have been promising for decades that the sport will crack America, and while the game’s profile is certainly growing there, this is now the second World Cup granted in modern times to a country which has never fully embraced the world’s most popular sport. Then there is the fact of Fifa granting the World Cup to the US even as its Department of Justice continues to investigate football’s financial corruption. It was always a complaint of Infantino’s fallen predecessor, Sepp Blatter, that the US authorities levelled corruption allegations at Fifa in Zurich, when the wrongdoing the investigators found was mostly in the Americas. A chief culprit, the late Chuck Blazer, criminally filled his offshore bank accounts and evaded his taxes from his personal fiefdom – in Trump Tower. Now, with so many more dollars promised, Trump’s US and Infantino’s Fifa are good friends again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/16/how-china-censors-internet-information","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"How China censors the net: by making sure there’s too much information | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/16/how-china-censors-internet-information","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/16/how-china-censors-internet-information","fields":{"headline":"How China censors the net: by making sure there’s too much information","bodyText":"One of the axioms of the early internet was an observation made by John Gilmore, a libertarian geek who was one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The internet,” said Gilmore, “interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.” To lay people this was probably unintelligible, but it spoke eloquently to geeks, to whom it meant that the architecture of the network would make it impossible to censor it. A forbidden message would always find a route through to its destination. Gilmore’s adage became a key part of the techno-utopian creed in the 1980s and early 1990s. It suggested that neither the state nor the corporate world would be able to censor cyberspace. The unmistakable inference was that the internet posed an existential threat to authoritarian regimes, for whom control of information is an essential requirement for holding on to power. In the analogue world, censorship was relatively straightforward. It merely required state control of all the main communications media – print, radio and television – plus fear of draconian punishment for anyone daring to circumvent the resulting restrictions on information citizens were allowed to see. The 20th century provided numerous instances of how this worked – in fascist dictatorships, the Soviet empire and Mao’s China, for example – and how effective it could be in the pre-digital age. Although much has changed since those dark days, it remains true that the internet (as distinct from the web) is still very difficult to censor. And yet – despite that – authoritarian regimes are flourishing. How come? The answer, in a nutshell, is that they have sharpened up their act. In the process, some have displayed remarkable insights into the nature and affordances of network technology, insights that some democratic governments still don’t seem to appreciate. And at the cutting edge of the new approach to censorship that has emerged is – surprise, surprise! – the People’s Republic of China. In 2015, commenting on the fact that Chinese internet users generated 30bn pieces of information a day, a former director of the country’s state internet information office observed that “it is not possible to apply censorship to this enormous amount of data. Thus censorship is not the correct word choice. But no censorship does not mean no management.” Note that last sentence. The quote comes from a remarkable new book – Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China’s Great Firewall – by Margaret Roberts, one of a number of dedicated scholars who have for some years being studying how the Chinese regime is “managing” the internet. What these scholars have been unearthing is a detailed picture of “networked authoritarianism” (to use the academic Rebecca MacKinnon’s term) in action. Roberts’s book is a magisterial summary of what we have learned so far. In essence, the Chinese approach is a combination of technocratic realism and political nous. It accepts that, in the end, Gilmore’s axiom still applies, but not the techno-utopian conclusion that effective censorship is therefore impossible. It just needs to be updated for a digital age. Censorship 2.0 is based on the idea that there are three ways of achieving the government’s desire to keep information from the public – fear, friction and flooding. Fear is the traditional, analogue approach. It works, but it’s expensive, intrusive and risks triggering a backlash and/or the “Streisand effect” – when an attempt to hide a piece of information winds up drawing public attention to what you’re trying to hide (after the singer tried to suppress photographs of her Malibu home in 2003). Friction involves imposing a virtual “tax” (in terms of time, effort or money) on those trying to access censored information. If you’re dedicated or cussed enough you can find the information eventually, but most citizens won’t have the patience, ingenuity or stamina to persevere in the search. Friction is cheap and unobtrusive and enables plausible denial (was the information not available because of a technical glitch or user error?). Flooding involves deluging the citizen with a torrent of information – some accurate, some phoney, some biased – with the aim of making people overwhelmed. In a digital world, flooding is child’s play: it’s cheap, effective and won’t generate backlash. (En passant, it’s what Russia – and Trump – do.) In her book, Roberts provides abundant evidence of how the Chinese authorities deploy these three techniques. She also suggests that other authoritarian regimes are now taking lessons from the Beijing playbook. This is significant because there are only two systems of governance left in our world: some version of liberal – or, as in Hungary – illiberal democracy; and the Chinese model of networked authoritarianism. Up to now, we in the west – high on Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” narrative – have tended to assume that our system would triumph and that digital technology would help make that happen. The Chinese take a different view. And in the end they may have the last laugh.

Susanne Hinte, who died last year, hit the headlines in early 2016 when she tried to claim a £33m prize with a ticket that she said had been damaged in the wash. Camelot rejected her claim but Hinte became a brief favourite with the tabloids, who gave her the nickname “Lotto Gran”. Later that year Hinte’s former friend Julie Howard sold topless pictures of Hinte to the Sun for £750. She went on to tell police she had done it to humiliate Hinte after they fell out. She obtained the pictures after Hinte borrowed her phone, which automatically copied the images Hinte took to a cloud storage service. The Sun published the photographs on its website and in print on Sunday 3 April 2016. In January 2017 Howard was found guilty of disclosing private sexual images with intent to cause distress, and received a fine and a six-week suspended sentence. She was convicted under a law the Sun had campaigned for in 2014. The newspaper claims it did not know the images it bought from her were stolen. Hinte died suddenly of a heart attack in August 2017, aged 49. Her daughter, Natasha Douglas, pursued a claim against News Group Newspapers (NGN), the publisher of the Sun, on behalf of her mother’s estate. The claim was for the misuse of private information, breach of confidence, copyright and data protection law and the distress that the article caused to Hinte. NGN has not admitted liability but has settled for a five-figure sum. When the settlement is read in open court on Thursday morning it will be the first statement ever to be read in open court in a privacy case for a deceased person. Nick McAleenan, a partner and media and data privacy law specialist at JMW Solicitors, who acted on behalf of Hinte’s estate, said: “This was a serious intrusion and misuse of Susanne’s private information. The Sun showed a complete disregard for her legal rights. As a direct result of its decision to publish the distasteful and unnecessary article, she and her children suffered considerable embarrassment, upset and distress. They were subjected to relentless abuse, mockery and harassment, both in person and online.” Douglas said: “I felt very strongly that it was important to continue this claim against the Sun on behalf of my late mother, not only because it’s what she would have wanted but also to hold them accountable and make other people aware that it’s totally unacceptable to intrude into someone’s life as they did in this case. “Their actions caused a huge amount of pain – revenge porn is an awful thing, no matter who you are. We are all entitled to a private life, but they stole my mother’s dignity.” • This article was amended on 19 June 2018 to correct a date: the images were published on the website on 2 April 2016 and in print on Sunday 3 April, not 2 April as originally stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/13/grenfell-solidarity-neighbours-community-response","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T17:39:28Z","webTitle":"From the darkness of Grenfell came solidarity, kindness and hope.

They saved us","bodyText":"In the dark times,” wrote Bertolt Brecht, “will there also be singing? Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times.” Last Sunday, in a service at St Clement’s church, where many took shelter on the first night after the Grenfell fire, there was indeed singing. We sang the words of June Boyce-Tillman’s stirring hymn: “We shall go out, from strength to strength go on … We’ll make the tunes for those who sing no longer.” Over the past year survivors from Grenfell Tower, bereaved families and the communities around them have faced the very darkest of times. But in them they have also shown us a spirit of solidarity and resilience, of love and hope. It was there from the first. Three days after the fire at Grenfell, in the chaos, heat and dust, a trail of hearts appeared in chalk in Ladbroke Grove. It led to Maxilla Gardens, where the local artist Sophie Lodge sat making heart-shaped frames out of willow, covering them with wet-strength tissue paper. Sophie would make 24 hearts, one for each floor of Grenfell Tower. Today’s regular silent walks feature large green hearts made from willow frames, emblazoned with the words “dignity”, “grace”, “justice”, “peace”, “truth”, “love”. I walked past Sophie and her fellow heart-makers that day, and for many days afterwards. Near the Rugby Portobello club, where a crowd of mostly young people waited for news, I saw Susan Rudnik, a local resident I’d known before the fire, putting up posters for an art therapy centre she was setting up on her estate, where I used to work. An art psychotherapist, Susan wrote a powerful report titled “Out of the darkness”, in which she recorded how children from local schools drew spontaneous memorials on the streets. Every public space, every pavement was full of donations, and people just kept arriving. A friend said to me recently that people bring what skills they have in a crisis. The residents of W10 and W11 brought love. At the makeshift memorials, people gathered to write names and messages of support on the walls. Someone spray-painted “strength” in huge capital letters. People tied ribbons on railings and put flowers in vases. They cut, sewed and crocheted. They cleaned up and cleared rubbish from the tributes. They tended plants. Later, when the cold weather came, they wrapped them in cellophane. As we pause to reflect on the past year, we should remember all this: the role of the community, how it came together, how it was they who provided the humanitarian response when the government’s was so completely lacking, and how this extended into the weeks and months that followed. As for me, I walked around looking for ways to help, trying to make out faces I knew. In the centres at St Clement’s, the Harrow Club, the Notting Hill Methodist church, the Al Manaar centre, Kensal Resource Centre, Acklam Village, donations were sorted and labelled. I checked social media groups to see where they needed help, then shifted boxes on Kensal Road, opposite the offices of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), where I had worked several years before. I half-expected to bump into ex-colleagues and face their disapproval for going public about the organisation’s failings. I needn’t have worried – KCTMO, like the council, was nowhere to be seen. No, it was the local community who looked after the needs of survivors. Looking back, Andrea Newton, who lives on the Lancaster West Estate and is member of the steering group there, believes that it was local residents’ “overwhelming outpouring of love and generosity” that got people through the sleepless days and months that followed. “The concept of residents assisting residents is known to be the key to recovery around the world and residents of North Kensington seemed to instinctively fall into this role for each other. Caring for another person aided your own recovery.” It continues to this day. There was, for instance, the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit. This new organisation, funded by the National Zakat Foundation, was one of those able to respond in a quick and dynamic way to the needs of those on the ground. Everyone has been inspired by the dignity of bereaved families and survivors, and by Grenfell United’s quiet approach to seeking justice. That early community spirit has transformed into organising for the greater good, locally and nationally, urging the government to abide by the recommendations of the inquiry and campaigning to make homes safe across the country. We would do well to carry these qualities into other areas of public life, to learn from this community how to be kinder to each other. Grenfell Speaks, a social media channel for the transparent broadcast of public meetings and the voices of the bereaved, survivors and the local community, has repeatedly held both local and national government officials to account. Residents have established gardening projects, childcare projects. They have co-designed health and wellbeing services and advocacy groups for better housing services across the borough and country. Artistic projects involving young people have helped them translate some of their experiences. It would be a lie to say all this has been easy. Of course there has been anger, especially in the early, chaotic times. People have encountered extreme suffering and mental anguish. The NHS estimates that 11,000 people have been affected in the locality alone. And a new report from a local law centre, NKLC, says the delays in rehousing have added to the community’s suffering. Nevertheless, acts of solidarity and kindness continue to tend to the emotional wounds. Monthly silent walks bring people together to remember the reasons for this sudden traumatic tearing of a community’s fabric; on the loss of 72 lives and the displacement of hundreds more. This week is a time of reflection. The green heart has become a symbol representing hope for all groups in the community. Carried on silent marches and now taken to other cities throughout the country, the willow hearts bring with them the spirit of the Grenfell communities – those who were bereaved and those who were displaced. Those who tended the memorials, day after day: changing water in the flowers, removing litter, cleaning the teddy bears. There is now a sign at Maxilla Gardens which reads, “Heart fixing”. Those affected by the fire do not need anyone to speak for them. They are writing this story themselves – with their dignity, their actions, and in the way they live. For 12 months they have had to fight for justice and yet the inquiry, which everyone hopes will deliver a meaningful outcome (though many fear won’t), has only just begun. There are still so many issues that need to be resolved. But the community has demonstrated a strength, resilience and love that few of us will see the like of again. They deserve justice. They will not give up. And they will continue to exhibit the virtues so beautifully evoked by those green hearts. Dignity. Unity. Grace. Peace. Justice. Love. • Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher.

Olajide Ogunye, 47, is seeking $10m in compensation from the Canadian government after he spent months incarcerated in what his lawyer has described as a “profoundly disturbing” case of mistaken identity. Ogunye was approached by border agents and detained outside his Toronto home in June 2016, even though he produced citizenship papers and a government-issued health card. The agents disputed the validity of the documents and brought him to a detention facility near Toronto Pearson airport, where they fingerprinted him and alleged his prints matched those of a fraudulent refugee claimant who was deported to Nigeria in the 1990s. “It is shocking,” said Adam Hummel, Ogunye’s lawyer. “Even people who are having their citizenship revoked … are not detained like this.” The results of the fingerprint analysis – which Hummel says were never shown to his client – were contradicted by numerous sworn affidavits by friends and neighbours who had known Ogunye for years. Ogunye, who immigrated to Canada from Nigeria with his family and became a citizen in 1996, was moved between Maplehurst correctional facility and Central East correctional centre. Near-constant security lockdowns – a problem plaguing prisons and jails throughout the country – prevented him from making contact with family members. Traumatized by his detention, he was placed on suicide watch. “One time, for the whole month, I was crying nonstop. I was crying continuously,” he told the CBC. “The nurse had to give me depression pills to make me calm down.” Ogunye was released in February 2017. Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) alleged fraud and impersonation by Ogunye as justification for his detention. CBSA said in a statement that it had received Ogunye’s claim and was reviewing the matter, but that it would be “inappropriate” to comment further. Targeted arrests, like the one that ensnared Ogunye, are common for clearing a backlog of immigration violations, said a number of lawyers working in immigration and refugee law. But the arrest of a Canadian citizen by border guards was nearly unheard of, said Max Chaudhary, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer. “That’s simply not what [border] officers do. Their mandate is not with Canadian citizens.” Chaudhary speculated that if border officials believed Ogunye was a foreign national or permanent resident violating immigration laws, it could explain the duration of the detention – and the slow pace in which investigation unfolded. “It seems quite incredible there could be a case of mistaken identity that could not have been cleared up in a faster amount of time, having this person deprived of his liberty for eight months,” he said. Ogunye’s case was indicative of a broken system, said Lorne Waldman, a professor of immigration law at Osgoode Hall. Despite years of lobbying for oversight of the agency’s conduct – and assurances from the public safety minister, Ralph Gooddale, that such mechanisms would be put in place – Wadlman said no progress has been made “Because there’s no oversight, there’s nobody who reviews the conduct of CBSA officers and this matter was allowed to drag on for months and months. It’s extremely unacceptable.” Hummel and his client charge that the government breached Ogunye’s constitutional rights; he filed the case in Ontario superior court on 30 May. “The very fact that this happened, someone who was approached and showed he was a Canadian citizen, means that it could happen to anyone if this is how [border agents] are operating,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2018/jun/14/russia-2018-world-cup-england-guardian-support","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T12:08:51Z","webTitle":"If you value the Guardian's World Cup coverage, we'd love you to support it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/jun/14/russia-2018-world-cup-england-guardian-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2018/jun/14/russia-2018-world-cup-england-guardian-support","fields":{"headline":"If you value the Guardian's World Cup coverage, we'd love you to support it","bodyText":"Here we are then. Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too. Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the Guardian and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the Guardian since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the Guardian. It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are. And hopefully our coverage makes you sound slightly less unintelligent than you are during a discussion of the reactive gegenpress in the local Wetherspoons. Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde. Perhaps you even enjoy reading the World Cup Fiver, following the multi award winning* daily World Cup blog, and listening to Max, Barry and star guests speak their brains over four increasingly hysterical weeks of World Cup Football Daily. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Either way we will always be here on these occasions. But this is only possible because of your support; and because you think what we produce is worth having and – yes – giving something back for in return. Enjoy the football. And if you think what we do is decent, please help us keep coming back here to give you more of the same by clicking on the link below.

For the Tunisia game? Ingerland, Ingerland, Ingerland … I can’t quite see it, though that is sort of why he is here: to find out what kind of Russia football fans are coming to. There are other reasons to be interested in Russia right now, of course. Not least: THE NEW COLD WAR. Dimbleby was here 25 years ago, talking to Boris Yeltsin. “Are you no longer targeting British citizens?” a younger Dimbleby asked the then president. No presidential audience this time. No opportunity to ask the man – who, after 18 years in charge, is looking more settled and established than ever – the same. Who are you targeting, Vlad? Anyone, for example, in the Salisbury area? Foreign elections, perhaps? Instead, Dimbleby talks to the people. He meets a lot of young ones, whom you might hope would support democracy, free speech, human rights etc, but are actually massive Putin fans. He visits a hospitable lady called Maria who lives in an apartment block with her 10 children. Ten! They’ve built a clever triple-decker bunk system into the walls. Maria has a medal – the Order of Parental Glory – for having children. I’d say she has earned it. Her eldest is 24, her youngest just two; that’s 22 years of manufacturing new Russians. Maria, who has her nails painted in the colours of the Russian flag, also likes Putin – he is strong, he has made the army strong, he likes big families, she likes his foreign policy. Dimbleby has an awkward conversation with the kids about the Queen – our Queen. He has met her twice, he tells them, though he has to think about it. Also awkward: a conversation he has with Neil Harvey, a British newsreader at the RT international broadcasting network, which is funded by the Russian government. Harvey says he is not responsible to anyone beyond his own conscience. “And that’s clear?” asks Dimbleby, verging on the sarcastic. “100%, absolutely” says Harvey. The veteran BBC man turns away with a look of disgust. I don’t think Harvey, who once won a news scholarship with the BBC, should bother applying for the Question Time gig when – if – Dimbleby ever calls it a day. The clip from RT is about the Skripal case, incidentally: an interview with Sergei’s niece Viktoria, saying she was manipulated – not by the Kremlin though, but by MI5. Dimbleby also meets Vladimir Pozner, a veteran broadcaster with a weekly TV politics show – a sort of Russian David Dimbleby, then. Pozner’s show is on state-controlled Channel One, where he says he has more autonomy than most, and gets to choose who he has on, though he couldn’t have opposition leader Alexei Navalny on, for example. A politics show in which you can’t interview Putin’s main political opponent? It might seem incredible to us, but – well, things are different here. Hang on, Dimbleby’s not on Channel One, he could visit Navalny. Maybe he was in jail. I hope he tried. He does find plenty of dissent and opposition though. Such as Ivan Pavlov in St Petersburg, which was also home to the other Ivan Pavlov, of canine fame. This Pavlov is a human rights lawyer who specialises in defending people who have gone against the state – Pavlov’s underdogs, you could say. Russian judges tend to find defendants guilty in 99 % of cases. Dimbleby visits an independent radio station (allowed to exist so the Kremlin can claim free speech), where Yevgenia Albats, a campaigner for democracy, explains that Russia is a corporate state, run by the FSB. He meets Alena Popova, a women’s rights campaigner protesting against an MP accused of sexual harassment. While they are talking, a man from state security arrives, followed by someone who films her, then a counter-protester, the police … eventually Popova, who has only just been released, is arrested again. It’s farcical, hilarious … well, apart from the fact it’s state harassment of a woman protesting against sexual harassment, something she has every right to do. Popova is remarkably sanguine. I guess it’s normal, and has been for a long time. This is Russia, and they do things differently here – that’s the main conclusion of Dimbleby’s thorough and fascinating second Russian odyssey. Now it’s football time. I know it’s good for the atmosphere of a tournament if the host nation wins the opening game, but this isn’t making me feel the love. Who are they up against again? Saudi Arabia! Brilliant.

Why pop stars choose the films they do","bodyText":"This week, Rihanna takes on her biggest acting role since pretending to be interested in Drake, as one of a ragtag gang of jewel thieves in Ocean’s 8. She plays Nine Ball, a computer nerd, who helps Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett upset Anne Hathaway while James Corden is somewhere in the background being annoying. On paper, it’s a character that feels at odds with the Rihanna we know and love – she’s certainly not like anyone in my computer group – but, as with all semi-successful pop star-to-actor pivots, there is enough of her there to fit the brand and signpost where she might be going next. In a recent interview, Rihanna’s hairstylist Yusef Williams revealed it was the Sex With Me hitmaker’s decision for her character to sport dreadlocks, a move that kept things “cool, chill and very minimal”, all buzzwords that also apply to her last album, Anti. Williams also mentioned using “kinkier, looser textured hair [extensions] for a reggae feel”, which ties in with the news that Rihanna is making a reggae album inspired by Bob Marley (Nine Ball sports a Marley T-shirt in the film). So, yes, it’s Oscar-buzz worthy acting but it’s also brand-cementing and foreshadowing. There will be more of that later this year when Lady Gaga ramps up the earnest, authenticity jamboree that was 2016’s Stetson-sporting Joanne album in Bradley Cooper’s remake of A Star Is Born, a role originally pencilled in for fellow part-time actor Beyoncé. If the trailer is anything to go by – all sepia-tinged whiskey swilling, auburn wigs and throaty lung-busting – Gaga is just one MOR single away from heading off on tour with Mumford &amp; Sons. It could be said that Justin Timberlake’s role in Woody Allen’s recent atrocity Wonder Wheel mirrored a period of poor decisions for the pop star – see: Man of the Woods. (He did, however, excel playing the smarmy egomaniac Sean Parker in The Social Network.) Alongside Timberlake, the only pop star so convinced of their acting abilities despite evidence to the contrary is Madonna, who has somehow appeared in 18 films, playing roles as varied as a baseball player (A League of Their Own), a fencing instructor (Die Another Day) and a showgirl called Hortense Hathaway (Bloodhounds of Broadway). Perhaps the reason her acting has rarely clicked is because it’s tough to find a role big enough to make you forget the fact you are watching Madonna, an icon of modern popular culture. It is no coincidence that the only role Madonna’s played that approached positive reviews was the powerful and critiqued female figure Eva Perón, a career move she foreshadowed via the video for the 1995 single You’ll See. Unfortunately, she followed Evita with a role in The Next Best Thing, a risible “comedy” film, and affirmation that pop’s lure always wins out in the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"community/2018/jun/17/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-hard","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'hard'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2018/jun/17/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-hard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2018/jun/17/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-hard","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'hard'","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘hard.’ Share your photos of what hard means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

The US Open gets under way on Thursday with Americans seeking to maintain a run in which they hold every men’s major and significant transatlantic team trophy. Such a scenario will always resonate in a Ryder Cup year. The man Europe will place the most faith in when the USA visit France in September, Rory McIlroy, believes the return of Woods has had a positive impact on the country’s golfers. Woods, amid his compelling return from back surgery, tees off at Shinnecock Hills at 6.47pm (BST) seeking to add a 15th major to his CV. “The great young players from this country, they’re playing well,” said McIlroy. “They have had a great run. They have probably a couple of guys – but one in particular – that they try to emulate who’s back out here playing and he has become a friend of theirs. “I think that’s been a huge part of all this. A lot of these guys have gotten to know Tiger. And are able to say: ‘OK, this is what he does. And we mightn’t be able to achieve everything that he has but we can at least try to do that.’ That’s been a huge thing for Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups and them as individuals as well.” Not that McIlroy is overawed by the recurring sight of stars and stripes. “These things go in cycles,” the Northern Irishman added. “European golf was very healthy a few years ago, for a long time. It seemed every major someone from the island of Ireland turned up to, we were winning it. It doesn’t seem that long ago. “There are a lot of strong players [here] but I feel good about my game. I just want to give myself another chance to win another major championship. It’s another opportunity to try and do something great this week.” Should he do so, and in contradicting the sense that he has endured a low-key year, McIlroy could return to No 1 in the world. He has accumulated more ranking points in 2018 than any other player. In truth it would be no shock if a European prevailed here on Long Island. McIlroy has a fondness for the course and has performed well in practice. Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm and Henrik Stenson also have strong claims on a links-like venue that was softened by heavy Wednesday rain. Wide fairways mean this is a second-shot course, where approach-play is key. If Woods would be by far the most high-profile winner, perhaps Phil Mickelson could lay claim to the most endearing tale. The left-hander, who turns 48 on Saturday, needs only the US Open to round off a grand slam of major titles. He has been second or tied second in this one half a dozen times. Mickelson tees off on Thursday morning at 1.02pm (BST) in the company of McIlroy and Jordan Spieth. “This is a golf course he obviously likes,” said McIlroy. “He plays well in the New York area. He should have nothing but good, positive vibes going into this week. He won for the first time in a few years earlier this year so his game’s in good shape. “Phil’s had six runner-ups at this event. He’s played wonderfully. It’s just someone has played a little better at a certain week or maybe he made a mistake at the wrong time. It’s not as if he’s had a poor US Open record. His US Open record is incredible. “If I wasn’t playing and just purely as a fan of golf, I’d love to see Phil win this week because it’s great for the game. It’s a huge story in the game of golf. And as someone involved in the game, I think it would be really cool for that to happen. Seeing as I’m playing in the tournament, I’d rather beat him and not have that happen. But if it isn’t me that wins this week, it would be a great story if Phil was to win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/13/having-dog-never-have-holiday-jilly-cooper","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:58:23Z","webTitle":"If having a dog means you can never have another holiday, is it worth it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/13/having-dog-never-have-holiday-jilly-cooper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/13/having-dog-never-have-holiday-jilly-cooper","fields":{"headline":"If having a dog means you can never have another holiday, is it worth it?","bodyText":"Jilly Cooper says she hasn’t had a holiday in 22 years because she would miss her dog too much. “It’s ridiculous, but I can’t bear to leave Bluebell,” she said, adding that it helps that she lives somewhere lovely. “Gloucestershire is so beautiful in the summer, I don’t want to go away.” I live in the bucolic surroundings of a big city, soothed by the dulcet natural tones of car horns and sirens, so I quite like going away whenever possible, but having a dog does make it more difficult, for practical as well as sentimental reasons. The main way of dealing with the missing-them part is to take them with you. This is less easy for Cooper, who has a greyhound, too gangly to be truly portable, but manageable for me, with a little whippet, and a fondness for the kind of walking-based breaks beloved of retirees and BBC Four presenters. Lyra comes on most of these trips. She has a tendency to knock hot drinks over the bedsheets in “dog-friendly” B&amp;Bs who change their policy immediately after we’ve left. She doesn’t like to be alone and prefers human company at all times. She will love you for ever if you give her a chip, and she has a tendency to vomit in the car. She is basically on her own permanent stag do. Holidays are much better with her than without her. She can’t come on planes – what is this, the US? – so, like Cooper, I miss her terribly when she has to be left behind. But in the two years since I’ve had my dog, I’ve started to think they should be prescribed on the NHS. I’ve barely had a hint of a cold. I’m fitter, healthier and happier. I walk her every day, and every day she makes me laugh, even when she is covered in fox poo and coming in for a hug. Maybe it isn’t quite so easy to book a spontaneous minibreak to Marbella, but you can look at a dog as being a sort of holiday from life, anyway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/13/snp-gifts-may-a-hissy-fit-to-take-her-out-of-the-limelight-at-pmqs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T17:31:30Z","webTitle":"SNP gifts May a hissy-fit to take her out of the limelight at PMQs | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/13/snp-gifts-may-a-hissy-fit-to-take-her-out-of-the-limelight-at-pmqs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/13/snp-gifts-may-a-hissy-fit-to-take-her-out-of-the-limelight-at-pmqs","fields":{"headline":"SNP gifts May a hissy-fit to take her out of the limelight at PMQs","bodyText":"It was one way of getting noticed. For a while now the SNP have been feeling rather peripheral to the main events in Westminster. Unloved, unrecognised, unwanted. An afterthought at best. Much the same way the prime minister must feel when she goes to meetings of the G5 + 1 + 1 and the European council. After parliament had been given just 19 minutes the day before to debate the impact of Brexit on the devolved governments, Ian Blackford decided enough was enough at prime minister’s questions. Rather than bothering to ask Theresa May a question she wasn’t going to answer, the SNP leader chose to invoke an arcane piece of procedure to demand an immediate vote in private on the government’s handling of Scottish constitutional affairs. For the first time in his parliamentary career, Blackford had the Commons’ undivided attention. Cue chaos. The Speaker was blindsided and didn’t appear to know whether he was obliged to halt PMQs and call a vote immediately or delay it till the end of the session. After some hesitation, John Bercow advised Blackford to wait until PMQs were over. Blackford remained on his feet, insisting the session be interrupted for his meaningless meaningless vote. As a change from a meaningless meaningful vote if nothing else. With the noise levels rising and sensing he was about to lose control of the chamber, the Speaker ordered the SNP leader in Westminster to leave the chamber for the rest of the day. Blackford punched the air. Job done. The vote in private had always been secondary to the stunt in public. Now he couldn’t be ignored. Even if only for a matter of minutes. As Blackford waddled – he tried to stomp, but was just a bit too self-conscious – out of the chamber, the other 34 SNP MPs rose to leave with him. Joanna Cherry gestured angrily towards the Speaker. Mhairi Black jabbed her finger and looked ready to take on all comers – “come and get me if you think you’re hard enough” – as Tory backbenchers heckled and jeered the Scots Nats on their way out. The walkout might have been right up there in futility with the Lib Dem hissy-fit of 2008 – over an EU referendum, of all things – but the long-term fallout may be more damaging. The sight of several hundred entitled Tory backbenchers making it clear they don’t give a toss about anyone in Scotland is not going to play out well north of the border. When it comes to the Union, the Tories couldn’t have made it clearer that it’s England first. The disruption did work to one person’s advantage though. For a few minutes everyone forgot about the prime minister. There’s only one reasonable explanation left for how Theresa May can continue to function. And that is that she goes to bed each night hoping everyone will forget how badly she’s screwed up the day before and that she can start afresh in an altered reality. One where she never called the election. Where Britain never voted to leave the EU. And preferably where she isn’t prime minister. For the fourth consecutive week, Jeremy Corbyn chose to exploit the government’s divisions and confusion over Brexit, though with less success than before. Not because May was any better prepared, but because her uselessness has now been factored in to the equation. No one now expects her to say anything coherent – or even credible – and provided she doesn’t fall over or inadvertently crash her circuit boards, her minders rate her performance as a triumph. Better still for May, the mass walkout meant she didn’t have to face tricky questions from the four Scots Nats who had been tabled to speak. Instead the hardline Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Philip Davies got to press her on whether she was going to offer concessions to the Tory rebels who forgot to rebel or stick with offering a meaningless meaningful vote. May happily reassured them. She is now so far gone with Stockholm syndrome she can’t prevent herself from saying anything she thinks her captors want to hear. Whether she meant what she said, not even she really knows. It was just beginning to dawn on Dominic Grieve that he might have been outwitted by someone far dimmer and less capable than him. To round off one of the more extraordinary PMQs, Labour’s Frank Field spent the entire session sitting on the Tory front bench. He has appeared for a while to be angling for a transfer. Now he’s got his wish. If several more Tory ministers resign over Brexit, he could be in the cabinet by this time next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/premier-league-fixtures-2018-19-manchester-city-start-title-defence-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T12:59:06Z","webTitle":"Premier League fixtures 2018-19: Manchester City start at Arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/premier-league-fixtures-2018-19-manchester-city-start-title-defence-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/premier-league-fixtures-2018-19-manchester-city-start-title-defence-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Premier League fixtures 2018-19: Manchester City start at Arsenal","bodyText":"Manchester City will start their Premier League title defence at Arsenal. The 2018-19 fixtures, announced on Thursday morning, handed Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking team an Emirates Stadium opener on the weekend of 11-12 August – a fixture that will be Unai Emery’s first competitive match as the Arsenal manager. City, who amassed 100 points and 106 goals en route to finishing 19 points clear of Manchester United in 2017-18, do not face another side from last season’s top six until the trip to Liverpool in October. Games against the newly promoted trio of Wolves, Cardiff and Fulham are part of a sequence that also includes Huddersfield, Newcastle and Brighton – the three teams who came up in 2017. It is a similar story for Manchester United, who begin at home to Leicester. The 2017-18 runners-up have Tottenham at home in their third game, with Brighton, Burnley, Watford, Wolves, West Ham and Newcastle their other early-season opponents. Liverpool start at home to West Ham, before playing Crystal Palace, Brighton and Leicester, but Jürgen Klopp’s side have a stiff return from the first international break, facing Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City in a run of four games that also includes the visit of Southampton. Tottenham start their campaign at Newcastle for the second successive year before hosting Fulham at Wembley on 18 August. Their new £850m stadium at White Hart Lane will not be ready until the 15 September fixture against Liverpool. Arsenal face a tough first two games without Arsène Wenger. After hosting the champions, they are at Chelsea for a London derby. The Blues, meanwhile, travel to Huddersfield on the opening day and, after the trip to Arsenal, face Newcastle, Bournemouth, Cardiff, West Ham, Liverpool and Southampton. The promoted sides were spared a daunting sequence of games to start the season – although all face one of the top six in their opening four matches. The Championship title winners, Wolves, have a home opener against Everton, before trips to Leicester and West Ham sandwich the visit of Manchester City to Molineux. Cardiff start at Bournemouth and have Newcastle at home and Huddersfield away, before the visit of Arsenal. Fulham, who secured their place in the top flight with victory over Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final, begin at home to Crystal Palace, before the trip to Spurs is followed by Burnley at home and Brighton away. The other first-day fixtures are Southampton v Burnley and Watford v Brighton. Among the final round of matches, scheduled for 12 May, Manchester City are at Brighton – where they started last season – while Cardiff and Wolves are at Manchester United and Liverpool respectively."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/as-a-society-we-must-get-over-the-green-loo","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T09:00:11Z","webTitle":"As a society, we must get over the green loo | David Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/as-a-society-we-must-get-over-the-green-loo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/as-a-society-we-must-get-over-the-green-loo","fields":{"headline":"As a society, we must get over the green loo","bodyText":"For some reason, Samsung has commissioned a study into what people think are the worst interior decoration fads of the last 50 years. I say “for some reason” because, at heart, I’m an optimist. I try to believe there’s a good reason or, failing that, some sort of reason for most of the things people do. But I must admit, in this instance, I’m struggling to think of one. Raising brand awareness perhaps? It certainly will do that, to a modest extent. Articles mentioning the study will probably mention Samsung, so it’s getting more mentions. But are they apposite mentions? It’s not as if Samsung makes interior designy things – or, if it does, there’s still a lot more brand awareness work to be done where I’m concerned. Can you get Samsung sofas, or curtains, or lamps, or wallpaper? Why didn’t Dulux or Laura Ashley or Ikea pay for this survey? I thought Samsung made mobile phones? To give Samsung’s marketing team credit, they have managed to corner me into mentioning that the firm makes mobile phones. So is that the strategy? To associate the brand with such weirdly unconnected areas of commerce that it forces people to contemplate the fact that it makes phones and puzzle over what links there might be between those phones and whatever interior design study, or real ale festival, or turbot-breeding initiative the logo is randomly stuck on? How tortuously cunning! It makes me feel like a dupe for having repeatedly written the word “Samsung” in the last few paragraphs and moves me to say that I once owned a Samsung mobile phone and, in all honesty, I thought it was crap. Much worse than a Nokia or an iPhone, in my view. And if I was ever interviewed by someone doing a survey into mobile phone use, perhaps sponsored by Robinsons Barley Water or Stanley Gibbons, that’s what I’d tell them. I suppose you can probably get Samsung TVs and surround-sound clobber, which are vaguely to do with interior design and may explain why “situation room levels of audio-visual equipment in what is supposed to be a lounge” isn’t one of the study’s top 10 most derided trends. Personally, I hate surround sound when I’m watching television. I want the sound to be made by what I’m looking at – and the pictures don’t surround you, so it’s just distracting when the noises do. Sometimes, it literally makes me turn away from the TV to see what’s happening behind me. Which obviously turns out to be nothing. But then, by the time I turn back to the screen, I’ve potentially missed a key bit of whatever’s going on. I mean, I hardly ever have missed anything, but you can’t be sure until you’ve rewound and checked. Otherwise, later on, when you inevitably find some element of the plot totally baffling, you become convinced that it would all be clear if you hadn’t missed that crucial instant of screen time. That’s my strong view. It’s not always the view of the person or people I’m watching TV with. So, all in all, surround sound is a disaster. But it’s not something the 2,000 respondents to the survey were bothered by. When asked to rank their least favourite of the last half century’s home decor ideas, from a list of suggestions drawn up by design writers, their collated responses produced the following top five: first, furry lavatory rugs and loo seat covers; second, stuffed animals; third, avocado bathrooms; fourth, chintzy furniture; and fifth equal, waterbeds, Artex and carpeted bathrooms. So what do we learn from this list? On the plus side, it shows a timely rejection of trends for absorbent surfaces in the rooms most prone to stray excreta. Anyone who’s ever lived in a shared house will have come to view any little pink rug clinging round the communal lavatory pedestal with the sort of awed respect for extreme toxicity usually reserved for a nerve agent. But, on the minus, it’s a lamentable reflection of how susceptible people are to fashion, not just in what is popular, but also in what is unfashionable. It’s long established that fashion can make people think they adore the daft and hideous. But this list suggests it can also make them dutifully loathe the completely inoffensive. I’m talking about avocado bathrooms. A decade ago, I co-wrote a TV sketch about how our culture has completely lost its sense of perspective about avocado bathrooms. And, as further proof of the complete impotence of satire, the situation has only worsened in the intervening years. It’s just green. An avocado bathroom is just green. All that’s happened is that a thing, the colour of which can be dictated in the manufacturing process – as it can with clothes, cars, crockery, carpets, toothbrushes and many many other items – has been made green. An extremely normal colour. It is one of the main colours for things to be. Many things are naturally green, but many others are deliberately rendered green, or partly green, in order to look nice. But people behave, and are being encouraged by designers to behave, as if having a loo, sink and bath that are coloured green, or indeed any colour other than white, is hideous and insane; as if it shows the worst excesses of “What were we thinking?!” fashion craziness – kipper ties, mullets, puffball skirts and bound feet all rolled into one; as if some final epiphany about the wrongness of baths being any colour apart from white has been reached. It’s not that green sinks aren’t currently fashionable: the implication is that it’s been decided they never will be again. It’s something society has permanently moved on from, like slavery. This reeks of the arrogance of the contemporary: we are the era that’s got it right, that finally understands. We will never look daft again. Well, anyone who observes the world as it currently is and seriously believes this is the age that’s definitely cracked it about anything at all, even bathroom design, is an idiot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/woman-suing-alleged-rape-tells-court-felt-she-would-die","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T17:47:04Z","webTitle":"Woman suing over alleged rape tells court she felt she would die","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/woman-suing-alleged-rape-tells-court-felt-she-would-die","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/woman-suing-alleged-rape-tells-court-felt-she-would-die","fields":{"headline":"Woman suing over alleged rape tells court she felt she would die","bodyText":"A former student who is suing her alleged rapist for damages has told a court she feared she was going to die during the alleged assault. The woman, known as Miss M, told Edinburgh sheriff court she was “so afraid” during the alleged rape in September 2013, “I didn’t know what was going to happen next ... [I] thought I was going to die”. Miss M, 23, who at the time was a student at the University of St Andrews in Fife, is suing Stephen Coxen of Bury, Lancashire, for nearly £100,000 in damages for allegedly raping her in her flat during freshers’ week. She told the court she had since been prescribed a cocktail of drugs to cope with her flashbacks, panic attacks and night terrors, which often left her waking in the night, or caused her to sleepwalk. She told her counsel, Simon Di Rollo QC, that in the months after the alleged incident she began drinking heavily and regularly, using alcohol to suppress her anxiety attacks and flashbacks. “I don’t sleep very well, I often wake up,” she said. “Maybe once a week I wake up in a panic.” She became more and more reclusive, she added, and only sought help after university staff and her doctor warned her drinking was dangerous. “It got quite bad,” she said. “It just spiralled out of control.” Coxen was prosecuted for the alleged attack in November 2015 but cleared by a jury at Livingston crown court who found the charges against him were not proven, a Scottish verdict which acquits an accused but is seen as stopping short of finding them not guilty. He pleaded not guilty in 2015 and is defending himself against Miss M’s civil action, which is thought to be the first in Scotland in many decades involving a defendant cleared in a criminal trial. Giving her second day of evidence to a closed court to protect her identity, Miss M was questioned closely by Coxen’s counsel, Stephen O’Rourke QC, over whether she had accurately remembered how much she drank on the night of the incident. She told the court on Tuesday she had drunk a bottle of wine, a bottle of champagne, four cans of cider, several shots of vodka and another shot of spirits, which may have been tequila, before going to a nightclub where she allegedly met Coxen. O’Rourke said her account did not tally with several witnesses who did not see her consume that amount of alcohol. He said it would have been very difficult to consume so much in the short time available. Miss M disputed that. Then 18 years old, she said many students drank heavily and quickly at that age. “I [would] always have the same alcohol, the wine or the cider, whether I drank it in four hours or 40 minutes,” she said. The court heard that witness statements given to police by her friends before the 2015 trial showed she had been very drunk before arriving at the nightclub, and was stumbling in the street. The bouncer at the student union told one friend she should not be allowed any more drinks. The hearing is due to continue for six more days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/13/christina-nielsen-le-mans-24-hours","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:05:13Z","webTitle":"Christina Nielsen sets sights on another memorable Le Mans 24 Hours | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/13/christina-nielsen-le-mans-24-hours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/13/christina-nielsen-le-mans-24-hours","fields":{"headline":"Christina Nielsen sets sights on another memorable Le Mans 24 Hours","bodyText":"Casual observers of this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours might be forgiven for believing that despite boasting a grid of 60 cars, encompassing 180 drivers, the meeting concerns but two. Inevitably it is Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button who have caused the furore as the two former Formula One world champions attempt to add winning the world’s greatest grand prix d’endurance to their CVs. Yet, as always, this magnificent event is so much more and for Denmark’s Christina Nielsen, racing at Le Mans is almost a family affair. Nielsen is competing for the third time at Circuit de la Sarthe, having already blazed a trail with a hugely successful career. She competes for the Ebimotors team in the GTE-AM class in a Porsche 911 RSR. Porsche are the race’s most successful manufacturer with 19 overall wins and have chosen Nielsen as the first woman with whom they have an official association, with the title of Porsche selected driver. For the 26-year-old it is honour and pleasure. Her father, Lars Erik Nielsen, drove a Porsche in four of his five runs at Le Mans between 2004 and 2008. In 2007 Nielsen attended the race to watch him when she was 15. This time he will be at the track to watch her. She is in the car wholly by right. Having begun karting relatively late at the age of 13, she threw herself into the sport. “In my family you either don’t do it or you give it 100%,” she says. “When you do, the goal keeps getting higher and higher.” Her ambition was rewarded in 2016 when she became the first woman to win the IMSA sportscar championship in the US in the GT Daytona class and remarkably repeated the feat the following year. The class is hugely competitive, as it will be at Le Mans, but the close racing is the attraction for Nielsen. It was Denmark’s Tom Kristensen who really put the race on the map in their home country, becoming the most successful driver at Le Mans with nine wins, but Nielsen too has made her mark and is putting it to good use. She is active in the Danish Women’s Society. “Our common goal in the organisation is to promote equality,” she explains. “So in a sport like racing, where men and women compete equally, to have those results to back me up is really important.” She has the credentials then but others still have lessons to be learned and there is some exasperation already at Le Mans. “I get annoyed when I am in a drivers’ briefing and the race director for the third year in a row continues to say: ‘Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.’ Instead of ladies and gentlemen, or he could just say ‘drivers’. I picked them up on it for the last two years but this year I didn’t because it didn’t change, so all I can do is go out and do my thing on the race track.” When Nielsen does, she knows she will not be the centre of attention and this week it has been impossible to ignore Alonso and Button. However, another former Porsche driver, Derek Bell, who won four of his five race victories for them, remembered gloriously in his new book, All My Porsche Races, believes the same principles for success apply across the grid when drivers share the car for 24 hours. “You have to work as a team,” says Bell. “You have to have total respect for your team-mates. The important thing was sitting in the car and saying: ‘We can win this bastard.’ And you have confidence your team-mates agree.” Bell drove with the great Jacky Ickx for three of his five wins, a formidable pairing indeed, but good team-mates are only part of the story. The 8.46‑mile La Sarthe circuit has unique demands but drivers must also cope with the volume of traffic and the high closing speeds between classes – all skills Nielsen possesses but ones that Alonso and Button must learn in short order. “They both have enough brains but you have to be able to analyse,” Bell says. “You mustn’t look at every gap and think it is a chance to go past and win. You have to think: ‘Will I benefit, or will it bugger up my lap?’” He is optimistic, however, that both have what it takes to prove themselves at the first attempt on the 24. “Fernando will adapt very quickly as he has been in the car already and Jenson will adapt because he knows what he has to do to win,” he says. “It’s more of a thinking race than F1 or any other.” Nielsen know all this already and brings a professional detachment to the maelstrom around the superstars. “It’s great that they are part of making it a success,” she says. “But once they are behind the wheel they are just like everyone else.” For her it is an event greater than any individual, no matter their fame. “Le Mans is so much bigger than anything else,” she says. “Every driver leaves with the same feeling: that I hope I can be back here next year – another 364 days and I can’t wait.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/dancing-with-the-tsars-world-cup-fiver","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T11:16:39Z","webTitle":"Dancing with the tsars | World Cup Fiver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/dancing-with-the-tsars-world-cup-fiver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/dancing-with-the-tsars-world-cup-fiver","fields":{"headline":"Dancing with the tsars: World Cup Fiver","bodyText":"IT’S THE ETHICS WORLD CUP, BABY! Today Julen Lopetegui will leave his phone off, avoid television and sit in a darkened room listening to Boney M and reflecting that, like Ra Ra Rasputin – Russia’s greatest love machine – it was a shame how he carried on. Meanwhile, everyone else will be having a party! Thirty-two managers, 736 players, tens of thousands of fans and at least two million besuited officials flashing laminated passes like police badges are in Russia and ready to strut their stuff! If not the Greatest Show on Earth, then at least one of the few not featuring Jack Whitehall! How the tournament has grown since 1930, when just four European teams headed to Uruguay for the inaugural bash, most of them travelling on a boat with Fifa chief sponge Jules Rimet, who carried the trophy with him in a holdall but warned the lads they’d have to win it in order to touch it. So the card games must have been fierce during the three-week voyage and if the ship’s log shows there was any gin left by the time they passed the Azores, then The Fiver’s crying forgery. Despite all the changes the tournament has undergone over the last 88 years, Fifa has strived to preserve football’s heritage and the fundamental aspects of the game that make it so special: the 1930 final was blown up six minutes early by a miscalculating referee, who, upon realising his mistake, had to drag the angry and bemused players of Uruguay and Argentina back out of the dressing rooms to complete the game; and this year Fifa has introduced VAR to perpetuate that vital sense of farce. But who will be the latest to follow in the footsteps of José Nasazzi by lifting the trophy? We can rule out anyone from Russia and Saudi Arabia. They’ll have their day in the spotlight when they kick off the tournament and that will probably be the last time we hear from either, save for some quiet sobbing from the hosts at the end of the group stage. Brazil are favourites because Neymar’s brought his dancing shoes and a high-class supporting cast who are happy to act like that 7-1 thrashing by Germany never happened. But Germany are planning for history to repeat itself. British tabloids have been readying the headlines for years. France, meanwhile, have an extraordinary array of attacking talent – and a manager who is six years into his reign and still trying to figure out what he’s up to. Belgium also have a gifted squad but you have to wonder about the hunger of a side that knows their slick-talking gaffer will be able to present even the most humiliating defeat as a salutary triumph. There should be no such hunger problems for Argentina, with Lionel Messi facing up to his last chance to step out of the shadow of Diego Maradona. The same goes for Him, who may have won the Euros with Portugal and swept the board with Real Madrid but, when it comes to appearances in the World Cup final, is all too aware that He still can’t hold a candle to Dirk Kuyt. Spain could yet shrug off the loss of their manager and pass all-comers into oblivion. And there are some intriguing outsiders such as Uruguay, Peru, Croatia and Senegal. And what of England? The chances of Harry Kane claiming the Golden Boot look high – and jokes about him doing so are absolutely inevitable – but no one really expects Gareth Southgate’s tender Lions to end 52 years of hurt. But watching them try could be enjoyable and that would count as progress. Where’s The Fiver’s money going? On enough chips and Tin to sustain us for another month in front of the TV.

FIVEЯ LETTERS “So, Spain have sacked an unbeaten manager in controversial circumstances, and appointed a former centre-half who missed a crucial penalty at Euro 96? It’ll never catch on” – Jim Hearson. “We don’t expect Pulitzer-winning writing when we read The Fiver but you can do better than: ‘With only one more sleep to go before the Ethics World Cup’ (yesterday’s World Cup FiveЯ). Surely only nine-year-olds count days in sleeps? And even they stopped the idiotic habit 10 years ago. Or 3,652 sleeps ago” – John Mackay. “Why is everyone so disbelieving about the concept of Mrs Fiver (yesterday’s World Cup FiveЯ letters)? Given it has so many other relations, why shouldn’t The Fiver have a mother? It almost certainly still lives with her. Unless it’s The Fiver’s aunt who is married to Weird Uncle Fiver, which I grant you is less likely” – Robin Hazlehurst. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Most walkers would think a £95 pair of boots would last longer. I’d have expected at least four years out of them with your kind of use – suggesting it would be reasonable to ask for 50% of the price back. Mark Ellis, who runs the store, started by arguing that the boots showed a lack of care and, on that basis, offered a 20% discount on a new pair.

I Boat Moored in the docks by the Cité du Vin, this former ferry begins the evening as a cool hangout for sunset drinks and dinner. Bands perform from 9pm – anything from heavy metal to electronic dance – and the place really comes alive after midnight when it transforms into a club until sunrise. I remember one really wild set by local hiphop star Senbei, when the whole boat seemed to be swinging and we all thought it would float away. In summer, the other big rendezvous is La Guinguette Chez Alriq, right on the bank of the Garonne river, perfect for sunset views and live concerts. • Quai Armand Lalande, iboat.eu Mathieu Perrein, producer at indie record label Banzaï Lab Darwin Eco-système This is the arts and culture project that has put Bordeaux on the international map.

Aux Quatre Coins is just round the corner from my fish restaurant, Le Petit Commerce, and with over 800 bottles on its wine list and a wide selection available by the glass (from €4), it has become the place to go for wine lovers in the city.

This has been a popular neighbourhood eaterie for over a century, and the chef cooks at an open kitchen, creating old-fashioned dishes like boeuf braisé (€19) simmered for hours, right in front of diners sitting around the bar. There’s a terrific wine list, and for dessert don’t miss the classic tarte tatin or île flottante.

Start by checking announcements at the legendary record store Total Heaven (6 rue de Candale), where DJs and record diggers gather. Local websites bdxc.fr and clubsetconcerts.com have music listings, and look out for late night parties in cafés associatifs, alternative cultural centres, like L’Antidote.

Come during the day and this chaotic space is filled with amateur and professional mechanics surrounding jacked-up cars and stripped-down Vespas.

As the Guardian reports, MPs voted by 324 to 298 to back the government in rejecting an amendment passed by peers that would have strengthened the hand of the Commons in the event of it rejecting the final Brexit deal. But rebels led by Dominic Grieve claimed they had agreed to vote with the government on the understanding that further changes would follow, and they would sit down with ministers to thrash out remaining concerns over the next few days. Here is our full story. Here is a table showing how MPs voted on the key division. And here is my colleague John Crace’s sketch. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn has heard something different. He posted this tweet. Newton Dunn was responding to this from the Tory Brexiter Bernard Jenkin, who was describing what he thought the government had offered. ITV’s Carl Dinnen says the Brexit department statement (see 7.47pm) is consistent with the assurance given by Theresa May to the Tory rebels (or potential rebels - in the end most of them did not vote against the government. The Brexit department has just put out a statement about the government’s “meaningful vote” compromise. (See 4.55pm.) This is from a spokesman. On the meaningful vote we have agreed to look for a compromise when this goes back to the Lords. The Brexit secretary has set out three tests that any new amendment has to meet – not undermining the negotiations, not changing the constitutional role of parliament and government in negotiating international treaties, and respecting the referendum result. We have not, and will not, agree to the House of Commons binding the government’s hands in the negotiations. This effectively confirms that the government will not agree to clause 5C of the Grieve amendment. (See 4.55pm.) This goes beyond what government sources were saying earlier, when they just said they were open to a discussion about the Grieve plan. The government has defeated the final group of Lords amendments, by 321 votes to 40 - a majority of 281. The SNP voted against, but Labour abstained. In a point of order Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, says Labour has let down the people of Scotland. The Labour MP for Edinburgh South, Ian Murray, uses Twitter to justify Labour’s stance. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, also rises to make a point of order. She says the way the government is applying the Sewel convention undermines Wales. Dominic Grieve told the Press Association that his amendment today was not about facilitating a second referendum. He said: I think a second referendum is a wholly separate issue. If the public change their mind on Brexit, then my judgment has always been that parliament needs to consider that. Some of my colleagues don’t agree. This debate in parliament today is not about second referendums, it is about trying to manage what is an extremely risky and complex process as well as possible. MPs are now voting on remaining Lords amendments. Lidington says the government agrees with the spirit of the amendment proposed by Chris Patten in the Lords (one of 15 amendments on which the government was defeated). But it is proposing amendments to tidy this up, he says. John Bercow, the speaker, interrupts. Time is up for the debate. Bercow asks MPs to approve government amendments to the Patten amendment. They go through on the nod, and then the Patten amendment, as amended, goes through unopposed. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says Lidington is filibustering. The Conservative MP Heidi Allen, who was one of the Tory MPs who rebelled over Dominic Grieve’s “meaningful vote” amendment in December, has said she abstained tonight because she was assured the government would accept parts 5A and 5B from the new Grieve amendment. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the UK government is legislating on matters that are devolved. He asks for an assurance that Westminster will not do that without a legislative consent motion. Lidington says the Welsh government accepts that Westminster is honouring its obligations to devolutions. And he says the UK is honouring the Sewel convention (which says the UK government should not legislate for matters that are normally devolved without the approval of the devolved legislature). Lidington says the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, has admitted that these are not normal circumstances. Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, says UK government is honouring the Sewel convention with the EU withdrawal bill. Lidington is still speaking in the debate. He says the Welsh government has agreed to what the UK government is proposing for powers being repatriated from the EU relating to matters normally devolved. The Scottish government has not accepted the government’s plans, but Lidington says the UK government has engaged constructively on this issue. You can read the voting lists for the “meaningful vote” division here. MPs are now starting the debate on the second set of amendments being considered today. But because the programme motion has set aside just six hours for debate, and because the voting has taken so long, there are only about 15 minutes set aside for debate. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, opens the debate. These amendments cover devolution issues, he says. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says the government should be ashamed of how little time has been set aside for this debate. (Wishart has every right to complain. The government tabled some substantial amendments when the EU withdrawal bill was in the Lords relating to devolved powers. But the SNP are not represented in the House of Lords, and so the SNP have not had a parliamentary say on these matters.) And the government won the the 11th and final vote in this round of voting, by 321 votes to 305 - a majority of 16. MPs voted to take out a Lords amendment requiring the government to seek parliamentary approval for phase two of the Brexit talks. The government won vote number 10, another one removing a Lords amendment saying ministers could only pass secondary legislation when “necessary”, and not just when “appropriate”. Ministers won by 317 votes to 306 - a majority of 11 (the lowest of the night). These are from Alex Wickham, who works for the pro-Brexit Guido Fawkes website. According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, government sources are not reading quite as much into the concession as Tory pro-Europeans like Dominic Grieve (see 6.07pm) or Phillip Lee (see 5.55pm.) There could be at least four explanations for the briefing discrepancy. 1) Different parts of the government machine are giving out different messages. 2) The government is pulling back a bit, under pressure from Brexiters. 3) The Tory “rebels” read rather too much into what May and others in government were telling them. 4) The “rebels” are deliberately talking up what they think they secured from May to make it harder for her to back down. It is quite possible that there is an element of all four in the mix. Here is some more comment from journalists on the significance (or otherwise) of the government’s “meaningful vote” concession. From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From Politico Europe’s Tom McTague From the Economist’s John Peet From the Telegraph’s James Rothwell From Business Insider’s Adam Payne The government won vote number 9, another one removing a Lords amendment saying ministers could only pass secondary legislation when “necessary”, and not just when “appropriate”, by 322 votes to 306 - a majority of 16. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has put out this statement about the government’s “meaningful vote” concession. It is very much a holding statement; he is essentially holding fire until he has a better idea of what the government is offering. He says: This vote was about ensuring parliament was given a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no deal situation, which is becoming more likely with the divisions at the heart of this government. However, facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat Theresa May has been forced to enter negotiations with her backbenchers and offer a so-called concession. We will wait and see the details of this concession and will hold ministers to account to ensure it lives up to the promises they have made to parliament. MPs are now voting to remove two more Lords amendments relating to the necessary/appropriate point. In the eighth contested vote the government won by 320 votes to 305 - a majority of 15 (the smallest of the night). MPs voted to take out the Lords amendment saying ministers should only be able to use certain powers to pass secondary legislation under the bill where it was “necessary”, not where it was “appropriate”. Only two Conservatives voted against the government in the “meaningful vote” division (see 5.44pm): Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry. But five Labour MPs voted with the government: Ronnie Campbell, Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann and Graham Stringer. Dominic Grieve, who led the Tory rebellion over “meaningful vote”, has told the BBC that the trusts Theresa May to deliver on the agreed compromise. But if the government does not deliver, MPs can vote on this again, he says. The government has won its seventh contested vote of the night - and its eighth, if you include the one that went through on the nod. (Or ninth if you include the programme motion.) MPs voted by 326 votes to 301 - a majority of 25 - to take out a Lords amendment that would have removed the power of ministers to decide when retained EU law can be challenged in court. Phillip Lee has tweeted to say that Theresa May has “given her word” that the government will now give parliament a “voice” in the Brexit process. It was worth resigning for, he says. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is now moving his amendment to the bill. This is the government “meaningful vote” one. (See 12.56pm.) It goes through on the nod. This is not the final word on the matter. The compromise announced earlier (see 4.55pm) means this amendment will get beefed up later. Theresa May has won the key vote on giving parliament a “meaningful vote” on Brexit - although only by offering Tory rebels a significant concession. (See 4.55pm.) MPs voted by 324 votes to 298 - a majority of 26 - to reject the amendment passed in the Lords enabling parliament to take charge of the negotiating strategy if MPs voted against the Brexit deal in the autumn. MPs are now voting on the key amendment; it is a motion to take out amendment 19, the Lords “meaningful vote” one tabled by Viscount Hailsham. (See 12.56pm.) The government has won the fifth vote. MPs voted by 328 votes to 297 - a majority of 31 - to take out another Lords amendment relating to the exit day. (It was a Lords amendment taking the date out of the bill; now it is going back in.) This is from Sky’s Faisal Islam. That explains why rebels were seen leaving the chamber towards the end of the debate. See 3.52pm. A Downing Street source said the government has committed to “open discussions” on the Grieve amendment. But the source went on: “We have not said we will accept particular parts of it yet.” But the Tory rebels, I understand, certainly think they have got government backing for 5A and 5B. (See 4.55pm.) Robert Peston, ITV’s political editor, has put a good post about the government concession on his Facebook page. Here is an extract. Arguably this transfers considerable power to MPs over the shape of a future Brexit deal. And it probably means that a no-deal Brexit is no longer any kind of realistic prospect. It means that if May really believes she was able to put negotiating pressure on the rest of the EU by threatening to Brexit without a deal, she has lost that leverage. In other words, one of her favourite catchphrases - that no deal is better than a bad deal - is dead. And that will be official in just a few days, when the bill returns to the Lords. MPs are now voting to remove another Lords amendment on the exit day. The government has won the fourth votes. MPs voted by 324 votes to 302 - a majority of 24 - to reject another Lords amendment on the exit day (ie, to put the exit day back in the bill after it was removed by peers). This is from my colleague Peter Walker. The Green MP Caroline Lucas is complaining about the voting arrangements. She is a longstanding critic of the way parliament works. We are expecting 11 votes in this tranche of voting, Labour whips say. MPs are now voting to remove another exit day amendment. The government has won the third vote. MPs voted to reverse the Lords amendment removing the “exit day” from the bill by 326 votes to 301 - a majority of 25. That means 29 March 2019 is going back in the bill as exit day. We don’t know that the Tory rebels may have been offered in private to persuade them not to vote for the Lords amendment on the “meaningful vote”. (See 4.18pm and 4.22pm.) But some of the negotiation was conducted in public, in the debate, by Robert Buckland, the solicitor general. Buckland implied the government would accept section 5A of the Grieve amendment. He said there was “much merit” in it. He said he would be willing to have a “structured discussion” with rebels on the whole of the Grieve amendment, with a view to accepting some or all of it in a new amendment in the Lords. You can read the whole of the Grieve amendment here (pdf). It is on page five. To summarise, the Grieve amendment says three things should happen if the Commons refused to back the withdrawal agreement in the autumn. Under the government amendment, a minister would already have to come back to the Commons to make a statement about what would happen next. The Grieve amendment says: 1) Within seven days of the statement MPs would have to vote on a motion approving the government’s approach. This is the 5A section. 2) If there is no agreement on Brexit withdrawal by 30 November, the government would have to give MPs the chance to vote on a motion saying what should happen next. This is 5B of the Grieve amendment. 3) If there is no agreement by 15 February 2019, the government have to bring the matter to the Commons within five days. But this vote would be different from the other two, because the government would then have to follow any “direction” given by the Commons in a vote in favour of a resolution. This is 5C in the Grieve amendment. According to sources, the government has accepted that it will implement 5A and 5B, and it has agreed to talk about 5C. The fact that it has not agreed to accept 5C is significant because 5C would be a binding vote. The 5A or 5B votes would not be binding. In theory (at least, from my reading of the amendment) the government could ignore them, just as it does ignore opposition day motions. But the Tory rebels would doubtless argue that in practice such votes would be influential. If the Commons were to reject a Brexit deal, and then MPs were to vote against the government’s revised Brexit strategy, it would be hard to see how the prime minister could continue in office (although to remove her you might need a confidence vote - a different measure, that brings party loyalties into play.) UPDATE: A Downing Street source told the Guardian the government has committed to “open discussions” on the Grieve amendment. But the source went on: “We have not said we will accept particular parts of it yet.” But the Tory rebels, I understand, certainly think they have got government backing for 5A and 5B The government has won the second vote, again rejecting a Lords amendment relating to the sifting committee. It won by 325 votes to 304 - a majority of 21. MPs are now voting for the third time - to take out the Lords amendment taking the “exit date” out of the bill. The government has won the first vote. It has voted down the Lords amendment on the sifting committee by 324 votes to 302 - a majority of 22. It looks as if the government has bought off the rebellion. This is from Sarah Wollaston, another Tory who rebelled with Dominic Grieve in December. MPs are now voting. But the first vote is not on the “meaningful vote” amendment. It is on the Lords amendment relating to the sifting committee. Jonathan Djanogly, one of the 12 Tories who rebelled on the Grieve amendment in December, is speaking now. He says the government amendment does not go far enough. He prefers Greive’s amendment. He was very pleased to hear Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, say the government will consider this, he says. He does not say how he will vote later, but it sounds as if he won’t vote against the government. Labour’s Frank Field is speaking now. He says two thirds of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Robert Buckland intervenes again. He repeats the point about he he will look carefully at amendments tabled in the Lords. Antoinette Sandbach, another Tory who rebelled with Grieve in December, says there has been an “important concession” from the government. Without it, she would have voted for the Lords amendment, she says. Two Tory “rebels” welcome government concession and signal they will not vote for Lords “meaningful vote” amendment. From Sky’s Beth Rigby. John Bercow, the speaker, cuts the time limit for speeches to two minutes. The Lib Dem Tom Brake is speaking now. He says the Lib Dems have tabled an amendment saying the final deal should be put to the people in a referendum. Politico Europe’s Tom McTague has a good tweet-length description of what is at stake with the “meaningful vote” division. From ITV’s Carl Dinnen. Labour’s Stephen Doughty says he was horrified by today’s Sun front page. Those tabloids don’t own patriotism, he says. Mark Harper, the Conservative former chief whip, is speaking now. He says he thinks the third part of the Grieve amendment, 5c, is flawed. It would give the opposite side in the negotiation an incentive to hold up talks, he says. He says the government has offered to bring forward a new amendment in the Lords. That is the best solution, he says. The Labour Brexiter Kate Hoey is speaking now. She says the Lords amendment is designed to ensure the UK does not get a deal from Brussels, so the government has to go back offering further concessions, such as more money. This is from the Yorkshire Post’s Arj Singh. From the Times’ Patrick Kidd. This is from my colleague Jessica Elgot. Lee is still speaking. He says he supports Theresa May’s leadership. But it would be dishonourable to keep quiet, or to criticise the government from within, he says. Phillip Lee, the Conservative who resigned as a justice minister, is speaking now. He says he resigned to help Grieve get his amendment through. He says he has four points to make. First, he says he supports the need to back institutions. When people want something against society’s interests, parliament is there to protect them. That was the case when MPs banned the death penalty even though the people favoured it. Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston both intervene to congratulate Lee. Wollaston says there is no majority in the country for a destructive Brexit. Lee says a choice between bad or worse is not a proper choice. It is not one that parliament should accept. He says the people of his constituency will be affected negatively by Brexit. He needs to speak up on their behalf. He says the Brexit vote in this constituency was not clear cut. Some parts voted for leave, some voted for remain. He says in the future it will be nations with allies that survive. He says he does not think we can turn back the clock. But if Brexit is worth doing, it is worth doing well, he says. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP, says the government should adopt the Grieve amendment. He says he thinks that is probably Robert Buckland’s view in private. And it is probably David Davis, the Brexit secretary’s view, he says. At least it was Davis’s view when he was a backbencher. He says ministers know that the view of the House is. They should accept it. Sir Bill Cash, the Conservative Brexiter, is speaking now. He says the Grieve amendment is not a compromise. In parts it is the same as the Lords amendment, he says. He says people fought and died over the issue of how governs this country. In this case, an act of parliament gave the decision to people in a referendum. George Freeman intervenes. He says he does not accept Cash’s analysis. He says he wants Theresa May to be able to go and negotiate. But what is wrong with the Commons having the ability to tell the government to go back to try again. Cash says the decision to opt for Brexit was taken by the people. The Commons must respect that. This is from Politico Europe’s Tom McTague. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Labour’s Chris Leslie is speaking now. He says the government should accept the Grieve amendment. He says it can go to the Lords, and the government could then amend it there. This is from ITV’s Robert Peston. The Telegraph claims that four more ministers are prepared to resign over Brexit, but not necessarily today. It does not name them, but quotes a source close to Phillip Lee, the minister who resigned this morning. Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, says this bill could be the most important passed by the Commons since the second world war. She says she is being criticised by the Brexiters for rebelling. But they rebelled against the government; Edward Leigh has rebelled 58 times, she says. She says Brexiters are undermining Theresa May. She says she respects Robert Buckland. But he is not the most senior minister, she says. She says if the government wants to avert a rebellion, it should accept the Dominic Grieve amendment. She says the Brexiters are supported “by Russian bots and their dirty money”. Condemning threats to MPs, she says that one pro-remain MP had to attend an event with six undercover armed officers because of death threats. I am getting a little tired of honourable members and right honourable members on the backbenches, in government, even in the cabinet, who come up to me and others in quiet and dark corridors, to British businesses who demand private meetings where they lay bare their despair but refuse to go public, to the commentators who say to me ‘You’re doing a great job, keep on going’ in the face of death threats, which mean that one of our number had to attend a public engagement with six armed undercover police officers. That is the country we have created and it’s got to stop. This is from the BBC’s Mark D’Arcy, one of the most experienced parliament watchers. Labour’s Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, says the “meaningful vote” amendment is the most important one being debated this week. He says all MPs believe in the sovereignty of parliament. To ensure that they have this in the autumn, they need to back the Lords amendment, he says. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general who tabled the rebel amendment for a “meaningful vote” that was passed last December, is speaking now. He says he tabled his new amendment (see 12.56pm) to help David Davis, the Brexit secretary. He complains about the state of the public debate. The irrationality of the debate we are having on the details of Brexit is truly chilling. He says the government is trying to pass hugely complex legislation. But anyone who questions how it might work is denounced by the newspapers. He says there could be a crisis if parliament rejects the deal and there is no fallback. Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, intervenes from the front bench. He offers to meet Grieve tomorrow to discuss a possible compromise. It seems a repeat of the offer David Davis made earlier. (See 1.42pm.) Grieve says this is quite late. Buckland intervenes again. He says there is “much merit’ in clause 5A in the Grieve amendment. Overnight I have read very carefully the amendment that he tabled and I think, for example, with regards to 5a there is much merit in the approach that he urges this House to adopt. Can I say I need more time to think about the other parts of his amendment but by indicating my position on a key part of it, I am indicating that the government is willing to engage positively ahead of the Lords stages. 5A would beef up the government amendment by saying, not only would a minister have to make a statement to MPs after a vote against the withdrawal deal, but also that a minister would have to put a motion to the Commons seeking approval of the government’s approach. Grieve suggests that does not amount to much. He says the idea of having a vote on the government’s position “really isn’t rocket science”. He says 5B and 5C are more important. Buckland intervenes again. He says he will use the Grieve amendment as the basis for a “structured discussion” on what happens next. Someone shouts out “six months” - meaning it has taken six months to get to the stage where the government offers this concession. Grieve says MPs will have to decide what they want. Labour’s Chris Byrant says the government could accept the Lords amendment, and then amend it in the Lords along the lines Buckland suggests. Grieve says that would not be possible. Ken Clarke intervenes. He says other ministers in Buckland’s position would accept the amendment wholesale. He says Buckland cannot do that because of hard Brexiters in government. Grieve says it is foolish to say parliament cannot direct government when negotiating a treaty. Minister offers last-minute concession on the Brexit “meaningful vote” as crunch vote looms. But Dominic Grieve, one of the leading Tory rebels, sounded unimpressed. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking now. The Lib Dems are calling for a referendum on the final deal. He welcomes the fact that Phillip Lee, in his resignation statement (see 10.59am), acknowledged the logic of having a second referendum. Cable says, if people vote to leave in a second referendum, he would accept the result. The Times’ Henry Zeffman has more on what has been happening in the chamber while the speeches have been going on. Richard Harrington, a business minister, has denied reports that he will follow Phillip Lee and resign over Brexit, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Leigh says Ken Clarke had some fun joking about the European commission knowing the Tories are divided. But, he says, if the Lords amendment stands, that would enable the commission to hold up the talks. Clarke intervenes. He says people made this argument in December. But the Commons passed the Grieve “meaningful vote” amendment, and the next day nothing happened. The negotiations were not affected, he says. Sir Edward Leigh, the Conservative Brexiter, is speaking now. He says the Grieve amendment tabled last night (see 12.56pm) just implements the Lords amendment, but in fewer words. If the Lords amendment stands, it will be a “catastrophe” for the government, he says. He says the government’s opponents want to create a situation where the whole process is frustrated. The Commons has already decided to leave the EU, he says. Grant says all the devolved administrations should have a say in the final Brexit deal. He says the contempt shown so far for the Scottish parliament and other devolved bodies has been astonishing. He says, if Scotland is not shown more respect, the government may find that the people of Scotland interpret “take it or leave it” as referring not just to Brexit, but to the whole relationship with the UK. Peter Grant, the SNP’s Europe spokesman, says more time should have been set aside for the debate. He says the UK is heading for dictatorship if people who disagree with the majority view are labelled traitors. And he urges MPs to take the language of violence out of the debate. He says a year ago the Labour MP Jo Cox died. Practically the last words she heard were “death to traitors”. And today someone else has pleaded guilty to plotting to kill an MP. Clarke is still speaking, explaining why he backs the Lords amendment on a meaningful vote. (See 12.56pm.) He says the Lords is not proposing that all 650 MPs have a meeting and decide what to do next. The Lords amendment says the government would have to follow what was set out in a Commons motion. But that motion would be moved by a government minister, he says. He says today’s vote is important for the constitutional position of the Commons. He has never known such a weak parliament, taking orders from the government, as in the timetable motion. (See 2.13pm.) He says all the government amendment is offering is a written statement. There are piles every day, he says. MPs don’t read them. He says the written statement may well end up saying: “House of Commons, get lost.” What does the government say in its amendment that the House should be faced with? Within 28 days, a written statement will be produced amongst the piles of written statements we have every day - and dare I suggest not every member of parliament usually bothers to go through the piles of written statements? What’s a written statement going to say? It could say: ‘Well in that case there’s no deal, we’re leaving.’ It could say: ‘Well we’re going to do this and that’s it, that’s the end of the parliamentary process.’ It might as well say: ‘Oh House of Commons, get lost.’ And that is a wholly inadequate response to the votes we had before parliament. And he says the argument that keeping the Lords amendment would undermine the prime minister is “ridiculous”. It is based on the theory that in the continent they don’t know there are divisions in the cabinet. This generates some solid laughter. He says on the continent people are bemused by the British. Other EU governments have to get the approval of their parliaments for Brexit. Today’s debate is just an attempt by “zealots” to stop this parliament having a say. He says he will vote for the Lords amendment. He hopes the government regrets trying to block it. This is from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh. Ken Clarke, the father of the Commons and veteran Conservative pro-European, is speaking now. Clarke has already rebelled once today. According to the Press Association, he and Anna Soubry rebelled over the programme motion. They were cancelled out by two Labour MPs, Kate Hoey and Frank Field, who voted with the government. Matthew Pennycook is still speaking. He says the new David Davis amendment (see 12.56pm) does not go much beyond what the government promised in December. Labour’s John Mann says Labour voters in the Midlands and the north do not want to see the Brexit negotiation carried out by 650 members of parliament. How will Labour explain to them that the unelected Lords will overturn the Commons and the refererndum. Pennycook says this is about the Lords saying MPs should take control if there is no deal. He says a ‘take it or leave it’ vote cannot be said in any sense to be genuinely meaningful. He says MPs backing the Lords “meaningful vote” amendment are not trying to block Brexit. More from the Times’ Henry Zeffman. He is watching the debate from the press gallery, and so can see things no visible to people watching the TV coverage. George Freeman also tweeted this about Phillip Lee earlier. The Conservative MP George Freeman says he could rebel over the “meaningful vote” issue. In the December vote on the Grieve amendment, Freeman said he would support it but changed his mind at the last moment after hearing a government concession of sorts. Antoinette Sandbach, the Conservative pro-European who was one of the 12 Tories who rebelled on the Grieve amendment on the “meaningful vote” in December, posted this on Twitter earlier. These are from the Times’ Henry Zeffman Julian Smith, of course, is the Conservative chief whip. And this is from the Labour MP Stephen Doughty. Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, is speaking now. Labour’s Graham Stringer, a Euroceptic, intervenes. He accuses the Lords of going way beyond their constitutional role and suggests they are trying to block Brexit. Pennycook does not accept this. Davis says the Hailsham amendment would represent a profound shift in constitutional practice. He quotes from the Bogdanor article again. Stephen Hammond, a Conservative pro-European, asks what would happen under Davis’s new amendment if there were no deal. Davis says ministers would come back to the House. The House would have the chance to respond. Dominic Grieve intervenes. He says the government has not made provision for no deal. He says his amendment provides a mechanism for addressing what would happen if there were no deal. He says he does not think the bill can get royal assent until it has a provision explaining what would happen if the government tried to leave with no deal. Davis says he has not had much time to study the Grieve amendment. He is happy to have a conversation about this, he says. But three principles must be kept in mind. 1) They must not undermine the government’s negotiating postion. 2) They should not undermine the principle that the government, not parliament, negotiates treaties. 3) They must respect the result of the referendum. First, we must never do anything that undermines the government’s negotiating position or encourages delays in the negotiations. Secondly, we cannot change the fundamental constitutional structure which makes the government responsible for international relations and international treaties. Thirdly, we must under all circumstances respect the result of the referendum. That’s what this House voted on article 50. He says he is happy to meet Grieve to discuss potential solutions, provided these three principles are observered. Davis sets out three conditions that any new “meaningful vote” amendment would have to meet. He winds up urging MPs to back the government. Davis is now talking about the “meaningful vote” issue. (See 12.56pm.) He says a peer described the Hailsham amendment as a no Brexit one. He quotes from the article Vernon Bogdanor, the constitutional expert, wrote at the weekend. Bogdanor wrote: More fundamentally, the Hailsham amendment would substitute parliament for government in the negotiating process. If parliament refused to approve the agreement, it would require the government to return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. That is a constitutional absurdity. Parliament’s role is to scrutinise legislation and policy; 650 MPs, still less 800 peers, cannot themselves negotiate. Davis says it has always been accepted that the government negotiates treaties. That was the case when the Maastricht treaty or the Amsterdam treaty or the Lisbon treaty were being considered by parliament. What [the Lords amendment] actually amounts to is an unconstitutional shift which risks undermining our negotiations with the European Union. Labour’s Frank Field says, if the Lords amendment stands, the government will be going naked into the negotiating chamber. Davis says the European commission reads all British papers, especially the Financial Times and the Times. And they believe them, he says. He says the Europeans do not want the UK to leave. He summarises the Hailsham amendment (pdf). Davis says people who talk about a meaningful vote want to reverse the result of the referendum. Davis is now talking about delegated powers. He refers to a Lords amendment saying ministers should only used delegated powers when “necessary”, not when “appropriate”. He says in practice it may be necessary for ministers to use these power when they are appropriate. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry intervenes. She says the government is going back on pledge made when the legislation was proposed. Davis says the Lords amendment could prevent ministers making sensible changes to regulations. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and a leading pro-European, says he does not agree. Davis says Grieve is a very good lawyer. But other lawyers disagree. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, and a laywer, says appropriate could mean anything. Ministers could use it to change laws in almost any circumstances. He says, with “appropriate” at the test, minsters could not be challenged in court. Davis says Clarke is a good friend. They were able to have lunch together for two hours without discussing Brexit. But he says he disagrees on this. Davis is now talking about the Lords amendment removing the amendment introduced by the government in the Commons putting the Brexit “exit day” in the bill. He says the Commons had already reached “a sensible position” on this matter. The government will stick to it. Davis says the government has improved the bill in a number of areas. He is going to address the main issues addressed the amendments in the group being discussed today. First, there were amendments to the “sifting committee” (a committee being set up to decide what pieces of secondary legislation introduced under the bill get put to a full vote in the Commons.) Davis says the Lords amendments would make it harder for ministers to use secondary legislation. He says he knows the Lords want to improve the bill. Their changes can seem sensible in isolation. But their cumulative affect is damaging, he says. I understand that the House of Lords wants to improve the bill in various ways, and each of some of their changes individually can seem sensible and proportionate when seen in isolation, but the cumulative effect of these changes can sometimes make it impossible to deliver the smooth and orderly exit we want. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is opening the debate now. He says more than 1,000 non-government amendments have been debated, and hundreds of government ones. Today they are debating the Lords ones. He says, when amendments have been made undermining the purpose of the bill, or undermining Brexit, the government will reject them. The programme motion has passed by 321 votes to 304 - a majority of 17. Both of Theresa May’s mooted customs plans are very unlikely to be accepted, meaning that the Brexit process is heading for a “major crunch”, according to Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former chief diplomat to the EU. Appearing before the Commons home affairs committee, Rogers – who stepped down from the role in January 2017 and has since then regularly expressed sceptical views on the Brexit process – also warned how extraordinarily complex it would be to leave the EU, saying people must realise it was a process of many stages. Quizzed about the two customs plans, the so-called max fac and the customs partnership, Rogers said both seemed implausible. On max fac he said: Max fac doesn’t solve the problem as other see it, so they don’t understand why max fac is on the table at all. However facilitated the border, it’s still a border, and still demonstrably different from what we’ve got now. So I don’t think you’ll ever get max fac agreed, personally. On the customs partnership he said: It’s complex, to put it mildly. We don’t know whether the technology could be devised. It certainly doesn’t exist at the moment. It involves us operating as a third country power, policing the external border of the European Union, and then an extraordinarily elaborate machinery for remitting back to importers the difference between what our tariff rates have become once we use our sovereign trade policy and what the EU [does]. If you were confronted by that from the other side of the table, and that were Europeans putting it to us and saying, could we police your external border of your external customs union, and operate that, I can imagine what the UK systems answer would be. After the customs partnership idea had been submitted by the UK, Rogers said, the EU had asked “five killer questions” on how it would work, and received no answer. He continued: If they’re in that position and saying neither max fac nor new customs partnership is a runner then, you know, you don’t need to be in my shoes to say we’re heading for a major crunch. On the sheer complexity of Brexit, Rogers told MPs: That’s not messing up Brexit or undermining it or reversing it, or anything. It’s saying: you’ve got a huge number of areas where you’re extricating yourself from the existing relationship and the existing acquis [body of EU law], which is thousands and thousands and thousands of pages long. And then you’re developing, over time, some immediately some less immediately, a different relationship which the EU where some bits you like … and there are other areas where you may want autonomy and divergence, and quite radical divergence over time, but you may not be able to assess in the next couple of years how radical. This is a revolutionary system change. If you take Brexit seriously, which I do, you can;’t say, we can do all that in a jiffy. It’s not going to happen. He added: “That’s not obstructive to say that, it’s just to say all of this is going to be bloody difficult to do.” This would, he said, require a series of stages of exit. Rogers said that while he did not see membership of the EEA - the so-called Norway model – as a good long-term answer, it could be “a perch for a number of years where you got some of the freedoms and sovereignty that you would want”.He added: I’ve always seen an EEA model as implausible as the medium/longer term destination, but not necessarily inconceivable as a short-term transition chamber route out of the EU. Here is the Commons library briefing (pdf) explaining all the Lords amendments that MPs will be voting on this afternoon. And here is a shorter guide from my colleague Peter Walker. There will be two sets of votes this afternoon - at 4.15pm and at 7.15pm. The vote on the “meaningful vote” amendment or amendments (see 12.56pm) will come in the first tranche of voting. MPs are now starting the debate on the EU withdrawal bill. First they have to agree the programme motion setting out the timetable for the debate - six hours today and six hours tomorrow. There has been an objection, and so it is being put to a vote. The key vote this afternoon will be on what is being described as the “meaningful vote” issue. This refers to the vote that parliament will have on the Brexit withdrawal agreement if, as planned, it is agreed in the autumn. But the term “meaningful vote” is not particularly helpful because there are at least five versions of what this might entail. Here is a quick summary. 1 - The government version - “take it or leave it”. Originally Theresa May resisted offering MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal, and she only confirmed that there would be one in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017. The government firmed up the commitment when the article 50 bill was going through parliament, and gave an even more precise commitment in a written statement in December. Ministers do not accept that this is a meaningless offer; MPs will be able to say no. But if they do say no, the UK will leave the EU without a deal, which is why critics say this would not amount to a meaningful vote. 2 - The Dominic Grieve version from December - limiting the powers ministers will have to implement Brexit until MPs have passed legislation. This is the amendment passed by MPs, against the wishes of the government, in December. The government was defeated by a majority of 4 after 12 Tories rebelled. At the time this was widely reported as a “meaningful vote” amendment. But actually what it was really about was preventing ministers using powers in the EU withdrawal bill to implement Brexit until an EU withdrawal and implementation bill has been passed. 3 - The Lords version - enabling parliament to take charge if the withdrawal deal is not passed. This amendment, tabled by the Conservative former cabinet minister Viscount Hailsham (better known as Douglas Hogg) was passed by peers in April by a majority of 91. The wording is complicated (pdf), but essentially it says that if MPs do not pass a resolution backing the deal agreed by the government, the government is obliged to follow “any direction” in future Brexit talks set out in a resolution passed by the Commons. That means, if MPs were to vote down the deal but vote in favour of a resolution telling ministers to go back to Brussels and try a different approach, ministers would have to obey. This is the version the government wants to vote down today. 4 - The government compromise - a ministerial statement after a no vote. In an attempt to avert defeat, the government has tabled a compromise amendment to be debated today. It is amendment 19 (a), on the order paper here (pdf). It is quite long, and gives details of documents the government will publish before the autumn vote, but essentially it does not alter the fact that a vote against the deal would not stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The key new commitment is that, if MPs were to vote no, a minister would come back to the Commons within 28 days to say what would happen next. Since the answer could be “not much”, it is not seen as a significant concession. 5 - The latest Grieve proposal - enabling parliament to take charge at the last moment. This is the amendment tabled last night, and it is an amendment to Davis’s amendment. It says if there is no agreement by 30 November, there must be a vote on what happens next. And if there is no agreement by 15 February 2019, the government would be bound to follow any “direction” given by MPs in a resolution passed by the Commons. In the Commons Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, has just raised a point of order. She said that, to her personal knowledge, at least one MP was not voting as they wanted to because of threats to them, their staff and their family. To my knowledge at least one honourable member on these benches will today and tomorrow not vote in accordance with their conscience because of threats to their personal safety, to members of their parliamentary staff and members of their family. John Bercow, the speaker, said no MP should be subject to threats. Any MP subject to threats should take appropriate action, he said. Soubry claims at least one MP will not vote as they want on Brexit bill because of threats. Number 10 did not have much to say about the Phillip Lee resignation at the Downing Street lobby briefing, BuzzFeed’s Emily Ashton reports. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is picking up suggestions the government will lose the vote on the “meaningful vote”. Dr Phillip Lee may not be a household name, but his decision to quit as a minister so he can vote against the government on Tuesday could have far-reaching consequences. His focus, in particular, on the meaningful vote amendment, already on a knife-edge for the government, has given the Tory whips an even bigger headache than they were already facing. By standing down ahead of the first votes on Theresa May’s painstakingly crafted and much amended Brexit bill, he will have, deliberately or not, put the screws on any wavering backbenchers who might be having second thoughts about rebelling. Most of the original eleven rebels on the meaningful vote amendment, led by Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, have indicated that they will stand firm. One told the Guardian that at least a couple of other MPs were considering joining the rebel alliance. As ever in this parliament, every vote matters. Despite offering last-minute concessions to rebels, May lost on the original meaningful vote amendment back in December by 309 to 305 votes. With Labour saying it has rallied all but its most pro-Brexit MPs behind it, the result will again come down to the wire. Tory party insiders insist that Lee is “not trying to cause an avalanche” and he is more concerned about the principle of giving parliament a meaningful vote over the final Brexit deal. In his resignation statement he claimed “I would find it hard to live with myself afterwards if I let it pass”. But actions have consequences, and some of those on the Tory benches who share his views, particularly those without the responsibility of a ministerial role, will now feel emboldened. A defeat would be yet another blow to May’s authority. It would also undermine her negotiating clout with Brussels, if a combination of Tory rebels and the opposition could together inflict such a serious defeat. The MP’s departure is also a personal blow for the prime minister. Lee was part of her leadership team and a constituency neighbour. One MP even describes them as “friends”. May doesn’t have many in the party, and although Lee says she remains the best person to lead the country at this time, he adds that “more strength, vision and integrity” is needed. Last night, Lee attended the ‘22 committee of Tory backbenchers, where May attempted to unify the party ahead of the crucial votes with a plea not to vote against the government on the withdrawal bill. Today, the party stands more divided on Brexit than ever. ITV’s Robert Peston thinks the Phillip Lee resignation could presage a Tory split. Mmm. Not so sure about that. Lee is resigning as a minister, not from the party. And in his resignation statement he goes out of his way to praise Theresa May’s leadership. (See 10.59am.) People have been predicting a Conservative party split over Europe for ages, and when Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless defected to Ukip, it looked as though that might have been the start of a proper break-up. But it wasn’t. What’s extraordinary about the Conservative party is how its held together. That’s party because the pro-Europeans have been marginalised. It is not predominantly a pro-Brexit party. These are from the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope. If you want a break from Brexit for a moment, my colleague Alex Hern is covering Arron Banks’ appearance at the Commons culture committee on a separate live blog. This is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has written a blog about the Phillip Lee resignation. She says he is “categorically not the only Tory MP among the younger ranks who is upset and irritated by how the government is handling Brexit.” Opposition MPs have praised Phillip Lee for his decision to resign. From Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader From the Labour MP Chuka Umunna From Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary From the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake The Conservative MP Nick Boles has used a tweet on Phillip Lee’s resignation to make none-too-subtle jibe about David Davis, the Brexit secretary. Here are the main points from Phillip Lee’s resignation statement. Lee says that he is resigning today so that he can vote in favour of the Lords “meaningful vote” amendment. We should ... empower our parliament so that its role is not limited to making fake choices – such as between a ‘bad deal’ and a cliff-edge ‘no deal’. Our Parliament should be able to direct our Government to change course in our interests. In all conscience, I cannot support the Government’s decision to oppose this amendment because doing so breaches such fundamental principles of human rights and parliamentary sovereignty. A vote between bad and worse is not a meaningful vote. And I cannot bring myself to vote for it in the bastion of liberty, freedom and human rights that is our parliament. Lee does not talk about other EU withdrawal bill amendments, and so it is not clear if he will rebel on other amendments, or just this one. He says the government is heading for a Brexit outcome that “will be neither fully to leave the EU, nor fully to stay”. The outcome that is emerging will be neither fully to leave the EU, nor fully to stay. This is not an outcome for which anyone knowingly voted. In my view, this raises the important principle of legitimacy. Lee voted remain, but his critique is increasingly shared by leading Brexiters. For example, Boris Johnson (here), Daniel Hannan (here) and Nigel Farage (here) have all said much the same in recent days. He calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. This is significant because so far parliamentary support for a second referendum has been very limited. (Only around 40 MPs are said to be in favour.) A referendum is probably the only mechanism that would enable Brexit to be stopped. He calls for article 50 to be paused or revoked so that Brexit can be delayed. We should recognise that the UK and EU are not ready for Brexit and pause, extend or revoke Article 50 so that we do not leave before we are ready. The government has repeatedly ruled this out. But experts say article 50 could be revoked, and the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, floated this very idea only last night. (See 9.30am.) Lee floats the idea of renegotiating EU membership, or single market rules, implying that this could result in the UK staying in. We should ... re-engage with our European and international friends to talk about how to achieve the aims that we share for the future in ways that respect individual countries’ interests and sovereignty. Since 2016, electorates in many countries across Europe have expressed similar concerns to those that we expressed in the referendum and so much is changing, and will continue to change, across the whole of our continent. There is little support for this idea in parliament, but Tony Blair (here) and Gordon Brown (here) have both made similar arguments. Lee says employers in his Bracknell constituency have told him Brexit will be bad for business. As a member of parliament, I also have a major responsibility to my constituency of Bracknell. In extensive consultations with local employers, both large and small, I have been warned that they expect Brexit as it is currently being pursued, whatever the negotiated settlement, will damage their business. I have spoken to people, many of whom have lived, worked and raised their family here, whose fears for their futures I am not always able to allay. Regrettably, it seems inevitable that the people, economy and culture of my constituency will be affected negatively, and I cannot ignore that it is to them that I owe my first responsibility. According to an analysis (pdf) by the academic Chris Hanretty, Bracknell voters backed Brexit in the EU referendum by 53% to 47%, making it marginally more pro-Brexit than the UK average. Lee says he has found it “virtually impossible” to change Brexit policy in government. (That is not very surprising. He was a junior minister in a department, justice, with little purchase on Brexit policy.) He stresses he supports Theresa May and still thinks she is the best person to lead the country. I strongly supported Theresa May’s bid to lead the Conservative Party in 2016. I have great respect for her and still believe that she is the best person to lead the country at this exceptionally difficult time. This goes some way toward quashing claims that pro-European Tory rebels are a threat to her leadership. (Lee is implying he would vote against May on the EU withdrawal bill, but in support of her in a confidence vote on her leadership of the party.) He says Brexit is turning out to be more complicated than people claimed in the referendum. The practicalities, logistics and implications of leaving the EU are far more complex than was ever envisaged and certainly more complex than the people were told in 2016. The UK is not going to be ready in time, neither is the EU, and both would suffer from a rushed or fudged agreement. He implicitly accuses the leave campaign in 2016 of peddling “dreams and dogma”, not plans “rooted in reality and evidence.” He stresses that he is resigning after “a great deal of personal reflection” and discussion with friends and trusted colleagues. But he does not say if he had warned the whips, or Downing Street, of what he was planning He twice stresses his medical background (he is a GP) when explaining his decision. For example, he says: In my medical experience, if a course of treatment is not working, then I review it. I also have a duty to get my patient’s informed consent for that action. People tend to trust GPs, at least more than MPs. Another Tory pro-European rebel, Sarah Wollaston, is a GP, as is the leading Brexiter and international trade secretary, Liam Fox. Responding to Lee’s resignation, a Downing Street source said: We will get a good deal that works for everybody in the UK. The government’s amendment today provides for a meaningful vote. Phillip Lee, who resigned as a justice minister today so that he can speak out against the government’s Brexit policy. More from Phillip Lee on Twitter. Phillip Lee has posted more about his resignation on Twitter. Lee calls for referendum on final Brexit deal. Here is the full text of Phillip Lee’s resignation statement. Here is Lee’s tweet. Philip Lee, a remain-supporting justice minister, has resigned from the government to speak out against the government’s policy on Brexit. In a tweet he said he was “incredibly sad” to resign but felt he had to to “better speak up for my constituents and country over how Brexit is currently being delivered.” Another big parliamentary challenge for Brexit is coming this afternoon, but Theresa May will be more optimistic than might have been expected a few weeks ago, when the House of Lords was merrily rewriting her EU withdrawal bill to give it much more of a remain flavour and the prospect of all those defeats being overturned in the Commons seemed uncertain. The bill is now back in the Commons, with 15 amendments added against the government’s wishes. The government is going to accept one of them (an almost entirely tokenistic one, saying the UK will be able to choose to stay in EU agencies after Brexit) but on the others it is offering compromises (on three), or planning to simply vote down what the Lords was proposing. Last week Labour was looking forward to “a whole catalogue of victories against the government” during the two-day debate starting today. But it seems that some potential Tory rebels have been won over by the argument that they should not undermine May’s negotiating position and now it looks as though the only really tricky vote for the government will be the one this afternoon on whether or not parliament should have a “meaningful vote” on the final withdrawal agreement. There have been a series of developments overnight. Here are the key ones. The leading Conservative pro-Europe rebel Dominic Grieve has tabled an 11th-hour compromise amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, calling on the government to back his bid to prevent a “no-deal” Brexit in order to avoid defeat in the Commons. Here is the text. Downing Street has said it will not back the Grieve compromise. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Leading Conservatives remainers and leavers have united to propose a new amendment on customs, intended as a compromise measure designed to avert the debate about whether the UK should seek to remain in a custom union with the EU until a later date. Here is the amendment. On the Today programme Sir Oliver Letwin, the former cabinet minister who is one of the signatories to the amendment admitted that this was just about delaying the divisive vote. Asked if the amendment just “just kicked the can down the road”, he replied: That is a very sensible thing to do. If you are engaged in trying to sort something which is complicated out, it makes sense to do it when you know what the thing that you are debating looks like. Jeremy Corbyn has defended Labour’s decision not to back the Lords amendment saying the UK should stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) - the so-called Norway option that would keep the UK in the single market. In a post on Facebook this morning he said: The Norway model does not reflect the needs of the much larger British economy. It would mean taking rules from Brussels, but having no role in making them. It would not deliver the comprehensive new UK-EU customs union we want to negotiate. Nor would it meet our commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland. We cannot settle for this. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has floated the possibility of delaying Brexit. In an interview with Irish broadcaster TV3, he said: You’ll know that there are a number of different scenarios that could arise if we’re in a no-deal situation. For example, it is possible to extend Article 50, to allow more time for negotiations to take place. There is the possibility of an interim deal, or a transition period, pending an outcome or final negotiations around the transition period. Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt has reported that May is expected to endorse the “max fac”, or “maximum facilitation”, plan for customs after Brexit, not the alternative “new customs partnership” proposal that she originally favoured. Pro-Brexit tabloid papers have claimed that MPs will be betraying Brexit if they vote against the government today. Here is the Sun splash. And here is the Daily Express. Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s guide to all the Lords amendments the government is trying to reverse. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 10.30am: Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former ambassador to the EU, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about post-Brexit immigration policy. 10.30am: Arron Banks, the Leave.EU founder, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee. We will be covering the hearing on a separate live blog. After 12.45pm: MPs begin debating the Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill. The first round of votes, including divisions on the “meaningful vote”, will come three hours after the debate starts. There will then be further votes six hours after the start of the debate. Mostly today I will be focusing on the debate, but I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard.

Make mental healthcare more affordable","bodyText":"The recent deaths by suicide of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain have caused an outpouring of shock and grief on social media, and naturally raise questions as to how we can better support people with a mental illness at risk of self-harm. While sharing advice like “reach out to your friends and family” and “seek medical help” is undoubtedly positive, actually “getting help” in the Australian healthcare system can be both difficult to achieve, and very expensive. If you have a Medicare card, visit a GP and present with signs of a mental health condition and/or disorder, your GP can set you up with a mental healthcare plan which consists of 10 subsidised psychology sessions per year. For some people, 10 sessions a year is enough to talk through personal issues and work on developing effective coping strategies. For others with more complex or severe conditions or histories of trauma, 10 sessions barely scratch the surface. As a survivor of family violence (which we know is at epidemic proportions in this country), I have done years of work with various psychologists, and a great proportion has been paid for out of my pocket. The gap for psychology sessions tends to be anywhere from $40 to $100, depending on the charges of the psychologist or practice. Psychiatrists, unlike psychologists, are able to prescribe psychiatric medications. An initial consultation with a psychiatrist is around $360, with a Medicare rebate of $220, which leaves a gap of around $140. It generally takes a psychiatrist three 45-60 minute sessions to diagnose a patient and set up a treatment plan. This means the patient will be a minimum of $400 out of pocket before they are able to even start medication or treatment. The gap for psychiatry varies, but is around $67 for a half hour appointment and $114 for an hour. Once you have spent $460 on the gap as an individual or as a family, you reach the Medicare safety net and receive back 100% of the scheduled Medicare fee for that particular service. However, this fee doesn’t necessarily match what the medical specialist charges, and Medicare fees notoriously haven’t kept up with inflation, which has left patients increasingly out of pocket. It also has to be noted, that a patient needs to pay for the session before they get the Medicare rebate. What this means is that if you don’t have $360, for example, to pay the psychiatrist upfront, you can’t go to the appointment. If you can’t afford to access assistance in the private sector, you will have to go through the public system, which is overloaded and can barely handle those who are at crisis level, let alone provide preventative care. The tragic story of Naomi Watson-Ley exemplifies this – she took her own life only days after being discharged from the psychiatric ward of a hospital. Seeking treatment takes time. If you need to take time off to go to the psychologist or psychiatrist (or both), that’s time that you won’t be able to work and make money. It’s not hard to see why people just try and “push through” only to end up more exhausted and sick than ever. How many employers are happy for someone to take several hours off every week or fortnight to go to medical appointments? How many employees are comfortable sharing this kind of information with employers? Seeking treatment can also be risky, because to open up and be vulnerable in front of a stranger (even if they are a medical professional) takes an enormous amount of courage and isn’t always a safe option. Many marginalised people (such as people of colour, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, LGBTIQA+ people and sex workers) won’t know if a specialist is bigoted or holds prejudicial ideas about the group they belong to, until they have opened up to them in the session. Bad experiences beget a distrust of the system in general, and discourage individuals from seeking further assistance in the future. It comes as no surprise that those who are the most marginalised in our society, who are the least able to afford or access expensive psychiatric treatment, are also disproportionately affected by social issues that are likely to exacerbate stress and worsen mental health. Housing instability, unemployment (or underemployment) and financial pressure all cause stress that contributes towards making people feel worse about themselves and their future. Steps towards making our society more equal would help to improve the mental health of those most vulnerable. Telling individuals with mental health conditions and/or disorders to “get help” is easy. Changing the system to better serve the diverse Australian population is much harder. None of the answers to these questions are easily solved, but what begs understanding is that “seeking help” is only possible when the services are available and accessible for everyone. We need to care more about mentally ill people when they are alive, and not only after they have taken their lives. • Adele Perovic is an actor and journalist based in Brisbane In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

A ceremony at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Tuesday, which took place while the landmark summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore had the world’s attention, was attended by a delegation from Washington that included Marie Royce, the US assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs. Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, several Taiwanese government officials as well as legislators were also present. During the ceremony, US ambassador James Moriarty and Royce reiterated Washington’s commitment to uphold the relationship with Taiwan, calling the new facility “a symbol of strength and vibrancy of the US and Taiwan partnership in the 21st century”. “AIT’s new home is a tangible symbol that reflects the strength of our ties,” said Royce. “It’s a state-of-the-art facility that will make possible even greater cooperation for many years to come.” The ceremony comes at a time when bilateral relations between Beijing and Washington have been severely tested over ongoing trade negotiations and rising tensions in the disputed South China Sea. China has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan since the election in 2016, blocking the self-ruled island from participating in international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and poaching its diplomatic allies. Beijing has also increased the frequency of military exercises in the last few months, including deploying its own aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, in the Taiwan Strait. On Monday night, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times published an editorial, suggesting Beijing should warn the US and Taiwan of possible consequences for any provocative move. “We must draw a red line for the US and Taiwan,” Global Times said through the editorial. “Once crossed, a serious Taiwan Straits crisis will be triggered.” Despite media speculation that Trump would send the new national security advisor John Bolton to the ceremony, the US president exercised restrain. Kharis Templeman, a social science research associate at Stanford University’s Walter H. Shorenstein Asia Pacific research center, said that given the delicate nature of the summit in Singapore, the Trump administration may have chosen not to use the occasion to make a strong symbolic statement. However, Templeman suggested the ceremony should not be interpreted as revealing the Trump administration’s Taiwan policy in general. “High-level visits can be arranged at any time, not just when AIT inaugurates a new building,” Templeman told the Guardian. “Any US administration would have made a similar set of statements at the official opening.” The American Institute in Taiwan is not an official embassy, but a non-profit institution established by the US government to represent its interests since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979 under the One China policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/guardian-australia-writers-pick-their-socceroos-world-cup-starting-xis","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T18:00:07Z","webTitle":"Guardian Australia writers pick their Socceroos World Cup starting XIs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/guardian-australia-writers-pick-their-socceroos-world-cup-starting-xis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/guardian-australia-writers-pick-their-socceroos-world-cup-starting-xis","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Australia writers pick their Socceroos World Cup starting XIs","bodyText":"Jonathan Howcroft: My XI is based on the understanding we’re not trying to reinvent Bert van Marwijk’s gameplan – one based on Australia defending in a compact block without the ball and maximising rapid transitions with it. To the side we’ve seen start the recent couple of friendlies I’d make two changes, these are based on my belief good results have papered over defensive cracks that better opponents are likelier to expose. I’d bring in Matt Jurman ahead of Mark Milligan in a straight swap and I’d find room for Mile Jedinak in midfield. Including Jedinak’s experience and leadership means one of Australia’s big names has to miss out and in my XI Aaron Mooy’s distribution and Massimo Luongo’s energy would get the nod ahead of Tom Rogić. As undoubtedly brilliant as Rogić is he is somewhat of a luxury in this reactive set-up. Against the Czechs and Hungary he struggled to find the ball so presuming Australia have even less meaningful possession against France his value diminishes further. With Jedinak anchoring I’d expect Aaron Mooy and Massimo Luongo to bolster the few attacks Australia are likely to have. I’d also look to Rogić, Daniel Arzani and Tim Cahill as three contrasting tempo-changing weapons on the bench to be factored into the 90-minute strategy. 4-3-3: Ryan; Risdon, Sainsbury, Jurman, Behich; Luongo, Jedinak, Mooy; Leckie, Nabbout, Kruse Richard Parkin: To presume to defend against a team with the attacking qualities of France is to invite slaughter. So the Socceroos’ best chance is to name the most industrious and hard-working XI they can find, to pack the midfield, to contest possession higher up the pitch and to not allow their more-fancied opponents any time on the ball. Acclaimed as two players in one when Leicester won the Premier League, N’Golo Kante cannot be allowed to play forward without risk, nor can Paul Pogba or Blaise Matuidi be allowed to effortlessly join the attack. While Tom Rogić is Australia’s most gifted attacking outlet the necessity for work-rate makes him the necessary sacrifice (although a 70thminute cameo could prove decisive). Nominally a 4-3-3, in attack I’d ask a duel role of Mile Jedinak stepping into midfield to create a 3-4-3/3-2-2-3, with Mooy anchoring the base alongside him (or Milligan if there’s any fitness/pace concerns surrounding the skipper), and in defence, Dimitri Petratos would drop centrally so that both he and Jackson Irvine could harry Kante, and ensure there’s never less than four buzzing full-tilt around the engine room. I’m a Tomi Juric fan, but unless well-supported he can get isolated or frustrated; the interchangeability of Andrew Nabbout and Dimitri Petratos gets them the nod; at least to start, and then to work, work, work. 4-3-3: Ryan; Risdon, Jedinak, Sainsbury, Behich; Mooy, Luongo, Irvine; Petratos, Leckie, Nabbout Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Mike Ticher: The first priority is not to give up cheap possession, and Mark Milligan’s performance against Hungary did nothing to reassure on that count. It’s a risk to start Matthew Jurman without having played in any of the friendlies, but of all the potential centre-back partnerships he and Trent Sainsbury look the most solid. The second is to stay compact in front of defence, so Mile Jedinak makes it instead of an unlucky Massimo Luongo. The third is to have energy everywhere and put as much pressure as possible on N’Golo Kante and Paul Pogba, which means Jackson Irvine instead of Tom Rogić, and Andrew Nabbout instead of Tomi Jurić – especially if Jurić is not fully fit. Rogić has flickered too rarely regardless of formation, and this midfield three finished the Hungary game looking much more coherent in defence and attack. Leaving out Luongo and Rogić leaves the team short on inspiration, so I would take a chance on Daniel Arzani. Robbie Kruse doesn’t deserve the abuse he has got from some fans, but he’s offered an increasingly feeble goal threat (one goal in 25 internationals), and poor options from good crossing positions. If France have a weakness it’s at the back and, recently, in goal. Arzani gives the Socceroos the best chance of giving them something unexpected to think about. 4-3-3: Ryan; Risdon, Sainsbury, Jurman, Behich; Jedinak, Mooy, Irvine; Leckie, Nabbout, Arzani Kieran Pender: Mat Ryan is the settled first choice keeper, and deservedly so. Mark Milligan has been a loyal servant for the national team but was exposed against Hungary and is at risk of a poor showing against France; Trent Sainsbury and Milos Degenek with Josh Risdon and James Meredith on the flanks would be my preferred defensive unit. Mile Jedinak provides a steadying influence at the base of the midfield – as much was clear after he was brought on against Hungary. Tom Rogić and Aaron Mooy pose the Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard dilemma of our time: Australia’s two best players but as yet unable to gel. If Australia are going to beat France, Denmark or Peru, their quality will be desperately needed. Better to die trying? Against an attacking French side, though, Jackson Irvine might be a safer option than Rogić. Mathew Leckie and Robbie Kruse are the obvious selections out wide – Daniel Arzani is too inexperienced to start. Bert van Marwijk has opted for a lone striker in all four matches of his Socceroos tenure to date, and there are no signs that will change. While Andrew Nabbout is the apparent first-choice, in my view Jamie Maclaren is the better selection. Maclaren has been in fine form since a loan move to Hibernian from Darmstadt 98, bagging eight goals in 15 matches. 4-2-3-1: Ryan; Risdon, Degenek, Sainsbury, Meredith; Jedinak, Mooy; Leckie, Rogić, Kruse; Maclaren Ante Jukic: Let me just preface by explaining this XI is with the squad and Bert van Marwijk’s tactical plan in context. To expand on Monday’s piece, I’ll start with the midfield. Jackson Irvine and Massimo Luongo arguably turned in their best Socceroos performances in recent times, as the central midfield pairing against Chile at last year’s Confederations Cup. The fact Australia pressed higher up the park in that match with Chile dominating possession makes it even more relevant for France, given Van Marwijk’s 4-4-1-1 formation in defence and preference for deeper pressing zones. For mine, Luongo is Australia’s best two-way midfielder and although he is deployed higher up the park, playing the screener is arguably Irvine’s natural role. Meanwhile, I’d be wary of Aaron Mooy and Mile Jedinak’s recovery pace against a dynamite French team in transition. Les Bleus can be numb with a defence in their own half, though, and Jedinak is a very good organiser. I would have him next to Sainsbury, who’s a non-negotiable along with Mat Leckie and Mat Ryan. Risdon and Behich are the Socceroos’ only viable options with the squad selected and Andrew Nabbout’s pace up top suits the counter with Rogić tying attacking movement together. Robbie Kruse is pivotal and though I would very much be tempted to start him, Daniel Arzani might be more effective as the first substitute in chasing the game. 4-2-3-1: Ryan; Risdon, Sainsbury, Jedinak, Behich; Irvine, Luongo; Leckie, Rogić, Kruse; Nabbout John Davidson: Australia have a mountain to climb in their 2018 World Cup opener against France. A heavy loss in the first group game would likely spell disaster for the Socceroos, like it did in South Africa in 2010 and in Brazil in 2014. So the best bet for the green and gold is to be compact and organised against Les Bleus, with a draw or even a 1-0 loss a valuable result. In that vein, I would go with a 4-1-4-1 formation that tries to create width on the flanks and is hard to break down. When the ball is won, breaking effectively and quickly is the best way to catch Didier Deschamps’ men unawares. Mat Ryan is a lock in goals and is Australia’s best with the ball at his feet. In defence, Trent Sainsbury and Matt Jurman should be paired in the centre as a no-nonsense defensive partnership. The duo has shown in the World Cup playoffs they can work well together. With Aziz Behich on the left and Josh Ridson on the right, Mile Jedinak would shield the back four. In front of him, Massimo Luongo and Aaron Mooy would marshal the midfield effectively. With experienced pair Robbie Kruse and Mathew Leckie on the flanks, they give the Socceroos’ attacking options. Andrew Nabbout up front will run all day and pressure the French backline, but can also hold the ball up when needed. A more attacking approach and more offensive line-up would be called on for the matches against Denmark and Peru. 4-1-4-1: Ryan; Risdon, Sainsbury, Matt Jurman, Behich; Jedinak; Leckie, Luongo, Mooy, Kruse; Nabbout"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/12/the-singapore-summit-is-a-global-exercise-in-damage-limitation-of-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T04:13:11Z","webTitle":"The Singapore summit is a global exercise in Donald Trump damage limitation | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/the-singapore-summit-is-a-global-exercise-in-damage-limitation-of-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/the-singapore-summit-is-a-global-exercise-in-damage-limitation-of-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"The Singapore summit is a global exercise in Donald Trump damage limitation","bodyText":"Let’s be honest. The sight of high-level talks with a bellicose, incoherent, nuclear-armed world leader is far better than the alternative. What good can come from isolating an impetuous man suffering from delusions of grandeur? Yes, it’s a relief to see the world trying to talk sense to Donald J Trump, even if those talks are doomed to fail. The imperative for the world’s leaders is how to manage the risks posed by an American president who can’t be trusted to keep his word or to distinguish his friends from his foes. What the world watched aghast at the G7 summit is the same dynamic it now sees in Singapore: a global exercise in damage limitation of Donald Trump. So far, so good in Singapore. Before he could begin talking to Kim Jong-un, Trump already declared his talks “tremendously successful” and the outcome of “a terrific relationship.” He also described his meeting with the world’s worst dictator as “my honor.” You shouldn’t hold your breath waiting for the condemnation of this belittling of the American presidency from the same conservatives who were disgusted by President Obama’s greeting of the Japanese emperor. Then again, who cares? As long as Trump can cool his own saber-rattling, the good citizens of South Korea can sleep soundly at night. After all, when North Korean fears reached fever pitch a few months ago, it wasn’t because of a spike in Pyongyang’s rhetoric. That has long been at a level of fire and fury that most of its neighbors choose to ignore. In 2010 a North Korean torpedo sank a South Korean warship, and three years later, it threatened to fire on US bases after B2 stealth bombers flew over the peninsula. What changed this year? The threats of fire and fury came from the American president, not the North Korean dictator. Suddenly the world was unsettled by Washington and a hotheaded leader who insisted his nuclear button was bigger than anyone else’s. So we should understand what the world is hoping for when we look at the Singapore summit, and appreciate the little wins that will keep war at bay. At the top of that list is a path to managing the unhinged conduct of the president of the United States. As for managing North Korea, we have been here before. The Stalinist state has been a nuclear power for more than a decade, with enough conventional firepower and long-range missiles to inflict mass civilian deaths on our allies in South Korea and Japan. President Clinton was close to a summit in 2000 after years of diplomacy and deals that his political opponents scorned. Republicans in those days were rightly distrustful of the North Koreans, who cheated on the Clinton deal. Still, President Bush joined the six-party talks and came to a deal, which the North Koreans promptly blew up with their own nuclear test. Presidential summits were of no value to Trump’s predecessors because they wanted to enhance the deal, not their own image. They chose not to meet with the North Korean leadership because there was no upside for them. Those deals hinged on sanctions and nuclear talks: the normal language of diplomacy and national security. For this president, the calculation is entirely different for all sides. Trump speaks the language of personal enrichment because, well, that’s who he is. When asked in the Oval Office last month whether North Korea was heading for a Libyan outcome, as his national security adviser suggested, Trump disagreed. “This would be with Kim Jong-un,” he explained, “something where he’d be there, he’d be in his country, he’d be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Personal enrichment is something the North Korean leadership understands as much as the Trump family. The Bush administration discovered this by chance when it blacklisted a Macao bank that turned into its greatest leverage over the North Koreans. It turned out that the bank held $25m belonging to just 52 people close to the Pyongyang regime. Freeing up that cash became a critical part of the Bush-era nuclear deal with North Korea. This is where the G7 allies are speaking a different language from the man who currently tweets about cable television from the executive mansion of the White House. They want to talk about communiqués, the rules of global trade and how to treat your allies like they’re your friends. They hold meetings about women’s empowerment and expect Trump to turn up on time. They agree the language of a joint statement and expect Trump to stay true to that agreement from morning to afternoon. They look at an American trade surplus with Canada and are shocked when he talks about a deficit. The sooner they understand that Trump cannot grow into a normal world leader, the better. Before conservatives cheer this moment in global politics, they should realize they are happy that Trump is finally taking on the great Canadian threat to our national security. Whatever will he protect us from next? Perhaps it’s time he challenged the international evil that is Switzerland. If there is a Trump doctrine, it’s certainly not America First. That might just involve promoting America’s interests by maintaining the largest number of powerful allies. No, the Trump doctrine is to create the Age of Outrage: a constant churn of outrageous statements designed to disrupt and distract. Some of that outrage is intentional, and some of it is just incompetence. For now, the permanently startled press corps can only ask the most serious questions of this least serious president. Before he flounced out of the G7 summit, Trump was asked how long it would take him to figure out if the North Korean leader was serious. “That’s a good question,” said the commander-in-chief. “How long will it take? I think within the first minute I’ll know.” “How?” asked the dumbfounded reporter. “Just my touch, my feel. That’s what I do.” That’s what Trump does: he gropes his way to his foreign policy, while the rest of the world just looks shocked. As long as he’s happy, we can rationalize his bad behavior as being good for the world. As long as he doesn’t grope his way to war, we might just have a chance to rebuild America’s alliances in 2021.

In a rambling interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo from Singapore, a highly emotional Rodman claimed credit for predicting that today’s summit – which seemed unlikely just months ago – would happen. Wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap and a T-shirt bearing the name of his sponsor Potcoin, Rodman sobbed as he described his feelings about the summit and recalled the abuse he had received over his controversial visits to Pyongyang to meet Kim. “I said to everybody, the door will open,” he said. “It’s amazing, it’s amazing, it’s amazing. When I said those things, when I went back home, I got so many death threats … and I believed in North Korea, and I couldn’t even go home, I couldn’t even go home, I had to hide out for 30 days, I couldn’t even go home. “But I kept my head high, brother, I knew things were going to change … I knew it, I was the only one. I never had no one to hear me, I had no one to see me. But I took all those bullets, I took all at that … but I’m still standing. Today is a great day for everybody, Singapore, Tokyo, China, everybody … it’s a great day. I’m here to see it. I’m so happy.” The former NBA star is one of the few westerners to have met Kim, with whom he struck up an unlikely friendship over their shared love of basketball. Describing his meetings with Kim, Rodman said: “He’s more like a big kid, even though he’s small. He wants to come to America. He wants to enjoy his life.” Rodman said he had tried to pass on what he heard from Kim to Barack Obama but was “brushed off”. Rodman said he had earned Kim’s trust after making good on a promise to take a team of ex-NBA players to North Korea in 2014. “I gave him something for his birthday … I said: I’m going to bring a professional basketball team to you,” Rodman said. “He said: Can you do that. I said: Yes I can. Even though I couldn’t do it, I knew if I fail now there is going to be a problem. But I got Potcoin here helped me out, my sponsor, fetch those guys and it happened. And Kim Jong-un came to me and said: ‘Dennis - you know what this is the first time someone has ever kept their word to me and my country’.” Rodman said he believed Trump “will understand that the people of North Korea have a heart, have a soul, charisma and love each other”. “I think that country is normally hearing people who are always lying, deceitful and not trustworthy. I think that if President Trump goes in there with a great heart, with his heart on the table and let Kim Jong-un see him really emotional … it ain’t got to be about war, it ain’t got to be about hatred or what happened in the past. “I’ve told people about Kim Jong-un. He all about the 21st Century. He’s trying to progress his country.” Rodman arrived at Changi airport late on Monday amid speculation that he might even join the talks between the two leaders. The White House has since said that he will play no role in the discussions. The former Celebrity Apprentice contestant, who has visited North Korea several times and met Kim three times since 2013, claimed the president had thanked him for his efforts to being the two men together, saying a White House secretary had called to say that Trump was “proud” of him. That is in direct contradiction to a 2014 tweet by Trump, who said Rodman was “delusional” for wanting him to visit North Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/12/shortens-hopes-for-smooth-labor-conference-dashed-by-strong-showing-by-left","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T03:01:17Z","webTitle":"Shorten's hopes for smooth Labor conference dashed by strong showing by left","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/12/shortens-hopes-for-smooth-labor-conference-dashed-by-strong-showing-by-left","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/12/shortens-hopes-for-smooth-labor-conference-dashed-by-strong-showing-by-left","fields":{"headline":"Shorten's hopes for smooth Labor conference dashed by strong showing by left","bodyText":"The Labor right faction’s effort to secure a majority in its own right at the party’s national conference, which would help Bill Shorten navigate politically fraught debates, has been dealt a blow by a strong turnout for the left in Queensland. With the Queensland delegation for the national conference now settled, the left faction will field 193 conference delegates in December and the right 195 delegates, with Queensland’s “old guard” group numbering five, with seven independents forming a conference crossbench. While the right faction has finished nominally ahead because of concerted organisational efforts in Victoria and New South Wales, the old guard, which used to be a right-aligned group, now caucuses with the left in Queensland. Nationally, the group of five delegates is regarded as a swing vote. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The practical consequence of the national result is the December conference numbers are too tight for any one faction to claim a clear working majority, and the outlook is further complicated by wars between sub-factional groupings. The current outlook is a repeat of the conference dynamic in 2015, when Shorten had to rely on cooperation from a substantial delegation from the left-aligned CFMEU to head off politically sensitive forays on asylum seeker policy and other flash points. Given one of the prominent members of Labor’s industrial left faction, Ged Kearney, is leading the public push to prevent mandatory offshore detention becoming indefinite detention because of the lack of viable resettlement options, any left split during the looming conference debate will be internally contentious. One left source told Guardian Australia: “If the left votes together, no one has a majority. It is a very fine balance, which obviously has led to a lot of concern from the left about what the CFMEU will do.” “There is a worry we will see a repeat of what happened last time in critical votes, particularly on asylum seekers, and the CFMEU will vote with the right.” The current concern around the left doesn’t stop with the ultimate resolution of asylum debate. “To the CFMEU, we would say, if they expect the rest of the left to vote on the issues that matter to them – then it would be helpful if they maintained solidarity on issues that are of concern to other left delegates.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/12/brisbane-council-could-force-motorised-scooters-to-go-slower","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T04:08:25Z","webTitle":"Brisbane council could force mobility scooters to slow down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/12/brisbane-council-could-force-motorised-scooters-to-go-slower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/12/brisbane-council-could-force-motorised-scooters-to-go-slower","fields":{"headline":"Brisbane council could force mobility scooters to slow down","bodyText":"People who use mobility scooters could have their speed throttled to walking pace in Brisbane under a council bid to toughen regulations. Brisbane city council has proposed lowering the speed limit for scooters and motorised wheelchairs from 10km/h to 6km/h over concerns they are posing a danger to pedestrians. It is also pressuring the Queensland state government to introduce licensing requirements for scooter drivers, with minimum standards of physical and cognitive ability. Nationals senator John Williams has been pushing for greater regulation since his wife, Nancy Capel, was hit and injured by a mobility scooter in August 2016, forcing her to get a hip replacement. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “[She] took literally one step out of the office and the gopher hit her,” Williams said at the time. “I think we need to see some regulation to keep them away from the point of entry into the shops and the offices, where people are walking in and walking out.” In September last year, Williams successfully moved a motion at the Nationals’ national conference to support a 6km/h limit, and in December he established a Senate inquiry into the mobility scooter industry. The inquiry will look into the number of deaths and injuries caused by scooters and whether any regulation is needed. It is due to report in September this year. Brisbane city councillor Amanda Cooper told the Courier Mail the mobility scooter speed limit was needed “to ensure safety for all’’. “Council [has also] proposed that state governments consider a basic licensing process to monitor users’ physical and cognitive ability to drive a scooter safely, with the frequency specified by their doctor,” she said. Currently in Queensland, all motorised wheelchairs must be registered and have an in-built speed limit of 10 km/h. Registration provides users with compulsory third-party insurance in the event of an accident or collision. However, scooter users do not need to be licensed, and are considered to be pedestrians under Queensland road rules. Unregistered scooters cannot be used on roads, and must be kept inside the home. Scooters do not need to be registered in any other state or territory. Disability advocates have criticised moves to limit scooters’ speed, saying it poses a safety risk to those with mobility issues. Julie de Waard, a member of the Hervey Bay Safe Scooter Committee, told the ABC in September the 6km/h limit would make the scooters too slow to cross a road safely. “They wouldn’t get anywhere,” she said. “At 10km/h crossing a road is already dangerous.” Greens senator and the party’s disability spokesman, Jordon Steele-John, also criticised the wisdom of the Senate inquiry. “The Australian Greens did not support Senator Williams’s motion for an inquiry into mobility scooters because it does not come from a place of genuine concern for the safety of people who need mobility assistance,” he said at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15015","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T23:00:11Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,015","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15015","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15015","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,015","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/12/neal-e-boyd-opera-singer-americas-got-talent-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T08:00:23Z","webTitle":"Neal E Boyd, opera singer who won America's Got Talent, dies aged 42","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/12/neal-e-boyd-opera-singer-americas-got-talent-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/12/neal-e-boyd-opera-singer-americas-got-talent-dies","fields":{"headline":"Neal E Boyd, opera singer who won America's Got Talent, dies aged 42","bodyText":"Neal E Boyd, the opera singer who won America’s Got Talent in 2008, has died aged 42.

The Iberian giants have been thrown into chaos as half their team attempt to terminate their contracts having being attacked at their training ground by what the Mirror refers to as “masked thugs”, enraged by their team’s failure to qualify for the Champions League, and if the players get their way a lot of totally free talent will suddenly become available. The goalkeeper Rui Patricio, who had previously been close to a £15.8m transfer to Wolves, might now conclude a free transfer to Wolves, while Arsenal are said to be interested in Gelson Martins, Bruno Fernandes has been watched by Liverpool, William Carvalho has been linked with West Ham and Everton in the past and Bas Dost is entertainingly tall. Also on his way from Portugal is Raúl Jiménez, Benfica’s Mexican striker, who is about to join Wolves on a season-long loan. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United, plus Napoli and Internazionale, are all ready to battle for the 20-year-old Fiorentina ace Federico “son of Enrico” Chiesa, who has been priced at £62m by his club after a season of superlative wingplay that would probably have earned him a place in his country’s World Cup squad if only they had one. Inter are unwilling to meet that price but are hoping to tempt La Viola with a crafty player swap arrangement, with the Brazilian left-back Dalbert, the teenage forward Yann Karamoh and the 19-year-old Italian defender Federico Valietti all on the table, making this very much the moment for a cash-rich English team to swoop. Arsenal aren’t as cash-rich as most, which is why they are currently locked in talks over Sampdoria’s midfielder Lucas Torreira rather than already back home with the Uruguayan’s signature. “Lucas has a release clause, everybody knows it,” said the Italian club’s president, Massimo Ferrero. “Whoever wants to take him will have to work with that release clause, €25m.” Arsenal have worked quite hard with that release clause, have chopped it into several chunks and are now offering to pay it in instalments, so as to leave themselves with a bit more cash to go bargain-hunting in the summer sales. Liverpool’s young midfielder Marko Grujic could meanwhile be heading to one of Enrico Chiesa’s old clubs (there are quite a few) in the shape of Lazio, who would like to play him alongside his hotly-tipped occasional Serbia team-mate Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, while Liverpool’s young striker Harry Wilson is wanted by Fulham and Huddersfield, both of whom would pay up to £7m for his services. In further Liverpool-related news, the club has “received initial encouragement” from Xherdan Shaqiri’s representatives and will press ahead with a £12m transfer once Switzerland are eliminated from the World Cup, according to the Mirror. Meanwhile the Roma goalkeeper Alisson says his future “will be resolved before the start of the World Cup, or at least that is what I hope”. At least one of Roma’s big players is leaving – Tuesday’s Gazzetta dello Sport leads with Radja Nainggolan, shown with mocked-up blue-and-black Mohican, agreeing to join Internazionale. Tuttosport meanwhile lead with news of Aleksandr Golovin, who is wanted by Juventus for £17.5m, and declare that Carlos Bacca has delivered the 23-year-old Villarreal winger Samu Castillejo to Milan, who he will join in a player exchange deal, with Bacca heading to Spain. Marco Silva has told Wayne Rooney that the former England ace is no longer needed at Everton and intends to replace him with the much-coveted £25m-rated Norwich midfielder James Maddison, who is also wanted by Leicester and Fulham. West Ham meanwhile have been told they can have Swansea’s Lukasz Fabianski, but only if they nearly double their opening bid to £7m. Finally an Aston Villa armageddon update, and it looks like Steve Bruce is on his way: the Star exclusively reveal that “the club’s Chinese owner, Dr Tony Xia, may decide to sack Steve Bruce. But if he doesn’t, the 57-year-old could walk out anyway”.

Sydney philanthropists Andrew and Jane Clifford have pledged to match every donation made to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy up to $1m before the end of the financial year, hoping to create a $2m fund to eradicate Australia’s cat plague. Feral cats kill one million native birds every night. They have caused the extinction of 20 native species and cover 99.8% of the continent. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon In May, the AWC completed the world’s longest cat-proof fence, creating a cat-free sanctuary that is being repopulated with endangered native mammals such as the bilby and burrowing bettong. Now it is running a campaign for the Cliffords’ donation to be matched by 30 June. The conservancy’s chief executive, Atticus Fleming, said if that target is met it would be enough to double the size of the cat-free sanctuary. “There are very few gifts of this magnitude,” he said. “Hopefully, it will have a catalytic impact and inspire other parties to come to the table. It’s a game changer in terms of building momentum.” The AWC is also working with the CSIRO on genetic technology research, and will use the funds to develop a genetic way to neuter feral cats. “We want to help feral cats breed themselves out of existence by only having male babies,” Fleming said. “It’s such cutting-edge technology. We’ll have to wait a few decades. But if we don’t start now, it’ll take even longer. We’ve got to get cracking.” Jane Clifford said she hoped the funding drive would become a grassroots campaign. “We’ve been involved with AWC for a number of years and we know we need something that can solve the problem,” she said. “Cats just decimate animals every night. They kill 2,000 native animals a minute. That’s mind-blowing, really. “It could be a really great grassroots campaign. I think there are so many people who are interested in the environment, who want to do something, but don’t actually know what to do. Here’s a great Australian thing to do – help save a numbat, a bilby, a mala.” The AWC is already planning to extend its existing fence, which surrounds the former Newhaven cattle station. The 44km fence has created a 94 sq km cat-free area. The second stage would extend it with at least 135km of additional fencing to create a 700 sq km sanctuary. Over 10 years, conservationists will then reintroduce 11 species of endangered marsupials, bringing numbers up from as low as 2,400 individuals in some species to 18,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/12/singapore-meeting-what-we-know-so-far","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T08:15:02Z","webTitle":"Singapore summit: what we learned from the Trump-Kim meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/singapore-meeting-what-we-know-so-far","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/singapore-meeting-what-we-know-so-far","fields":{"headline":"Singapore summit: what we learned from the Trump-Kim meeting","bodyText":"The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has committed Pyongyang to “work towards” the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in an agreement signed with the US president, Donald Trump, in Singapore. It also commits the two countries “peace and prosperity”. The US and North Korea also agreed to recover the remains of prisoners of war from the conflict between North and South Korea, and the immediate repatriation of those already identified. The vague nature of the agreement and the lack of other specific details were greeted with disappointment by analysts. Robert Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University, says the text is “even thinner than most sceptics anticipated”. Trump said the US would halt joint military drills with longtime ally South Korea. The exercises have infuriated North Korea for years and if Trump follows through with this pledge, which was announced at a press conference and not in signed documents, it would be a big concession to Pyongyang. North Korea will be dismantling a missile facility, according to Trump. This was another item not detailed in the signed documents, but Trump said at a briefing Kim had pledged to begin winding down some facilities. This claim could not be immediately confirmed. South Korea praised the outcome and both Trump and Kim. But President Moon Jae-in acknowledged there could be difficulties ahead, and most experts agree there will need to be many more meetings to hammer out the details. China welcomed the summit as historic. The fact that the two leaders “can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning, and is creating a new history,” the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, told reporters. He also talked of the need for a peace mechanism for the peninsula. Trump has said his talks with Kim Jong-un were “better than anybody could imagine”. The two leaders initially met in private for 38 minutes accompanied only by translators. They later held a working lunch with top aides. The talks were the first time a sitting US president has had a meeting with a leader of North Korea. Trump and Kim met on the steps of the Capella hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore and shook hands in front of a display of US and North Korean flags. The handshake lasted about 12 seconds. Speaking through an interpreter Kim said: “Many people in the world will think of this as a form of fantasy from a science fiction movie.” After the signing ceremony Kim’s motorcade headed for the airport. Sitting together for a brief photo call before officials talks, Trump said it was an “honour” to be there with the North Korean leader. Kim said the pair had overcome many “obstacles” to make it to the summit.

Nick Miller is at the St Petersburg Stadium for the Guardian and was no doubt effing and jeffing to beat the band when Iran bagged their late, late winner. Here’s his on-the-whistle report. So, heartbreak for Morocco. It’s difficult not to imagine that with games to come against Portugal and then Spain, their World Cup is already over. While Aziz Bouhaddouz will be feeling very sorry for himself after scoring that own goal, he’s entitled to wonder what on earth his fellow substitute Sofyan Amrabat was doing giving away such a daft free-kick in that position so late in the game. Player ratings: If you’re reading this report you probably didn’t see the match, but don’t let that stop you getting your player ratings in tout suite. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over and ... somehow, Iran have won their first World Cup match since 1998. Their winner came deep into added time and was a gift. Under no pressure of any kind, Morocco substitute Aziz Bouhaddouz put an unstoppable near post header past his own goalkeeper while attempting to defend a free-kick that was needlessly given away by another substitute, Nordin Amrabat. Morocco gifted Iran that winner long after their opponents had shut up shop and clearly settled for the draw. Both sides will be sitting in their dressing rooms in a state of shocked disbelief; Morocco wondering how they lost a game they dominated for long periods and Iran wondering how they won a game in which they were dominated for long periods. 90+5min: The substitute Bouhaddouz scores past his own goalkeeper with a near post header as he attempts to defend the free-kick taken by Ehsan Hajsafi. That is a horror show! The ball was crossed, there was nobody in an Iran shirt near him and for reasons best known to himself, he sends a bullet header past his own goalkeeper. Unbelievable, Jeff! Iran score in the knockings! It’s an own-goal!!! 90+3min: Amrabat 2.0 concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left, between the left side of the penalty area and the touchline. 90+2 min: There’s a bit of a skirmish on the touchline, where Herve Renard and Carlos Queiroz get in a bit of a set-to. Renard’s coaching staff drag him away from the Iran manager, he calms down and offers Quiroz a handshake ... which is accepted. Meanwhile back on the pitch, Iran’s Karim Ansarifard’ has been booked for something or other. 90 min: There’ll be six minutes of added time. Iran have clearly settled for the draw in the hope they can beat Portugal or Spain, but Morocco are still trying to win this one. 86 min: It’s been a game of two halves in St Petersburg, where the second has been quite flat. A series of injuries and substitutions punctuating the play hasn’t helped, but there seems a distinct lack of urgency from two teams who now seem more interested in not losing the match than they are in winning it. It’s understandable, but ultimately a draw is unlikely to be much use to either side. 83 min: Alireza Jahanbakhsh off on a stretcher with cramp, Saman Ghoddos on. 82 min: Morocco substitution: West Ham old boy Manuel Da Costa comes on for Amine Harit. There’s another break in play as Iran’s Jahanbakhsh goes down with cramp. 79 min: Hakim Ziyech goes close for Morocco with a sweet strike from 20 yards that forces a very good save from Alirez Berianvend, who puts the ball out for a corner. That’s a great save. 76 min: Morocco substitution: Sofyan Amrabat comes on to replace his brother Nordin. Elsewhere in the Morocco ranks, striker Ayoub Kaabi is replaced by Aziz Bouhaddouz. 74 min: Bad news for Morocco, as Amrabat is caught by an accidental shoulder from Hajsafi and wallops his head off the ground. He looks very dazed and confused but is anxious to come back on. Thankfully, Morocco’s medical staff opt to take him off despite his protestations. 71 min: A truly momentous occasion in this World Cup, as I get my first accusation of bias from a reader for ... describing what’s happening in a football match. “It’s astonishing how bias your reporting toward Iran is!” writes Aarta Alkarimi, who I suspect may actually think I am being biased against Iran. “You can’t even hide it.” It is true that I am fabled for my anti-Iran bias. And now I’ve been rumbled. 69 min: For Iran, Jahanbakhsh gets down the inside left but his attempted cross is put out for a corner. Again, the delivery is poor and another decent attacking opportunity goes to waste. 66 min: Iran substitution: On a yellow card, their skipper Masoud Shojaei goes off. He’s replaced by Mehdi Tarem. He comes on as his team wait to take a free-kick from deep, which is duly wasted when the ball is larruped high and wide. 63 min: Shepherding the ball out of play near the corner flag, Iran’s Ehsan Hajsafi is challenged from behind by Hakim Ziyech. Hajsafi goes to ground with a roar of pain so loud it can be heard over the din of horns and vuvuzelas. It’s quite the over-reaction from a nothing challenge and Ziyech turns to the ref with a look of bafflement on his face and shrugs his shoulders ostentatiously. 61 min: From a Morocco corner, Iran attack on the break with Alireza Jahanbakhsh on the ball and two men up in support. Morocco get back in numbers at high speed to snuff out the danger. 60 min: Little in the way of chances being created in this second half, in a match that remains – not so much on a knife-edge, as hanging in a Dali-esque fashion over the back of a spoon. The first half was a lot more entertaining, but the players seem to be getting more tense the longer it goes on. A goal would spice things up nicely. 56 min: Throw-in for Morocco, deep in Iran territory. From that, Iran win a throw-in of their own and lump the ball forward. Remember, with Spain and Portugal in this group, a draw almost certainly won’t be much use to either of these sides here. 55 min: There’s a break in play as Iran’s Omid Ebrahimi receives treatment for a rib injury. 53 min: More good play from Iran, who enjoy a rare period of sustained possession. They lose the ball, however, and it’s Morocco’s turn to attack on the break. Their attack breaks down when Hakim Ziyech is harshly penalised for a handball he couldn’t possibly avoid. 50 min: Another promising counter-attack from Iran, who advance up the field with a four-on-four. It comes to naught on the back of a poor final pass. 48 min: Another chance squandered by Morocco, as Amine Harit completely miscues a volley at the far post after being teed up by an excellent cross from Amrabat, who has been excellent for Morocco on that right flank. 47 min: Iran’s Alrireza Jahanbakhsh picks up a needless booking for stamping on the instep of Hakim Ziyech. 46 min: Play is back under way at the St Petersburg spaceship. Morocco immediately go on the attack, but Amrabat cuts in from the right and sends in a wayward cross with way too much welly on it. Footballers, eh? All about bling and fast cars and fancy clothes. Well, Iran’s goalkeeper is quite the exception. 45 min: We’re into added time of what has been a thoroughly entertaining 45 minutes of football, despite the paucity of goals thus far. It’s been really enjoyable. Having been on the back foot from the get-go, Iran have gradually found their feet and this has evolved from what looked a certain Morocco win, to a very hard game to call. 44 min: For Iran, Sardar Azman is played in behind by a nicely weighted through-ball from Jahanbakhsh and finds himself one-on-one with Muniz in the Morocco goal. He gets down and spreads himself and saves with an outstretched foot. That was a fantastic chance for Iran, who have grown into this game and are looking potentially lethal on the counter-attack. 42 min: It’s worth noting that this match is being played to the soundtrack of a cacophony of horns above what sounds suspiciously like the low, irritating drone of thousands vuvuzelas. 38 min: From the left touchline, Moroccan winger Hakim Ziyech tries to pick out Ayoub El Kaabi with a wafting cross. It’s a perfect height for the Morocco frontman, but a mite too far in front of him and he fails to make contact despite stretching every sinew. Could he have made more of an effort to fling himself at the ball, there? I thought so. 34 min: From the ensuing free-kick, Alireza Jahanbakhsh shoots high over the bar from almost 40 yards. That was an optimistic effort. 34 min: Medhi Benatia loses the ball high up the field and with Iran on the break, Karim El Ahmedi is left with little choice but to clip the heels of Sardar Azmoun. Yellow card. 32 min: Free-kick for Iran, wide on the right. Mortez Pouraliganji floats the ball into the box, where it’s Rouzbeh Cheshmi hooks it over the bar. 30 min: Amine Harit picks up the ball on the edge of the Iran penalty area and drifts past two defenders before unleashing a shot. It’s a weak effort that doesn’t trouble Alireza Berianvend. He should have done better, truth be told. 28 min: Romain Saiss wins a free-kick for Morocco just inside his own half after getting bundled over by Karim Ansarifard. 26 min: More pressure from Morocco, which leads to Iran central defender Rouzbeh Cheshmi having to get in front of a 35-piledriver from Younes Belhanda and block. I reckon that stung. 23 min: Getting caught on the break is something Morocco need to look out for, as their full-backs Hakimi and Amrabat are playing in ridiculously advanced positions, leaving centre-backs Medhi Benatia and Romain Saiss as a back two. I think Wolves fans will be more used to seeing Saiss playing in midfield, but he’s used as a centre-back while playing for the national team. 21 min: Having been totally dominated for the opening quarter, Iran go close to taking the lead. Attacking on the break in a two-on-two, Karim Ansarifard’s attemot to pick out the man up in support is deflected out for a corner, from which nothing comes. 18 min: Morocco have three or four shots in quick succession blocked in and around the six yard box after another long diagonal is headed back into the penalty area from the byline. Medhi Benatia has the pick of the shots, but his effort is saved by Alireza Berianvend and an unseemly – but always welcome – goalmouth scramble ends when the ball is hacked clear by Iran. 17 min: “Yeah, but this is all well and good, but is Morocco manager Herve Renard wearing one of his trademark pristine, out-of-the-wrapper fresh white shirts?” you ask. I can confirm that he is. 15 min: For Morocco, Amrabat crosses from the wide right in an attempt to pick out Mbark Boussoufa at the far post. Iran right-back Ramin Rezaeian is on hand to get a vital touch. 13 min: Morocco continue to dominate and seem to have acres of room in which to operate. It’s almost as if Iran don’t have a full complement of 11 players out on the pitch. They seem outnumbered. 10 min: Iran’s Masoud Shojaei gets booked for raking his studs down the shin of Mbark Boussoufa. He’s an interesting character, the AEK Athens midfielder - he was exiled from the Iran team until quite recently, as he was considered a troublemaker. He once played against an Israeli side with his club and repeatedly agitated to have women allowed into Iranian football stadiums, so his mum and sisters could come and watch him play. 8 min: Morocco play the ball over the Iranian defence and a backpedalling defender can only head the ball as far as Ayoub El Kaabi on the edge of the area. He shoots high and wide. Morocco are running amok here - they could be three up already and Iran don’t seem to know what’s hit them. They can’t get the ball out of their own half. 6 min: There’s a break in play as Morocco’s Amine Harit goes down under a bad two-footed challenge from Omid Ebrahimi. The Iranian midfielder is lucky to escape a booking ... or worse. 4 min: Morocco have already taken control of this match with less than five minutes on the clock - they look in danger of completely overwhelming Iran. 3 min: Morocco win an early corner, which Younes Belhanda takes. It’s a training ground move and he rolls the ball towards the edge of the penalty area, where Hakim Ziyech is in acres of space. With the goal at his mercy, he hits an air-shot and falls over. That was a fantastic opportunity!!! 2 min: For Morocco, Medhi Benatia plays a long diagonal towards to the corner flag in a move that leads to a half-chance from the edge of the penalty area for Amine Harit. He doesn’t quite connect with his snap-shot and fires the ball wide. 1 min: Morocco kick off,, their players wearing red shirts, green shorts and red socks. Iran’s players wear white shirts, white shorts and white socks. I can also confirm that Iran’s players are all wearing boots, although in the wake of that Nike snub, I can’t see what brand. The teams are in the tunnel at the St Petersburg Stadium and click-clack their way out on to the pitch for a match that is pretty must-win for both sides, even if it is the first game of Group B. Kick-off is just a few minutes away, but first: the National anthems. ITV are showing this one in the UK: With 13 minutes to go until kick-off between Morocco and Iran, they’re focussing exclusively on ... England and telling viewers nothing whatsoever about either of the teams playing in the match they’re actually covering. It’s understandable, I suppose, if a little disappointing. Oh ... hold on, they’re now discussing the two managers involved in this encounter - specifically their English links. It is, of course, possible that none of their pundits –Slaven Bilic, Eni Aluko and Ryan Giggs – know anything about Morocco or Iran and if that is the case, you’d have to wonder what exactly it is they’re doing in the studio? It should be noted that BBC were equally guilty of this anglo-centric focus in today’s earlier game between Uruguay and Egypt. Morocco: Mohamedi, Hakimi, Benatia, Saiss, Boussoufa, Ziyech, El Ahmadi, Harit, Nordin Amrabat, El Kaabi, Belhanda. Subs: Bounou, Mendyl, da Costa, Fajr, Boutaib, Ait Bennasser, Dirar, En-Nesyri, Bouhaddouz, Sofyan Amrabat, Carcela-Gonzalez, Tagnaouti.

Subs: Mazaheri, Torabi, Mohammadi, Khanzadeh, Ghoddos, Montazeri, Ghoochannejhad, Taremi, Hosseini, Dejagah, Abedzadeh. Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey) Morocco: Munir, Amrabat, Benatia, Saïss, Achraf, El Ahmadi, Belhanda, Harit, Boussoufa, Ziyech, El Kaabi. Iran: Beiranvand, Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, Cheshmi, Hajsafi, Ebrahimi, Masoud, Jahanbakhsh, Ansarifard, Amiri, Azmoun. Nike incurred the wrath of Iran manager Carlos Queiroz last week after refusing to supply his players with boots under the terms of sanctions that won’t actually be imposed until after the World Cup. “US sanctions mean that, as a US company, Nike cannot supply shoes to players in the Iranian National team at this time,” announced the famously ethical sportswear company. “They should come out and apologise because this arrogant conduct against 23 boys is absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary,” harrumphed Queiroz by way of response. “Players get used to their sports equipment, and it’s not right to change them a week before such important matches. We are only managers and footballers, and should not get involved in such matters. But we are asking Fifa to help us with this.” This isn’t the first inconvenience Iran’s footballers have suffered in the build-up to the World Cup. A friendly between them and Greece was cancelled due to tensions between Greece and Turkey, before a second warm-up against Kosovo was also cancelled. World Cup Football Daily: Our Football Weekly podcast has gone daily for the duration of the World Cup and last night’s opening episode featured Max Rushden, John Brewin and I in the studio, with Barney Ronay and Sid Lowe on the phone from Russia. Early team news: Moroccan right-back Nabil Dirar is a doubt after missing his country’s recent friendlies with a calf injury. Otherwise, coach Herve Renard has a full squad to choose from. Combative midfielder Saeid Ezatolahi will be a big loss to Iran as misses out on the first of their group games through suspension. Midfielder Askhan Dejagh and striker Mehdi Taremi could also miss out through injury. Greetings one and all. The Atlas Lions take on Team Melli at the St Petersburg Stadium in the first of two Group B matches to be played today. With the Iberian heavyweights of Portugal and Spain going head to head later tonight, it’s difficult to see how a draw will be any use to either Morocco or Iran and an extremely cagey encounter seems likely. Kick-off is at 4pm (BST), but stay tuned for team news, build-up and lots of other treats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dementia-johns-campaign-fight-for-dignity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Dementia: the fight for dignity goes on | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dementia-johns-campaign-fight-for-dignity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dementia-johns-campaign-fight-for-dignity","fields":{"headline":"Letters: dementia – the fight for dignity goes on","bodyText":"There is still some way to go with John’s Campaign (“Four years after my father died, I feel we’ve reached a milestone in our fight for dignity in dementia care”, Focus). My mother was admitted to hospital overnight, 200 miles away. I phoned the ward in the morning to inquire how she was before I set off on the journey. I was told they couldn’t talk to me unless I gave them a password. On asking how to get one, I was told I would need to visit with ID. My mother’s dementia meant she would have been totally unable to verify any information herself. Luckily, I recalled seeing someone from the patient advice and liaison service on a previous visit. They were as baffled as I was but were wonderful. They visited the ward and managed to extract a password so that I could call en route to find out how my mother was. Their understanding of my long-distance carer’s difficulties and the complexities of dementia was heartening and reassuring. I am so grateful to Nicci Gerrard, Julia Jones and others involved in John’s Campaign for changes already achieved and hope they will continue so that all hospital policies and procedures can fully reflect their careful consideration of the needs of those with dementia and all those caring for them. Hilary Grime Oxford Reading Nicci Gerrard’s absorbing article on John’s Campaign, I feel obliged to ask what happened to Living Well with Dementia, the “national dementia strategy” first published in February 2009 by the then Blair government. In the summer of 2008, I worked in the HQ of the Alzheimer’s Society and publication of the strategy was hotly anticipated, a holy grail that would hack through the dark, unfeeling undergrowth and create humane, sophisticated policy on dementia. Perhaps it did bring forth desperately needed improvements in the NHS and private care. If I read Nicci correctly, I suspect not. Mike Abbott London W4 God bless Americans Kudos to Eva Wiseman for trumpeting the cold war period drama The Americans in her column (Observer Magazine). For some time, it has arguably been the most relevant and overlooked series on TV. Its final episode was one of the best pieces of television I’ve seen in many a year. Its lack of coverage in the UK is inexplicable. Will Goble Rayleigh, Essex The inhumanity of the EU Kenan Malik’s commendable piece offers an understanding of something many people do not know or do not want to know (“How we all colluded in Fortress Europe”, Sunday Essay). That the EU has been in the business of creating fears of the “other” has been well documented for years. The EU has been in clear breach of international agreements relating to the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers (born out of the precarious situation of Jews who survived Nazism). While there is freedom of movement for the citizens of 28 European countries, that freedom was designed, principally, with white Europeans in mind. The converse is that the citizens of some 175 other countries have no freedom of movement in relation to Europe. Xenophobia has long underpinned this “freedom”. As a lifelong socialist and internationalist, I had little choice when participating in the Brexit referendum but to vote leave. Alec Turner London N15 Craven Cameron In your excellent leader column last week, you state that “the prime minister has irresponsibly placated a minority on the Tory right at the expense of Britain’s best interest” (“May offers no leadership or strategy. Parliament must seize the reins on Brexit”, Comment). I would suggest that this happened some time ago when David Cameron did exactly the same thing by cravenly giving in to this same minority backed up by Ukip. A classic example of the tail wagging the dog. Morris Globe Droylsden, Manchester Putting Grenfell in context Reading the moving testaments in “Grenfell one year on…” (New Review), the key question is Mouna El-Ogbani’s: “We want to know what happened, why we were living in a death trap.” I would suggest that there is a structural context for this dystopian nightmare, one that is unlikely to be acknowledged by the Grenfell inquiry, which is rooted in ideology and social policy choices of governments. Since the late 19th century, housing policies have favoured the “deserving” classes, mainly white, ski lled working class or middle class. Better quality council housing – houses with gardens in leafy avenues – was built for the “heroes” returning from war after 1918 and 1945. In times of austerity, when council housing was targeted more at the poor, slum dwellers or immigrants, standards fell. What should have forewarned those responsible for the welfare of residents of Grenfell is that such reductions in standards led to the technical errors that caused the collapse of Ronan Point in east London in 1968, killing four people and injuring many others. Since the late 1970s, the ideology driving social policy in Britain has persevered with measures designed at privileging very narrow notions of “deserving” and “undeserving”. Those capable of succeeding as “effective consumers” gain; those defined as “failed consumers” lose out. This development needs to be resisted; resistance built on new social movements capable of campaigning around collective rights and empowerment, where the wants and needs of people are articulated, controlled and delivered by communities and individuals. Charlie Cooper Lincoln Stigma of forced adoption Regarding your article about forced adoption (“Sixty years on, unmarried mothers forced to give up babies seek justice”, News, last week), I became an unmarried mother in 1963 in Australia and felt compelled to surrender my child for adoption. However, the Australian government gave an apology to all such women in Australia in 2013. I signed the papers because I thought it would devastate my parents back home in Scotland if I had an illegitimate child, but also because I thought I would never be able to find “Mr Right”. I later had two more children, but many women were too traumatised and remained childless for the rest of their lives. We need to shed light on what happened in those days – right up to the 1980s in some cases – because today there is what I call “the second stigma”, which keeps these secrets still unmentionable. Young people today find it incomprehensible that any woman could feel forced to give up her baby just because she was not married. Jean Robertson-Molloy London N2 What price philanthropy? Since Jeff Bezos has announced that he is considering a philanthropic strategy (“The human cost of your Kindle”, special report), perhaps he could make a start by distributing his $103bn among his 566,000 workers, giving them each a nest egg of $181,978.80, while still maintaining a comfortable income stream for himself.

You can grade all of today’s players here if you want. Go easy on Suarez. Uruguay were sluggish and predictable for most of the match but snatched victory at the end with a straight-forward a header from a freekick. Egypt will be grievously disappointed but, with Salah back, showed enough to suggest they can still get out of a low-quality group. Uruguay will need to improve to go deep in the tournament but it turned out to be a satisfying start for them. 90 + 3 min: There will be at least five minutes of added time in all, and Uruguay have spent much of it repelling crosses so far. But Hegazi gives them a get-out by committing a needless foul on Suarez/ 90 min: Almost as soon as the goal went in the rather ungallant cameraman panned straight to Salah, who suddenly wasn’t smiling. Cuper must be wondering now whether he should have chucked him on, after all. You can be sure many millions of Egyptians are. Sanchez delivers a freekick from the right and Gimenez rises like Mark Wright to nod the ball into the net from seven yards! Uruguay have surely won it! 89 min: Cavani curls the freekick over the wall ... past the despairing dive of the goalkeeper ... and against the post! And Egypt’s defenders react smartly to scramble the ball away. 88 min: Danger here. Cavani is bumped to the ground by Fathi, giving Uruguay a freekick jsut outside the box, a little to the left of the D ... 85 min: Sanchez delivers a corner. Godin gets a head to it but not firmly enough to threaten. Shafy wellies the ball to safety. 83 min: Suarez tees up Cavani, who lets fly with a banger of a volley from just outside the box, bringing a brilliant one-handed save from Elshenawy! It’s only his fourth cap but the keeper has certainly justified his selection. Egypt substitution: on comes Warda off, on comes Ramadan Sobhi, newly off Huddersfield Town. That means we won’t be seeing Salah today, apart from his regular appearances on the giant screen in the stadium. Guess Egypt are happy with a point. 79 min: Uruguay are too static to trouble Egypt. In fact, it’s starting to feel like time itself is standing still. 76 min: A terrible pass by Sanchez - a basic mis-hit - ruins a promising move for Uruguay. I wouldn’t go so far as to say Saudi Arabia will be fancying their chances but Uruguay have been dross. 73 min: Chance for Suarez! He spins his man in the box and is through on goal. But Elshenaway rushes off his line to close him down smartly. Suarez looked like he was expecting the keeper to over-commit but he didn’t. 72 min: A counter-attack by Egypt is ended by a wild foul .. bu the ref waves play on because the balls runs to Fathi, who lets fly with a ferocious drive from over 20 yards. And the keeper catches it well. Note: catches it, not cops out by punch it away. 69 min: A weak corner makes it as far as Cavani short of the near post. Cavani tries to turn and get off a shot but he’s crowded out by about five players. 67 min: “So, Uruguay are being frustrated by a team playing better football than them and Suarez is utterly frustrated,” notes Gokul Kannan. “I think we all know what comes next. Sinking his teeth into Salah’s shoulder in the 80th minute and then going on to score the winner?” Well, Salah hasn’t come on yet. And it’s a pickle as to whether Cuper should introduce him: victory is there, you feel, is it worth the risk? 64 min: Suarez gets the ball to the left of the box. He tries to cross but it’s blocked. it rebounds to him. And then he’s pestered into losing it. The message from this game so far is forget about Suarez and Cavani, what’s needed is a Uruguayan Mark Wright (one for lovers of Italia ‘90 there, folks). Egypt substitution: Mohsen off and on comes Sal...no, only joshing, it’s Kahraba, but he’s nicknamed Electricity so be might bring a spark. Uruguay substitution: Rodriguez on, De Arrascaeta off. Let’s see if the double change sparks Uruguay into action. Egypt have had their number so far. Uruguay substitution: Sanchez on, Nandez off. 58 min: Excellent work by Trezeguet, winning back the ball with a strong challenge and then going on a winding run forward. But he eventually runs into trouble. 55 min: Egypt are dictating the tempo now and enjoying a lot of possession, knocking the ball about and forcing Uruguay to sit deep. Trezeguet, probing down the left, has hinted at penetration but not really carried through yet. It’s tight. 52 min: Egypt have responded to that injection of vim by Uruguay early in the second half. So this remains a tight and intense battle. Egypt substitution: Hamed has to come off and is replaced by Sam Morsy, the Wolverhampton-born midfielder who plays for Wigan and is now a World Cup star. 48 min: Hamed is lying on his back in midfield. He’s in obvious pain after receiving a knee in the lower back from De Arrascaeta during a challenge. Accidental, no doubt. it does not look like Hamed will be able to continue. 46 min: No changes in personnel during the break, but a marked change in Uruguay’s tempo: within 45 seconds of the resumption Cavani slips in Suarez for a chance. Nothing wrong with the striker’s shot on the run this time, but ElShenawy makes a fine save! Oh look! An unscrupulous man would suggest Uruguay should kick someone to wake themselves up. There’ll certainly be angry words exchanged during the interval because the South Americans have been oddly subdued. Some credit for that must go to Egypt, who have been dynamic and well organised. Cuper does not look capable of winning simply because they have been blunt up front: but they do have Salah on the bench ... 45 min: A skilful flourish by De Arrascaeta in midfield bu the ensuing cross by Uruguay is way off the mark. They’re been strangely off-colour so far, almost dozy. 43 min: Egypt launch a promising attack. But their final ball into the box twice lets them down. 42 min: Cavani drops deep into his own half to appeal for a pass. That’s been a common sight so far, lovely for Egypt to see. 40 min: Warda gets helped up by the referee after claiming to hurt his back following a fresh-air-overhead kick. 38 min: Godin makes a break from the back, gliding past one opponent before slipping the ball through to De Arrascaeta, who lets the ball run away from him in the Egyptian bo,x, much to the annoyance of Godin. Apparently De Arrascaeta - first name Giorgian - was named after a horse, but his touch there was that of a donkey. 36 min: Uruguay try to exert pressure again. But as soon as they get anywhere near the Egyptian box they can find no openings and no inspiration. 34 min: Egypt take up residence deep in the Uruguayan half. The threat from them is growing as they look to have more energy and more precision than Uruguay. So far there’s been no sign of sharpness up front from them, however. But they’ve been the better team so far, no doubt. 32 min: Freekick to Uruguay, 30 yards out. Suarez reckons this is the time for his luck to change But he curls the short straight into the wall. 30 min: Fathy nicks the ball off Suarez as Uruguay threatened to mount an attack. Suarez looks furious with himself: he’s just can’t get going today. 29 min: Elneny has begun well here but has just given the ball away with a stray pass. No matter, Egypt win it back again. They’re starting to make Uruguay look sluggish. Tabarez is looking very agitated on the sideline. 27 min: Mohsen does well to win a long punt from the keeper. He lays the ball back to Warda and then spins and receives it back again. His resultant shot through a couple of defender lacks power but is on target, at least, and forces Muslera to make his first save of the game. 25 min: An outswinging corner from the right runs all the way over to Suarez, who tries to sweep it into the net from six yards. He finds the net all right and the Uruguayan fans rejoice ... not realising it was the sidenetting! Suarez holds his mouth to stifle a naughty word. That was a bad miss: for the second time in the game, he did not connect cleanly with a shot. 24 min: Cavani hits a bouncing ball goalward from the edge of the area. Hegazi gets in the way. 23 min: De Arrascaeta curls in a corner for Uruguay. El Shenaway punches it clear. 21 min: Bentancur gets caught in possession in midfield. He is one of the players expected to provide Suarez and Cavani with better service than they got at the last World Cup, but he has been smothered well by dynamic Egypt so far. 19 min: El Said gets a lecture for diving over the leg of Caceres as Egypt tried to infiltrate the Uruguayan box. He should have been booked for that. The VAR official will have to retrospectively admonish the ref at half-time. 16 min: Freekick to Egypt, about 27 yards out and central. The big men come up from the back. El Said drifts the freekick towards Hegazi, but Uruguay head it away. 13 min: The big screen in the stadium shows Salah sitting on the bench. The crowd goes wild. A born entertainer. 12 min: Uruguay work Varela into space down the right wing. The former Manchester United winger pulls back a low cross to Suarez, who had held his run. But Suarez doesn’t catch his shot right and it wobbles several yards wide from a difficult angle. 10 min: It’s tight. Egypt are compact and energetic without the ball and tidy with it. Uruguay have yet to find any kind of inspiration and, indeed, are probably spending more time chasing the ball than anticipated. “It’s a mixed bag today for my mate SuperKev.,” reveals Steve Monkey. “His toddler nearly took his eye out in a nappy-changing incident last night but he has been signed off work for a week and at least gets to watch all the games through his one good eye. And the eye patch makes him look like a pirate. Give him a shout out will you.” 8 min: Cavani receives the ball with his back to goal, about 25 yards out. He spins and gets off a shot, but Shenawy saves his low effort. 7 min: Hegazi makes two interceptions in quick succession as Uruguay try to release Suarez with passes from deep. Otherwise, it’s quite a comfortable start for Egypt. 4 min: When they get the ball Egypt are trying to be constructive with it, not jut boot it away. Technically tidy, they’re enjoying a spell in the Uruguayan half. 3 min: Cavani is down clutching his handle after getting a whack from Hamed as they challenge for a loose ball near half-way. But the referee is not interested in his complaints. 2 min: It didn’t take long for Uruguay to regain possession and begin hogging the ball, as Egypt drop deep. That’ll be the pattern for most of the game, I fancy. 1 min: Uruguay, wearing angelic white, kick off. Immedaitely they lose possession to Egypt, clad in red tops and black shorts and socks. How about a video telling the backstories of some of the top players at this tournament, including Suarez? Uruguay’s anthem is more a sedate tune but no one’s going to be fooled by that. The Egyptian national anthem benefits from enthusiastic accompaniment from their fans and players. They’re in the mood alright! Here come the starting XIs: both countries seems to have large and noisy followings in the crowd, with Egyptians dominating one whole end of a stadium that is not completely full. A smiling Salah gets a humungous cheer when he enters the arena to take his place on the bench. This is a terrific interview with Diego Godín by Sid Lowe, touching, for example, on that wonderful garra charrrúa mentality. Cavani and Suarez have 93 international goals between them. You’ve got to fancy them to reach the century during this tournament (isn’t that right, Saudi Arabia). But Egypt’s approach today will most likely be to concentrate on shutting them out. They’re unlikely to devote much time to attacking, at least until Salah comes on - though they are probably hoping to keep the score to 0-0 so they can save him for the next match. Before we enjoy today’s fare, here’s The Fiver’s take on the first match and Saudi Arabia’s ridiculous performance. Egypt and Uruguay might have met at the 1934 World Cup ... if Uruguay hadn’t refused to defend their title because only four European teams bothered to travel to South America fo the first tournament. Egypt took up the invitation in ‘34 and sailed over to Italy under a Scottish manager, James McCrae. They only lasted one match, beaten 4-2 by Hungary after having two goals controversially disallowed and conceding one following a challenge that left their goalkeeper with a broken nose. If only VAR had been around then, eh? And here are tactical guides to both teams, as produced by the Guardian’s World Cup network: Uruguay here and Egypt here. You may think you’ve heard enough about Salah, but this piece by Salma Islam is well worth a gander. So as you can see from the teams below, Salah begins on the bench on his 26th birthday. Alongside him will be 45-year-old Essam El Hadary, as the Cuper has decided to give the gloves to Mohamed El Shenawy, the Al Ahly goalkeeper who’s a mere child of 29. Uruguay: Muslera; Varela, Gimenez, Godin, Caceres; Nandez, Betancur, Vecino, De Arrascaeta; Cavani, Suarez. Subs: Silva, Campana, Coates, Pereira, G Silva, Laxalt, Rodrgiuez, Torreira, Urretaviscaya, Sanchez, Gomez, Stuani Egypt: El-Shenawy; Fathy, Gabr, Hegazi, Shafy; Elneny, Hamed, Warda, El Said, Trézéguet; Mohsen Subs: El Hadary, El Mohamady, Gaber, Morsy, Salah, Kahraba, Ashraf, Sobhi, Hamdi, Ekramy, Shikabala, Samir Referee: B Kuipers (Ned) Hello and welcome to the second match of the 2018 World Cup and the first to feature some of the planet’s best players. It’s being billed in some places as Luis Suarez v Mohamed Salah - and in at least two households as Diego Godin v Ahmed Hegazi - but essentially it’s a clash between two teams who will fancy their chances of getting out of Group A even more after watching Russia and Saudi Arabia yesterday. Uruguay, in particular, have realistic hopes of going much father than that. They finished second only to Brazil in the South American qualification league and are the highest-achieving football nation on Earth, twice world champions and 15-times winners of the Copa America - all from a population smaller than that of Los Angeles. And this side have a mean defence, inventive young midfielders and, of course, two of the most fearsome strikers around, in Suarez and Edinson Cavani. Mind you, there’s one hat-trick Suarez won’t be looking to complete today: in 2010 he perpetrated one of the most dastardly/heroic fouls in World Cup history when he deliberately handled the ball against Ghana; and in 2014 he tried to eat an opponent. How do you follow up those deeds? By firing your country to World Cup glory, ideally. Speaking of firing your country to glory, behold Mo Salah! He’s back, albeit only on the bench! They’re aren’t many players who, after being Sergio Ramosed, would choose to make their return against Uruguay but Salah is no ordinary player. And with him Egypt have hope. They are not prolific scorers and stuttered during their buildup but, for the first appearance at the World Cup since 1990, the Pharaohs - under Hector Cuper - are likely to look to keep things tight and rely on their one true maestro to conjure moments of brilliance if he is introduced. We know he’s capable of it. It’s time for all the players of Egypt and Uruguay to stand up and deliver. And for us to sit down and enjoy. It’s on!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/14/plan-to-sell-hastings-pier-to-entrepreneur-angers-locals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T16:43:38Z","webTitle":"Plan to sell Hastings pier to entrepreneur angers locals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/14/plan-to-sell-hastings-pier-to-entrepreneur-angers-locals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/14/plan-to-sell-hastings-pier-to-entrepreneur-angers-locals","fields":{"headline":"Plan to sell Hastings pier to entrepreneur angers locals","bodyText":"A seaside pier that has been wrecked twice by fire, served as a landing site for second world war refugees and played host to The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Tom Jones is on the verge of being sold to a businessman six years after it was saved with a £12m lottery grant. The proposed sale of Hastings pier prompted a protest this week by local campaigners who have been raising money to try to buy it themselves. They complain that they have not been consulted on the sale and fear for the future of what they call the “people’s pier”. The private buyer Sheikh Abid Gulzar bought Eastbourne pier in 2015 and has angered local residents and conservationists by painting parts of it gold, banning dogs, cyclists, fishing and picnics and charging a £2 entrance fee. He was expected to sign an agreement to purchase Hastings pier this week. He has not commented on the reported deal, but last week he registered a new company, Hastings Pier Limited. The Hastings campaigners have raised through crowdfunding more than £440,000 of a £500,000 target and had understood they would be given enough time to find the rest, but they were told Gulzar had an “agreement in principle” for the purchase. Hastings pier was opened in 1872, had its heyday as a seaside pleasure attraction in the 1930s and became a popular music venue in the 1960s. The original 2,000-seat pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1917 and replaced five years later. The pier was damaged by storms in 1990, sold to a succession of owners and finally declared unsafe and closed in 2006. A fire in 2010 caused further damage, but in 2012 work began to rebuild it with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Last year the newly reopened pier won the Stirling prize for the best new building in the UK. Hastings Pier Charity, which ran the Grade II-listed structure and was partly funded by local “shareholder” donations, went into administration last November. Friends of Hastings Pier (FOHP) want to keep it in community ownership and have submitted plans they say will ensure its future. They hoped to be given more time to hit their fundraising target and were shocked to discover the pier was on the point of being sold. On Wednesday evening, 300 people turned out for an impromptu protest and concert on the pier. James Chang, a spokesman for the group, said: “Private investors typically have wanted to make a profit. The last pier owner didn’t invest money in maintaining it while at the same time taking money out of it. Under community ownership we’re not looking for profit, we just need to break even, but mainly we want it to be run for the community. “Having a derelict pier in a seaside town is worse than having no pier. It’s a massive sign of neglect. We can maintain the future of the pier with this, so we don’t quite understand why this decision is being taken. We want a say in its future. It is wrong for it to be sold for an entrepreneur to profit from.” Another campaigner said: “Hastings pier is part of our Victorian seaside heritage and it shouldn’t be flogged off for a song.” FOHP said on Thursday: “The pier was put into administration last November by the Hastings Pier Charity. This meant that the fate of one of the country’s very first community benefit societies, established under an act passed in 2014, was subject to a legal system which is designed purely to deal with commercial bankruptcies. “The administrator, Adam Stephens, has let it be known that he wants to make an imminent decision so that whoever takes over the pier can benefit from the very healthy summer trade. The pier makes much less money in the winter months. “He has a choice of just two bids. One is the Friends of Hastings Pier (FOHP), who wish to maintain the pier as a community-based asset. The alternative is Abid Gulzar, the owner of Eastbourne pier.” Dan Matthews, an events co-ordinator for the pier, said: “It is shocking that this iconic pier, which was the recipient of so much public money, is going to be flogged off on the cheap like this. It is a travesty. It’s criminal, really. It’s a national disgrace. There is a plan just waiting in the wings which would keep the pier in public ownership.” At Wednesday’s protest gig Jess Steele, one of the key figures in FOHP, said there was a clear alternative to the pier going into private ownership, and she announced that campaigners had been asked to put a revised business plan to the administrator by noon on Thursday. “We are now in a very strong position. We now have a very experienced commercial operator partner/investor on board who is willing to install and operate a new temporary structure on the pier at his own cost,” she said. “This essentially means we are ready to go. All we need is for the administrator to agree to sell us the pier and we could be up and running with our new business plan within weeks.” FOHP say they are confident that the remaining £60,000 can be raised before the end of the month. “It’s not over yet. We’re working up to the wire to try to get the best long-term answer for Hastings pier,” Steele said. The Heritage Lottery Fund said the decision lay with the administrators. A spokesman said: “We are supporting the administrators appointed by Hastings Pier Charity in their efforts to find a new future for the pier following the sad demise of the community trust. A decision on the future of the pier will be announced by the administrators in due course.” The administrators Smith Williamson said a decision would be made imminently but refused to comment on the identity of any possible buyer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/14/paws-and-play-gene-treatment-helps-rats-with-spinal-cord-injury-regain-their-nerve","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T17:00:04Z","webTitle":"Paws and play: gene treatment helps rats with spinal cord injury regain their nerve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/14/paws-and-play-gene-treatment-helps-rats-with-spinal-cord-injury-regain-their-nerve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/14/paws-and-play-gene-treatment-helps-rats-with-spinal-cord-injury-regain-their-nerve","fields":{"headline":"Paws and play: gene treatment helps rats with spinal cord injury regain their nerve","bodyText":"Rats with spinal cord injuries have regained the use of their paws after being given a groundbreaking gene therapy that helps to mend damaged nerves in the spine. The new therapy works by dissolving the dense scar tissue that forms a thick barrier between severed nerves when the spinal column is broken. Animals that were given the treatment produced an enzyme called chondroitinase which breaks down scar tissue and allows the broken nerves to reconnect with each other. Tests showed that when the therapy was given for two months, rats relearned the kinds of skilled movements they needed to grab little sugar balls from a platform. “The gene therapy has enabled us to treat large areas of the spinal cord with only one injection,” said Elizabeth Bradbury, who led the research at King’s College London. “This is important because the spinal cord is long and the pathology spreads down its whole length after injury.” While more animal studies are needed before the therapy can go into human trials, researchers hope that ultimately the treatment will help people with spinal injuries who have lost the ability to perform daily tasks, such as using a knife and fork, picking up a mug, and writing. “Recovering the use of the hands is the top priority for the majority of individuals living with spinal cord injuries. It would enable them to do everyday tasks such as washing and dressing independently, picking up a coffee cup, and would be life changing,” she added. Writing in the journal, Brain, the scientists explain that the therapy could have a “significant impact” on people with tetraplegic paralysis, for whom regaining hand control could mean a major improvement in independence. Most human spine injuries, such as those inflicted by traffic accidents, damage the neck and so affect all four limbs. Before it can be considered for human trials, the researchers will need to show that it works safely in larger animals which have suffered accidental injuries. They must also find a way to completely shut down the gene therapy once the spine has healed. At the moment, the scar-busting enzyme is still produced at low levels when the therapy is switched off. “While we are hopeful, we know there is a long way to go to add further safety elements to the gene therapy before it can be used in humans,” said Bradbury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/14/dont-panic-brexit-dads-army-ready-and-willing-to-tell-eu-to-sod-off","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T14:29:03Z","webTitle":"Don't panic!

Brexit Dad's Army ready and willing to tell EU to sod off","bodyText":"The Royal Mail has done some expert trolling this week by announcing plans to release a set of Dad’s Army stamps. “Don’t panic! Don’t panic!” and “We’re all doomed!” might be just the kind of nostalgic messages being whispered within the government but ministers are keen not to let the good news spread to members of the general public. Careless talk costs lives and all that. There was some good news for the Brexit department. The Royal Mail stopped short of superimposing the heads of ministers on those of the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard. David Davis is the perfect Captain Mainwaring. All mouth and no trousers, the perfect leader for any disorganised retreat: the bank manager capable of mis-selling himself his own pension. Then there’s Steve Baker, the spivvy Private Walker. A man to flog the country a dodgy Brexit straight off the back of a lorry. Preferably one parked up on the M2 outside Dover. Robin Walker, the very essence of Private Pike. Nice but dim. Too stupid to appreciate the irony in his constant repetition of Brexit Britain wanting “the brightest and the best”. If that was really the case, Walker wouldn’t have a job. Suella Braverman is slightly more of a problem. There weren’t many women in Dad’s Army and she would be an unlikely contender to be Pike’s mother. But with a stretch of the imagination she could pass for Private Godfrey. Someone whose grasp on reality is increasingly slim and who largely exists in a private fantasy world where people losing their jobs is a price worth paying for the One True Brexit. It was Walker – the spiv rather than the Robin – who got Brexit questions in the Commons under way in characteristic fashion. Britain had an unwavering commitment to workers’ rights, he said, but if it turned out that those commitments weren’t quite as unwavering as he promised then it was just one of those things. This was music to the ears of Tory Brexiters who have been getting a bit twitchy in recent weeks. David TC Davies jumped up to check that we would still be able to tell the EU to sod off. The spiv was happy to confirm it wouldn’t be just the EU we would tell to sod off. It would be the whole world. Next over the top were Privates Pike and Godfrey. Pike was happy to confirm that making up policy in real time during the debate on the meaningful vote earlier in the week was precisely the sort of tactic that struck fear into the enemy. If we didn’t know what we were doing then there was little chance of the EU second-guessing us. Godfrey went one further by refusing to recognise anything she didn’t like. Her own department’s best-case scenario indicating that Scotland would be 2.9% worse off after Brexit was just wrong. The foreign secretary’s remarks that the Brexit negotiations were a mess were unpatriotic. Leading from the rear was Captain Mainwaring, bravely karate-chopping away all comers. First he saw off Hilary Benn. It wasn’t true that Michel Barnier had rejected the government’s idiotic Northern Ireland Brexit backstop plan as idiotic. What Barnier had actually done was to say he would reject the idiotic backstop plan as idiotic in a week or so’s time when the EU council next met. Mainwaring smiled to himself, thrilled at the brilliance of his own logic. A few of the sharper minds in the house started sobbing. Jacob Rees-Mogg made a mental note to transfer the administration of more of his trust funds to Ireland. Keir Starmer then chose to take one for the country. Observing that the Brexit secretary had threatened to resign more often than he had met with Barnier over the last six months, he asked for clarification over the meaningful vote. Who was going to win? Dominic Grieve or the solicitor general? “The solicitor general,” said Mainwaring confidently. It was vital for the sovereignty of parliament that parliament should not be sovereign. You couldn’t risk this taking back control business falling into the wrong hands. Starmer ran the same question by the minister again. This time Mainwaring gave an entirely different answer. He had no idea what was going to be in the amendment that was due to be tabled later in the afternoon, so everyone would have to wait and see. A self-satisfied nod. He hadn’t got where he was today by knowing what he was doing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/14/police-face-legal-action-over-use-of-facial-recognition-cameras","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T20:45:06Z","webTitle":"Police face legal action over use of facial recognition cameras","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/14/police-face-legal-action-over-use-of-facial-recognition-cameras","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/14/police-face-legal-action-over-use-of-facial-recognition-cameras","fields":{"headline":"Police face legal action over use of facial recognition cameras","bodyText":"Two legal challenges have been launched against police forces in south Wales and London over their use of automated facial recognition (AFR) technology on the grounds the surveillance is unregulated and violates privacy. The claims are backed by the human rights organisations Liberty and Big Brother Watch following complaints about biometric checks at the Notting Hill carnival, on Remembrance Sunday, at demonstrations and in high streets. Liberty is supporting Ed Bridges, a Cardiff resident, who has written to the chief constable of South Wales police alleging he was tracked at a peaceful anti-arms protest and while out shopping. Big Brother Watch is working with the Green party peer Jenny Jones who has written to the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, urging them to halt deployment of the “dangerously authoritarian” technology. If the forces do not stop using AFR systems then legal action will follow in the high court, the letters said. Money for the challenges is being raised through a crowdfunding site. According to Liberty, South Wales police have used facial recognition technology in public spaces at least 20 times since May 2017. On one occasion – at the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff – the technology was later found to have wrongly identified more than 2,200 people as possible criminals. At the time a force spokesman said: “Technical issues are common to all face recognition systems, which means false positives will be an issue as the technology develops ... The accuracy of the system used by South Wales police has continued to improve.” Bridges claimed he was monitored on a shopping street in Cardiff last December, and again while protesting outside the Cardiff Arms Fair in March. He said: “Indiscriminately scanning everyone going about their daily business makes our privacy rights meaningless. The inevitable conclusion is that people will change their behaviour or feel scared to protest or express themselves freely – in short, we’ll be less free. “The police have used this intrusive technology throughout Cardiff with no warning, no explanation of how it works and no opportunity for us to consent. They’ve used it on protesters and on shoppers.” Corey Stoughton, Liberty’s advocacy director, said: “The police’s creeping rollout of facial recognition into our streets and public spaces is a poisonous cocktail – it shows a disregard for democratic scrutiny, an indifference to discrimination and a rejection of the public’s fundamental rights to privacy and free expression.” Liberty has argued that AFR systems capture peoples’ biometric data without their consent, disproportionately misidentifies the faces of females and minority ethnic people and breaches data protection laws. Lady Jones expressed fears that she could end up on a facial recognition watch list when conducting her parliamentary and political duties. Details about her were held on the Met’s domestic extremism intelligence unit. Big Brother Watch’s director, Silkie Carlo, said: “Facial recognition cameras are dangerously authoritarian, hopelessly inaccurate and risk turning members of the public into walking ID cards. The prospect of facial recognition turning those CCTV cameras into identity checkpoints like China is utterly terrifying.” Jones said: “I’m extremely concerned about the impact that the Met police’s use of automated facial recognition will have on my ability to carry out my democratic functions. Police use of this technology has no legal basis, and infringes people’s rights and civil liberties. That’s why I’m challenging the Met to end its use, now.” Anna Dews, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Big Brother Watch and Jones, said: “The lack of a statutory regime or code of practice regulating this technology, the uncertainty as to when and where automated facial recognition can be used, the absence of public information and rights of review, and the use of custody images unlawfully held, all indicate that the use of automated facial recognition, and the retention of data as a result, is unlawful and must be stopped as a matter of priority.” The Home Office defends the use of biometric technologies as a crime-tackling measure but said it believes it should respect individuals’ privacy. It is considering improvements to the governance of police use of facial recognition technology, including creating an oversight board consisting of the biometrics commissioner, surveillance camera commissioner, information commissioner and police representatives. The government is due to publish a biometrics strategy later this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/14/iran-nasrin-sotoudeh-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T15:16:27Z","webTitle":"Repression in Iran is getting worse: Trump must share the blame | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/iran-nasrin-sotoudeh-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/iran-nasrin-sotoudeh-trump","fields":{"headline":"Repression in Iran is getting worse: Trump must share the blame","bodyText":"The arbitrary arrest and jailing of Nasrin Sotoudeh, a leading Iranian human rights lawyer, is a crude act of state aggression against a courageous individual, and another heavy blow to the rule of law in Iran. It comes amid an intensifying judicial crackdown on dissent, in particular on women protesters who refuse to wear the hijab in public. This, in turn, forms part of a wider, epic struggle for Iran’s democratic future. Sotoudeh has a long, proud record of challenging Iran’s powerful clerical establishment – but always within the legal framework of the post-1979 constitution. Her defence of political dissidents, juvenile offenders on death row, and the Nobel peace prize-winner, Shirin Ebadi, brought fame and persecution. In 2010 Sotoudeh was detained in Tehran’s Evin prison, accused of “acting against national security” and “spreading propaganda”. She endured harsh and lengthy interrogations and, despite the obvious bias of her accusers in Iran’s intelligence ministry, was sentenced to 11 years behind bars. She was released in 2013 after an apparent intervention by Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s newly elected, politically moderate president and an international campaign waged on her behalf. In 2012, she had been awarded the European parliament’s Sakharov prize. Now she has been targeted again as Iran’s political climate deteriorates. Sotoudeh’s arrest at her Tehran home on Wednesday follows her latest confrontation with Iran’s judiciary over attempts to limit a defendant’s access to a lawyer in security-related cases. Only a handful of lawyers will be allowed in future to take on cases involving activists and dissidents, and they must first be state-approved. The judiciary’s move is illegal. Iran’s constitution sets no limits or conditions on the right to legal counsel. Article 35 states: “Both parties to a lawsuit have the right in all courts of law to select an attorney”. But Sadegh Larijani, head of the judiciary, says the new restrictions are in the public interest. Sotoudeh’s reaction was withering. “In the past, political suspects had a limited right to defend themselves and lawyers could take up their cases and carry out their professional duties, despite all the dangers they faced. But now, even that limited right is being completely eliminated,” she said earlier this month. After refusing a court summons in November, she insisted she was exercising her freedom of expression “within the boundaries of the law”. She added: “It really doesn’t matter what I am accused of. I know I will not be treated fairly by the judiciary.” Amid reports that Sotoudeh has already been sentenced without trial to five years, international condemnation has been swift. “The Iranian judiciary should cease its cowardly and unlawful actions of jailing and harassing human rights lawyers,” said Hadi Ghaemi of the independent, US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran. Amnesty International called Sotoudeh’s arrest an outrage. Sotoudeh has also been leading the defence of women threatened with draconian punishments for defying customary rules governing the wearing of the hijab in public. Since December 2017, dozens of women have been violently attacked and arrested for peacefully protesting against “compulsory veiling”. Since Vida Movahed removed her white headscarf and waved it like a flag during a demonstration in Tehran, what Sotoudeh calls a “national movement” has gathered pace, spearheaded by the “Girls of Revolution Street” campaigners and online groups such as My Stealthy Freedom. Sotoudeh represents Narges Hosseini, a protester charged with “encouraging immorality or prostitution” by removing her scarf. She faces up to 10 years in jail and 74 lashes. “Ms Hosseini objects to the forced hijab and considers it her legal right to express her protest,” Sotoudeh said in February. “She is not prepared to say she is sorry.” The crackdown on dissent follows demonstrations across Iran in December that were sparked by economic woes but quickly became anti-regime in nature. It also comes in the context of a losing battle by European countries to maintain lines of communication with Rouhani after Donald Trump reneged on the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed swingeing sanctions, and implied support for forcible regime change. Trump argued his action would force Iran to change its behaviour for the better. Instead, conservative hardliners appear to be extending their grip on Iranian society as part of a renewed bid to undermine the moderate forces around Rouhani. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian citizen held since 2016, is another innocent victim of this struggle. After her release from jail, Sotoudeh, who is married with two children, told me in Tehran in 2014 about her incarceration and the solitary horrors she was forced to endure.

Gündoğan, who has both a German and a Turkish passport, signed his shirt: “To my president, with my respects.” During recent national friendlies, Özil and Gündoğan were booed by German fans – and reprimanded, but ultimately backed, by the German Football Association. They have been told they can expect more animosity from fans as the tournament progresses. There are good reasons why you might boo a football star who meets Erdoğan. Given his record of human rights abuses and dictatorial tendencies, it’s the kind of photo-opportunity you should turn down. As Sevim Dağdelen, a leftwing German MP of Turkish descent, pointed out: “It’s a crude foul to pose with the despot Erdoğan in a luxury hotel in London and dignify him with the title ‘my president’, while in Turkey democrats are persecuted and critical journalists are detained.” But there are poor reasons to boo them too. Some, in Germany and elsewhere, struggle with the notion of multiple national identities – that people, particularly those with a history of immigration in their family, might feel an allegiance to more than one country. “Integration is supposed to be give and take,” Zelika Baba, a Berlin-based youth worker of Kurdish and Aramaean descent, once told me. “But they just want us to give up our culture. It doesn’t matter how long you’ve lived here – whether you were born here or whether you speak German – you’re always a foreigner. They talk about us, but they never talk with us.” MPs for the hard right Alternative für Deutschland have seized the moment to question not just the players’ decision, but their authenticity. “Why is Gündoğan playing for the German national team when he recognises Erdoğan as his president?” asked one. The World Cup is upon us, showcasing not just some of the greatest footballing talent but also giving free rein to the rawest and deepest anxieties both within nations and between them. During a period of heightened nationalism in Europe, we are about to enter a month of ostentatious flag-waving and anthem-singing, and momentary, patriotic euphoria, delusion or disappointment – often all of them. “The imagined community of millions,” the historian Eric Hobsbawm once wrote, “seems more real as a team of 11 people.” The trouble is that the reality – as seen on the football field – often fails to match up to the imagination, tended to over decades of mythology. These tensions need not necessarily have anything to do with race or ethnicity. When Italy failed to qualify for this tournament for the first time in 60 years, some put it down to corruption, comparing themselves unfavourably to Germany “which follows the rules”. In 2002 Ireland captain Roy Keane was sent home after he told the team manager, Mick McCarthy: “I didn’t rate you as a player, I don’t rate you as a manager, and I don’t rate you as a person. You’re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. I’ve got no respect for you.” Those who dismissed this as just one more tantrum of the overpaid and uncouth missed the parallels with the broader ruptures in Ireland at the time, argued commentator Fintan O’Toole. “[Keane] is the perfect exemplar of the new Celtic Tiger Ireland ... Like the new Ireland, he is rich, upwardly mobile and driven by a ruthless work ethic ... Around it there is the lingering legacy of a relatively poor society in which it made sense to be grateful for small mercies.” But given the nature of Europe’s anxieties and the fact that, outside of the criminal justice system and unemployment lines, football teams are one of the few places where minorities are likely to be overrepresented, issues of racial, ethnic and national identity often feature heavily. Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes the reason he has been left out of the Swedish team has little to do with his injury. “I do not have a typical Swedish name and I do not have the typical Swedish attitude and behaviour.” The most diverse English squad to date, wary of the notoriety of racism in the Russian stands, posed with Show Racism the Red Card signs. Interpretations of what these moments might mean can be overdone. When France won the World Cup in Paris in 1998 with a very multiracial and multi-ethnic team, the nation came out to celebrate. “What better example of our unity and our diversity than this magnificent team,” said the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin. Apparently we don’t always learn from our examples. Four years later Jean-Marie Le Pen, the then leader of Front National, entered the presidential election runoff after beating Jospin into third place. Eight years after that, in South Africa, the entire French team went on strike after a black player was sent home for insubordination. The philosopher Alain Finkielkraut echoed many a racist when he compared that team to youths rioting in the working-class suburbs. “We now have proof that the French team is not a team at all, but a gang of hooligans that knows only the morals of the mafia,” he said. Herein lies a central tenet of western racism. When diversity is related to something successful then it is a sign of the nation’s genius in allowing, nurturing and managing it; when it is attached to a national calamity, diversity is the reason for the failure. Some, in Italy, have predictably blamed their poor showing this year on “foreigners”. “Too many foreigners on the field,” Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League, tweeted. “#StopInvasion, and more space for Italian guys, also on the soccer field.” But in few places is Hobsbawm’s “imagined community” more apparent than England, where “the team of 11 people” doesn’t stand as a proxy for national identity – it is virtually its sole exemplar. Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who have assemblies or parliaments, England rarely exists in a material form apart from as a football and rugby team. (The cricket team can include players from throughout the UK and Ireland.) This is particularly unfortunate because it concentrates the “nation’s” identity in a sport which, thanks to former glory, promises unrealistic nostalgic pretensions of greatness that are unlikely to be repeated. Sound familiar? The problem is not that we underperform but that we have actually found our level. “England do just fine,” wrote Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski in their book Why England Lose. “They perform even better than expected, given what they have to start with.” So England has an inflated sense of its own capacity based on a gilded past – a fact it constantly struggles to come to terms with. Whether it crashes out in the first round or goes all the way, rest assured, however England fares will be seized on – by half the country – as a metaphor for Brexit. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/14/five-teenagers-jailed-killing-kent-gang-rivalry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T15:01:00Z","webTitle":"Five teenagers jailed for killing boy in Kent gang rivalry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/14/five-teenagers-jailed-killing-kent-gang-rivalry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/14/five-teenagers-jailed-killing-kent-gang-rivalry","fields":{"headline":"Five teenagers jailed for killing boy in Kent gang rivalry","bodyText":"Five teenagers have been given prison sentences of between 16 and 24 years for stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death as part of a gang turf war in Kent. A number of tit-for-tat attacks between teenagers in Medway towns unfolded over the course of some months last year, Maidstone crown court heard. A group of teenagers from a rival gang descended upon Kyle Yule, 17, “like vultures” during a revenge attack on 6 October in Gillingham. After he was chased from a parked car and stabbed five times, the teenager died on the operating table in the early hours of the next morning. “This was a revenge attack,” said the sentencing judge Adele Williams. “It was a senseless, ruthless and calculated killing, for which not one of you has at any stage shown any sign of remorse.” She handed them all sentences of detention for life. Yule’s mother, Nikki, who burst into tears as she read a victim impact statement to the court, labelled her son’s killers “cowards” and said they had “ruined lives for ever”. “Kyle was loving, kind-hearted, warm, funny, handsome and full of life,” she said. “He was my best friend. You were cowards running around with weapons. How dare you sit there and look forward to your birthdays. “I had to arrange a funeral for my son when I should have been planning his 18th birthday.” Victor Maibvisira, 19, Shezakia Daley, 18, both of Gillingham; Tyler Ralph, of Hertfordshire, and Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, of Sittingbourne, both 17; and 16-year-old Jordan Dania, of Croydon, were all convicted of his murder after an eight-week trial. Some of the defendants’ relatives, who were sat in the packed courtroom, fell to the floor in tears as they were led away. None of the defendants reacted to their sentences. The sentences will be served in youth detention centres until the defendants turn 21. The ringleader, Maibvisira, will serve a minimum term of 24 years, while the others will each serve a minimum term of 16 years. The judge warned that they may never be released. During the trial, the court heard that the five defendants, including Maibvisira who was known by his tag name V, were on East Street when they encountered a Renault Clio with Yule inside. In an effort to force him out of the vehicle, a witness said the “group were smashing the car as if they were possessed”. Yule escaped from the car and ran towards his best friend’s home where he was knocked to the ground and attacked in the front garden. A witness told officers the group chasing him “were on him like vultures, kicking and punching him”. There had been a string of disputes between the two groups before the attack, the trial heard, but Kent police has insisted the killing was not gang-related and there is not a problem with gangs in the area. The court heard that Yule was affiliated with a gang named G10 in Gillingham, while the defendants were a part of C4 in Chatham. Both groups are described as gangs in a Medway council report into tackling gang violence. There were two fatal stabbings in the conurbation of Medway last year, including Yule’s, which were among 73 overall across the town. DCI Ivan Beasley said: “These were two separate groups of former friends who fell out over something as small as a push bike and the defendants’ response was to attack a young man with knives.” He said they behaved “in an appalling manner with no regard for his life”. Akinwunmi-Streets, Daley, Ralph and Dania were granted anonymity during the trial due to their age but after the verdict the judge allowed their names and the towns in which they lived to be reported in the interests of “open justice”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/14/readers-recommend-share-songs-about-kings","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T19:00:06Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend: share songs about kings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/14/readers-recommend-share-songs-about-kings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/14/readers-recommend-share-songs-about-kings","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend: share songs about kings","bodyText":"We’ve had a couple of goes at covering royalty with readers recommend playlists over the years – but this time it’s just the kings we’re looking for.

GWR then confirmed a reservation had been made for the second bike and that a ticket was not necessary as all I had to do was give the train guard the reservation number. That also turns out to be not true. When I arrived at the station with my daughter and two bikes, the guard refused to allow us to board without a ticket for the second bike.

Olaf Zimmermann, who heads the German cultural council, an umbrella group for organisations from art galleries to television companies, said public broadcasters needed to step back and rethink a format that has helped cement gloom-ridden public attitudes towards refugees and Islam, and propelled the Alternative für Deutschland party into parliament at last September’s election. “I’d suggest for them, take a break for a year ... though the length of the intermission isn’t the decisive factor. What is crucial is that they return with new talkshow concepts and try to come up with more suitable contents with regards to social cohesion in our society,” Zimmermann said, arguing that the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF were obsessed with refugee-related issues, often framing them negatively. The cultural council, which is taxpayer funded, has pointed out that since 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis when almost a million refugees and migrants entered Germany, more than 100 political talk shows have put a topic related to migration at the centre of their discussion. Since September’s election, which saw the AfD enter the Bundestag for the first time, much debate has surrounded the extent to which framing an issue, or lending a topic a certain perspective, might have helped their cause. Television analysts have argued that the issue of refugees has been dealt with in a mostly negative way. TV bosses have defended their formats, admitting the intensity of the refugee debate led to the topic being far more widely discussed in 2015 and 2016 than ever before, but arguing that it was no longer a dominant theme. Even last week, however, ARD’s main talkshow Hart Aber Fair - Hard But Fair - led with the question: “To what extent is it possible to integrate young men who have fled from war and archaic societies? How unsafe is Germany as a result of them?” The programme was triggered by the murder of a 14-year-old German girl whose body was discovered in Wiesbaden last week. The 20-year-old Iraqi man suspected of her rape and murder was extradited from Iraq to Germany this week to face trial. Zimmermann said in too many cases refugees were unfairly presented as a threat to German society. The production team of Hart Aber Fair said it rejected the accusation that they had unfairly labelled all refugees as dangerous. “As journalists we find the concept of framing alien to us. We are simply trying to represent the issues which are occupying people, for what they are,” they said. A recent talkshow moderated by the veteran host Sandra Maischberger was advertised in TV listings with the title: “Are we too tolerant towards Islam?” Critics were quick to pounce on the word “we” as being problematic because it suggested “them and us”. The programme’s title was swiftly changed to: The Islam debate: where does our tolerance end? Other recent talkshow topics included ones entitled Refugees and criminality, and Beethoven or Burka? Kai Hafez, a media analyst, said that immigration was rarely presented in talkshows as anything other than negative. “The viewers get used to these negative expressions, and long-term that way the rightwing populists manage to press their points home,” he told Der Spiegel. For their part, the AfD – whose representatives are relative newcomers on the talkshow circuit, the party only having been founded in 2014 – have been deeply critical of the extent to which they are excluded from TV debates. Last week that impression was only intensified after Alexander Gauland, the party’s leader, had his invitation to appear on Hart Aber Fair withdrawn in protest at his description of the Nazi era as the equivalent of “a bird shit” in the context of “more than 1,000 years of successful German history”. AfD supporters reacted to the ban with fury on social media, calling it part of a campaign to squeeze the party off the airwaves. Typically a German talkshow concentrates on a single topic for 60 to 90 minutes. Guests invariably include media representatives, at least one member of the cabinet and opposition politicians. Many media watchers have long been critical of the extent to which the arguably tired and unimaginative format dominates German television, accusing programme makers of choosing it because it is cheap – despite Germany having one of the highest licence fees in the world – and blaming it in part for the dramatic fall in viewers in recent years. Controllers of the broadcasters have hit back. “We believe the talk shows are an enriching part of our programming,” Rainald Becker, the editor-in-chief of the ARD told Die Welt. “Of course we discuss Islam now and then, but we also have other topics such as housing, the collapse of bee colonies or the shortage of carers. “And to those who want to complain, I say to them: you know that there’s an off switch.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/12/deliveroo-chases-just-eat-with-plan-to-sign-up-5000-uk-eateries","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"Deliveroo chases Just Eat with plan to sign up 5,000 UK eateries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/deliveroo-chases-just-eat-with-plan-to-sign-up-5000-uk-eateries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/12/deliveroo-chases-just-eat-with-plan-to-sign-up-5000-uk-eateries","fields":{"headline":"Deliveroo chases Just Eat with plan to sign up 5,000 UK eateries","bodyText":"Deliveroo is planning to expand in the UK this year by signing up 5,000 eateries who use their own delivery fleets in a direct challenge to Just Eat. Until now, only restaurants that agreed to use Deliveroo’s network of 15,000 couriers could be listed on the fast-growing takeaway app. The London-based food delivery company said it expected to take on thousands more couriers as a result of the change in policy, as it would offer restaurants with their own fleets the option of using Deliveroo’s riders at busy times. Deliveroo faces two legal challenges over the employment status of its couriers with a high court ruling on one expected this week. However, the company’s founder, Will Shu, said it would not have been able to quickly build such a large fleet of couriers if they were fully employed. He said that, according to the company’s own figures, 90% of the group’s riders around the world valued the flexibility, which enabled them to access Deliveroo’s system whenever they wanted to work. “Whatever we can do to preserve that flexibility is the most important thing to me. If we can work with the government, and governments around the world, to enable benefits alongside flexibility and end this alleged trade off between these two things; that is something I would strongly welcome,” he said. Shu said Deliveroo’s new service would enable users to choose from 50% more restaurants. The “long-term 10-year goal”, Shu said, was to become “the definitive food company”, making the Deliveroo name synonymous with takeaway delivery in the same way Amazon has done for e-commerce or Google for web search. Deliveroo’s step into territory dominated by Just Eat comes weeks after the FTSE 100-listed online takeaway firm said it was planning to launch its own delivery fleetin the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It also comes as Deliveroo struggles to meet ambitions for its “dark kitchens”, which enable restaurants to set up a delivery-only service from cheap rented kitchen “pods”. Shu said its Editions business remained “a huge part of bringing more selection to customers”. The company currently operates 74 dark kitchens from 14 sites in the UK, up from 66 at 11 sites in October last year – but well short of the 200-plus kitchens it had hoped to have opened by now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/13/were-just-trying-to-survive-it-russian-cities-brace-for-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:09:21Z","webTitle":"'We're just trying to survive it': Russian cities brace for World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/were-just-trying-to-survive-it-russian-cities-brace-for-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/were-just-trying-to-survive-it-russian-cities-brace-for-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"'We're just trying to survive it': Russian cities brace for World Cup","bodyText":"On a riverboat between the World Cup cities of Kazan and Samara last month, a Russian couple in their 50s asked earnestly whether “all these rumours” about Moscow’s poisoning of Sergei Skripal could lead the west to boycott or cancel the tournament. “Russians don’t surrender to pressure like that, we push back hard,” said Yevgeny Prigov, a hefty businessman who trades in machine parts, echoing a popular Russian cliche. Their belief, summarised, was that the west wants to see Russia fall on its face when it hosts the World Cup this month, and that Russia would pull it off in spite of its guests. It’s a bit like inviting your enemies over for dinner: the best revenge is a five-star meal. “This is supposed to be a prazdnik,” or celebration, said his wife, Maria, sipping a lager. “And that’s what we’re going to give them.” For the defiant World Cup hosts, this month’s celebration of football comes amid its worst relations with the west since the cold war, after the annexation of Crimea, accusations of interfering in US elections, and the recent nerve agent attack in Salisbury. There was a time when Russia saw prestige sporting competitions like the World Cup or the Olympics as an occasion to woo the west and seek acceptance into a club of great nations. Russia still paid lip service to detente when it was awarded the tournament in 2010, and championed a reset with the US under its liberal-ish president Dmitry Medvedev. But forget about rehabilitating Vladimir Putin through sport now. “Russia is so toxic that the Mundial [World Cup] can’t help Putin to change anything, including his image,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst and senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre. Not that anyone here much cares. Defiance to the west has been enshrined in public policy and the national media since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, with officials wearing western sanctions as a badge of respect. On national television last week, Putin said that the main reason he had not sacked Vitaly Mutko, the disgraced former sports minister, was because the west wanted him out. “We know what kind of attack was made against him in connection with the doping scandal,” Putin said. “Under those kinds of circumstances, it is not possible to have him retire.” The main intrigue of Russia’s World Cup will likely be how Russia’s regional cities cope with the influx of tens of thousands of fans, many of them seeing foreign tourists on this scale for the first time in their history. Security will be extreme. The rule with prazdniki is that they mustn’t be spoiled, not by protests, provocations, faulty planning or poor security. “The best [Putin] can do in terms of soft power is to properly organise the championship without unpleasant episodes, especially in the security sphere, and get some pure pleasure from sports,” said Kolesnikov. Russian officials still bristle when they recall gleeful foreign coverage of a “double toilet”, two commodes in a single stall, at the Biathlon centre ahead of the 2014 Sochi Olympics. To the west, it was a symbol of slapdash planning or official corruption. To Russia, it was a construction mistake blown out of proportion. A person close to the Kremlin said that the Russian leader played up the geopolitical nature of the Olympics to justify the criticism over massive expenditures, a reported $50bn, to remake the Black Sea city of Sochi. “There were a lot of questions about why it was costing so much, so he came out and said it’s about promoting Russian values and developed a narrative behind it,” the person said. By contrast, the World Cup, costing an estimated $14bn across 11 cities according to the respected RBC business daily, has kicked up less fuss. Among the reasons? The country’s main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who publicises reports on official corruption, was sentenced to 30 days in jail last month, and will only be let out after the opening day of the tournament. Regionally, it’s a moment for leaders across Russia to preen. Down in Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov has already secured his photo op with Mo Salah, the world’s most famous Muslim footballer, as he leverages the World Cup in his push to be Putin’s envoy to the Middle East. Kadyrov reportedly had the Liverpool star summoned from his hotel, where he was asleep, for the meet-and-greet on the Grozny pitch. In regions across Russia, local officials have gladly taken the money offered for new stadiums and urban development, while also gritting their teeth for the daunting prospect of ensuring an incident-free tournament. “Where are you from?” growled the governor of Volgograd, a veteran of the first Chechen war, when I asked him about fan safety ahead of last month’s Russian Cup finals between FC Tosno and FC Avangard Kursk. “I assure you we are taking every possible precaution to ensure their safety.” It wasn’t an overstatement. The city has closed streets and shut public transport for several kilometres around the stadium during games. The security measures and other preparations are so extensive that match days have been declared public holidays because no one can get to work. Residents in one apartment block in Yekaterinburg have been told not to use their balconies, open their windows or stand near their windows on match days, in case they’re mistaken for attackers and shot by police snipers, Reuters reported. “To be honest we’re just trying to survive it,” Olga Khavanskaya, a schoolteacher, told me in Volgograd during the city’s Victory Day parade. “There’s this feeling like the city has been ripped up from the ground and flipped over. The city looks better than I can ever recall … but I’m ready for it all to be over.” Even the hooligans are under lock and key. “We’ve pretty much been sidelined,” Kostya, a member of a CSKA firm, told me in a Moscow pub recently. It’s a tightrope walk, a vast balancing act across 11 cities, and your greatest rivals have front-row seats. Perhaps deep down, the Kremlin may still hope that a successful tournament will earn recognition. But the real concern is not screwing up. So don’t ruin the prazdnik."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/12/the-allegations-against-wpps-former-chief-martin-sorrell-pile-up","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T16:22:18Z","webTitle":"The allegations against WPP's former chief, Martin Sorrell, pile up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/12/the-allegations-against-wpps-former-chief-martin-sorrell-pile-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/12/the-allegations-against-wpps-former-chief-martin-sorrell-pile-up","fields":{"headline":"The allegations against WPP's former chief, Martin Sorrell, pile up","bodyText":"Several allegations have emerged about Sir Martin Sorrell in the wake of his resignation as chief executive of advertising giant WPP, which was investigating claims of personal misconduct. A company probe is understood to have found no evidence that company money was misused. As reports have emerged about the circumstances surrounding Sorrell’s exit, allegations about his conduct have piled up. Sorrell strenuously denies any wrongdoing. Allegations about his conduct, revealed in an account of his departure by the Financial Times, include: Two employees saw him entering a premises in London’s Shepherd Market, Mayfair, that is occupied by sex workers for the purposes of their trade. That WPP staff were concerned he may have used company funds to pay for the alleged visit, after previously having concerns about his use of expenses. Sorrell had a reputation for bullying his executive assistants and had created a fear culture at the company’s headquarters. Staff feared he was misusing company resources for himself and his wife Cristiana. He sacked his long-serving chauffeur on the spot after the driver refused to start work at 7am, five hours after driving Cristiana home. Sorrell’s representatives told the FT that “great care and attention” was always taken by the company and the chief executive over his expenses and that he “denies there was any misuse of funds”. A spokesman previously told the Guardian: “Sir Martin signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down which precludes him from discussing any of the circumstances surrounding his departure. He has rigidly adhered to this obligation and will continue to do so. “As regards the allegations [that company funds were paid to a sex worker], Sir Martin strenuously denies them.

Don’t scoff so quickly. It’s true that when it comes to equinox and solstice-watching, we tend to think first and foremost about ancient sites, from the pyramids of Giza to Angkor Wat. For the British, all eyes turn towards Stonehenge, where, viewed from the centre of the stone circle at dawn, the sun rises directly above the Heel stone in more or less perfect alignment. But do you really want to be a part of what English Heritage, doing its bureaucratic best to get into the vibe, is calling Summer Solstice Managed Open Access? Me neither. Stonehenge? Stonehasbeen more like. Milton Keynes may once have evoked images of suburban dystopia with endless roundabouts, concrete cows and grey-faced commuters waiting for the 07:22 to Euston, but there’s another side to MK. If you don’t fancy hanging with patchouli-scented pagans, wildly dressed wiccans, staff-bearing druids, new age spiritualists and red-eyed stoners at Stonehenge, then this carefully planned town might offer a more original spot in which to worship the rising sun on the longest day of the year. For hidden among its many distinctions (22 million trees and shrubs, 20,000 parking spaces, 130 roundabouts, home to WD-40 lubricant production) is the sensational secret that it was actually designed as “a mystic portal to a higher realm”. Who knew? Top: Milton Keynes; Midsummer Boulevard is the central dual carriageway running top to bottom. Below, druids and shamans at Stonehenge. Photos: APS/Alamy/Geoff CaddickAFP/Getty/Kim Ludbrook/EPA It turns out that the eastern end of Midsummer Boulevard, which runs south-west to north-east from the train station, past a Holiday Inn, a Jobcentre Plus, the Centre:MK shopping mall, the Yong Yu Chinese supermarket, the Post Office and ending at Milton Keynes theatre, is perfectly aligned with the rising sun on summer solstice. Having consulted Greenwich Observatory on the precise coordinates required to bring this about, the town’s architects encouraged the engineers to shift the urban grid a few degrees. Job done. One solstice they celebrated with an all-night bonfire, tunes from Pink Floyd and suitable quantities of marijuana – this was the 70s, after all. But just as Brits can claim no monopoly on the sun in our low-skied, grey-clouded land, so ancient humans all over the world refashioned their own built environments to mark and celebrate important solar moments in the calendar. A recent study by the Italian archaeoastronomer Giulio Magli suggested that Alexandria’s main east-west Canopic Way may have been built deliberately to align with the sun on Alexander the Great’s birthday. Ireland has Newgrange, a staggering Neolithic monument built around 3,200BC, giving it boasting rights over both Stonehenge and the pyramids of Giza, which were built later. Each winter solstice the rising sun enters through the “roofbox” within the great, grassed mound, which is considered part passage tomb and part temple, and for around 17 minutes bathes the inner chamber in a breathtaking fulgor of light. Last year the event was livestreamed for the first time on 21 December, but sadly the sun failed to show up. Newgrange, a Neolithic monument built around 3,200BC.

Their mastery of maths and astronomy is seen to spectacular effect in the Pyramid of Kukulkan, which dominates the centre of the pre-Columbian city of Chichen Itza on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. Built around AD1000, it has 91 steps on each of its four faces, the final temple on its summit giving a total of 365, the number of days in the Mayan year. The pyramid also appears to have been constructed to produce a stunning visual effect. At sunset on every spring and autumn equinox, light slants across the stepped pyramid and creates a snakelike shadow that for around five hours slowly steals its way down the structure in what is quite possibly a solar tribute to the feathered snake god Kukulkan, whose likeness is sculpted across the monument. 12th-century temple at Angkor Wat in Cambodia discovered in 1976 that onlookers standing by the western entrance gate on the spring equinox see the sun rise directly over the top of the central tower. It seemed, in Nasa’s words, that the architect had “encoded calendrical, historical and cosmological themes into his architectural plan for the temple”.

Photograph: Alamy Americans must not be left out of the world’s solstice celebrations. Which is why New Yorkers can now celebrate “Manhattanhenge”, a term popularised by the American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. It happens around the time of the summer solstice, when sunsets are sensationally framed between glowing skyscrapers on the street grid laid out 29 degrees east of true north, as specified by the Commissioners’ Plan of 1811. Over the past couple of centuries, Manhattan’s once derided utilitarian grid has come to be widely admired and embraced. “This is the purpose of New York’s geometry: that each individual should be poetically the owner of the capital of the world,” wrote the French literary philosopher Roland Barthes in 1959. And a lesser known bonus of this economic street plan is Manhattanhenge, in the run-up to which the New York Times now publishes a brief guide advising its readers where and when to take “the best sunset picture of the year”. The summer solstice by definition transcends borders, religions, ethnicities. It unites rather than divides. Reassuringly, it harks back to a time long before Hinduism and Buddhism had entered the world’s consciousness, far earlier than the three great Abrahamic faiths that divided the planet’s population into rival God-fearing monotheists. In our endlessly, celestially revolving world the solstice demands a moment of stillness and reflection. Its very etymology – from the Latin sol (sun) and sistere (to stand still) – indicates that almost miraculous point of transition, sandwiched between cycles of movement, when the sun appears from Earth to have reached its most northerly or southerly excursion relative to the celestial equator and then, after “standing still”, reverses course. It is the longest day, the triumph of the sun, a celebration of midsummer and a marker that the days will start to shorten. For a fleeting moment the entire year is on hold, a moment of flux and suspense beautifully caught in Margaret Atwood’s Solstice Poem: This is the solstice, the still point of the sun, its cusp and midnight, the year’s threshold and unlocking, where the past lets go of and becomes the future; the place of caught breath, the door of a vanished house left ajar. Manhattanhenge illuminates New York’s 34th Street. Photo: Charles Mostoller / Barcroft USA The summer solstice once marked the beginning of calendars, the season of harvest, the ancient middle of summer: a time to celebrate fertility and the life-giving strength of the sun in a pre-industrial environment. In today’s less rural world, for many people that ancient connection with the cycle of nature has been lost. Yet our fascination with the solstice remains curiously undimmed, as though deeply embedded in our ancestral memory. Perhaps, then, it is not altogether surprising that hidden within the urban fabric of the world’s cities are solstice-friendly streets aligned with sunrise and sunset on the summer and winter solstices. There can surely be few more dedicated urban solstice sleuths than Demeter Sztanko, a Ukrainian data engineer based in London. He says after getting into conversations “too often” about druids, freemasons and streets aligned towards the solstice, he decided to use his data-mining talents to create “a tool that helps to find out the truth. As I work in data analysis and love maps, that sounded like a great idea.” The result is his painstaking list On Solstices and City Planning, a compilation of 694 cities worldwide that contain streets thus aligned. Streets that run broadly south-west to north-east are aligned with summer solstice sunrises and winter solstice sunsets. Those that run south-east to north-west correspond to summer solstice sunsets and winter solstice sunrises. Europe contains the largest number of such cities (226), followed by North America (168), Asia (131) and Africa (55). Sztanko is confident he has logged every city on the planet. “It is pure math,” he says. “I am using OpenStreetMap as the primary geodata provider, which is like Wikipedia for maps, free, open-source and accurate.” Druids gather on Primrose Hill, London for the autumn equinox. Photo: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty The UK has 21 cities on Sztanko’s list, mostly the largest ones like London, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Sheffield, Liverpool and Leeds. There may be a clue here in these cities’ sheer size. In other words, in vast, sprawling cities it may be inevitable that some streets are solstice-friendly. Tantalisingly, the jury is still out on the million-dollar question. Are these selected streets in 694 cities laid out like this by accident or design? Sztanko says he is still trying to find out. He is receiving so many emails from all over the world that he is “overwhelmed by the interest” in his site. Disappointingly for Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire’s greatest “new town” does not make the list, even after a direct appeal from the Guardian. Sztanko says his calculations are based on half the sun being visible, which may explain the absence of Midsummer Boulevard from his compilation. Be that as it may, summer solstice in Milton Keynes will be on Thursday 21 June at 11:07. No druids expected.

On Tuesday, the five-term Republican from Louisiana returned to the Capitol. He was welcomed with a standing ovation – from both parties. “It was one of the very few moments in my life, from the birth of my kids and marriage … that [I] will always remember,” Scalise said. “There were days where I [wasn’t] sure I was going to be able to do that – to be able to walk back on to the House floor on my own, with my crutches.” In an interview with journalists from Politico, Scalise reflected on the shooting and his views on the second amendment. “Those were some dark days,” he said. “You could take a bear down with the bullet I was hit with. When I looked at the caliber bullet, I was amazed I was still alive. Frankly, there are a lot of miracles that happened along the way.” Scalise said the experience reinforced his support for gun rights. “I was a strong supporter of the second amendment before the shooting,” he said, “and frankly, as ardent as ever after the shooting in part because I was saved by people who had guns. “They saved my life. But they also saved the lives of every other member. There were over a dozen members of Congress and staffers who would have been executed. That was the intention of the shooter.” There was no “magic bill” that would stop shootings, he said, criticizing Democrats for rushing to pass gun control measures. In the days after the shooting, Scalise said, he received calls from leaders including Donald Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. On several occasions, Scalise said, he answered calls from “weird numbers” and was connected to the president. Netanyahu, he said, spoke about his brother, who was killed during a raid to rescue hostages at Entebbe airport in Uganda. Bono also called to offer good wishes to Scalise, who is a U2 fan, and stopped by the congressman’s office to take photos with members of staff. Scalise batted away speculation about his political ambitions, repeating that he would not challenge the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, to succeed Paul Ryan as House speaker. He firmly ruled out running for governor in Louisiana. On issues from North Korea to this year’s midterms, Scalise largely stuck to the Republican script. He repeatedly touted the tax cut package passed in December and teased “tax cuts 2.0”, which he said would come before the midterm elections in November. Asked if Republicans’ uncompromising position on gun laws could cost them a generation of voters, Scalise said young people benefited the most from the GOP tax plan and that the priority of most Americans was the economy. He also expressed confidence that an effort to force a series of votes on immigration, led by moderate Republicans, would not work. The congressman, who is working with GOP leadership to block the effort, said the party was making a “lot of headway” on a compromise plan it believes could pass the House. It would be “devastating”, he said, if Republicans helped pass an immigration bill that protected young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers without concurrently tightening border security. Scalise mostly praised the president, insisting Trump is more focused on the Republican agenda than his Twitter feed might suggest. On North Korea, Scalise said he believed Trump would bring any agreement to Congress for approval, which he faulted former president Barack Obama for failing to do regarding the Iran nuclear deal. Despite a promising political landscape for Democrats, Scalise said he was optimistic about Republican chances of keeping control of the House. “I think we will keep the majority,” he said. “It’s for a lot of reasons, but the economy is the biggest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/13/strange-angel-series-jack-parsons-scientology","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"Science and sex cults: rocketeer Jack Parsons hits the small screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/13/strange-angel-series-jack-parsons-scientology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/13/strange-angel-series-jack-parsons-scientology","fields":{"headline":"Science and sex cults: rocketeer Jack Parsons hits the small screen","bodyText":"Making a television show is grueling, expensive and time-consuming, but it isn’t rocket science. Sometimes, though, as Mark Heyman points out, it’s pretty darn close. Heyman is referring to Strange Angel, a new series about the bizarre life of Jack Parsons, known in aeronautical circles as the father of modern day rocketry and to others as the Thelemite occultist who crossed paths with self-proclaimed prophet Aleister Crowley and Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard. Parsons’ life has already inspired two biographies, a graphic novel, and an episode of Comedy Central’s Drunk History. Now it’s the basis for a splashy new drama from A Ghost Story director David Lowery, set in 1930s Los Angeles, where the spirits of American enterprise and new age mysticism are alive and well. Those spirits converge, of course, in the ambitious, swaggering rocket engineer played by a mustachioed Jack Reynor. As the show begins, Parsons and his research partner Richard are trying to secure funding from California Institue of Technology (Caltech) for their studies on rocket propulsion. As it progresses, however, the plot sees him develop a fondness for ritualistic “sex magick” as part of a cult, making for an easily combustible series that mostly manages to rein in its own excesses. “Either aspect of the story, whether it’s the birth of American rocketry or the world of underground, occult LA, was enormously challenging,” admits Heyman, who began developing the series after being sent George Pendle’s 2005 biography of Parsons four years ago. “They start out as fairly separate worlds, but as Jack starts to straddle them both, we see how his experiences in the occult influence his rocketry work and vice versa.” Heyman, best known for co-writing Black Swan, felt a personal connection to the story, having been raised in New Mexico by hippie, new age parents in touch with their spirituality and the counterculture. Down the road from their home in the desert was the Los Alamos National Lab, the birthplace of the Manhattan Project, and Heyman’s best friend’s step-father was an acclaimed chemist. “My childhood was in this weird intersection between science and mysticism,” he explains, “so when I read the biography of Jack Parsons it really struck a chord with me. And then, of course, there’s all these other fantastic elements to the story that weren’t a part of my childhood, like sex magick and L Ron Hubbard. So it was very much an immediate feeling of: ‘I need to be involved in this.’” Over a four-month period, Strange Angel was developed at AMC, where Heyman put together a writer’s room and ended up with scripts for the first eight episodes. But AMC, which was already producing shows like The Terror and The Son, worried it had too many period pieces in the pipeline, so Strange Angel was shopped around before it landed at CBS All Access, the network’s subscription-based streaming service. “It made a lot of sense,” says Heyman. “A story about a guy who was breaking new ground on a channel that was, likewise, starting to break new ground and reinvent themselves.” Shortly after partnering with CBS, Heyman and showrunner David DiGilio brought on Lowery, whose credits also include Ain’t Them Bodies Saints and Pete’s Dragon. His sensibility, the pair explains, dovetailed closely with their intention of capturing both the occult underbelly and wide-eyed idealism of post-recession, pre-war Los Angeles. “For me, all of David Lowery’s works are period pieces, and you don’t necessarily realize it because he’s so good at making it feel fresh and current, updating it in a way that doesn’t feel like an artifice filter,” says Heyman. “We didn’t want a sepia-toned, nostalgic look at the past.” Production designer Warren Alan Young, DiGilio adds, “embraced the notion that LA was as much of an oil town as it was a Hollywood town”. As a result, the on-screen Parsons, charming but immodest, calls to mind The Aviator’s Howard Hughes and There Will Be Blood’s Daniel Plainview, themselves voracious, early 20th-century west coast entrepreneurs. Parsons, who’d go on to create Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab, was eventually poached by local Thelemites, followers of the occult religion founded by Crowley. The “bacchanalian, polyamorous” cult, as Heyman describes them, practiced sex rituals that involved the consumption of blood, semen and feces, believing orgasms to be pathways to higher consciousness. Parsons himself was particularly preoccupied with making manifest “Babalon”, the female messiah who he believed would come to Earth and ride on the back of the “Big Beast”, Crowley. Parsons’ integration into Thelema is stretched out over several unhurried episodes, but if Strange Angel occasionally plods along it’s only because the story needs time to gestate. Although their acquaintance isn’t featured in season one, Parsons will meet Hubbard, whose first wife Sara was the sister of Parsons’ first wife, played by Bella Heathcote. By the 1940s, Parsons was running Thelema’s California branch, consulting with Israel’s rocketry program and making an enemy of an American government subsumed in McCarthyist paranoia. In 1952, at the age of 37, Parsons died from injuries sustained in an explosion at his home laboratory. “This brief moment of freedom and exploration is replaced by the military-industrial complex and the bifurcating of the world between communist Russia and the United States,” says Heyman, who plans to show these changes in upcoming seasons. “That transition from the Crowley cult into what becomes Scientology mirrors a greater transition in the world at large, from greater forms of freedom and self-exploration into power being consolidated into systems of control.” In order to make Strange Angel accurate and accessible, Heyman and DiGilio included astrophysicists and chemists from Caltech in the writer’s room. But a rocket launch, they explain, might be better understood as a metaphor for Parsons himself. “A rocket is a very controlled explosion,” Heyman says. “You need a combustible part, but that explosion is always threatening to rip apart the whole thing. That idea, of someone trying to balance their explosive side with the side that needs to keep focus and in control, is the most fascinating aspect of the show to me.” Strange Angel starts on CBS All Access on 14 June with a UK date yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/13/trump-nafta-g7-sunset-clause-trade-agreement","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T05:57:55Z","webTitle":"Trump was right.

The rest of the G7 were wrong","bodyText":"He gets almost everything wrong. But last weekend Donald Trump got something right. To the horror of the other leaders of the rich world, he defended democracy against its detractors. Perhaps predictably, he has been universally condemned for it. His crime was to insist that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) should have a sunset clause. In other words, it should not remain valid indefinitely, but expire after five years, allowing its members either to renegotiate it or to walk away. To howls of execration from the world’s media, his insistence has torpedoed efforts to update the treaty. In Rights of Man, published in 1791, Thomas Paine argued that: “Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which preceded it. The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies.” This is widely accepted – in theory if not in practice – as a basic democratic principle. Even if the people of the US, Canada and Mexico had explicitly consented to Nafta in 1994, the idea that a decision made then should bind everyone in North America for all time is repulsive. So is the notion, championed by the Canadian and Mexican governments, that any slightly modified version of the deal agreed now should bind all future governments. But the people of North America did not explicitly consent to Nafta. They were never asked to vote on the deal, and its bipartisan support ensured that there was little scope for dissent. The huge grassroots resistance in all three nations was ignored or maligned. The deal was fixed between political and commercial elites, and granted immortality. In seeking to update the treaty, governments in the three countries have candidly sought to thwart the will of the people. Their stated intention was to finish the job before Mexico’s presidential election in July. The leading candidate, Andrés Lopez Obrador, has expressed hostility to Nafta, so it had to be done before the people cast their vote. They might wonder why so many have lost faith in democracy. Nafta provides a perfect illustration of why all trade treaties should contain a sunset clause. Provisions that made sense to the negotiators in the early 1990s make no sense to anyone today, except fossil fuel companies and greedy lawyers. The most obvious example is the way its rules for investor-state dispute settlement have been interpreted. These clauses (chapter 11 of the treaty) were supposed to prevent states from unfairly expropriating the assets of foreign companies. But they have spawned a new industry, in which aggressive lawyers discover ever more lucrative means of overriding democracy. The rules grant opaque panels of corporate lawyers, meeting behind closed doors, supreme authority over the courts and parliaments of its member states. A BuzzFeed investigation revealed they had been used to halt criminal cases, overturn penalties incurred by convicted fraudsters, allow companies to get away with trashing rainforests and poisoning villages, and, by placing foreign businesses above the law, intimidate governments into abandoning public protections. Under Nafta, these provisions have become, metaphorically and literally, toxic. When Canada tried to ban a fuel additive called MMT as a potentially dangerous neurotoxin, the US manufacturer used Nafta rules to sue the government. Canada was forced to lift the ban, and award the company $13m (£10m) in compensation. After Mexican authorities refused a US corporation permission to build a hazardous waste facility, the company sued before a Nafta panel, and extracted $16.7m in compensation. Another US firm, Lone Pine Resources, is suing Canada for $119m because the government of Quebec has banned fracking under the St Lawrence River. As the US justice department woke up to the implications of these rules in the 1990s, it began to panic: one official wrote that it “could severely undermine our system of justice” and grant foreign companies “more rights than Americans have”. Another noted: “No one thought about this when Nafta implementing law passed.” Nor did they think about climate breakdown. Nafta obliges Canada not only to export most of its oil and half its natural gas to the US, but also to ensure that the proportion of these fuels produced from tar sands and fracking does not change. As a result, the Canadian government cannot adhere to both its commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change and its commitments under Nafta. While the Paris commitments are voluntary, Nafta’s are compulsory. Were such disasters foreseen by the negotiators? If so, the trade agreement was a plot against the people. If not – as the evidence strongly suggests – its unanticipated outcomes are a powerful argument for a sunset clause. The update the US wanted was also a formula for calamity, that future governments might wish to reverse. But this is likely to be difficult, even impossible, without the threat of walking out. Those who defend the immortality of trade agreements argue that it provides certainty for business. It’s true that there is a conflict between business confidence and democratic freedom. This conflict is repeatedly resolved in favour of business. That the only defender of popular sovereignty in this case is an odious demagogue illustrates the corruption of 21st-century liberal democracy. There was much rejoicing this week over the photo of Trump being harangued by the other G7 leaders. But when I saw it, I thought: “The stitch-ups engineered by people like you produce people like him.” The machinations of remote elites in forums such as the G7, the IMF and the European Central Bank, and the opaque negotiation of unpopular treaties, destroy both trust and democratic agency, fuelling the frustration that demagogues exploit. Trump was right to spike the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He is right to demand a sunset clause for Nafta. When this devious, hollow, self-interested man offers a better approximation of the people’s champion than any other leader, you know democracy is in trouble. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/shortcuts/2018/jun/12/darkness-death-and-decay-the-eerie-appeal-of-the-ghost-town","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T16:35:34Z","webTitle":"Darkness, death and decay: the eerie appeal of the ghost town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2018/jun/12/darkness-death-and-decay-the-eerie-appeal-of-the-ghost-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/shortcuts/2018/jun/12/darkness-death-and-decay-the-eerie-appeal-of-the-ghost-town","fields":{"headline":"Darkness, death and decay: the eerie appeal of the ghost town","bodyText":"For a cool $1m (£750,000) you can own your own ghost town. That figure will buy you an entire abandoned settlement, the former mining town of Cerro Gordo in the Inyo Mountains of California: 300 acres of land, an empty hotel, a saloon, a chapel and the homes of miners who once dug for silver and lead. In the 1870s, it was a violent place that averaged a murder a week. Nowadays, its private owners operate public tours at $10 a head for thrill-seekers. From video games to horror movies and dystopian film and fiction, the ghost town comes wreathed with decrepit appeal. Its abandoned state leaves it ready to be filled by our imagination. Time has stopped; nature has started to overtake. The result is both a memento mori and a salutary lesson in our overweening presumption that our world is always progressing. The ghost town shows us the opposite. In his book The Rings of Saturn, the German émigré WG Sebald – who was well aware of the terrible ghost towns created by the second world war and the Holocaust – writes of the way settlements develop to the west, moving on towards the sun, leaving behind the derelict and the dispossessed once resources – and people – have been used up. This is certainly true of the US, where land is expendable and exploitation is the founding economy, evoking scenes of tumbleweed and Hitchcockian gothic. Detroit’s decayed status as Motown has left parts of the city vacated, as the car economy moved elsewhere, leaving entire districts prey to what has become known as “ruin porn”. In western Europe, the ravages of the Black Death – which took the lives of more than one-third of the continent’s medieval population – meant thousands of villages were abandoned and gave rise, eventually, to the darkness of the tales of the Brothers Grimm. In England, the Victorian visionary Richard Jefferies imagined a post apocalyptic metropolis in his book After London, in which the suburbs were quickly subsumed by nature. (In the alternative nightmare of another visionary, England Have My Bones by TH White, the opposite happens: London becomes so sprawling that the New Forest becomes a Tube stop). War and other military manoeuvres left British rural sites such as Tyneham in Dorset – evacuated for use as a training area in 1943 and never returned to its inhabitants – as skeletons of themselves, testaments to a forgotten mid-century and a kind of utopia. Patrick Wright, in his book The Village That Died For England, vividly describes Tyneham’s stone ruins lying in a “valley of lost causes”. He also notes that modern measures “taken to convert the village into a safe visitors’ attraction have disenchanted the place”. Health and safety have no place here. As the new owners of Cerro Gordo may learn, a tourist attraction is the antithesis of what such places symbolise: the defeat of our dominion and our attempts at civilisation, and the romantic allure of darkness, death and decay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/16/sarah-sze-afterimage-images-in-debris-feature-q-and-a","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T14:00:47Z","webTitle":"Sarah Sze: ‘I don’t do Twitter.

There’s enough information in my head already’","bodyText":"Sarah Sze (pronounced “Zee”) was born in Boston in 1969. She studied painting at New York’s School of Visual Arts but is now known for her sculptures and installations exploring ideas of time and space and the relentless flow of information of the digital age. She was awarded a MacArthur fellowship (AKA the “genius grant”) in 2003 and represented the US at the Venice Biennale in 2013. A professor of visual art at Columbia, Sze lives in New York with her husband, the writer and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee, and their two children. Her new show, Afterimage / Images in Debris, is at the Victoria Miro gallery in London until 28 July. You use a lot of everyday materials in your work, from milk cartons to potted plants and toilet roll… Are you always on the lookout for suitable objects? Yes. Images in Debris is very much about the leftovers of an experiment, so, for example, you see a broken egg. But it’s kind of Darwinian: things die out, things stay around, things get added. For this show, I’m interested in the idea that, in some ways, images have replaced objects. Now, for example, people send virtual candles for you to light, like where you’re in a church. Or an artist will say: “I want to make a sculpture, I need something red and soft”, but they see the material online first. So much of what we own materially, we make decisions about digitally, so there’s this interesting kind of confusion. Do you try to ration your exposure to the digital world? I couldn’t find you on social media, for example. I don’t do Twitter or Instagram or Facebook. I feel like there’s enough information in my head already. I photograph all the time – I’m totally subsumed by this melancholic way of trying to remember something better by photographing it – but the idea of then putting it [on social media] would be too all-consuming. However, I do go on Instagram and search for my work and see how other people see it. To me, that’s very interesting; it’s giving me the opportunity to see how the work is experienced. You started out as a painter. Why did you move into sculpture? I painted since I was little in a very academic way, from the figure mostly. When I went to graduate school it felt almost like an athletic thing, to be able to paint things with virtuosity, and I didn’t know why I was doing it except to say, “This is an academically strong painting.” So I started making sculpture from, I think, a painter’s perspective. Which had a lot to do with trying to harness a kind of improvisation that I found in painting. I’m trying to play with the idea of the live, of seeing process, in sculpture. Do you go far beyond the art world in search of inspiration? For Images in Debris, I was particularly interested in films about timekeeping – such as Powers of Ten by Charles and Ray Eames, which is about time and measurement of space through film, or Christian Marclay’s The Clock, or Chris Marker’s La Jetée, which people say was the instigator of Terminator. Your husband is a physician and has written books about cancer and genetic engineering. Is there much cross-pollination between your work? I read a lot of what he writes. When he was writing The Emperor of All Maladies, I was saying: “You have to explain to people what a cell is. You have to make it accessible to someone who studied biology in school 20 years ago.” He reads a lot of poetry, so when he looks at my work he might bring up a poem – there’s a cross-pollination of language around the work. He comes to my studio all the time. We actually met because he likes contemporary art. I was reading a Zadie Smith essay about your work [The Tattered Ruins of the Map, from Feel Free] and it gradually became clear that you know each other. Yes, I met her through an art critic, Hal Foster, and now we’re close friends with Zadie and Nick Laird, her husband, who is also a great writer. It all sounds very glamorous… Spending time with Zadie and Nick is always interesting; they are absolutely brilliant. But as for glamorous… My teacher, Ursula von Rydingsvard, she’s an artist, and her husband, Paul Greengard, is a Nobel prize-winning neuroscientist. I remember when I was a student, she was on stage and someone asked: “Ursula, you’re married to a scientist, you must have all these incredible conversations.” She said: “Yeah, I’m like, ‘Paul, did you play the plumbing bill?’” A few years ago, Zadie Smith hit back at a piece by Lauren Sandler in the Atlantic that said women should have just one child if they want to avoid limiting their careers. As a mother of two, what’s your take on that? Any way you do it is fine. If you’re a loving parent and you’re a role model for the child, have five if you want to. What do you do for fun? I do like to work a lot [laughs]. But I feel like my work is fun. And work and play are quite enmeshed for me – half of the photographs in the show were taken when I didn’t realise I was working."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theguardian/2018/jun/19/notes-queries-social-media-relationships","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T10:59:10Z","webTitle":"On balance, do social media create or destroy relationships?

Most of the last year’s 11 Tory rebels, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, have indicated they will stand firm. Their number was boosted on Tuesday morning by the resignation of Philip Lee, and rumours were swirling at Westminster that others might yet join the rebel alliance. But the Tory backbenchers might not be alone in digging in. Downing Street has officially ruled out backing Grieve’s 11th-hour amendment, tabled on Monday night, making it unlikely to be put to a vote unless No 10 reverses its decision. If both sides stand firm, a government defeat is on the cards. Last-minute government offer Despite the chief whip, Julian Smith, dining with Grieve on Monday night, the rebel alliance has not yet been convinced by the government’s own amendment. “I do remain hopeful of a compromise on the meaningful vote,” one potential rebel said. The solicitor general, Robert Buckland, has hinted at a government concession at the despatch box, but Grieve and the others have yet to bite. When the Commons last decided on the meaningful vote, in December, ministers offered last-minute concessions at the end of the debate, but it prompted shouts of “too late” from the Tory rebels, who then went on to defeat the government. If MPs accept that the government’s offer of more talks is made in good faith, then the prime minister could escape a damaging parliamentary defeat, but she would emerge weakened. Tory rebels bow to pressure Grieve and other Tory rebels have suggested they could back the Lords amendment, which has a much more expansive role for parliament, if the government does not compromise further. But they have come under intense pressure from the whips and the prime minister herself not to destabilise the government. She told her cabinet on Tuesday morning: “Anything which undermines the government at home would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.” The rebels have long experienced attacks from the rightwing press, and the remainer Anna Soubry claimed that at least one MP would not vote with their conscience because of threats to their personal safety or that of staff or family. If the Tory rebels bow to pressure and back the government’s amendment, No 10 will breathe a big sigh of relief. Labour Brexiters let government off the hook Labour whips believe they have persuaded all but the most hardline of their Brexit-backing colleagues to support the meaningful vote, increasing the chances that the government is defeated. One Labour insider said: “It was always going to be close but we hope all Labour MPs heed our call for parliament to be given a meaningful vote.” Jeremy Corbyn intervened personally in December to persuade leavers, including Denis Skinner and Graham Stringer, to support the original Grieve amendment, which the Lords has sought to strengthen. The prospect of delivering a damaging blow to the Conservatives was just too tempting. Only two – Kate Hoey and Frank Field – voted with the government. If even a couple more joined them this time round, they could hand May her victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/16/granit-xhaka-neymar-switzerland-brazil-world-cup-under-17","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T17:59:04Z","webTitle":"‘He fell down very often’: Granit Xhaka set to lock horns with Neymar again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/16/granit-xhaka-neymar-switzerland-brazil-world-cup-under-17","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/16/granit-xhaka-neymar-switzerland-brazil-world-cup-under-17","fields":{"headline":"‘He fell down very often’: Granit Xhaka set to lock horns with Neymar again","bodyText":"Granit Xhaka’s first brush with Neymar was light yet memorable. “It did not take much for him to go down, even the slightest touch was enough – that’s how I remember him,” the Switzerland and Arsenal midfielder says. The confrontation took place at the Under-17 World Cup in 2009, when Xhaka’s team faced Neymar’s Brazil in their final group-phase match, and it was a direct one. Xhaka started at right midfield; Neymar on the left. Switzerland were assured of going through, having won both their previous games, but Brazil needed at least a draw. They did not get it. Switzerland prevailed by the only goal, scored by Nassim Ben Khalifa – now of St Gallen – following a corner from Xhaka and the result provided the springboard to glory. Xhaka and a lineup that featured the left-back Ricardo Rodriguez (now at Milan), the Sion midfielder Pajtim Kasami and the Benfica striker Haris Seferovic would beat Germany, Italy and Colombia to set up a meeting with the hosts, Nigeria, in the final. They won 1-0, courtesy of a Seferovic goal. Brazil’s exit was early and ignominious, particularly as their team also included the future Roma goalkeeper Alisson, the Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro and the Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho. There was the usual paroxysm of melodrama and soul-searching when they got home before the Brazilian public and media moved on to the next thing. For Xhaka the events of 2009 provide the backstory to Switzerland’s World Cup opener against Brazil in Rostov on Sunday night, along with a couple of lessons. “The main one I learned was that in football everything is possible,” the 25-year-old says. Xhaka’s recollections are crystal clear, down to the detail of the anticipation that he and his roommate, Rodriguez, felt on the eve of the Brazil tie. Back then the dream had been to face Brazil at a senior World Cup. That is now upon them. “It’s the standard dream of every kid because Brazil is always the one that you want to beat,” Xhaka says. “Before we played them in 2009 there was so much excitement. I remember that Neymar, Coutinho and Casemiro played. Casemiro was already really muscular – a bull type, as he is today. I thought: ‘This is an incredible opportunity for me and the whole team.’” Xhaka’s comments about Neymar sound provocative but to him they are merely statements of fact. He has never been a guy to pull his punches. “I just remember that he fell down very often and very lightly,” Xhaka says. “What can I say? That was the reality. It’s how it was in that game. “Neymar is a world-class player who can decide matches and I wish him all the best. I actually hope to meet up with him after the game in Rostov to swap shirts. We didn’t swap shirts in 2009. We needed ours for the next match.” Neymar was ineffective against Switzerland back then and he was substituted after 69 minutes. Coutinho, though, was another story. “What a player he was – he was a completely different class,” Xhaka says. “There was absolutely no comparison between Neymar’s performance and Coutinho’s performance. Coutinho was a constant danger. “I don’t know if Coutinho would remember it but I’ll remember that performance for the rest of my life. I knew right then that Coutinho would go on to become a full international, even if he was a shyer type than Neymar. I could see that Neymar was one of the big characters in the team and a lot of players looked up to him.” Xhaka faced Neymar and Brazil in a senior friendly in August 2013, which Switzerland won 1-0 in Basel, and he and the squad have come to boast sureness and cohesion. The manager, Vladimir Petkovic, has pretty much retained the starting XI that reached the last 16 at Euro 2016 and there is the belief that this can be the tournament in which Switzerland reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 1954. In Brazil four years ago – when Xhaka started every game under Ottmar Hitzfeld – they suffered a 1-0 extra‑time defeat by Argentina in the last 16. “Everybody knows the history of 1954 but a lot of my teammates – and me, especially – think that 2018 might be the year when we equal or even better it,” Xhaka says. “The main thing at these tournaments is that you have to be ruthless. You don’t have 10 chances. You have one and you have to score. “Brazil’s reputation is not really of any importance. They are an opponent and we want to beat them. I hope and think that they might underestimate us. That’s a big asset we have. We are a real underdog against them.” Xhaka wears his youth World Cup crown lightly. He describes the triumph as a “big step” in his career but not the defining one in terms of becoming a top professional. That said, it is a rich crop when an under‑17 team supplies three key players for a World Cup campaign – Xhaka, Rodriguez and Seferovic. Kasami is also a full international but he is not in Petkovic’s squad. “Four [internationals] is a lot because we are talking about under-17 level,” Xhaka says. “From this generation quite a few others became professionals, although they are not at the highest level. Most of them play in Switzerland.” Xhaka does not want to get ahead of himself because Switzerland’s group in Russia is tough. After Brazil they face Serbia and Costa Rica. But he does see another parallel to the Under-17 World Cup success, a further good omen. “We played Germany in the last 16 in 2009 and the same thing can happen at this World Cup,” Xhaka says. That Germany team featured his now Arsenal colleague Shkodran Mustafi, together with the Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen and the Borussia Dortmund midfielder Mario Götze. Earlier in 2009 Germany had won the European Under-17 Championship and they were the favourites to progress. Instead Switzerland stunned them 4-3 after extra time. “We were never ever looking forward to a game as much as that Germany one,” Xhaka says. Until now, that is. He and Switzerland have their eyes on another upset."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/12/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-shocking-xenophobia","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T16:32:49Z","webTitle":"Einstein's travel diaries reveal 'shocking' xenophobia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/12/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-shocking-xenophobia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/12/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-shocking-xenophobia","fields":{"headline":"Einstein's travel diaries reveal 'shocking' xenophobia","bodyText":"The publication of Albert Einstein’s private diaries detailing his tour of Asia in the 1920s reveals the theoretical physicist and humanitarian icon’s racist attitudes to the people he met on his travels, particularly the Chinese. Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries see the scientist musing on his travels, science, philosophy and art. In China, the man who famously once described racism as “a disease of white people” describes the “industrious, filthy, obtuse people” he observes. He notes how the “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” After earlier writing of the “abundance of offspring” and the “fecundity” of the Chinese, he goes on to say: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.” Ze’ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, said: “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular. “They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.” Rosenkranz has edited and translated The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, which have just been published for the first time as a standalone volume by Princeton University Press, including facsimiles of the diary pages. The diaries have only previously been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, with small supplementary translations into English. A spokesperson for Princeton University Press said: “This is the first time Einstein’s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn’t a serious Einstein scholar.” Further passages in the diaries, which are thought to have been written for Einstein’s stepdaughters in Berlin while he and his wife were travelling in Asia, Spain and Palestine, and as an aide memoire, see him writing of the Chinese that “even those reduced to working like horses never give the impression of conscious suffering. A peculiar herd-like nation [ … ] often more like automatons than people.” He later adds, in Rosenkranz’s words, “a healthy dose of extreme misogyny” to his xenophobia with the observation: “I noticed how little difference there is between men and women; I don’t understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring”. In Colombo in Ceylon, Einstein writes of how the locals “live in great filth and considerable stench at ground level” adding that they “do little, and need little. The simple economic cycle of life.” Einstein’s perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: “Japanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,” he writes. “Pure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.” But Rosenkranz points out that he also concludes that the “intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition?” “Einstein’s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist – in these instances, other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may ‘supplant all other races’ is also most revealing in this regard,” writes Rosenkranz. “Here, Einstein perceives a foreign ‘race’ as a threat, which … is one of the characteristics of a racist ideology. Yet the remark that must strike the modern reader as most offensive is his feigning not to understand how Chinese men can find their women sufficiently attractive to have offspring with them. In light of these instances, we must conclude that Einstein did make quite a few racist and dehumanising comments in the diary, some of which were extremely unpleasant.” Rosenkranz told the Guardian that although views like Einstein’s were prevalent at the time, they were not universal. “That’s usually the reaction I get – ‘we have to understand, he was of the zeitgeist, part of the time’ – but I think I tried here and there to give a broader context. There were other views out there, more tolerant views,” he said. In his introduction, Rosenkranz writes how it is important to explore how a humanist icon such as Einstein – whose image was once used for a UNHCR campaign with the slogan “A bundle of belongings isn’t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country. Einstein was a refugee” – could have written xenophobic comments about the peoples he encountered. “The answer to this question seems very relevant in today’s world, in which the hatred of the other is so rampant in so many places around the world,” he writes. “It seems that even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/15/melodys-echo-chamber-bon-voyage-review-a-psych-pop-hotchpotch","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:30:13Z","webTitle":"Melody’s Echo Chamber: Bon Voyage review – a psych-pop hotchpotch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/15/melodys-echo-chamber-bon-voyage-review-a-psych-pop-hotchpotch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/15/melodys-echo-chamber-bon-voyage-review-a-psych-pop-hotchpotch","fields":{"headline":"Melody’s Echo Chamber: Bon Voyage review – a psych-pop hotchpotch","bodyText":"French singer-songwriter Melody Prochet’s self-titled debut – a collection of radiant psychedelia produced by her then-boyfriend, Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker – was released almost six years ago. In 2014, she began trailing its follow-up. Only now, however, has Bon Voyage actually arrived. The reasons for the four-year delay are rather hazy: in 2017 it was revealed that Prochet had been hospitalised following a serious accident (the details of which have never reached the public), yet the album had been pushed back for years prior to that. Much like its mysterious timeline, Bon Voyage is not a straightforward record. Sung in a mixture of English, French and Swedish, tracks tend to be loose and freeform as they slope between tempos and styles: opener Cross My Heart begins by aping Jefferson Airplane before segueing into a fidgety breakbeat; Breathe in, Breathe Out matches trembling, wiry synths with a Britpoppy chorus; Desert Horse interrupts chunky guitar riffs with helium vocals; Quand Les Larmes D’un Ange Font Danser La Neige’s jazzy drum fills are silenced by a grossly scatalogical spoken-word passage courtesy of Pond’s Nicholas Allbrook. There are recurring themes – Prochet’s sweet, breathy voice, extended psychedelic wigouts, Middle Eastern instrumentation – but no trope as pervasive as the record’s proclivity for impromptu left turns. On the one hand, this means dull moments are few and far between. Yet an album that flits wantonly back and forth between languages and decades needs a strong personality to anchor it – and that’s one thing Bon Voyage’s restless experimentalism never quite gets round to establishing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/12/lionel-shriver-penguin-diversity-books-random-house","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T13:20:35Z","webTitle":"Lionel Shriver is wrong.

This may make for good copy, but Penguin Random House is a very large company in an industry that produces a staggering number of distinct products.

If it diverges to any significant extent, then that itself is evidence of a problem – perhaps a social one, but almost certainly a business one: it will be leaving parts of its market underserved. If different sectors of society are under-represented in published books, then this is evidence of some sort of a systemic problem, for which outreach is a possible solution. It is easy to deride diversity as a warm and fuzzy social objective without objective substance, but without diversity the English literary world would not have Homer, Dostoevsky or García Marquez. The whole point of reading is, almost by definition, to learn or experience something new and different: how new, how different, are matters of taste, but diversity is integral to the exercise. But diversity in publishing is more complex than a mere reflection of readers and authors divided up by category: diversity of viewpoint, for example, does not map cleanly on to diversity of origin, Kazuo Ishiguro and Michael Ondaatje being two cases in point. Nor does readership necessarily match either ethnic or social background of the author or the subject matter of the book. More fundamentally, perhaps, literature has been a global exercise for centuries; and so, increasingly, is publishing. The idea of distinct British, American or Australian book markets is increasingly quaint. But the world of writing is, of course, much wider even than that. A Chinese author from China in translation adds just as much diversity – arguably more – than an emigré writing in English or a second-generation British-Chinese or Chinese-American writer. From my viewpoint in Hong Kong, writing from an ethnically Asian writer in the US or Britain is not necessarily terribly Asian at all: a Chinese-American novel, for example, often has more in common with mainstream American fiction than it does with Chinese fiction written in China in Chinese. And for “Asia”, write “Africa”, “Latin America” or any other place. It is true that good writers can set their stories anywhere, but when Boris Akunin, say, writes a Russian thriller, the result is rather different than Martin Cruz Smith’s Gorky Park or Tom Clancy’s The Hunt for Red October. All are fine writers, but they are hardly interchangeable. And these examples are roughly apples and apples; the distinction is even starker in literary fiction. Seen globally, therefore, the diversity issue looks rather different that it may from within any given society. Ethnic Indian and Chinese writers have no real problem being published in India or China, for example. There is, it is fair to say, no great shortage of ethnic Indian writing in English; it’s just that it circulates mostly in India. English-language publishers have sourced few books from outside the main anglophone countries, relative, at least, to publishers in French, Spanish, and other languages. English-language publishers had had, in general, a far larger pool of writers to choose from. “Foreign” writers in French, for example, tend to come from pretty diverse places to begin with. But European bookstores have a far higher percentage of books in translation than the typical bookstore in one of the large English-speaking countries. Bestselling Korean, Japanese and Chinese writers tend to show up in French and German before English readers get a crack at them. One imagines, and hopes, that this will change. Translations and overseas sourcing tend to pick off the the best books. The next-as-yet-untranslated novel in Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Russian or Swahili is likely to be better than the average English-language book. So, diversity – and an increased emphasis on translation – will tend to increase overall quality rather than, as Shriver argues, dilute it. The ironic corollary is that a push for diversity will not necessarily open as many opportunities for “domestic” writers as they might hope, because publishers may well source more writers from overseas and in translation. There are, one can be pretty sure, more top-notch ethnically Indian or Chinese writers in India and China than in the US or Britain. Publishing and literature are, like other things, becoming globalised. In literature, at any rate, this can thankfully lead to more good writing rather than increasing homogeneity. • Peter Gordon is editor of the Asian Review of Books in Hong Kong"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/12/brexit-withdrawal-bill-negotiations-rebels-meaningful-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T13:41:59Z","webTitle":"Brexit bill negotiations enter frantic final hours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/12/brexit-withdrawal-bill-negotiations-rebels-meaningful-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/12/brexit-withdrawal-bill-negotiations-rebels-meaningful-vote","fields":{"headline":"Brexit bill negotiations enter frantic final hours","bodyText":"Frantic negotiations to prevent a damaging government defeat over parliament’s ability to block a no-deal Brexit look set to come down to the wire, with rebels and government whips locked in deep discussions hours before the vote. The mood appeared to shift against the government over the course of the afternoon. The justice minister Philip Lee resigned on the morning of the vote and suggested he would rebel against the government. Justine Greening, a former education secretary, suggested she would back the amendment, telling the Commons it was “sensible to have a structured process to deal with the different scenarios this House may face”. Most of the original 11 rebels on the meaningful vote amendment, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, have also indicated that they will stand firm. One told the Guardian that at least a couple more MPs were considering joining the rebel alliance. Opening the debate in parliament, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said the government could not accept anything that could undermine Theresa May, hinting that the provisions in amendments proposed by Lords and Tory rebels would hamper negotiations. “We have listened wherever possible to sensible suggestions that have been made to improve the bill,” he said. “But where amendments have been made that seek to or inadvertently undermine the essential purpose of the bill to provide a smooth and orderly exit, or undermine the referendum result, we must reject them.” Downing Street had said it would not accept a compromise amendment offered by Grieve, which gave more flexibility than the Lords amendment. However, in a sign the government saw the prospect of defeat looming, solicitor general Robert Buckland intervened from the front bench saying there was “much merit’ to parts of the compromise amendment and asked for more time to meet Grieve to discuss it, offering to use it as the basis of “a structured discussion ahead of the Lords stages” in exchange for support for the government on Tuesday. Grieve, the former attorney general who has been a leading figure in the Conservative rebellion, suggested that would not be enough to prevent a rebellion. Lee dealt a significant blow to the prime minister by resigning over the government’s handling of Brexit, which he said was detrimental to the lives of his constituents. His departure will increase the number of rebels planning to oppose the government on the key amendment to the bill, and could also encourage wavering backbenchers to join him. The Tory MP, who supported remain at the referendum, said: “If in the future I am to look my children in the eye and honestly say that I did my best for them, I cannot in all good conscience support how our country’s exit from the EU looks set to be delivered.” MPs have said the government could lose the vote unless it offers concessions soon. In December, ministers conceded at the end of the debate, prompting Tory rebels to shout “too late” before the government was defeated. As the debate opened, the Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, hurried up and down the green benches of the Commons chamber, speaking urgently to groups of MPs. They included Grieve and another potential rebel, Stephen Hammond, and two more influential pro-Europe Tories, Greening and George Freeman. Inbetween discussions, Smith spoke to ministers on the front benches, including May, scribbling notes on a Commons paper. Downing Street has officially ruled out backing Grieve’s 11th-hour amendment, tabled on Monday night, which would give parliament more control over the outcome should MPs vote down May’s final Brexit deal. It is now unlikely to be put to a vote unless No 10 reverses its decision. The government has offered its own amendment that guarantees only a ministerial statement to parliament within 28 days. Grieve and other Tory rebels have suggested they could back the Lords amendment, which has a much more expansive role for parliament, if the government does not compromise further. On Tuesday, Grieve said he accepted that the Lords’ version was “not completely satisfactory” but said the government’s proposal did not go far enough either. “My own amendment is trying to bridge that gap,” he told the BBC. “It doesn’t affect the ability to negotiate a deal at all. It’s making perfectly sensible and reasonable safeguards for what is undoubtedly a highly risky business.” The cabinet discussed the Brexit bill for around 20 minutes on Tuesday morning, No 10 said. “The prime minister said that the votes were important in terms of the message which they sent to Brussels. She said that anything which undermines the government at home would make negotiations with the EU more difficult,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. The “meaningful vote” amendment is now the only potential government defeat, after remainers and Brexiters struck a compromise deal overnight over the customs union. Downing Street sources said they would back an alternative amendment on the proposal for “a customs arrangement”, tabled by the backbenchers Nicky Morgan, a remainer, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading Brexiter. However, on Tuesday pro-Europe Conservatives said they were winning fresh converts to the cause of keeping Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA). An amendment on the issue, which will be debated on Wednesday, is not expected to pass because the Labour frontbench will not back it. The remainers plan to continue pushing for EEA membership when the trade and customs bills are discussed next month. And at least one Tory backbencher not previously identified as a rebel is expected to sign up. “It’s only going one way,” said one Conservative moderate. Later in the Commons debate, Davis suggested that the meaningful vote amendment was a Trojan horse to keep the UK in the EU. “People keep using the phrase ‘meaningful vote’ but what it conceals in some cases is that they want to reverse the result of the referendum, and nothing we do will be organised to allow reversal of the result of the referendum,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/14/rameau-nais-review-exuberant-baroque-rarity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"Rameau: Naïs review – exuberant baroque rarity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/14/rameau-nais-review-exuberant-baroque-rarity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/14/rameau-nais-review-exuberant-baroque-rarity","fields":{"headline":"Rameau: Naïs review – exuberant baroque rarity","bodyText":"First performed in 1749, Naïs was the second of four “pastorales héroiques” that Rameau wrote around the turn of the 1750s. This one was his “Opéra pour la paix”, commissioned to celebrate the end of the war of the Austrian succession, which had been resolved with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle the previous year. The premiere of Naïs at the Palais-Royal in Paris was evidently a lavish affair, with spectacular sets, elaborate stage machinery and even pyrotechnics, while Rameau was allowed to add an extra trumpet to the standard opera orchestra. It was performed again with revisions in 1764, but the score was never published in the composer’s lifetime, and did not appear in print until the 1920s. This Hungarian recording, using a modern critical edition of the score, now seems to be the only one currently available on disc. The libretto of Naïs was written by Louis de Cahusac, who provided the texts for six more of Rameau’s stage works (including what is perhaps his greatest achievement, Les Boréades). The narrative of the three main acts is a straightforward retelling of the god Neptune’s love for the nymph Naïs, who eventually becomes queen of his submarine kingdom. But it’s the prologue, with its grand, celebratory choruses, and vivid martial music, that seems to be the real point of the work, telling the story of how Jupiter mobilised the gods to defeat the Giants and the Titans who were attempting to invade Mount Olympus, and then divided the earth into kingdoms with Jupiter himself ruling over all of them. It’s a thinly disguised allegory, designed to celebrate the role of the French king, Louis XV, in restoring peace to Europe. Even in the three acts of the opera proper too, however, the characterisation of the protagonists seems rather routine, despite the exuberant, florid arias dotted throughout. What happens in the story often seems far less important than the danced divertissements, which Rameau and Cahusac included in all three acts. This music is often gloriously vivid, and it’s the robust singing of the Purcell Choir and the gutsy, extrovert playing of the Orpheus Orchestra under György Vasheygi that make the strongest impression. Still, the largely francophone cast are first rate: Chantal Santon-Jeffery takes the title role in a suitably winsome way, and Reinoud Van Mechelen is the libidinous Neptune, while Florian Sempey is Jupiter in the prologue and Tirésie in the opera proper. It all adds up to much more than just a decent performance of a real baroque rarity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/14/germany-2018-world-cup-thomas-hitzlsperger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T06:24:35Z","webTitle":"Avoid complacency and Germany should be kings of the world again | Thomas Hitzlsperger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/14/germany-2018-world-cup-thomas-hitzlsperger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/14/germany-2018-world-cup-thomas-hitzlsperger","fields":{"headline":"Avoid complacency and Germany should be kings of the world again","bodyText":"I’m often asked who my Germany heroes were growing up. I could pick anyone – if not all – of the side that won the World Cup in 1990. That is the first tournament I remember and, for obvious reasons, it is a great memory. Lothar Matthäus’s goal against Yugoslavia in the opening game set the tone for a great run of results by a truly great team. Going into this World Cup Germany are champions again and I expect them to defend their title in Russia. They have a really strong squad and, having won the Confederations Cup last year, without some of their best players, they are not short on confidence. Saying that, I’ve watched Germany’s last two games – against Austria and Saudi Arabia – and they were poor on both occasions. If they are to be successful once again at a major tournament they will need to switch on more than they have been doing. If not, complacency could be Germany’s undoing. It says a lot about how strong Joachim Löw’s squad is that he felt able to leave out Leroy Sané. I know that decision raised eyebrows in England given how important Sané was to Manchester City winning the Premier League title, and it raised one or two eyebrows in Germany too. More than anything it seems a debatable decision given Löw has stressed the need for Germany to have wingers who can beat a defender in one-on-one-situations; Sané is the best example of that type of player Germany have at their disposal. However, he has not played as well for Germany as he has for City, specifically with his decision-making in key areas. But he is young – only 22 – and there is no doubt he will improve as a player if he stays focused. From the players Löw has selected, Toni Kroos is the one that stands out most. He is hugely experienced and, as he has showed throughout his time at Real Madrid with three Champions League titles in a row, he is a calm strategist and an excellent passer, well respected by everyone in the team. If he plays well in Russia, Germany should play well. From those players making their first appearance at a World Cup for Germany, Timo Werner is one to keep an eye on. We know him well at Stuttgart, where I am head of the academy, because he started playing for the club at under-nine level and went all the way into the first team and has gone onto develop tremendously in recent years at RB Leipzig. Julian Brandt, who has essentially taken Sané’s place in the squad, is also one to watch – he’s a real talent. England do not get mentioned often in Germany when it comes to other teams who could win the World Cup (and we often joke about England still celebrating the 1966 World Cup), which says a lot about how they are viewed in terms of strength and quality. This is why I rank them as a potential surprise pick for the tournament – there is less expectations nowadays but I think they could do well, perhaps reaching the semi-finals. I know Gareth Southgate from my time at Aston Villa and it hasn’t surprised me that he has done well in management. In the dressing room he was always a guy you looked up to – he spoke well and confidently, a guy who made it clear what he expected from you and, on the pitch, led by example. I want him to do well in his job. In regards to Russia hosting the World Cup – I understand the criticism that decision has received ever since it was made and, as a gay man, I should be among those voicing my concerns and objections to the tournament taking place in a country that has a poor record when it comes to the treatment of minorities. But I’m willing to give Russia a chance to show it can be a great host. I’ve visited Russia three times in the past 12 months – to Moscow and Volgograd as part of a delegation with the German Football Association, and once to St Petersburg with ARD, the German broadcaster I will be working with during the World Cup. What struck me during those visits is how determined many Russians are to show that there is more to their country than all the bad headlines we read in the press. There are ordinary people in Russia who want to make friends with people from other nations and the World Cup offers them that chance. For that reason, this could be a more welcoming and friendly tournament than it is expected to be. I hope it is and I also hope, as was the case in 1990, Germany end it as kings of the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/12/standing-up-to-far-right-unlike-labour-lewisham-byelection-hustings","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T13:30:30Z","webTitle":"I’m standing up to the far right in Lewisham – because Labour isn’t | Mandu Reid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/standing-up-to-far-right-unlike-labour-lewisham-byelection-hustings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/standing-up-to-far-right-unlike-labour-lewisham-byelection-hustings","fields":{"headline":"I’m standing up to the far right in Lewisham – because Labour isn’t","bodyText":"Running for parliament is a steep learning curve, full of challenges, and this week brought the most personal one yet: whether to attend a hustings where far-right characters who have brought their vile agenda to my south London constituency would be on the same platform. The byelection in Lewisham East is just two days away. But Labour said it would not attend tonight’s event because its candidate is unwilling to share a platform with these candidates. There were no such qualms in the 2015 election, when the outgoing MP, Heidi Alexander, appeared at the same hustings as Anne Marie Waters. But Waters – representing the For Britain party in this byelection – was Ukip back then, and the mainstream parties were not only willing to debate with Ukip but to impersonate its policies in an effort to win back votes. The Conservatives, too, will be avoiding tonight’s debate – apparently due to a diary clash. I share the sentiment that far-right views are dangerous and that there is no room for them in our community. But my concern is that the explanation Labour has given plays into the hands of those who oppose our tolerant, diverse and open society. Don’t get me wrong. It is extraordinarily painful for me, as a black woman, to share a stage with these people. But it is just as painful to watch Labour and the Conservatives dodge it, when it was their politics that supported her in the first place. I stood at a bus stop and asked residents in Lewisham whether I should show up to the hustings. I spoke to everyone who was willing – old and young, black and white, male and female – and I was struck by the consensus among them. All but one said I had to show up and make a stand – otherwise it could win. They wanted me and the other candidates to take on this hate – and, crucially, to win the argument, and expose the cruelty that underpins it. One guy said to me: “We don’t have the luxury of no-platforming … so why should they?” I agree that the best way of defeating the far right is to confront it, because refusing to engage doesn’t solve anything for the people who have to navigate it daily. The ugly, small, incoherent, fearful ideology that lies behind it needs to be exposed for what it is. And Labour and the Conservatives have a special responsibility to do this, since these latest political formations have been fuelled by some of the decisions of the UK’s two biggest parties: in recent years both parties have chosen an approach of absorbing what political benefits they can from these fringes – polluting the mainstream and making the fringes more toxic in the process. Take Brexit: the EU was the scapegoat for dissatisfaction caused by government policies. Whatever the issue – economics, immigration, welfare, crime – Brussels was to blame. Labour and the Conservatives failed to tackle that narrative, and at times encouraged it, because that let them off the hook: what could they do in the face of mysterious Brussels directives? This strategy started to get out of control, Ukip’s support grew and suddenly the referendum was upon us. But rather than changing course, the two main parties doubled down. For both, it was easier to ape Ukip’s rhetoric than to challenge the false narrative behind it. The easy option was to blame the EU and absorb some of Ukip’s support into their own ranks; the difficult option for the main parties was to address why people felt left behind, and own up to their collusion in austerity. Guess which they chose. It may have boosted their standing in the opinion polls, but our country has paid the price – with economic prospects uncertain, and the political extremes emboldened. Women and minorities have paid the highest price of all. I don’t want migrants, or black people or Muslims to be blamed for a moment longer. I grew up in Swaziland, in the shadow of apartheid South Africa, and I have seen the lasting damage of bigotry and division. I have also seen the power of a movement of people who challenge it. Two of my reasons for running for parliament were to show the other parties some leadership where they are falling short, and to be visible – as a woman, as a person of colour, as an LGBT person, and as an outsider. The reason that I am showing up tonight is because of the one person who told me I shouldn’t. A young Muslim girl, no more than 14 years old, said: “Be careful. If you make a mistake, everyone will blame us.” The hateful ideology that caused her fear must be challenged and defeated. • Mandu Reid is the Women’s Equality party candidate for Lewisham East"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/13/john-travolta-lennys-pizza-saturday-night-fever-brooklyn","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"John Travolta keeps Brooklyn stayin' alive at event honoring actor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/13/john-travolta-lennys-pizza-saturday-night-fever-brooklyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/13/john-travolta-lennys-pizza-saturday-night-fever-brooklyn","fields":{"headline":"John Travolta keeps Brooklyn stayin' alive at event honoring actor","bodyText":"Forty-one years after strutting down a Brooklyn street, merrily swinging a paint can to the sound of the Bee Gees’ Stayin’ Alive, an older, less lithe John Travolta returned on Tuesday, to be honored for his services to the now-trendy New York City borough. Hundreds of people gathered outside Lenny’s Pizza in Bensonhurst, south Brooklyn, to glimpse Travolta, who brought the neighborhood to national and international consciousness in Saturday Night Fever. The 1977 film saw his character Tony Manero disco dance, conduct troubling relationships with women and occasionally engage in punch-ups. In the opening scene, Travolta orders two slices of pizza at Lenny’s before combining them in a double decker-type situation. The pizzeria claims Saturday Night Fever fans regularly order the same. “This is a great day,” New York state senator Martin Golden – who represents the Bensonhurst neighborhood and has submitted a 1,070-word legislative resolution commending Travolta for “putting Brooklyn both on the map and in America’s hearts” – told the crowd. “A great day for John Travolta, a great day for his family, and a great day for Brooklyn.” Travolta was an hour and a half late, 90 long minutes in which the MC, “Brooklyn’s own” DJ Chazz, repeatedly ask the crowd if they were ready. Most remained in a state of readiness throughout, waving Saturday Night Fever memorabilia and singing along to the Bee Gees’ back catalogue. “I’ve seen loads of his movies,” 32-year-old Matthew Sterling said of Travolta. “Face/Off, Look Who’s Talking. He’s such a versatile actor.” Sterling, who lives in Bensonhurst, was carrying a large Saturday Night Fever poster. He bought it at an auction for $200 and said it had been owned by the photographer who took many of the publicity shots for the film. “I’m definitely a big fan,” Sterling said. “You’ve got to be a fan if you’re from this area.” Among the crowd was Travolta impersonator Brian Bergdoll, who performs as “Brian Travolta”. Bergdoll said he had met Travolta “from afar, three times”. “He’s seen me, but I’ve never actually talked with him,” Bergdoll said. Bergdoll, who was wearing a white suit with a black shirt, was not the only Travolta impersonator in attendance. His rival, whom he said was called Patrick and who, to be fair, looks quite a lot more like John Travolta, was getting most of the attention from the local news channels. “We started in the business around the same time,” Bergdoll, 47, said as Patrick pointed one finger in the air and sashayed towards a television camera. “He was born in Brooklyn, though, and I’m not, so he’s got a little more street cred than I do,” Bergdoll said. “I’m younger, though.” When Travolta finally arrived, in a black SUV, he was also wearing the famous white and black suit. The 64-year-old’s hair, such as it is, looked similar to Tony Manero’s, except for its grey hue. Travolta was drowned out by screams as he took the microphone. He spoke for less than a minute, during which the Guardian just about heard him thank the crowd and urge them to go to the cinema. Members of his entourage were wearing stickers with the name “Gotti” written on, which probably not coincidentally is the name of Travolta’s latest film, which is released on Friday. If that diminished the idea of Travolta being there to be honored for his work promoting Brooklyn, it didn’t seem to bother the crowd. Or him. Travolta posed for photos while holding a double slice of pizza – a press release had said Lenny’s planned to name a slice after Travolta, but there was no further mention of that – and jigged about a bit to Stayin’ Alive. On the way back to his car he stopped to sign memorabilia, causing a minor crush. Susan Turco, 47, emerged from the ruck with Travolta’s signature on her 1978 record of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. “It’s my first and only autograph,” Susan said. She described Travolta as having “a special glow”. Turco grew up in Bensonhurst, and in the late 70s she was motivated to get into the disco scene by the film. “It was a great era,” she said. “Dancing and having fun. I’m thrilled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/12/england-world-cup-squad-targets-russian-hackers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"England World Cup squad told they will be soft targets for Russian hackers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/12/england-world-cup-squad-targets-russian-hackers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/12/england-world-cup-squad-targets-russian-hackers","fields":{"headline":"England World Cup squad told they will be soft targets for Russian hackers","bodyText":"England arrived at their World Cup training base in Russia with explicit instructions aimed at preventing them from being victims of online hacking. Gareth Southgate and his players, along with the entire Football Association entourage, have been briefed by a team of experts from Government Communications Headquarters and warned they will be seen as soft targets unless they take stringent measures to improve their online security. They have even received advice about how to conceal belongings in their hotel rooms and, in essence, the best way of hiding items other than using their safes. The players have been warned not to assume they have privacy in their rooms and to go by the general rule that using their safes is not foolproof at a time when many famous sportsmen have been targeted by Russian hackers. In contrast to a number of FA staff, the players have been allowed to take their usual phones and other personal devices but security experts have installed extra software that will be removed when they return to England. The players have been warned they are high-risk targets and it is understood their team hotel in Repino, on the Gulf of Finland, was swept for bugs before the team arrived on Tuesday. The other recommendations from GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre are that the players do not access online bank accounts while they are away and avoid internet activity that could cause embarrassment if it were made public. The players were told to take as few devices as possible, to avoid public wifi and not to use the memory sticks that are often handed out at major tournaments. The risk is so high that security experts recommend high-risk visitors to Russia should put tape over the cameras of their laptops. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the NCSC, has described Russia as “our most capable hostile adversary in cyberspace”, adding that “tackling them is a major priority for the National Cyber Security Centre and our US allies”. The organisation has also produced an online blog on the Be on the Ball: World Cup 2018 website to offer advice for travelling fans. England will be staying at the ForRest Mix Club in Repino, 19 miles from St Petersburg, with their training base a few miles away in the village of Zelenogorsk. “We like the town and we like St Petersburg,” Southgate said. “Hopefully the players and family will get an opportunity to go into St Petersburg when not working. We have taken the hotel for ourselves, which will be good for the balance of working and players being able to relax and have time for themselves. I am pleased with the base and looking forward to meeting the community.” The FA had initially been looking at Black Sea resorts, notably Gelendzhik, but that idea was abandoned because Southgate was worried the summer heat and humidity might be too oppressive. That is not a problem much further north in Repino, where the temperature on England’s arrival was just below the average for June of 16C (61F). It will be much hotter on Monday when England play their opening Group G game against Tunisia in Volgograd, with temperatures there likely to be one of the main challenges for Southgate’s team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/12/att-time-warner-takeover-approved-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T21:05:16Z","webTitle":"AT&T $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner approved by judge in blow to Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/12/att-time-warner-takeover-approved-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/12/att-time-warner-takeover-approved-trump","fields":{"headline":"AT&T $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner approved by judge in blow to Trump","bodyText":"AT&amp;T’s politically charged takeover of Time Warner was approved by a US judge on Tuesday in a blow to the Trump administration, which had fought hard to have the deal scrapped.

Leon said the government’s objections “rested on improper notions” and warned against an appeal. “I hope the government has the wisdom and courage” not to seek a stay, he said.

Corporate America had closely watched the case and the decision is likely to lead to more mergers. Seats for the ruling at the E Barrett Prettyman courthouse in downtown Washington were in such demand that lines began forming outside the courthouse a full day before the scheduled 4pm announcement. The decision on a so-called “vertical integration” – between two companies who do not make competing products – could have a profound impact on future mergers. Vertical mergers, such as Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods and drugstore chain CVS’s purchase of health insurer Aetna, have become increasingly popular. But the most immediate effect of the deal will be on the already consolidated media market. A clear win for AT&amp;T will embolden Comcast, the US’s largest cable company, to top Walt Disney’s $52bn bid for 21st Century Fox, the media empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his family. Comcast has made clear its intention to challenge that merger and is reportedly preparing a $60bn all-cash offer of its own. Comcast has already made an offer for Sky, the UK satellite TV business. 21st Century Fox owns 39% of Sky and has been in a long battle with UK regulators to buy the rest of the company. AT&amp;T’s wooing of Time Warner has been politically complicated from the outset. Announced in October 2016, it was seized on by then presidential candidate Donald Trump as the sort of deal his administration would block. On the campaign trail Trump argued that a combined AT&amp;T/Time Warner was “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few”. Trump weighed in again after the justice department filed its suit: “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up,” he said last November. Critics charged that Trump had come out against the deal because of Time Warner’s CNN, which has been highly critical of his presidency. The Trump administration has denied those charges. In May it was revealed that AT&amp;T had paid Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, $600,000 for consultancy fees as it attempted to woo the White House. AT&amp;T’s chief executive officer, Randall Stephenson, said the hiring had been “a big mistake”. In court the justice department argued an integrated company would use its size to raise prices and that it was problematic for one company to own a top pay-TV distributor, AT&amp;T’s DirecTV, as well as Time Warner, a company that makes content distributed by DirecTV’s rivals. AT&amp;T in turn called the government’s arguments “absurd” and has argued the deal is necessary for it to compete with tech companies like Netflix, Apple and Amazon as they spend billions to bolster their positions in media."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/12/morocco-boost-2026-world-cup-united-bid-us-mexico-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T18:50:52Z","webTitle":"Morocco receive late boost in their bid to host 2026 World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/12/morocco-boost-2026-world-cup-united-bid-us-mexico-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/12/morocco-boost-2026-world-cup-united-bid-us-mexico-canada","fields":{"headline":"Morocco receive late boost in their bid to host 2026 World Cup","bodyText":"The race to host the 2026 World Cup finals was too close to call, according to Fifa insiders, as Morocco received a late boost to their hopes with the expectation that four US territories will abstain from voting on Wednesday. The so-called united bid of the USA, Mexico and Canada is the technically safer option and definitely more attractive financially to the voting federations but that may not be enough to carry them over the line. Their position was weakened by the expectation that four US territories at the centre of a voting row will not take part. Morocco has been pressing Fifa for several weeks to intervene and exclude the US-governed territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands because of a perceived conflict of interest. This is the first World Cup vote since England endured a shock defeat in the contest to host the 2018 finals when Russia and Qatar were picked to host consecutive tournaments despite being vastly weaker on paper. The subsequent revelations of widespread corruption within the world governing body mean the landscape is very different this time, including the fact that it will be an open vote. It is expected that 201 of Fifa’s 211 member federations will vote at the annual congress at Moscow’s Expocentre on Wednesday. The four bidding nations are excluded and Ghana and Kosovo are understood not to have sent representatives. The Fifa hierarchy – including the president, Gianni Infantino – are understood to prefer the united bid, which has promised to generate a profit of £8.1bn for Fifa compared with the projected £4.48bn the Morocco World Cup would raise. But there are other geopolitical and football factors to consider. Some of those close to the united bid were concerned that interventions by Donald Trump during the campaign period may have worked against them. In April, he tweeted: “The US has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?” There were suggestions that his antagonistic manner could alienate some nations and also that the recent public dispute with Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, could undermine the collaboration between two of the hosting nations. However, it emerged that behind the scenes Trump has been lobbying on behalf of the bid. He sent three letters to Infantino and other Fifa officials offering reassurances should the united bid win. Trump pledged that his hardline stance on visas would not affect visitors to the country during the tournament. The letters, seen by the New York Times, also cite the 1996 and 2002 Olympic Games and the 1994 World Cup as examples of major international events hosted by the US. But Morocco’s bid team were confident they could sway a few nations who might be undecided, continuing their lobbying night in Moscow hotels and bars. They will also have a 15-minute presentation to congress on Wednesday morning to make a last‑ditch plea for votes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/15/hollywood-vampires-interview-alice-cooper-johnny-depp-joe-perry","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:28:29Z","webTitle":"Hollywood Vampires: 'You've got to have ego to do what we do'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/15/hollywood-vampires-interview-alice-cooper-johnny-depp-joe-perry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/15/hollywood-vampires-interview-alice-cooper-johnny-depp-joe-perry","fields":{"headline":"Hollywood Vampires: 'You've got to have ego to do what we do'","bodyText":"In the early 70s, Alice Cooper helmed his own secret late-night drinking club. Based in an exclusive loft at Hollywood’s legendary Rainbow Bar and Grill, it provided boozy sanctuary to many fellow stars including Ringo Starr, John Belushi, John Lennon, Keith Moon, Keith Emerson, Harry Nilsson and Marc Bolan. Their all-night drinking sessions took place away from the prying eyes of the media and nagging managers. The staff at the Rainbow dubbed the crew the Hollywood Vampires. “Because they only saw us at night and all we did was drink!” Cooper laughs down the line from New York. “I remember it, but the lines are a little blurred. Our lines would all get blurred quite a lot. It just seemed to be the place where everybody ended up.” These days Cooper is plainly doing a lot better than most of his friends, many now departed. A wiry and energetic 70-year-old, he is currently on tour – he’s almost always on tour, but this time it’s with the band he named after the drinking club, formed in 2015 with guitarists Joe Perry (of Aerosmith) and, more intriguingly, Johnny Depp. The roots of this all-star project stretch back to an intimate gig Cooper played at London’s 100 Club in 2011. Both Cooper and Depp were in the city to film Tim Burton’s horror comedy Dark Shadows. Cooper invited the actor to play a few songs and started toying with the idea of forming a covers band to pay tribute to his fallen drinking buddies. Depp and Perry (whom Cooper has known for decades) joined and the band made their live debut at LA’s Roxy Theatre in September 2015. They released their self-titled debut album the same month, featuring three originals among the classic rock covers. Well-received by rock bibles Kerrang! and Rolling Stone, the Vampires were credited with avoiding self-indulgence – though in the age of #MeToo, it remains to be seen whether they’ll pull off another tribute to macho rock-star excess. This month they are packing out Europe’s arenas and working on a second album of entirely original material. Quite how this works with three major stars sharing the spotlight is anyone’s guess, though it sounds as though their egos have found an odd equilibrium. “When we put three alpha males in the band, I did think, ‘Oh man, this could be tough,’” Cooper says. “But there’s never been an argument.” “You’ve got have ego to do what we do,” says Perry, “but with this I’m in a totally different headspace. I can just sit in the corner! It’s fucking great. And Johnny is the real deal, let me tell you.” Depp’s passion for music is well known. In the early 90s he was a member of the (largely unlistenable) alt-rock supergroup P, alongside Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Gibby Haynes of Butthole Surfers. In 1997 he played slide guitar on Oasis’s Be Here Now and he has performed with everyone from Marilyn Manson to Shane MacGowan. Allegations of domestic abuse towards ex-wife Amber Heard have affected his career, which was already struggling in the wake of flops like The Lone Ranger and Transcendence. (After Heard accused him of physical and verbal abuse “during the entirety” of their relationship, the couple divorced. Heard received a $7m settlement, which she donated to charity, and the couple released a joint statement describing their relationship as “volatile, but always bound by love”.) Meanwhile, recent photos of Depp looking gaunt have prompted speculation that he is unwell. Having been told firmly that questions along these lines will bring the interview to a halt, I ask instead what he gets from rock’n’roll. “My day job is a completely different animal, I suppose,” he says. “What do I get from this that I normally don’t get? I get me!” He laughs. “But when I’m up there on stage with these guys, it’s that feeling I had as a kid. It’s freedom. In movies someone is always telling you what to do, but here I have the freedom that my day job doesn’t allow. Most important, it’s really fucking fun.” Perry is particularly eager to sing Depp’s praises, noting that he first realised that Depp had a talent when he saw him playing acoustic guitar in Lasse Hallström’s 2001 film Chocolat. “Quite often when you watch a movie and someone is playing, you can really tell that it’s not for real,” Perry states. “But he was playing some really cool shit, things I’d never touched on as a guitarist. A lot of actors and actresses have walked our way over the years” – pun presumably intended – “but with Johnny it’s different. There’s a laser focus in his eyes.” “He trades licks with Joe and I’d put him up against any second guitarist out there,” agrees Cooper, with somewhat faint praise. “He needs to prove himself every night and that’s a good thing. It gives him that edge.” Hollywood Vampires’ summer tour ends on 8 July in Rome, after which Cooper and Depp will continue working on their second album. Time will tell as to whether their novelty value will survive, but both are adamant that they’re now taking what was once a bit of fun a lot more seriously. “I think we really found our sound this time; I think we just had it by the tail on the first record,” says Depp. Cooper adds: “We’re doing what we keep telling young bands to do: don’t lose the anger in rock’n’roll, don’t lose that edge, don’t mellow out! All of the songs that have been written so far are really raucous rock’n’roll songs. It’s got a lot of attitude to it.” Given how many of the original Hollywood Vampires drinking club members are gone, Cooper ranks as one of the great survivors of rock’s first golden era. Perry too, a former addict, has every reason to be thankful. But only last month, reports emerged of a drunk Depp threatening to attack a crew member on a film set. Could this totem to excess, in some perverse way, be a form of rehabilitation? “What separates survivors from the guys that die?” Depp wonders aloud. “It’s just about having the right people around you, people who care about you, at the right time, to save you from yourself. It’s not a good thing to face on your own,” he says, of alcoholism and addiction, “but some people do. Really, it’s just luck.” “That is definitely true,” Cooper agrees. “There were times when I should’ve been gone. I’m 70 now and I’m in better shape than I was at 28. At 28 I was a wreck. I’d never heard the word tofu in my life. I was trying to live that lifestyle as fast as I could and it was non-stop.” Still, he can’t help romanticising the myth of the male rock star. “You just wrote your songs, ate what you could, drank as much as you can and went off to be a great rock band after…. And we looked good doing it!” Hollywood Vampires are on tour in the UK (16 June: Birmingham Genting Arena, 17: Manchester Arena, 19: Glasgow SSE Hydro, 20: London SSE Arena)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/exhibition-spotlights-secret-life-onboard-britains-nuclear-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T11:45:39Z","webTitle":"Exhibition spotlights secret life onboard Britain's nuclear submarines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/exhibition-spotlights-secret-life-onboard-britains-nuclear-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/exhibition-spotlights-secret-life-onboard-britains-nuclear-submarines","fields":{"headline":"Exhibition spotlights secret life onboard Britain's nuclear submarines","bodyText":"They dined on fillet of beef washed down with fine wines, staged ribald theatrical productions to help break the monotony of lurking for months in the depths of the ocean and looked forward to weekly “familygram” bulletins from home. The extraordinary, secret, sometimes bizarre life of the men who spent months at a time onboard Britain’s Polaris nuclear deterrent submarines is being revealed in a new exhibition at the National Museum of the Royal Navy. Exhibits range from the intriguing – including an officers’ mess menu and play programmes – to the thought-provoking and downright scary, such as a training model of a Polaris missile and the keys that would have been used to unleash the weapons, each with a range of 2,800 miles and an explosive power eight times that of the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima. The permanent exhibition – Silent and Secret – is being unveiled on Friday at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport, Hampshire, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first patrol of the first Polaris sub, HMS Resolution, on 15 June 1968. Just as the Polaris programme was dogged by controversy, the exhibition has attracted criticism from anti-nuclear protesters who fear it may glorify the technology and be used as a propaganda tool by those who back renewing its successor, the Trident system. The museum has made preparations for protests but insists it is simply telling the story of a piece of recent history – and playing a part in the Trident discussions. Dominic Tweddle, the director general of the National Museum of the Royal Navy, said: “As well as acknowledging the role of the deterrent, it is important that the exhibition reflects the current debate on the renewal of Trident missiles. The museum will not tell the visitor what to think, but will leave them to form their own opinion.” The exhibition explains how in the 1950s the UK’s deterrent was delivered by the RAF’s V bomber nuclear strike force, but improvements in radar and surface-to-air missiles made the aircraft vulnerable and the response was to build four Polaris submarines, each armed with 16 missiles. A crew of of 143 officers and men, divided into two sections – the port crew and the starboard – spent three-month patrols at sea, always ready to launch their missiles within 15 minutes. Though the submarines were taken out of service in 1996, there is no access to the four vessels, which are laid up in Rosyth dockyard in Fife, Scotland. Instead their story is told through objects and documents. Hardware on display includes a training firing panel from which an officer would have monitored missiles as they were prepared and launched. In a glass cabinet nearby is a copy of a prayer written by Mike Henry, one of the Polaris commanding officers: “Give us the will, but never the wish, to obey the order to fire. But O Lord, if it be thy will, grant that order may never need to be given.” The tiny glimpses into life onboard may prove to be the most interesting to visitors. On one August evening in 1979, while the Americans and Soviets were undertaking tests of nuclear weapons in Nevada and Kazakhstan, a menu reveals that officers in the wardroom mess on HMS Resolution were tucking into trout and beef followed by baked Alaska, plus sherry, beaujolais and Cockburn’s special reserve port. The menu does not reveal if this was a special occasion or regular fare. As well as through food and drink, morale was maintained with theatrical performances. A programme for a play called A Deep Distraction staged by the “Polaris Players” has survived. An instant camera illicitly smuggled onboard captured an image of a submariner dressed in women’s clothes for another theatrical production. However, some elements of life onboard were austere. The bunk beds in which the men slept look tiny and the only communication with family were weekly 40-word telegrams known as familygrams. Often even senior crew members had no idea what part of the world they were in during patrols. George Malcolmson, a curator of archives and images at the museum, accepted not all would approve. “Polaris does divide opinion. There are strong views on both sides but as a museum we shouldn’t shy away from difficult subjects.” Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said she planned to visit the exhibition. “CND has a very powerful track record on protesting about Polaris,” she said. “There was huge opposition across the country. Vigils were held and questions asked in parliament. “Fortunately Polaris is very much a thing of the past. If this exhibition treats it as such without making false claims that it maintained British national security, it will be interesting from a historical perspective.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/12/var-world-cup-referees-flag-offsides-pierluigi-collina","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T17:58:30Z","webTitle":"Leave it to VAR: World Cup linesmen told not to flag for tight offsides","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/12/var-world-cup-referees-flag-offsides-pierluigi-collina","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/12/var-world-cup-referees-flag-offsides-pierluigi-collina","fields":{"headline":"Leave it to VAR: World Cup linesmen told not to flag for tight offsides","bodyText":"Fans inside the World Cup stadiums will be shown replays of incidents requiring video assistant refereeing decisions to reduce the confusion that has reigned during trials of the technology in England and other domestic leagues. Supporters at the tournament in Russia will be shown clips of the passage of play that was under revision but only once the referee has made his decision and play has restarted. Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of Fifa’s referees committee, said the problems with lengthy delays during trials had been ironed out. The Italian also said assistant referees had been advised to keep their flag down for tight offside calls and to leave it to VAR to decide. “If you see some assistant referee not raising the flag, it’s not because he’s making mistakes,” Collina said. “It’s because he’s respected the instruction to keep the flag down. They were told to keep the flag down when there is a tight offside incident and there could be a very promising attack or a goal-scoring opportunity because, if the assistant referee raises the flag, then everything is finished.” There will then be 13 referees who officiate, exclusively watching the control screens in the video operations room. Collina confirmed the VARs would wear the full kit, identical to their colleagues out on the pitch. “It’s because they sweat like they do on the pitch,” he said last week. “It’s not like watching a game on the couch while drinking coffee. It’s very stressful so they can’t be dressed like a clerk.” Néstor Pitana of Argentina will officiate the opening game between Russia and Saudi Arabia at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday. Officials have not yet been announced for the group‑stage matches during the tournament but Gareth Southgate insisted on a referee from the Asian Football Confederation for his team’s final warm-up game against Costa Rica in Leeds.

The government is being urged to adopt changes to freedom of information laws that might have exposed fire safety failings before the Grenfell Tower disaster. Housing associations including the body that managed Grenfell would be made subject to FoI requests under a private member’s bill going before parliament. It would also place firms like Carillion, G4S and Serco under greater public scrutiny. “The general public has a right to know as much about Carillion or Serco when they are given public contracts or providing public services as we do about public authorities doing the same work,” says the Labour MP Andy Slaughter, who is proposing the bill. When Carillion collapsed with the loss of thousands of jobs, there had been little advance notice of its financial vulnerability. And Grenfell residents had tried before the fire to get information but the building’s managers were able to claim exemption as a non-public body. Slaughter, the MP for Hammersmith, has campaigned about high-rise fire risks since a 2016 blaze in a Shepherd’s Bush tower block not far from Grenfell. Other areas that would be subject to FoIs under Slaughter’s bill include local safeguarding children boards, electoral registration officers, returning officers and the housing ombudsman. * * * Quick catch-up - Here is the latest on some developing stories. &gt; In news just breaking this morning, Saudi-led forces have launched their threatened assault to reclaim Yemen’s port city of Hodeidah from Houthi rebels.

The bodies of a man in his 40s and a woman in her 30s were found on the Praia dos Pescadores (Fishermen’s Beach) at the bottom of a 40-metre drop. “Since we found a mobile phone on the wall, everything suggests the victims might have been taking a selfie, when they allowed the phone to fall, leaned over to grab it and fell,” said a local rescue official.

Lunchtime read: Why don’t more women ride bicycles? “Fifty-one per cent of the UK population is female, yet most of our cities are failing to design roads and streets for women to cycle.” So says Xavier Brice, from Sustrans, which campaigns to get people out of their cars. Is he right that metropolitan planners are to blame for half as many women as men getting around on bicycles? “The main reason most women don’t cycle in the UK is because they think it is dangerous,” writes north of England editor and avid cyclist Helen Pidd. “When they sit on the top deck of a bus and look down to see a cyclist squashed up against the kerb they feel no compulsion whatsoever to join them … 10 out of 13 cyclists killed in London in 2009 were women, and eight of them were killed by left-turning HGVs.” Seventy-six percent of women say segregated lanes would persuade them to cycle. Until there are more, Pidd writes, “when women tell me cycling is too dangerous I can’t, in good conscience, persuade them otherwise”.

Business Asian stocks have mostly fallen after a muted market response to the Trump-Kim summit.

The pound is worth $1.336 and $1.137 at time of writing. The papers There are two big stories today and most papers have the Trump-Kim summit, the Brexit vote in the Commons, or both on their fronts. The Guardian, FT and Telegraph have photographs and stories about the Singapore talks but give Brexit top billing. “May escapes Brexit bill defeat as Tory rebels accept concession” is the Guardian splash. The FT leads with: “Tory rebels force May into Brexit climbdown”, and the Telegraph says: “Three ministers ‘meet anti-Brexit group over second referendum’”. The Express splits the front page evenly between the two stories – its headlines are: “May fights off Brexit rebels” and “Taming of the tyrant”. The Times has Brexit on the front, but splashes with “No more games: Trump gives path to peace”. There’s nothing of North Korea on the front of the Sun, which is so furious about the Brexit bill that it opts for a Theresa May/Star Wars pun: “May the farce be with you”.

Dominic Fifield Notoriously hard to call before a round of games has been played. Brazil beating Germany would be my preference.

Ideally a surprise from a minor nation who gets four in one game then goes home. BR Gabriel Jesus, supplied by Neymar and Roberto Firmino, could fill his golden boots. AL Luis Suárez. Uruguay’s draw is a dream and they will make the quarter-finals, at least, giving Suárez plenty of game-time to do damage. DH Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has a good scoring record at international level and is the spearhead of a team that should go far.

His record for France isn’t bad, though, with 20 goals in 53 games. MK Neymar. The Brazilian arrives in Russia with fresh legs and a desire to take his nation all the way. France’s Kylian Mbappé is also a decent shout. SL Romelu Lukaku. He’s on great form, has everybody playing for him and some great passers to provide him with the ammunition he needs. MD Gabriel Jesus. I watched him quite a lot last season and really liked his movement, not to mention his scoring rate. He’ll get plenty of service playing in the same team as the likes of Neymar and Philippe Coutinho and, given I’ve predicted Brazil will get to the final, he should play plenty of games, also. TH Neymar. He was hurt, played two games and scored in both – I can’t wait to see him in action. M Who will be the surprise team of the tournament? Switzerland. The Fifa world rankings are not the best way to judge a team, perhaps, but there must be some valid reasons why they are currently sixth (ahead of France and Spain). DT Serbia. Mladen Krstajic’s team are unfancied, but boast strength and quality. The key will be ensuring players perform to the same levels they invariably achieve at their clubs. DF This question contains an internal contradiction. Colombia for the semis, maybe. BR Uruguay, a mix of renewed confidence and wily old know-how. AL I see Croatia going deep into the tournament – maybe even the semi-finals. Any team with Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Mario Mandzukic deserves respect. DH Denmark. They’re 15 matches unbeaten and this could be the stage for Christian Eriksen to shine. Mind you, their opening game, against Peru, won’t be easy. SJ Peru return to the World Cup after a 36 year absence but they are full of hope, galvanised in part by their captain, centre forward and all time top scorer Paolo Guerrero managing to overturn a 14-month drugs ban just weeks before the world cup. MK Would it count as a surprise for Egypt and Uruguay to do well? The two sides from group A certainly could do so. Uruguay have their usual qualities, have Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield and a quiet, competitive confidence. SL Belgium. Technically they are so good, they have so many talented players. I truly think they can bring a new name to the nations that have won the World Cup. MD England. There is little expectations around the squad but I think they will get to the quarter-finals. TH Sweden. It is a country that I have a lot of affection for and I want them to do well in this World Cup. M Who will be breakthrough player of the tournament? Hirving Lozano of Mexico sounds good fun: talented, fiery and nicknamed “Chucky” because of his apparent resemblance to the Child’s Play doll. Lozano scored 19 goals as a winger for PSV Eindhoven last season and is likened to Luis Suarez, though hopefully he will manage not to bite anyone. DT Samuel Umtiti. That may sound odd given the French centre-half plays at Barcelona, but he was rushed into the team at Euro 2016, making a senior debut in the quarter-final, and is a far better player now. DF He’s already at Barcelona and cost £90m but I think Ousmane Dembélé could remind everyone exactly why. BR Kylian Mbappé, who has achieved so much already but in his teens this will be his first major tournament. AL Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. The 23-year-old Serbia and Lazio midfielder is tall, dynamic and has an eye for goal. I’m looking forward to watching him, together with Morocco’s creative midfielder, Hakim Ziyech, who plays for Ajax. DH Poland’s Piotr Zielinski. The 24-year-old was a key member of the Napoli team that pushed Juventus all the way in Serie A last season. SJ Karol Linetty. The Polish midfielder’s inventive play has seen him glitter for Sampdoria and catch the eye of one or two Premier League clubs. More could take interest if he has a good World Cup. MK Marco Asensio and Kylian Mbappé. This could be the tournament when they underline just how brilliant they’re going to be. SL It’s difficult to say, but, if pushed, Kylian Mbappé. He has the potential to be a big World Cup star. But will it be at this World Cup? He is still very young. MD Benjamin Pavard, a young defender I work with at Stuttgart and part of France’s squad. He can play right-back but, for me, is much better suited to being a centre-back. He is calm and composed, good in the air and aggressive when he needs to be. A real talent. TH He’s still only 19 and there were ups and downs in his first season at Paris Saint-Germain but I feel Kylian Mbappé could make a really big impact for France. M How far will England get? There is a potential quarter-final against Brazil or Germany looming. Even with the new wave of optimism, surrounding Gareth Southgate’s team it’s difficult to see them getting past that stage. DT The quarter-finals, playing some encouragingly enterprising football along the way. DF Respectable/brave 2-0 quarter-final loss after narrow squeak to that stage based on discipline and a couple of flukey clean sheets. BR The usual in all probability, maybe a quarter-final this time. AL The quarter-finals, where we will lose on penalties to Germany. DH They will get out of the group but it’s hard to see them progressing any further than the last 16. SJ Quarter-finals. This is the minimum target the FA has set and is eminently achievable for a team which seems to have had the shackles removed. MK Quarter-finals. Am I alone in thinking that England are actually quite good? I like the look of them offensively. SL It is hard to say as England are short of experience. I feel they will need this tournament to grow as a group of players. MD The quarter-finals. With a bit of good fortune and good play, they could even make the semi-finals. TH They will definitely get out of their group and possibly go beyond that. M Who will be England’s best/most important player? Harry Kane. People forget how poor he was in the European Championship, booed by the England fans, but if Kane is on form the team have a striker who can trouble any defence. DT Harry Kane, making his mark at a major finals. The one player of real pedigree in English ranks. DF Raheem Sterling. Will bring a dash of Manchester City to things and finally score a couple of goals - hopefully with his gun foot, before suggestively unfurling his sock for the cameras. BR Harry Kane. Has to be. AL Kyle Walker. He has a pivotal role on the right of Gareth Southgate’s back three, where he brings defensive cover and, crucially, pace on the transitions. Confidence is high after his superb debut season at Manchester City. DH Harry Kane. England’s captain, principal goalscorer and, it’s fair to say, best player. SJ Harry Kane is vital to England’s success as one of our few genuine world-class players. The captain has no shortage of motivation, claiming a World Cup victory would be trump winning the Champions League with Tottenham. MK Marcus Rashford. On the basis he is given continuity, confidence and a certain level of freedom. SL The guy who has really confirmed his talent on the big stage is Harry Kane and if he gets good service he could be one of the top scorers in Russia. MD Harry Kane. He needs to score goals and I’m sure he will. TH Harry Kane. He had a great season with Tottenham Hotspur and his goals will make a difference for England. M What are you most looking forward to, on or off the pitch? The final. It’s a World Cup final. For a journalist, there’s no better moment when it comes to covering the sport. DT Off the pitch, seeing The Motherland Calls in Volgograd. On it, that jaw dropping contest to match the drama of Belo Horizonte in 2014. DF Discovering that, in fact, everyday Russians aren’t all Putin-mad dopes or gumshield-clad football hooligans. Also vodka. BR Exploring Ekaterinburg and watching football in an unexpected place. Japan versus Senegal in a city known as the ‘gateway to Siberia’ is what it’s all about. AL The best thing about the previous World Cups I’ve covered has been the carnival vibe. I hope it’s the same this time. DH Seeing Colombia play. I had the pleasure of watching them in Brazil and they were a joy. I also haven’t forgotten how a few of their fans felt sorry for me when I ordered a table for one in a Brazilian steakhouse – four years later and we’re still in touch. SJ I’m genuinely intrigued to see what sort of World Cup-host Russia will be and if they can succeed in reversing opinions of some visitors that the country is cold and unwelcoming. MK The same thing you always look forward to at the World Cup – loads of fans from loads of places making loads of noise and discovering players and teams..Some ‘random’ player being brilliant. SL I’m excited to see which teams are going to surprise us AND which teams are going to show from the very outset that they are here to win it. MD Although I think Germany will win the World Cup this looks like a really open tournament, with quite a few genuine major contenders as well as teams would could cause a major surprise. It should be fascinating. TH Talking about soccer, watching beautiful and clean games, with sportsmanship, fair plays and no dirty plays. That’s what I hope to see, anyway. M What are you most concerned about, on or off the pitch? This might be the worst prediction of them all, but I don’t think there will be the racism or riots that people fear. We heard similar before Euro 2012 in Ukraine and Poland, plus other scare stories before the World Cups in South Africa and Brazil, but it tends to be different in the big tournaments. DT The inevitable shambles and confusion which will be VAR. DF The only thing any football hack ever really worries about is the wi-fi. Will it be good? Will it come and go? Will it fade at kick-off? I’m worrying about it right now. BR Having been in Marseille for England versus Russia, digging out the old Italia ‘90 “No All Violenza” T-shirt and hoping for a peaceful tournament. AL VAR leading to confusion inside the stadiums and, potentially, killing the emotion of big moments. DH The battery life on my new mobile phone. Any incomplete answers in here are down to the fact my phone died while trying to file. SJ That we will spend the next five weeks talking exhaustively about decisions made by Video Assistant Referees. MK Connection issues and late goals. Long distances. Cyrillic script. On the pitch: teams turning defensive when it gets decisive. SL That all the talk about security and organisation will overshadow the football. As a Fifa ambassador l have visited many stadiums, met many Russians, and l am confident in the capacity of Russia to run a great tournament. MD Vladimir Putin and Gianni Infantino appearing on our television screens more often than the actual players. TH Ugly incidents between supporters. Sport is not a tool for spreading hatred and disagreement but rather love, passion, and unity.

No artificial clouds necessary! If it seems a far way off, that’s because it is, but don’t let that dampen your excitement. Let the countdown begin. As promised, Fifa has released all the votes publicly after the conclusion of balloting. Transparency is the name of the game these days. Donald Trump, who actively lobbied for the bid in his own inimitable way, has weighed in on the result. The US president could be midway through his third term when the tournament kicks off during America’s Sestercentennial. Oscar De La Hoya embodied the American dream when he went from a poor Mexican-American teenager to Olympic gold medalist ... and ultimately one of his generation’s richest and most decorated world champions as a professional. He’s written an essay for Guardian US, in English and in Spanish, on why Americans should back Mexico at the World Cup. The dizzying high of today’s outcome for American soccer fans will soon be tempered by a harsh comedown. Namely, when the World Cup kicks off tomorrow in Russia, the United States men’s national team will be watching it from their living rooms for the first time in more than three decades after a disastrous qualifying campaign. That’s rendered many Americans emotional free agents for this year’s tournament, but here at Guardian US we’ve decided to throw our support behind Mexico. In the next few weeks, we’ll have a reporter at each of Mexico’s games, starting from their opener against the reigning champions Germany on Sunday. We’ll also liveblog every El Tri game – in English and Spanish – and provide news and analysis throughout the tournament. All three heads of the winning federations are predictably thrilled with today’s result. Their immediate reactions: “Hosting the 2026 Fifa World Cup is a rare and important moment to demonstrate that we are all truly united through sport,” US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro said in a release distributed immediately after the result was announced. “We are humbled by the trust our colleagues in the Fifa family have put in our bid; strengthened by the unity between our three countries and the Concacaf region; and excited by the opportunity we have to put football on a new and sustainable path for generations to come.” “We are grateful for the chance to bring to life Fifa’s new vision for the future of football,” said Decio de María, president of the Mexico Football Federation. “Together – in partnership with our candidate host cities, the Member Associations, and Fifa – we will use this platform to unite the world around football and help create a new and sustainable blueprint for the future of Fifa World Cups.” “Hosting a Fifa World Cup is an extraordinary honor and privilege,” said Steven Reed, president of Canada Soccer. “Canada, Mexico, and the United States are ready to welcome the world to North America and serve as stewards of the largest Fifa World Cup in history. Our vision is of a world of opportunity for our candidate host cities and for the global football community.” USA 94, the first and only time the World Cup was staged in the United States, started and ended with a missed penalty. But everything that happened in between offered a compelling proof of concept that ultimately Fifa’s member nations were unable to resist today in Moscow. The 1994 World Cup set an attendance record that still stands with nearly 3.6m spectators (for only 52 matches), which augurs a record-smashing profit of $11bn for the expanded 48-team, 80-match tournament in 2026. That was twice what Morocco could promise. Throw in the nod toward the fiscally responsible, infrastructure-ready leanings of the moment – the US is one of the few countries on the planet with enough world-class stadiums, airports, hotels and training facilities to host the World Cup tomorrow if it needed to – and it’s no surprise that Fifa’s member federations voted the way they did. Interestingly, Fifa awarded the United States its first World Cup on the Fourth of July in 1988. The countries that it beat out? Brazil and ... Morocco. The United Bid received 134 votes, Morocco received 65 votes while one country voted for neither. Here’s the final tally on the voting body. A total of 210 members are present and eligible to vote but seven will abstain: the four countries directly involved (USA, Canada, Mexico and Morocco) and three US-governed territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands). The members have been prompted to vote electronically and they will have 15 seconds to cast their ballots. Former Bolton Wanderers and Senegal midfielder Khalilou Fadiga is speaking now. He doesn’t exactly dodge the money issue in his impassioned remarks: Football is love and Africa loves football. I’m here to ask for your vote. Why? ... Because Africa is the birthplace of humanity. Africa has given everything to the world. Now it’s up to you to understand that football is not just a question of money and finances, but it is deeply rooted in passion and enthusiasm. In Africa, we don’t have a lot of material wealth, but we do have that joy and we do have that passion and we do want to welcome you on our continent because this is the competition that we have been working in order to host. Africa has given everything to you and I do believe it is time to pay back to Africa. The representatives for the United Bid have finished their presentation and now it’s Morocco’s turn to make their final pitch. It starts with a video presentation (with an American voice-over) keeping with the running theme of casting perceived weaknesses as strengths, promising a more compact experience relative to North America’s sprawling three-country plan. Notably, the narrator promises $5bn of profits for Fifa, which is less than half the $11bn guaranteed by the United Bid moments ago. Now a Moroccan government minister roams the stage with a hands-free microphone making the case in French. Meanwhile, it appears as if the Spanish drama will be a net positive for the North American bid. Meanwhile, Spain is burning. Scenes! If these final presentations aren’t grabbing you, here’s some light reading material to tide you over. The official bid books for Morocco and USA-Mexico-Canada, which spell out the proposals in painstaking detail. Infantino is going through the voting procedure in exhaustive detail. Meanwhile, a series of flowcharts flash on the monitors behind him. No one can plead ignorance after this. Now each bid will make their final presentations. The United Bid, which won a drawing of lots, will go first. First to speak is Alphonso Davies, a 17-year-old winger with the Vancouver Whitecaps of Major League Soccer and the Canadian national team, saying he looks forward to playing in a World Cup on home soil. Mexican Football Federation president Decio De Maria speaks next, followed by Brianna Pinto, a member of the US women’s under-20 national team. Representatives for each bid will have a chance to make a final 15-minute presentation to the congress. Then there will be opportunities for advocates outside the bid teams to make supporting remarks. Then the electronic balloting will begin. As mentioned earlier: a detailed outline of the balloting procedure can be found on Fifa’s website, but here’s the short version: each of Fifa’s member federations one equally weighted vote on the first ballot for one of three options 1) the United Bid, 2) Morocco or 3) None of the Bids. Should either North America or Morocco receive a simple majority of all votes cast, it will be awarded rights to host the 2026 World Cup outright. We’ve moved to Item 13 on the agenda. The vote is here. Infantino is making his final remarks and the balloting should be under way shortly. There’s one question I’ve heard more frequently than any other since the USA, Mexico and Canada announced their joint bid last year. That is: The answer: Yes, the host country automatically qualifies for the World Cup finals by tradition, but in the event of multiple host nations, the Fifa Council will make the final determination on the number of countries that receive automatic bids. Of course, the World Cup has only been co-hosted once before in 2002, when both South Korea and Japan earned automatic invites. By most objective metrics the United Bid is superior. Fifa’s task force, which inspected each bid across a range of infrastructural and commercial elements, gave it a score of 402.8 out of 500 (compared to 274.9 for Morocco). The North American bid also promises to generate a profit of £8.1bn for Fifa, nearly twice Morocco’s projected haul of £4.48bn. But some close to the United Bid have expressed concern that Donald Trump’s intervention during the process in defiance of Fifa rules, say nothing of the administration’s incendiary politics, may work against their pitch, even as it’s since emerged that Trump has been lobbying on behalf of the bid behind the scenes. The US president has reportedly sent three letters to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and other organization officials offering reassurances that his hardline stance on visas would not affect visitors to the country during the tournament. Our Martha Kelner is at the Expocentre in Moscow. Her sense is a comfortable victory for the North American bid is afoot after the vote, which should begin in roughly one hour. Mingling with some of the delegates during the break in proceedings and suggestions seem to be for a comfortable victory for the United bid, possibly by a margin of 30/40 votes. The session is running slightly behind schedule but we can probably expect the voting process to start in about an hour. Confirmation, too, that the number of federations who will vote is 203. That accounts for the four bidding nations who are ineligible, plus three American-governed territories who are expected to abstain (American Samoa will still vote because one of their delegation has a New Zealand passport) plus Ghana, who are not here after corruption allegations. The Fifa congress is set to resume from a half-hour coffee break momentarily. Item 10 of the agenda is next: Vote on proposals for amendments to the FIFA Statutes, the Regulations Governing the Application of the Statutes and the Standing Orders of the Congress. The main event, as it were, is Item 13. We all know the World Cup is big business. But the raw numbers are no less stupefying whenever they’re revealed. To wit, Fifa’s head of finance said today he expects $6.56bn income during the four-year cycle leading up to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. From the Associated Press: Fifa’s head of finance says he “anticipates strong revenues” leading to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Thomas Peyer tells member federations that income from broadcasting rights will add up to 53% of FIFA’s budgeted income of $6.56bn over the next four years. Around 70% is already contracted. The extra income lets FIFA promise $1.5m annual grants to each of its 211 member federations. That’s a 20% increase. Fifa’s budget, which is typically conservative and eventually exceeded, calls for a $100m overall profit through 2022. That should help lift Fifa’s cash reserves close to $2 billion. The Fifa congress has just broken for a half hour, which is the perfect chance to explain the mechanics of today’s vote. A detailed outline of the balloting procedure can be found on Fifa’s website, but the CliffsNotes version is as follows: each of Fifa’s member federations one equally weighted vote on the first ballot for one of three options 1) the United Bid, 2) Morocco or 3) None of the Bids. Should either North America or Morocco receive a simple majority of all votes cast, it will be awarded rights to host the 2026 World Cup outright. If there’s no simple majority on the first ballot, one of two scenarios will ensue: 1) if enough “None of the Bids” votes are cast to prevent either North America or Morocco from surpassing the 50% threshold, the vote will go to a second ballot with the abstention option eliminated, or 2) if the number of “None of the Bids” votes equals or surpasses the combined total of votes for North America or Morocco, then both bids will be thrown out and the bidding process reopened to all eligible Fifa members except for the United States, Canada, Mexico and Morocco – a highly unlikely scenario but one worth mentioning. Our Martha Kelner, on the ground in Moscow, reports that at least 201 of Fifa’s 211 member associations will take place in today’s vote. The four bidding nations will not take part (per usual), while Morocco has lobbied for Fifa to exclude the US-governed territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands due to a perceived conflict of interest (though it’s unclear at this point whether they will indeed abstain). Additionally, Ghana has not sent a representative. Kosovo, whose attendance was in question due to the recent death of their FA’s president, are here and will be voting. Fourteen months ago when the United States launched a joint bid to host the World Cup with Mexico and Canada at a news conference on the 102nd floor of One World Trade Center, the outcome felt like little more than a formality. Even when Morocco announced a bid only hours before the August deadline to deny an unopposed victory to the USA and their junior partners, the so-called United Bid felt like a stone-cold lock. But a constellation of factors have narrowed the contest in the months leading up to today’s vote at Fifa’s annual congress at Moscow’s Expocentre, where insiders on Tuesday said the decision was “too close to call”. Now the moment of truth is a little more than an hour away. But right now Vladimir Putin is at the dais. Bryan will be here shortly but Fifa’s congress has kicked off in Moscow, where the organisation is preparing to choose between Morocco and a joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup. More than 200 national football federations are to set to vote at around midday local time in Moscow (10am BST) at their annual meeting one day before the 2018 World Cup kicks off. Fifa members must pick between the financial security of the United States-Canada-Mexico bid where all venues are ready, and a Moroccan bid that needs to build or renovate all 14 stadiums for a 48-team tournament. Mexico has twice hosted the World Cup, in 1970 and 1986, the US hosted in 1994, while Morocco has lost in four previous bid campaigns. The president, Gianni Infantino, has begun his introduction. Here are some of the highlights so far … Talking about when he took over: At that time Fifa was clinically dead as an organisation … two years later Fifa is alive and well, full of joy and passion and with a vision for its future. On his belief that Fifa is modernising: Of course we can do things better and we are trying to do this better. We have demonstrated we are a modern organisation. For the first time in a World Cup, VAR will be used by the referees. On his hopes to change the way in which transfer are dealt with: We are working on a real revolution on the transfer of players because we need to put an end to what sometimes seems an ugly image around transfers. We need to provide greater transparency. We need to protect our players &amp; the clubs that train players."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/12/england-south-africa-women-one-day-international-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T19:35:39Z","webTitle":"England’s women level one-day series with comfortable win over South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/12/england-south-africa-women-one-day-international-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/12/england-south-africa-women-one-day-international-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England’s women level one-day series with comfortable win over South Africa","bodyText":"It was statement day for England Women and they batted accordingly, returning to the joyous style that has defined the side under the coach Mark Robinson to reach a total of 331 for six, dominated by a pair of superlative hundreds from Tammy Beaumont and Sarah Taylor. The winning margin of 69 runs was comprehensive at the end of the entertaining encounter but when Lizelle Lee exploded to deliver a century of her own it was certainly game on. All it took, however, was Katherine Brunt to break the 142-run opening stand to prompt a run of consistent wickets to guarantee England victory. With England needing a win to balance the ledger at one game apiece and avoid a third-straight series defeat, South Africa sent them in under cloudy skies in an effort to bring on another collapse. Instead, Heather Knight’s side produced their best performance with the blade since their triumphant World Cup campaign. Taylor’s genius is far from a secret but this 118 was its fullest expression, packed with exuberant hoicks, upmarket footwork and outlandish standing reverse sweeps that only she dares to attempt with such regularity. It took the 29-year-old 93 balls to complete the century on her home ground, leaving only five women who have made more ODI hundreds. Less noticeable but no less important to the squeeze she and Beaumont created were the raft of shots through the fielding circle where hard running routinely turned ones into twos to quickly build their 156‑run stand. They defied the perception that middle overs of ODIs are when you wait for the fun to start again. On this day, the fun bit came early. When Beaumont saluted in the 36th over, arriving at the mark with three consecutive boundaries to pass through the 90s faster than Guru Josh, it was the first time an England player had done so since the group stages of the World Cup. It was also a timely reminder of what Beaumont has achieved playing for Robinson. When he took over in 2016 the right-hander was out of the side having made a paltry 207 in 23 matches. Her performance on Tuesday made it four centuries in 29 matches under his stewardship at an average of 49. That only three women have reached three figures four times in ODIs quicker than Beaumont says it all. Earlier her new partner at the top, Amy Jones, was impressive again until falling for 29, but it was her highest score in this country and laid a base with Beaumont of 71 to allow Taylor to come in with the opposition already under pressure. When the stand came to an end, Knight (24) and Danni Wyatt (20) did their bit with cameos at the death. Only Nat Sciver (6), elevated to No4, failed to get going. Statement made. Under the lights, Lee smashed 62 in 27 balls to double South Africa’s score in the space of seven overs to 142 without loss. But with wickets falling, Lee was snaffled wonderfully by Wyatt at point to put the locals at ease. After an early struggle, Sophie Ecclestone fought back well to finish with three wickets. The three-game ODI series will be decided at Canterbury on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/13/godspeed-england-reigniting-loving-feeling-2018-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T13:28:41Z","webTitle":"Godspeed England and thank you for reigniting that loving feeling | Sachin Nakrani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/13/godspeed-england-reigniting-loving-feeling-2018-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/13/godspeed-england-reigniting-loving-feeling-2018-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Godspeed England and thank you for reigniting that loving feeling","bodyText":"A World Cup is upon us, which means it’s time to look forward as well as back. Forward to a glut of football over the next few weeks – some of it great, some of it poor, all of it compelling – and back to previous tournaments, acting as they do as signposts in our lives. We remember how they shaped our summers as well as ourselves and, as is the case with most things, the first World Cup tends to mean the most. Italia 90. That was mine. I was nine, a year into my love affair with football and it was the tournament that sealed the deal. Omam-Biyik’s header against Argentina; Baggio’s dribble against Czechoslovakia; Schillaci’s eyes; Rijkaard’s mouth; O’Leary’s penalty; the warm hue of the television coverage that was like nothing I had seen before ... it was mesmerising. And making that summer of 28 years ago even more glorious, there was England. Oh, England. Young readers may struggle to believe this but there was a time when the national team were less a trigger for regret and cynicism and more a source of pride and hope. More than that they were liked, and no more so than in 1990. Bobby Robson, everyone’s favourite uncle, was in charge and the team was made up of seemingly decent blokes, the type who smell of Old Spice and have normal, proper jobs. Add Paul Gascoigne, that most lovable of rascals, to the mix and it was easy to be intoxicated by “our boys”. World in Motion played endlessly during those long, warm days and it went on all the way to the semi-finals, at which point there were tears before bedtime but also confirmation that, yes, I was an England fan. But it didn’t last. Come France 98 I was utterly indifferent to England’s progress and by Euro 2000 the bond had snapped completely. I laughed when Phil Neville gave away that penalty against Romania, a reaction that confirmed the worst – not only did I no longer care about England, I found their failings utterly hilarious. Several factors explain the change. On a somewhat superficial level, I found it increasingly difficult to get behind players from Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton and elsewhere as my dedication to being a Liverpool supporter hardened during my teenage and early adult years. Wanting the likes of Gary Neville, John Terry and Wayne Rooney to do well felt like an act of treachery rather than loyalty, with all the overblown fuss that surrounded the “golden generation” hardly helping matters. By the mid-noughties England felt like a travelling band of celebrities and no good can, and should, come from that. On a deeper level there was also the fact that as I got older, I felt less English. It’s the fate of many second-generation immigrants and especially those who have seen their mum called a “fucking Paki”, as I did in the 90s. Quite frankly, there’s nothing like a bit of racist abuse hurled at one of your parents in the middle of the street to make a person feel disconnected from the place of their birth and those who live in it. The hooliganism was a problem too, and in that sense Euro 2000 was a real watershed moment. Seeing those boozed-up dunderheads tear through Charleroi before England’s game against Germany made it even clearer that this particular source of national engagement wasn’t for me. All of which was a shame given how much England had meant to me, with Euro 96 the undoubted high point. I’m from Wembley and it felt like the centre of the universe for those few weeks in June. I also went to the Scotland game, saw Gascoigne score that goal and, up to that point, had never felt more deliriously content. The love died but now, slowly but surely, it has returned. Well, sort of. Because as England get comfortable in Russia I find myself willing them to do well. Godspeed Gareth and the boys, to Volgograd and beyond. This is an England setup that is easy to get behind. The manager is thoughtful and upstanding, bringing a primary school headteacher quality to the role (not to mention an actual tactical plan), while most of the players come across as decent lads. Yes there’s Jesse Lingard and his bloody dabs but even he fizzes with a tiggerish energy that is rather endearing. The captain, meanwhile, looks like the type of bloke you’d hire off Checkatrade to paint your spare room and be thoroughly satisfied with his time-keeping as well as work, while the sinister targeting of Raheem Sterling by a certain section of the media has had the effect of turning the player into a figure of sympathy. So England are nice again, unburdened by hype and Baden-Baden narcissism, and that’s no bad thing, especially as Brexit continues to tear a hole through society. Frankly, it’s become exhausting arguing with people over the colour of a passport and now comes a chance for the fighting to pause and for everyone to get behind a single cause. That’s certainly what I intend to do, and while too much has happened since 1990 for me to feel deep affection for England, there’s enough there to work with, enough for me to say I want “us” to do well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/12/senior-pwc-auditor-of-bhs-accounts-faces-15-year-ban-and-hefty-fine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T19:24:30Z","webTitle":"Senior PwC auditor of BHS accounts faces 15-year ban and hefty fine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/senior-pwc-auditor-of-bhs-accounts-faces-15-year-ban-and-hefty-fine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/12/senior-pwc-auditor-of-bhs-accounts-faces-15-year-ban-and-hefty-fine","fields":{"headline":"Senior PwC auditor of BHS accounts faces 15-year ban and hefty fine","bodyText":"The senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited BHS’s accounts ahead of its sale for £1 just a year before the department store chain collapsed is facing a 15-year ban and six-figure fine from the industry watchdog. Steve Denison, who spent more than 30 years at PwC according to his LinkedIn profile, becoming a partner, is understood to have been facing a £500,000 fine from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), reduced to £325,000 after he agreed to cooperate. PwC is separately facing a record £6.5m fine, reduced from £10m after it agreed to settle. The accountancy firm has also been given a severe reprimand and been told to monitor and support its Leeds audit practice and provide detailed annual reports about that practice to the FRC for the next three years. PwC said: “We recognise and accept that there were serious shortcomings with this audit work and that it is important to learn the necessary lessons. We are sorry that our work fell well below the professional standards expected of us and that we demand of ourselves.” The heavy sanctions against PwC come after the watchdog said it would double fines for poor audit work by the major accountancy firms to £10m from this month. Until now, the largest fine issued by the FRC was £5.1m, also to PwC, for its audit of RSM Tenon in 2011. Earlier this week the accountancy firm KPMG was fined more than £3m by the FRC for misconduct relating to the scandal-hit insurance software firm Quindell, which changed its name to Watchstone in 2015. The penalty was reduced from £4.5m as part of a settlement agreement. The conclusions of the FRC’s investigation come two years after it launched an investigation into audit work at BHS after the department store collapsed into administration with the loss of 11,000 jobs. PwC stepped down as BHS’s auditor after its sale by Sir Philip Green, the Topshop magnate, to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell in 2015. It gave the struggling retailer’s finances for the year to 30 August 2014 a clean bill of health. It also advised Green’s retail group on the BHS pension scheme between 2009 and 2013. Denison, who is also chairman of Yorkshire county cricket club, was among the witnesses asked to give evidence to an inquiry by MPs into BHS’s collapse. There had been valid reasons for signing off BHS’s accounts as a “going concern” before Chappell bought the retailer, he told a hearing in May 2016. Denison is understood to have left PwC this week and his personal contact page on the firm’s website had already been removed on Tuesday. He has agreed to remove himself from the register of statutory auditors, which is overseen by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, until 2033, according to Sky News, which first reported the fines. The FRC declined to comment. Denison was unavailable for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/13/morning-mail-us-halts-war-games-william-tyrrell-search-cat-free-zone","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T21:11:11Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Trump suspends war games with South Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/morning-mail-us-halts-war-games-william-tyrrell-search-cat-free-zone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/morning-mail-us-halts-war-games-william-tyrrell-search-cat-free-zone","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Trump suspends war games with South Korea","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 13 June. Top stories Donald Trump has ordered the suspension of US military exercises with South Korea in a surprise concession at an extraordinary summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Previously regarded as a key element of the military alliance with Seoul and deterrent against North Korea, the decision has led to the US president facing criticism for legitimising the pariah state without extracting concrete commitments in return. In return, Kim signed a joint statement committing to denuclearisation, but it was a vaguely worded pledge the regime has made several times before. Asked what would be different this time, Trump pointed to his instincts as a dealmaker. “We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time,” he said. “I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn’t.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia’s migrant intake will drop to its lowest level in seven years, figures disclosed at Senate estimates and visa statistics obtained by Guardian Australia under FoI have revealed. Australia’s migration program has been at 190,000 since 2012-13, but could drop as far as 25,000 below the 190,000 planned figure. Treasury modelling indicates that migration adds an estimated 1% to Australia’s GDP every year. Police have renewed efforts to find the missing toddler William Tyrrell, four years after he disappeared, beginning a four-week search of bushland at Kendall on the NSW mid-north coast. William was three when he disappeared from his grandmother’s home. Police in Port Macquarie are expected to brief the media on the search this morning. The world’s largest cat-free sanctuary could be doubled thanks to a $1m donation. The philanthropists Andrew and Jane Clifford have pledged to match every donation to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy up to $1m to eradicate the feral cat population, which is believed to kill 1 million native birds every night, covers 99.8% of the continent and has led to the extinction of 20 native species. The AWC has begun repopulating a sanctuary with endangered native mammals such as the bilby and burrowing bettong. Aboriginal organisations have added their voice to condemnation surrounding the NSW family and services minister, Pru Goward, after the release of the scathing Tune report, which was presented to the state government 18 months ago. AbSec says it’s no secret the state’s child protection system is failing, and criticises that “the lack of transparency around the report”. It has called for a statutory body to focus investment on Aboriginal community-controlled child and family services. A 27-year dispute between Greece and Macedonia could be over, with the latter agreeing to adopt a new name. The dispute has poisoned relations between the two countries since Macedonia’s independence from Yugoslavia and has prevented the nation from joining international institutions such as Nato and the EU. It will now be known as the Republic of Northern Macedonia, to distinguish itself from the Greek province of Macedonia. Sport Real Madrid have announced a surprise replacement to departing manager Zinedine Zidane, with Spain’s head coach, Julen Lopetegui, signing a three-year deal to begin once his duties with the national side at the World Cup in Russia conclude. Lopetegui, 51, was on the books with Real between 1988 and 1991 as a goalkeeper, and was selected ahead of rumoured targets such as Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp and Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino. In contrast to criticism surrounding AFLW, Cricket Australia employs six women in full-time coaching roles, thanks to a conscious effort to create pathways for female former players. Shelley Nitschke, the Australian women’s cricket team’s assistant coach, is one who has benefited from the push, and tells Guardian Australia: “It’s a good time to be involved in both coaching and playing.” Australia’s men’s team takes on England in the first ODI tonight – follow our live blog from 10pm (AEST). Thinking time Fifteen thousand years before the Egyptians, Aboriginal Australians were grinding grain – making them very possibly the world’s first bakers. That was the finding of Bruce Pascoe’s seminal 2014 book, Dark Emu: Black Seeds – Agriculture or Accident?, now transformed into a dance show by Bangarra. It premieres at the Sydney Opera House tomorrow before embarking on a national tour. “It’s a great opportunity for Australians to look at Australia with fresh eyes,” says Pascoe. “It also brings a new audience to the book and a new audience to the ideas.” A statement from the chief executive of the UK’s Royal College of Midwives may have resolved a long-running feud. Are the breastfeeding wars finally over, asks Zoe Williams. “This support for mothers who bottle feed has been hailed as the end of a battle that has raged for at least a decade, the Treaty of Versailles in a postpartum wrangle in which the breastfeeding side was considered so righteous that it didn’t even have to acknowledge the other one,” she writes. “Walton’s position sounds so straightforward, so obvious: why would you ever not want to support bottle or mixed feeding women, given that they represent over 60% of the population?” In 1984 Laura Miller, 16, was abducted and murdered by an unknown assailant, sending her father, Tim, on a three-decade crusade to find her killer. J Oliver Conroy tells his remarkable story, including the night he almost killed the man he believed responsible for the murder of almost 30 women and girls across 30 years along Houston’s “highway to hell”, and how after 25 years he came to forgive his daughter’s killer. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has come under heavy criticism for the glowing terms he used to describe Kim Jong-un, telling a journalist “he’s smart, loves his people, he loves his country”, in stark contrast to a speech from 2017 in which he detailed “enduring torture, starvation, rape and murder” within the North Korean regime. Media roundup Almost every major metropolitan masthead has led with Trump and Kim’s historic summit, with the Daily Telegraph going with “Donald &amp; the despot: nuclear frenemies unite”. The West Australian reports that Bill Shorten will today throw an extra $400m at WA while pledging to match Malcolm Turnbull’s $3.2bn infrastructure spending. And families of victims from the Oakden aged care facility scandal could receive compensation “within weeks”, according to the Adelaide Advertiser. Coming up Malcolm Turnbull will meet the Solomon Islands PM, Rick Houenipwela, in Canberra, while Scott Morrison will open a new building at Western Sydney University.

Today, when we leaned over the dry-stone wall, all trace of saxifrage was hidden. Over the past month, summer flowers have grown waist-high; tall enough to hide fledglings of the curlew that landed on the wall on the far side of the field and yelped alarm calls into the buttercups and cow parsley. North Pennine meadows are famous for their glorious flora, of hay rattle, wood cranesbill, greater burnet, sorrel, melancholy thistle and lady’s mantle, but on this warm, humid afternoon it was the flowering grasses that seemed to epitomise the luxuriance of midsummer. You really need a magnifying glass to appreciate the intricate modular architecture of their inflorescences. The basic grass floral unit is a tiny floret, with papery bracts, enclosing dangling stamens and feathery stigmas, adapted for shedding and capturing pollen carried on a summer breeze. In bentgrasses the florets are carried singly on long, slender stalks forming conical, airy panicles. Brome florets are clustered into heavy spikelets that curve languidly downwards. Timothy grass carries a cylinder of short-stalked spikelets, like a cat’s tail, surrounded by a halo of stamens. Elegant variations on a theme, simply by altering the length of floret stalks and the way they join and branch. Flowering grasses are an ethereal presence, graceful and constantly moving. As we watched, a zephyr passed across the field, trailing a wave in its wake: a gentle genuflection of tall-stemmed, russet flower spikes of meadow foxtail, a shiver through arching inflorescences of bromes, a trembling in the aura of stamens surrounding flower heads of crested dog’s-tail; millions of invisible pollen grains liberated in seconds. I trailed my fingers in the meadow, picked and crushed a piece of sweet vernal grass and breathed the aroma of coumarin, the smell of new-mown hay. For a day or two after the mowers arrive, this whole field will be heavy with that scent as the windrows dry in the sun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/12/solidarity-of-heirs-on-the-trump-and-kim-surreality-show","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T16:49:12Z","webTitle":"Solidarity of heirs on the Trump and Kim surreality show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/solidarity-of-heirs-on-the-trump-and-kim-surreality-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/solidarity-of-heirs-on-the-trump-and-kim-surreality-show","fields":{"headline":"Solidarity of heirs on the Trump and Kim surreality show","bodyText":"The Singapore summit was destined for success. Donald Trump had predicted as much on waking at the Shangri-La hotel, and by his own account the president was not disappointed. Trump had primed the world for a triumph. Like a dawn artillery barrage, softening up enemy lines and setting conditions for victory, Trump had fired off a string of tweets at 6am hitting out at his critics, the naysayers, and promising his followers: “We will be fine!” His hunch was proved right and his meeting with Kim Jong-un turned out to be as successful as he had foretold, something he was able to confirm within the first 10 minutes of meeting Kim. “I feel really great. I think it’s gonna be really successful and I think we will have a terrific relationship,” Trump said, sitting alongside Kim in the first session of a summit he had earlier described as “getting-to-know-you plus”. The hotel where the two men met, the Capella, is a former British barracks and a reminder of the pleasant life of colonial officers, spotless in white paint with wide verandahs behind rows of grand arches. The colonnades, an echo of the White House, provided a photogenic backdrop for the two leaders to stroll up and down in conversation. The personal warmth only got deeper as they day went on. By the end of five hours, after Kim had signed the joint statement and flow back to Pyongyang, Trump was talking about a special bond between them, and appeared ready to defend Kim to the bitter end. Asked about the North Korean leader’s penchant for killing his own relatives and starving his own people, Trump replied: “Well he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough.” “I don’t say he was nice,” the president cautioned unless anyone had got the wrong idea. “He ran it, few people at that age. You can take 1 out of 10,000 could not do it.” The remarks added ballast to a hitherto speculative notion that Trump identified with Kim’s backstory. They both took over the family business at a young age from unscrupulous but idolised fathers. It was solidarity among heirs. At his side Kim said little, apparently content to allow Trump to act as a master of ceremonies and cheerleader. With his perpetual flow of honeyed adjectives and careful stage-management, the US president, a former reality show host, conducted the summit as if it were a TV dating show – one in which Trump was both compère and suitor. As the two delegations sat down for a working lunch, Trump called out to the waiting Singaporean photographers: “Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.” Kim, who probably does not hear too many fat guy jokes back in Pyongyang, looked astonished. There are no pictures to record the look on the North Korean leader’s face when Trump produced an iPad and showed Kim and his aides a specially commissioned advertorial video on the benefits of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement. Produced in the style of the trailer for a straight-to-video 1980s action movie, it cast Kim and Trump as a pair of heroes struggling to save the world and its 7 billion people. “There comes a time when only a few are called upon to make a difference, but the question is what difference will the few make?” the portentous narrator asked. “One moment. One choice. What if? The future remains to be written.” Trump was so delighted with the video that he had it shown to the press while they waited for his arrival. “We had it made up,” he declared. “I showed it to [Kim] today. Actually during the meeting. Toward the end of the meeting. I think he loved it.” It has been a long time since Trump has been this ebullient. He claimed to have tried to persuade Kim to look at his country from a “real estate perspective”, speculating on what the beaches currently used for war games might fetch on the open market. “I said look at that view. That would make a great condo,” Trump said. He joshed with almost every reporter he called on to ask a question, and even pleaded with his spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, allow the session to run overtime. “I don’t care,” Trump said. “Hey, you know, it just means we get home later in the evening, right?” No amount of scepticism or snarkiness from the press was going to dent Trump’s mood. He seemed genuinely unaware that the promises he had received about North Korean denuclearisation had been made, in somewhat firmer language, by Kim’s father and grandfather in earlier decades. This time it would be different, Trump promised, because this time there was “a different administration and different president and a different secretary of state”. It was, in a way, a statement of the Trump doctrine. The ethereal, somewhat quirky nature of the venue helped the atmospherics. From early in the morning, the streets of central Singapore were blocked off and lined by police as the two leaders set off in their motorcades from their separate hotels for the island of Sentosa, a name apparently derived from the Sanskrit for peace and contentment. It was an improvement on the old Malay name, Pulau Belakang Mati, which meant “the island where danger lurks behind your back”, reflecting a dark past as a pirates’ lair. The Singapore tourist industry had gone one step further in the island’s rebranding, dubbing it the State of Fun, a place to escape the realities of everyday life. Along the way to their meeting, the two leaders drove past a turreted Disney-inspired castle and a rollercoaster, both set in lush foliage. The whimsical backdrop was not lost on Kim, whose father was a film fanatic and whose family has stayed in power in part because of their ability to create an alternate reality for their population. At one point within the first few minutes, as they were strolling down the white-arched colonnade, Kim turned to Trump and said: “Many people in the world will think of this as a ... form of fantasy ... from a science-fiction movie.” He could have had no way of knowing that Trump had actually had a science fiction movie made, starring the two of them as messianic saviours of the planet. But judging from the outcome of the summit, it is just possible that his instinct for handling Trump was far better than the American’s much vaunted intuition about dealing with Kim."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/12/cut-out-meat-pets-and-kids-to-save-the-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T17:13:54Z","webTitle":"Cut out meat, pets and kids to save the Earth | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/12/cut-out-meat-pets-and-kids-to-save-the-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/12/cut-out-meat-pets-and-kids-to-save-the-earth","fields":{"headline":"Cut out meat, pets and kids to save the Earth","bodyText":"Alongside George Monbiot’s suggestion (Want to save the planet? Drop meat and dairy, 8 June), another way to reduce greenhouse gases is to stop keeping pets. It’s been calculated that an average dog has an ecological footprint twice as large as that of a large car. Like meat-eating, pet ownership is nowadays encouraged by a vast industry; the pet insurance sector alone is said to generate more of Britain’s GDP than fishing does. The production of pet food, provision of veterinary services and breeding the creatures are big businesses, all with an interest in promoting the alleged benefits of owning a furry friend. There’s something rather astonishing about humans, especially those concerned about the environmental impact of our species on other ones, cheerfully possessing animals that are the results of generations of selective breeding and which exist purely to give their owners pleasure. It all sounds a bit like a ghastly dystopian sci-fi fantasy. Brian Hughes Cheltenham • George Monbiot’s article inspired me to cook vegetable curry for dinner, but surely limiting population growth is as important as changing our diets in order to conserve human and other life forms on this planet? Hazel Sutcliffe Holmes Chapel, Cheshire • The headline of George Monbiot’s article curiously echoes one that appeared in the Guardian last year (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July 2017). This earlier article, reporting on a study published in Environmental Research Letters, compares the results of different courses of action. By far the greatest impact is having one fewer child, which equates to saving 58 tonnes of CO2 for each year of a parent’s life. This takes into account the child’s total life, and that of his or her descendants, in proportions described in the article. In comparison, eating a plant-based diet would only save 0.82 tonnes. There is a graphic in the article which shows this very dramatically. Therefore, while the measures proposed by George Monbiot are helpful, their effect will be minimal compared with reducing our progeny. Roger Plenty Stroud • George Monbiot is correct that the way we currently produce meat is inherently inefficient. But we don’t have to give up meat entirely. Instead, we should make meat from plants and through tissue engineering – no animals required. Plant-based meats are already available in grocery stores. From Moving Mountains’ new “bleeding” burger to Vivera’s groundbreaking steak, there has never been a better time to switch to plant-based meat, which is vastly better for the animals, our health, and the planet. For those who want to eat meat that actually came from animals, meat grown directly from cells, called “clean meat”, is coming soon; like plant-based meat, it will vastly ameliorate the harms spelled out by Mr Monbiot. Bruce Friedrich Executive director, The Good Food Institute, Washington DC • I have always been intrigued/confused by the concept that vegetarians and/or vegans would want food to look like the very thing they profess to abhor (Sainsbury’s to sell vegan ‘fake meats’ next to real thing in 400-store trial, 11 June). Why would a vegetarian desire a pseudo-sausage or make-believe burger? Dave Collins Kidderminster, Worcestershire • While the discovery of meat traces in vegan and vegetarian ready meals (‘Meat found’ in vegan food, 9 June) will have come as a shock to many – including, I suspect, those producing these foods – the reality is that we live in a world where animals are routinely killed by the billions for their body parts, and worrying about trace amounts of animal-derived foods in vegan products won’t help them. It’s no different from eating a veggie burger at a restaurant that also serves meat or off the grill at a friend’s barbecue – there’s always a chance of cross-contamination. What we have to remember is that the packets of bacon and beef sold by supermarkets are composed 100% of dead body parts – so those are the products we should avoid if we want to help animals. Eating vegan isn’t about “perfection” or a quest for personal purity – it’s about achieving real change for animals suffering in the food industry. Choosing a vegan burger over a meat-based one is a win for them, the Earth and one’s arteries, and Peta offers a free vegan starter kit for anyone wanting to make the shift towards a more compassionate way of living.

This is why, when I am put in charge of everything, my first decree will be a limit on how long we must endure so-called entertainment. (Sorry, world peace. You’ll have to wait.) Double albums will be banned, the plug will be pulled at concerts after an hour, podcasts will be capped at 40 minutes, and any film director who allows their masterwork to run over two hours will have to reimburse viewers for distress caused. Furthermore, memoirs should comprise a single volume – if you insist on spinning out your life story over two or more books, you are probably a narcissistic windbag. Look no further than Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 500-page monster, Unmasked, which ends in the mid-80s to make way for a second volume. On realising, halfway through the book, that I had only got to 1978, I nearly burst into tears. Meanwhile, my coccyx is still smarting from watching the excellent but endless War Horse while parked on a hard plastic seat earlier this year; and my head continues to throb from the three-hour beating that was Avengers: Infinity War. I’ve had shorter holidays than that. It’s with a stab of sadness that I now know I will never see the Cure play live owing to their well-known and evidently well-intentioned policy of playing their entire back catalogue end to interminable end. For me, it would take 90 minutes for inertia to kick in, followed by resentment and then actual physical pain. We are, of course, living in an era when bigger is invariably seen as better, from food portions to fridges. Then there is a matter of investment. Art in all its forms is an expensive hobby – theatre and concert tickets in particular don’t come cheap – so value for money must be a consideration. Last week I went with my daughter to see Taylor Swift, where the top tickets were priced at £182. For that sum, you’d expect her to serve you dinner and drive you home after the show. Television is more cost-effective for consumers, though it has nonetheless become one of the biggest offenders in outstaying its welcome, with countless shows insisting on leaving us feeling glutted and nauseous rather than hungry for more. It’s a trend that began in earnest with the advent of box sets (Friends lasted 10 seasons and 236 episodes), and has gone into overdrive as networks vie for our loyalty with season upon season of hi-spec drama. Thus we have witnessed once brilliant shows – such as Orange Is the New Black, Dexter, or House of Cards – enacting a slow death before our eyes. It’s worth noting that two of the best British dramas of the year so far – A Very British Scandal and Patrick Melrose – have come in at three and five episodes respectively.

Just moments before voting began, the prime minister held 11th-hour talks with more than 14 Tory rebels in her Commons office, after which they received personal assurances that she would agree to the broad thrust of their proposals. One MP in the meeting, which included former cabinet minister Justine Greening and Ed Vaizey said that May told the group it was “a matter of trust”. The Tory rebels, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, later praised the government for “responding positively” to their concerns and claimed that they would be addressed when the EU withdrawal bill goes back to the Lords on Monday. However, furious Brexiters immediately condemned as unworkable Grieve’s plan to hand over control of the government’s Brexit strategy to MPs, suggesting that May’s attempts to overcome deep Tory splits on the issue was failing. A Downing Street source claimed that the prime minister had agreed only to ongoing discussions, raising the prospect of an angry showdown when a delegation of rebel MPs sits down with ministers to thrash out a deal. David Davis’s Brexit department cast further doubt over the rebels’ claims, issuing a statement which read: “We have not, and will not, agree to the House of Commons binding the Government’s hands in the negotiations.” MPs voted by 324 votes to 298 to back the government in rejecting an amendment passed by peers in April that would strengthen the hand of the Commons in the event of it rejecting the final Brexit deal. Tory rebels, who were numerous enough to have otherwise inflicted a damaging defeat, claimed that they had agreed to vote with the government after May agreed to address ongoing concerns. The proposals would mean that in the event of parliament rejecting the final Brexit deal, ministers would have seven days to set out a fresh approach. In the case of talks with the EU breaking down, they would have until 30 November to try to strike a new deal. However, there did not yet appear to be agreement on the final part – clause C – of Grieve’s proposals, that if there was still no deal by 15 February next year, the government would have had to hand over the reins to the House of Commons to set its Brexit strategy. The government climbdown, just hours after Downing Street said it would not compromise further on the meaningful vote proposals, underlined the fragility of the prime minister’s grip on her party and her lack of room for manoeuvre on Brexit. It came amid claims that three ministers had held talks with the anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain, which backs a second referendum being held. However, the group has approached almost every MP with details of research that it has carried out on every constituency in the country. In a day of extraordinary drama, Tory ministers and whips were engaged in frantic negotiations to prevent a damaging defeat over parliament’s ability to block a no-deal Brexit, which came right down to the wire even as the debate carried on. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, opened the debate by saying that the government could not accept anything that could undermine May, hinting that the amendments proposed by Lords and Tory rebels would hamper negotiations. But most of the original 11 rebels on the meaningful vote amendment had indicated that they would stand firm. The justice minister, Philip Lee, dealt a blow to the prime minister by resigning, saying he planned to vote against the government. The former cabinet minister Justine Greening, and George Freeman, Downing Street’s former policy guru, spoke in support of the rebel plans, heightening alarm among government ministers. The Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, scurried up and down the green benches, speaking urgently to groups of MPs, including Grieve. In between discussions, he spoke to ministers on the front benches, including May, scribbling notes on a Commons paper. The prime minister had urged Tory MPs not to undermine her negotiating clout with Brussels by voting against the government, but in a series of passionate speeches, the mood appeared to be shifting against her. In a sign that the government saw the prospect of defeat looming, the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, intervened from the front bench, saying there was “much merit” to parts of the compromise amendment. Shortly afterwards, the former attorney general left the chamber, later joined by the bulk of the remain rebels, who had been sitting together in a corner of the Commons, raising speculation they had been offered a last-minute compromise. After the vote, Grieve told the Guardian: “I am very pleased that the government has listened to the concerns of many colleagues and has responded positively to the need to amend the bill further to provide a proper mechanism to enable parliament to act, where necessary, if there is no deal or a deal is rejected by negotiations. “We will now work with the government to get acceptable amendments tabled in the Lords to address this.” However, the Brexit minister Steve Baker appeared to rule out the government backing Grieve’s plans for parliament to take back control. He told the Guardian: “It is a constitutional innovation which would be totally unprecedented. You cannot have 650 MPs conducting the negotiation. “Brexit is about making our constitution work the way a majority think it does, which is parliament making our laws. What we cannot, should not and must not do is overturn the principles by which international relations are conducted, which is that the government negotiates, and must have the support of parliament.” The Tory Brexiter Andrew Bridgen said: “The Lords have themselves admitted it is a wrecking amendment that is designed to stop Brexit. If the government accepted any version of it, they’d have a much bigger revolt on their hands and it would be led by the electorate.” But Tory rebels appeared unconcerned by opposition to their plan. One said: “Ultimately, if the government don’t accept the Grieve amendment then the Lords will put it down and we’ll have the fight again.” MPs return to the Commons for a second day of votes on the Brexit bill on Wednesday, although after remainers and Brexiters struck a compromise deal on Monday over the customs union, kicking that particular battle into next month, no more defeats are expected. The government won all 11 votes on the Lords amendments, and one more which was not contested. However, by the time the votes were done, there was only 30 minutes left to discuss key concerns over devolution and Brexit, in particular those raised by the Scottish government, to the fury of the SNP."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/12/democrats-poverty-calls-congress-us-rates-statistics","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T18:52:14Z","webTitle":"Democrats urge Congress to take action on 'appalling rates of poverty'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/12/democrats-poverty-calls-congress-us-rates-statistics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/12/democrats-poverty-calls-congress-us-rates-statistics","fields":{"headline":"Democrats urge Congress to take action on 'appalling rates of poverty'","bodyText":"Bernie Sanders and a group of top Democrats are calling on the Trump administration to present a plan to Congress to combat “massive levels of deprivation and the immense suffering this deprivation causes”, following an excoriating United Nations report into extreme poverty in America. In a congressional letter delivered on Tuesday to Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, the group said the UN report was “a call to action that we must heed”. They stand ready, the signatories say, to work with the Trump administration “to address appalling rates of child poverty, destructive economic policies that benefit the wealthy over the working poor … and lack of access to basic necessities in rural and underserved communities”. The group specifically urges Trump to put the convention on the rights of the child before the Senate for ratification. The US is the only country in the world that has failed to ratify the treaty and the letter writers say “it is shameful that more than 13 million children live in poverty in this country and that, on any given night, more than one in five homeless individuals are children”. The signatories include many of the most outspoken critics of inequality and poverty in America today. In addition to Sanders, an independent from Vermont who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, the senators in the group are Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein and Jeff Merkley. The signatories from the House of Representatives, led by Terri Sewell, are: John Lewis, Yvette Clarke, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, James McGovern, Raúl Grijalva, Earl Blumenauer, Danny Davis, Ro Khanna, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Frederica Wilson and Mark Pocan. The congressional intervention comes in response to the official report of the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, who acts as global watchdog on the human rights implications of deprivation. Following a two-week tour of the US in December that took him to several of the most poverty-stricken parts of the country, he issued a scathing critique of the fact that 40 million Americans live in poverty and more than five million experience levels of absolute deprivation associated with the developing world. Alston will present his findings to the UN human rights council in Geneva on 21 June. The joint letter suggests Alston’s report is starting to gain traction in Washington. So far the White House and federal government departments have remained studiously silent over his findings, though Sanders and his fellow signatories express the hope that Haley will relay the key conclusions to Trump. The UN report and the Democratic response to it act as a timely corrective to self-congratulatory noises coming from the White House over the state of the US economy. After this month’s jobs report showed a net increase of 223,000 jobs, Trump tweeted that under his presidency the US had achieved the “best economy &amp; jobs EVER”. But the UN report exposed the extent to which millions of Americans remain locked in penury exacerbated by the growing gulf between rich and poor. Sanders, Warren and their colleagues say the existence of such suffering in a rich country like the US is “an affront to any notion of the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Given the breadth of poverty outlined in the report, these rights are simply illusory for millions in this country.” Pressure on Congress to do something to counter the stubborn endurance of ill health, homelessness, lack of food and unsanitary living conditions has been given a further boost by the Poor People’s Campaign, the movement led by the Rev William Barber and the Rev Liz Theoharis that has swept more than 30 states. Barber and Theoharis were set to join Warren for a forum on poverty at the Capitol on Tuesday. Following Alston’s lead, the letter writers accuse Trump of taking hardships that have been decades in the making and “making things worse. We agree with the report’s conclusion that the administration’s $1.5tn in tax cuts ‘overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and worsened inequality’.” They lament the narrow definition of human rights adopted by the US over successive administrations. Quoting Alston, they say the US “is alone among developed countries in insisting that, while human rights are of fundamental importance, they do not include rights that guard against dying of hunger, dying from a lack of access to affordable healthcare or growing up in a context of total deprivation”. Sanders and his peers conclude that Alston exposed “horrendous conditions” across the nation. From Alabama, where endemic diseases of poverty are making a comeback, to hurricane-racked Puerto Rico and the jobless strife of West Virginia, “Americans are suffering”. But they end on a positive note: “The good news is, these are problems we can address. We agree with the special rapporteur that ‘with political will, extreme poverty could readily be eliminated’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/12/yahoo-fined-hack-ico-uk-accounts-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T14:53:16Z","webTitle":"Yahoo fined £250,000 for hack that impacted 515,000 UK accounts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/12/yahoo-fined-hack-ico-uk-accounts-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/12/yahoo-fined-hack-ico-uk-accounts-russia","fields":{"headline":"Yahoo fined £250,000 for hack that impacted 515,000 UK accounts","bodyText":"Yahoo has been fined £250,000 over a hack from 2014 that affected more than 515,000 UK email accounts co-branded with Sky, the Information Commissioner’s Office has announced. The personal data of 500m user accounts worldwide was compromised during a state-sponsored cyber attack in 2014, which was only revealed in 2016. The stolen data included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, passwords and encrypted security questions and answers, the ICO said on Tuesday. The ICO said the fine related to the impact on 515,121 accounts that were co-branded as Sky and Yahoo services in the UK, for which Yahoo! UK Services Ltd is the data controller. The data protection watchdog said the internet firm had “failed to prevent” the Russia-sponsored hack, following an investigation carried out under the Data Protection Act 1998. James Dipple-Johnstone, ICO’s deputy operations commissioner, criticised “inadequacies” that had been in place for a long time at Yahoo without being “discovered or addressed”. ICO said Yahoo had failed to take appropriate measures to prevent the theft of data and failed to ensure that data was processed by Yahoo’s US arm with appropriate data protection standards. Dipple-Johnstone said: “The failings our investigation identified are not what we expect from a company that had ample opportunity to implement appropriate measures, and potentially stop UK citizens’ data being compromised.” Yahoo declined to comment. The firm has since been acquired by US cable operator Verizon and was merged with fellow original internet firm AOL to form Oath, an operator of various specialists sites and internet services. “We accept that cyber-attacks will happen and as the cybercriminals get shrewder and more determined, the protection of data becomes even more of a challenge,” said Dipple-Johnstone. “However, organisations must take appropriate steps to protect the data of their customers from this threat.” Yahoo also suffered a larger data breach in 2013 that affected 1bn accounts but it was only revealed in 2016, after the disclosure of the 2014 hack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/jun/13/legal-system-of-child-protection-is-in-crisis-says-senior-judge","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"Legal system of child protection is in crisis, says senior judge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/13/legal-system-of-child-protection-is-in-crisis-says-senior-judge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/jun/13/legal-system-of-child-protection-is-in-crisis-says-senior-judge","fields":{"headline":"Legal system of child protection is in crisis, says senior judge","bodyText":"The family justice system is in crisis, fuelled by an “untenable” workload created by a glut of applications to take vulnerable children into care, the senior judge about to become the next head of the family courts has said. Sir Andrew McFarlane, who takes over as president of the family division of the high court of England and Wales in July, questioned whether the courts saw too many cases that may not be sufficiently serious enough to warrant the breakup of families. McFarlane said the courts had to be careful to ensure that the increase in cases that sat relatively low on the spectrum of harm, such as those involving child neglect and poor parenting, properly met the high legal thresholds justifying intervention by the state. The courts may be in danger of “slipping into the exercise of a broad benevolent discretion” and intervening on behalf of children who were “generally in need” rather than asking whether the conditions for removal from their parents had been strictly met, he said. “It may properly be said that we have reached a stage where the threshold for obtaining a public law court order is noticeably low, whereas, no doubt as a result of the current financial climate, the threshold for a family being able to access specialist support services in the community is conversely, very high,” he said. McFarlane’s comments came as he helped launch the Care Crisis review, an independent study of the child welfare and family justice system in England and Wales carried out by a group of senior lawyers, social workers, charities and academics. The review found that the system in England and Wales is in crisis, overstretched by spiralling demand and diminishing resources, dominated by a suffocating culture of “shame and blame” in social work practice, and undermined by austerity cuts and rising poverty. The number of care applications reached record levels in 2017, it noted, while the number of children looked after in the care system was at its highest since 1989. There are around 73,000 children in the care system, up from 60,000 a decade ago, and cash-strapped local authorities are struggling to keep pace financially. “Many professionals described the frustration they feel at working in a sector that is overstretched and overwhelmed and in which, too often, children and families do not get the direct help they need early enough to prevent difficulties escalating,” the report said. “There was a palpable sense of unease about how lack of resources, poverty and deprivation are making it harder for families and the system to cope.” The review set out 20 options for reforming the system, including a call for the government to review the impact of poverty and cuts to social security benefits on care applications, and a recommendation that ministers meet the estimated £2bn shortfall in children’s social services budgets. It said several complex and overlapping factors were driving the rise in children entering care and care proceedings, including rising family poverty and destitution linked to welfare reforms, and cuts to council support services for families struggling to cope. Social workers were hampered by an “increasingly risk-averse” culture, it said, and often felt under pressure to play safe by taking a child into care rather than trying to work to keep the family together, because of a fear of media vilification in the event that the child is injured or killed. The review was set up by the Nuffield Foundation and the Family Rights Group charity after comments made two years ago by the current family division president, Sir James Munby, that relentless rises in care applications had plunged the family courts into crisis, with no clear solution in sight. McFarlane said Munby had been fully justified in labelling the increase in care applications a crisis, and “was plainly right to blow the whistle” when he did. “I too am clear that this is a crisis and I am extremely concerned to see that it is by no means abating,” he said. Munby, who sat on the advisory body of the review alongside McFarlane, described it as “a fundamentally important report whose insights and recommendations must inform policymaking and decision-making, especially by government ministers and local authority directors of children’s services, if we are to have any chance of meeting the ongoing care crisis.” Richard Watts, the chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said: “The crisis facing children’s services goes beyond providing vital support to a record number of children in care. In addition, councils are also now starting more than 500 child protection investigations every day on average, and have a child referred to them every 49 seconds on a daily basis.” A government spokesperson said: “We want every child to be in a loving, stable home that’s right for them. In most cases children are best looked after by their families and children are only removed as a last resort. “Vulnerable children and families rely on the hard work of social workers, which is why we are continuing to attract high-quality recruits to the profession and setting high standards for the knowledge and skills they need. We are also rolling out a new assessment and accreditation system and establishing a new dedicated regulator so that all vulnerable children and their families get the right support. “We have made more than £200bn available to councils for local services, including children’s services, up to 2020 and we are improving children’s social care through a £200m innovation programme. As the report points out, many of these projects are doing effective and innovative work with families who are at risk of breakdown.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/13/a-cold-walls-samuel-ross-streetwear-class-race-architecture-virgil-abloh-kanye-west-a-cold-wall","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T05:15:09Z","webTitle":"A-Cold-Wall*’s Samuel Ross: ‘Streetwear used to be a class thing’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/13/a-cold-walls-samuel-ross-streetwear-class-race-architecture-virgil-abloh-kanye-west-a-cold-wall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/13/a-cold-walls-samuel-ross-streetwear-class-race-architecture-virgil-abloh-kanye-west-a-cold-wall","fields":{"headline":"A-Cold-Wall*’s Samuel Ross: ‘Streetwear used to be a class thing’","bodyText":"In menswear, streetwear is less a genre and more simply the norm. At this week’s spring 2019 shows, you could probably count on one hand the collections that didn’t feature trainers. But one person who doesn’t throw the term around with abandon is the designer Samuel Ross. “Streetwear. Hmm. I’m not too keen on it as a word,” says Ross, 27, leaning back in his chair in his small, sweltering attic studio in east London. “But it is a powerful one.” I ask him to expand. “Well, it used to be used as a separator. Them and us. A class thing. But now luxury houses are adapting to it.” He pauses. “The people who are in that category are the ones dominating fashion.” If Ross is not yet dominating fashion, he can almost taste it. Since launching his menswear label A-Cold-Wall* (ACW) in autumn 2015, aged 25, in three seasons he has become a rising star of British menswear with his cerebral, arty and futuristic take on, well, streetwear. A brace of recent nominations – the prestigious LVMH prize (he just lost out) and the Andam fashion award (still to come) – have sent his label global. His clothes are worn by the R&amp;B star Kehlani, the actor Jaden Smith and the designer Virgil Abloh. Ross is inspired by race, architecture and class – ACW is, among other things, about breaking down boundaries. In a single collection, you will see working-class uniforms alongside sportswear, Savile Row tailoring with building materials – jackets that resemble pebble-dash or the polythene sheets you might find on construction sites. At his spring 2019 show on Sunday, guests wore protective eyewear as metal structures were wheeled around by models. An industrial fan jarred to a minimal beat. At times, the clothes were in danger of sinking under the weight of concept. But then you meet Ross and realise there is more to it. Ross is black, working class and does not come from the standard Central St Martins fashion pool (he studied graphic design at De Montfort University in Leicester). He chooses his words in a nerdy, sometimes highfalutin way, but he is smart, snappy and fast talking. He explains how “protection”, “fear”, “tension”, and “pain” inform his work as much as being black. He describes clothes as objects or art, collections as performances, and becomes wide-eyed talking about nylon, shapes and lines. On his desk sits a Rubik’s cube, rulers and set squares. Ross, who now has a partner and a baby daughter, was born in Brixton, but he barely remembers life there before his family moved to Northamptonshire, because it was easier to get a mortgage. He would shuttle between the two to see family until he was 12. Home was Wellingborough – a market town with a pond – which wasn’t as quaint as it sounds. “For one, it was way more segregated – there were a lot of race issues,” he says. “But at the same time it was quite diverse, even though it is known for being a white, working-class town.” The town voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. “Had I grown up in Brixton, I think we’d still be talking about the same stuff in my work. Ross’s grandparents came to Britain on the Empire Windrush – and both his grandmothers were nurses. “The scandal happened and that rattled me, yeah. I still grapple with the idea of being English but I felt more [English] before the scandal,” he says. “I have a hard time grappling with the last 10 generations, to be honest.” Ross recently did a DNA test and discovered his family had originally come from Benin, in west Africa. “There is always going to be displacement,” he says of the scandal, before paraphrasing James Baldwin: “There is no way you can be a conscious black person and not have angst every day.” His father studied art at Central St Martins, which was “groundbreaking” in the 80s, and worked in stained glass windows. His mother is a lecturer at the University of Northampton. “Education has always been the thing in our family, and art,” he says. Ross was encouraged to draw on the floorboards, but took a circuitous route into fashion. “Nike tracksuits were my uniform. And buying fake shoes for £20, or selling fake Adidas from my house to turn a profit, was normal.” He laughs. “I mean, clearly, there was some sort of interest in fashion, a link.” Funnily enough, it is the architecture that has stayed with him. Not his terraced home, but the brutalist buildings or hostels, where a lot of his friends lived – post-war Victorian houses that had been gutted and fitted with cheap carpets. “There were drug issues, some had violent homes, but I was 15. I didn’t really look at things in a deeper level. These were and are my friends.” After studying design, he went to work in “hardcore commercial design”. He lasted a year. “I felt like I had been tricked. That everything I had read at uni was a lie to get me into the system.” He started putting his designs online to get noticed before he came across Off-White, the label overseen by Virgil Abloh, who has just taken over as head of menswear at Louis Vuitton in one of the biggest moves in menswear. He emailed Abloh. Abloh responded and he went to work for him, as well as Kanye West’s Yeezy label. These days, being a designer does not always mean simply that. At the CFDA awards last week, James Jebbia (the man behind Supreme) won menswear designer of the year despite not being a designer. Like Abloh, Ross came to fashion sideways, through design. “I’ve only consciously worked in fashion, as we know it, for five years.” That is as far you will get on the topic of Abloh or West. He mentions their names in passing, but he is guarded. “Look. [Abloh] is my big bro. We speak weekly,” Ross says of the most prominent black designer in the industry. He adds: “I mean, now I know that Ozwald [Boateng] was at Givenchy, but it wasn’t widely talked about. If I had known that 10 years ago, it would have steered me down this direction sooner.” Abloh attended Ross’s show at east London’s Truman Brewery on Sunday morning. The collection was part show, part performance art. Padded armless jackets, loose trousers – zipped or cut open – and plastic transparent coats sat alongside his signature detachable hoods. At one point, a styrofoam box was wheeled out and broken apart and a naked man covered in water and “blood” emerged. When it looked like Abloh got his Nikes wet, the audience gasped. Backstage, though, the designer was unfazed. “It’s so good to see him grow,” he said. “We’re a tribe and we have to stick together.” To anyone following Ross’s career, the collection was clearly a step up. Tomorrow London Holdings recently acquired a “substantial minority stake”, meaning the clothes are now produced in Vicenza, Italy, instead of Leytonstone, east London. It shows. “I’m producing with people who worked at Margiela,” he says. “Up until now I’ve been capping my ideas due to the resources. Now the cap is off.” He has a team of 14, including his close friend and ACW’s brand partner Andrew Harper, and two more who fly between Italy and London. It’s not cheap. A T-shirt will set you back almost £200; socks, £45. To counter criticism, he has an affordable line called Polythene, where T-shirts cost £40. “We hired two transit vans to go round London for the new collection and sold T-shirts out of the back,” he says. It makes sense that his work overlaps with his various cultural identities – his Benin roots, his Northamptonshire childhood, his time spent in London. “I came from a working-class background, but I’m not in that world anymore,” he says. “If fashion has long been about the upper-class painting the working class, this is post-class.” As to what happens next, surely a big fashion house is on the cards? “With time,” he says. “I’m 27. I’m not in a rush”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/we-have-a-new-chance-zimbabwe-gears-up-for-elections-after-mugabe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T04:00:06Z","webTitle":"'We have a new chance': Zimbabwe gears up for elections after Mugabe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/we-have-a-new-chance-zimbabwe-gears-up-for-elections-after-mugabe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/we-have-a-new-chance-zimbabwe-gears-up-for-elections-after-mugabe","fields":{"headline":"'We have a new chance': Zimbabwe gears up for elections after Mugabe","bodyText":"The president and his wife drive slowly across the dusty sports ground, preceded by a pickup full of local reporters, flanked by a crowd of excited teenagers, and followed by a large cloud of dust. Banners are held aloft, flags waved. Zimbabwe’s election campaign has reached Chegutu, a small agricultural town on the high, flat uplands 70 miles west of Harare. The rally is one of the first since the official declaration of the campaign last month. The coming election – on 30 July – is the latest turning point in the most tumultuous few months in almost four decades of Zimbabwe’s political history. In November, Robert Mugabe was forced out of power after 37 years, following a peaceful military takeover supported by the vast majority of the 17 million population. The coming election could decide the former British colony’s course for decades to come. “For so long we were suffering. Now we have a new chance in Zimbabwe,” says Chiedza Marutsa, a 57-year-old farmer attending the rally in Chegutu. The election pits Zanu-PF, the ruling party, against the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the longstanding opposition. Zanu-PF is led by Emmerson Mnangagwa, a 75-year-old former vice president known as “the Crocodile” who took power when Mugabe was ousted. Polls indicate a potentially close race, but one Zanu-PF should win. Mnangagwa’s message at Chegutu is simple: a vote for Zanu-PF is a vote for economic growth. The average income in Zimbabwe will increase four, five, 10 times in coming years, he promises the crowd, but that requires foreign investors. “What builds clinics, roads, schools, clean water? What makes jobs? It is business … Zimbabwe is open for business,” he says. The rhetoric is a stark departure from the leftist ideology of the Mugabe years. But Zimbabwe is in desperate need of capital: its once envied infrastructure is crumbling; government debts are massive; civil servant salaries go unpaid; millions need food aid to avoid severe malnutrition. Marutsa says her six children, all educated or with professional qualifications, are without jobs. Senior officials deny any shift in party principles, describing a “course correction” instead. “We are fulfilling what we went for in the 1970s: to build a new and modern country. We are going to break out economically at last,” says Chris Mutsvangwa, a presidential adviser and leader of the powerful veterans of the liberation war. Mugabe has “stolen the future of the young people”, he continues. “We were sliding into the middle ages. Reforms are in the works that will make us the optimal destination for investment in the while of Africa. Discipline, organisation, education and stability will be the building blocks of our future.” The ruling party’s messaging encourages Zimbabweans to look forward to prosperity and stability under an experienced, moderate and reasonable ruler. Anyone looking back may see Mnangagwa in a very different light. A former spy chief, Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s right-hand man for decades. He and other senior officials – many of whom are former senior soldiers – are accused of involvement in massacres in the early 1980s of tens of thousands of civilians in Matabeleland and of masterminding the brutal repression of the MDC in more recent years. Some are accused of corruption and racketeering. Voters know that Mugabe was not ousted to restore democracy but because Mnangagwa and others feared that the 94-year-old ruler’s much younger wife, Grace, was about to take power. Senior opposition figures are unequivocal about their view on the state of affairs. “We removed a dictator in November 2017 but we did not remove a dictatorship. These are not change agents,” says Tendai Biti, a top MDC official. So far there has been little material improvement for the ordinary Zimbabwean citizen since the end of Mugabe’s rule. Hard currency still remains desperately short and the price of key essentials is still rising. Representatives of major international investment funds have flown into Harare but are wary of committing large sums. When Mnangagwa flew to Beijing this year, he was told that China was happy to help but only when financial and legal systems improved. Until massive loan arrears are cleared, the big multilateral lenders cannot supply the money needed to refloat the economy. This is one reason why senior officials are so keen for Zimbabwe to return to the Commonwealth, from which it was suspended in 2002 after brutal repression and fraud during a presidential election. “Our policy is very clear: we want to be friends with everyone,” says the foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo, a former general who shot to global prominence when he announced the military takeover of the state broadcasting network. “For many years our people have been suffering and we want to get them out of the quagmire. We need friends to do that. We want to be a member of the community of nations again.” Opinion of Mnangagwa is divided among western diplomats and analysts in Harare Some are convinced the president wants to be seen as the statesman who has restored democracy in Zimbabwe and who would step down if defeated. Others say the Crocodile “does not have a democratic bone in his body”, but has pragmatically recognised the need to win international legitimacy if his country is to access the financial assistance it so desperately needs. The international community has interests too. Post-Brexit Britain needs a foreign policy success and has made its support for Mnangagwa clear – if conditional on free, fair and credible elections. China continues to take advantage of the Trump administration’s lack of interest in Africa to expand its influence. Recent polls show the MDC leader, Nelson Chamisa, on 28%, and Zanu-PF on 39%. If the gap were to close substantially in the weeks before the ballot, there are fears that hardliners within Zanu-PF may be tempted to revert to the old ways rather than lose power, even if the cost is international opprobrium. “These are the same people who were the enforcers of Mugabe’s regime,” says Welshman Ncube, a senior MDC figure based in Bulawayo, the country’s second largest city. The MDC says there are serious problems with the electoral roll, concerns over the ballot papers, a biased election commission and systematic intimidation of voters in rural areas. They also complain about the obvious and massive bias in the dominant state-run media. “A ruse has been sold to the international community … They are putting stability ahead of democracy, and favouring commerce over good governance,” says Chamisa, who has been leader of the MDC since the death of Morgan Tsvangirai in February. Other MDC officials go further, accusing London and Washington of complicity in repression. But few deny that the atmosphere is dramatically improved compared with previous elections. Although there have been 71 verified incidents of political violence in the first six months of this year, about half of which were committed by Zanu-PF supporters, respected human rights activists in Zimbabwe say that, so far at least, levels remain relatively low. One international election expert in Harare says logistic and technical preparations for the elections has been “correctly conducted” – a statement that opposition leaders called “outrageous” – and points out that many more respondents are now prepared to answer pollsters questions on voting intentions, suggesting “less fear” than before Mugabe’s fall. The MDC is holding rallies in Zanu-PF strongholds where previously it feared to set foot and has been allowed to march through central Harare. “A lot remains to be done but in the context we were coming from, to let us canvas, mobilise and organise is a lot of progress,” Ncube says. Mukudzei Majoni, 25, a project officer at Magamba TV, an online network in Harare that faced repeated harassment by the authorities under Mugabe, describes the atmosphere as “weird”. He says: “We’ve never had an election like this. We’ve never had this much peace ... It’s very disorientating.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/13/world-cup-fiver-spain-sack-julen-lopetegui-real-madrid-fifa-usa-usa-usa-canada-mexico-2026","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T11:28:27Z","webTitle":"World Cup Fiver | You have to hand it to Real Madrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/13/world-cup-fiver-spain-sack-julen-lopetegui-real-madrid-fifa-usa-usa-usa-canada-mexico-2026","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/13/world-cup-fiver-spain-sack-julen-lopetegui-real-madrid-fifa-usa-usa-usa-canada-mexico-2026","fields":{"headline":"World Cup Fiver: you have to hand it to Real Madrid","bodyText":"BREAKING NEWS … The bid staged by Canada, Mexico and USA! USA!! USA!!! has won the right to try and make the World Cup great again after Qatar 2022, beating off Morocco in the big Fifa 2026 vote shindig. Lots more here. LA FURIA ROJA With only one more sleep to go before the Ethics World Cup, a sense of excitement is sweeping across the globe. It’s no wonder the night before the World Cup – even the Ethics World Cup – is being called football’s Christmas Eve. Everyone’s got a mad case of football fever. The Fiver’s so giddy that it’s filled its diary with fake social engagements it can pretend to cancel over the next five weeks, a great bunch of lads met up in Singapore to discuss their sticker albums the other day and Gianni Infantino upgraded Fifa’s status from “clinically dead” to “alive and well” on Wednesday morning. Hooray! Hooray for Gianni! Hooray for Santa Soccer! Yet if the comparison to the festive season is going to hold, it falls to The Fiver to point out it wouldn’t be Christmas without someone spoiling the party. Our money was on Sam Allardyce flying to Repino and challenging Gareth Southgate to a n@ked wrestling match, but instead the focus has switched to Spain, where they’ve been flapping around like Iker Casillas at Brazil 2014 following the announcement that Julen Lopetegui is to become Real Madrid’s new manager, a development that’s gone down about as well as Roy Keane’s observations about Mick McCarthy’s professional and personal qualities in Saipan. You have to hand it to Madrid. At a time when nobody was talking about club football, they’ve managed to create quite the drama simply by opening their massive gob and, in a fervent show of patriotic pride, spilling the beans about Lopetegui. Luis Rubiales, Spanish FA president, had been enjoying a pleasant evening in his hotel bar in Moscow when word reached him that his national manager was about to do one. One minute all was well, the next he was flying to Krasnodar to tell Lopetegui to effectively “shove it up your b0llocks”. What a farce! Spain hadn’t panicked this much since Arjen Robben ran at them four years ago. So it wasn’t long before reports were emerging that Lopetegui was going to be bundled on the next flight aboard Do One Airways and a press conference was hastily scheduled for 9.30am BST. The minutes ticked by and, with no announcement forthcoming and talk that the players were opposed to their manager being sacked two days before their opener against Portugal, it seemed Lopetegui could yet emerge unscathed. It was a Christmas miracle. Were the good vibes back? Er, no. In an episode that made France’s bus strike in 2010 look admirably restrained, Rubiales eventually found a way to mend his wounded pride, plunging one of the tournament’s favourites into a state of utter chaos by dismissing Lopetegui. “We had to react,” Rubiales said. “I know that whatever I do I will be criticised. I accept that. The negotiations have occurred without any information to the Spanish FA and we were informed just five minutes before the press release. There’s a way to act that needs to be fulfilled.” Oh well. The players will just have to get on with it. At least they don’t have to face Him in 48 hours. Oh. QUOTE OF THE DAY “Jealous is what I feel. Massively disappointed. That should be me [at the Ethics World Cup]. Unfortunately because of the circumstances that wasn’t the case. If a bit more time was taken, a bit more patience, I believe I should still be the England manager” – never change Big Sam, never change.

BITS AND BOBS Marcus Rashford sat out England training in Zelenogorsk on Wednesday morning with knee-knack his manager Gareth Southgate described as no more than “a slight knock”, shortly before being presented with salted bread and a golden teapot by local dignitaries. Despite the minor detail that he’s currently serving a six-year ban from “all soccer-related activities”, Sepp Blatter will attend the slightly soccer-related activity that is the World Cup as a guest of Vlad Putin. “It will be a sporting and diplomatic mission for me,” he cooed. Russia manager Stanislav Cherchesov says his players have been passing the time before the opener against Saudi Arabia by “playing Trivial Pursuit” and presumably arguing over whether those little segments you win for each category are called slices of “cheese” or “pie”. Kylian Mbappé claims he is “fine” after being forced out of France training on the back of a reducer from team-mate Adil Rami. Non-World Cup News Dept I: League Two side Oldham have appointed Frankie Bunn – Paul Scholes’s favourite footballer – as their new manager on a one-year deal.

She was 59. A highly accomplished journalist with a warm and sunny personality, Cameron began her career at the Warrnambool Standard – after a stint in advertising – and then jumped to the Canberra Times in 1985. In 2004, she became the first woman to be the Sydney Morning Herald’s Tokyo correspondent, and made the transition to full-time radio after impressing ABC management with her easy manner and natural talent as a guest commentator. Cameron’s husband and fellow journalist, Greg Earl, said her favourite memories from her time as ABC Sydney’s mornings presenter from 2008 to 2011 were outside broadcasts such as Anzac Day in Hyde Park and the knit-ins where she got to meet the listeners. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon She famously said “hooroo” when she signed off from her morning shift, in a throw-back to her country upbringing in Warrnambool. The director of ABC local radio, Michael Mason, said: “Deb’s many friends at ABC radio are saddened to hear of her passing. Deb made a significant contribution to ABC Radio Sydney over many years as both a guest commentator and as a presenter. Our thoughts are with her family at this time.” Cameron died suddenly on Saturday, 11 months after her breast cancer returned and serial chemotherapy, radiography and surgery failed to stop the cancer spreading, Earl told Guardian Australia. Earl said Cameron had been courageous in her struggle with the disease and had gone out of her way to discuss her circumstances with any student nurses and doctors that she came across. “She made a practice to pick the quietest one out of the groups that increasingly came to visit her at hospital and at home and made sure they got to ask a question about the most personal things,” Earl said. “She told me that she couldn’t bear the thought of writing about her circumstances, despite being asked to do so at times, but loved talking to the young practitioners.” When she left the ABC she joined communications firm KJA where she enjoyed using her journalistic skills for community engagement projects. The executive chair of KJA, Kathy Jones, described her as an amazingly talented woman. “When she joined KJA some seven years ago after leaving the ABC as their morning broadcaster, I remember saying that her arrival had instantly doubled the intellectual capital of the organisation. And this remained the case whilst ever she was with us. I know we will all miss her intelligence, inventiveness and innovative approach to her work but we will also miss her warm spirit, love of life, and the guidance, wisdom and mentoring she provided to us all.” Cameron is survived by Earl and their two children, Nat and Eleanor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/jun/18/an-unconventional-gas-boom-the-rise-of-csg-in-australia","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T18:00:21Z","webTitle":"An unconventional gas boom: the rise of CSG in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/jun/18/an-unconventional-gas-boom-the-rise-of-csg-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/jun/18/an-unconventional-gas-boom-the-rise-of-csg-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"An unconventional gas boom: the rise of CSG in Australia","bodyText":"Australia’s production of coal seam gas has risen exponentially since 1995, going from zero to 30% of the country’s overall gas production in 2015-16. This boom has been led by development in Queensland, with only a small number of wells in New South Wales contributing to production on the east coast of Australia. In the following map, you can see CSG wells added by the date of drilling, and how it has spread across the east coast, with concentrations in the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland: However, not all of the wells drilled are producing gas – here’s the current status of all wells, according to data from the NSW and Queensland governments: The difference in development between NSW and Queensland is stark. Queensland’s CSG industry was helped along by a government scheme introduced in 2000 that required 13% of all power supplied to the state electricity grid to be generated by gas by 2005. In contrast, NSW governments have had a much more cautious approach amid heated opposition to CSG development from farmers and environmentalists. The NSW government temporarily froze new CSG exploration licences from March 2014, introduced exclusion zones where CSG development cannot occur, and has bought back exploration licences. The freeze on exploration has now been lifted, but no new licences have been granted. While not all coal seam gas wells require fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, to extract the gas, some do. Victoria has had a moratorium on onshore unconventional gas exploration and development since 2012. The vast majority of land in both the NT and South Australia is covered by either current tenements for petroleum exploration and development, or applications for exploration and development: In the NT and Western Australia, the unconventional gas reserves are primarily shale, which requires fracking. The moratorium on unconventional gas development has just been lifted in the NT, leading to community protests and assurances from the NT government that the risks of fracking could be reduced to levels that are acceptable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/11/g7-photo-of-trump-merkel-becomes-classic-art","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T06:28:25Z","webTitle":"Trump G7 photo becomes internet classic, going from baroque to ridiculous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/g7-photo-of-trump-merkel-becomes-classic-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/g7-photo-of-trump-merkel-becomes-classic-art","fields":{"headline":"Trump G7 photo becomes internet classic, going from baroque to ridiculous","bodyText":"A viral photo of Angela Merkel and other world leaders standing over a seated Donald Trump at Friday’s G7 summit has been given the meme treatment on social media, with Twitter users quick to liken the image to everything from renaissance art to a scene from the Apprentice. The G7 summit, which brought together world leaders from Germany, Japan, Canada, the US, Italy, France and the UK, was held in Charlevoix, Quebec, in Canada, over the weekend. This year’s summit had a particular focus on trade. However, the enduring image from the summit was one in which divisions between the group were clear. The German chancellor’s office posted the striking picture to Instagram on Saturday with the caption: “Day two of the G7 summit in Canada: spontaneous meeting between two working sessions.” The photograph, which was taken by the German cabinet’s official photographer Jesco Denze, was quickly singled out for its uncanny resemblance to a classical painting. Some Twitter users alluded to the overshadowing tensions between the two world leaders. After Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and recent tariffs on trade, the summit had been renamed by many journalists as the ‘G6 plus one’.

A letter signed by the leaders of most northern councils, tourist bosses and business people including Gary Neville – warns the government that the “current fiasco” could be repeated if Transport for the North (TfN), which advises the government on northern transport, is not given the power to improve the railways. “Over the past two weeks in the north of England we have seen an unacceptable level of cancelled and delayed trains. Travellers have missed vital appointments and been given written warnings at work; businesses have struggled to cope; and public services have been put under strain. Anger is mounting,” they write. Calling on the government to grant TfN full powers to manage all northern infrastructure, they argue that “only by TfN being accountable for the performance of Network Rail and the train companies can the north truly take control of its own destiny. Without greater authority TfN will not be able to supervise delivery of the north’s first strategic transport plan and avoid repeats of the current fiasco.” Despite having an annual budget of £80m, TfN has minimal powers to improve transport infrastructure. Unlike Transport for London, its counterpart in the capital, it cannot commission or run services, and instead comes up with suggestions for the transport secretary. All it can do is fund pan-northern projects, and in 2018-19 has set aside almost £50m for the development of a smart ticketing system that will work across counties and operators. A further £18m will go towards developing Northern Powerhouse Rail, a new Transpennine rail line. TfN has no power over the private rail operating companies, such as Arriva North, a subsidiary of the German national railway, which has cancelled165 daily services and temporarily closed the entire Lake District line after being unprepared for the introduction of a new timetable last month. On Monday, an additional 15 Northern services were part- or fully cancelled, and 21 services ran with a reduced number of carriages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/11/robbie-williams-singing-let-me-entertain-you-before-russia-v-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T11:26:25Z","webTitle":"World Cup Fiver | Robbie Williams singing Let Me Entertain You before Russia v Saudi Arabia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/11/robbie-williams-singing-let-me-entertain-you-before-russia-v-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/11/robbie-williams-singing-let-me-entertain-you-before-russia-v-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"Robbie Williams singing Let Me Entertain You before Russia v Saudi Arabia","bodyText":"THE WORLD CUP FEVER Wallchart affixed to fridge door with novelty football magnets?

Armed with all the requisite gear but still as clueless as ever, your World Cup FiveЯ is so wound up with anticipation it could be nicknamed “The Fever”, so giddy with excitement do we find ourselves as we continue the countdown to Thursday, when the competition kicks off. Of course no Fifa competition worth its salt can start without an official opening ceremony, the kind of garish, bland and inoffensive jamborees that are eagerly anticipated on the grounds that they: a) signal the beginning of a month’s worth of non-stop competitive international football action; and b) raise the comic possibility of seeing a former lead singer of the Supremes attempt the kind of penalty fans don’t normally expect to see taken so inexpertly until England have made it through to the knockout stages. Of course, in the interests of historical accuracy and pedantry it should be noted that Diana Ross famously shanked her spot-kick wide of a collapsible goal’s upright ahead of USA! USA!! USA!!! 94, a competition at which England – unlike Diana – didn’t actually get to kick a ball. World Cup opening ceremonies have varied in quality down the years from the commendable simplicity of placard-wielding schoolboys in full kit (England 1966), to men and women in national folk dress emerging from giant footballs (1974), to scantily clad raunchy dancers (Mexico 1986), to predictable pretentiousness (France 1998), to the equally predictable army of drum-beating Bavarians in lederhosen (Germany 2006). But Fifa has announced the 2018 Ethics World Cup opening ceremony “will have a slightly different format compared to previous editions”, with every indication suggesting it will – if nothing else – be mercifully brief. “This time, the ceremony will focus on musical acts and will take place much closer to kick-off,” announced Fifa of a shindig set to take place at the Luzhniki Stadium on Thursday, featuring the mouthwatering prospect of Robbie Williams singing Let Me Entertain You before Russia v Saudi Arabia, a match many are predicting will be a total snooze-fest. “I’ve done a lot in my career, and opening the [Ethics] World Cup to 80,000 football fans in the stadium and many millions all over the world is a boyhood dream,” enthused the popster as he channelled his inner Robbie Keane. With Jason Orange and Howard otherwise engaged, the former Take That singer will be joined on stage by Russian soprano Aida Garifullina, with “the football glory that all players will be hoping to achieve on Russian soil” represented by Brazil’s maraca-waving two-time World Cup winner Real Ronaldo on vibes. O Fenômeno may be carrying a wee bit more timber now than in his heyday, but if called upon to take a ceremonial penalty this Thursday you’d still be inclined to bet on him putting it away.

Not that Dele Alli is worried, even as someone with previous for retrospective punishment. “I’ve got everything under control,” he tooted. “You have to stay concentrated and you can’t do stupid things.” Uruguay forward Luis Suárez is another preaching the good behaviour line, what with that 2014 nibble still relatively fresh in the mind. “It was my mistake,” he sighed. “So I have a debt to repay to myself and Uruguay, to try to show a good image.” Neymar seems to have escaped his Brazil comeback unscathed after scoring in a 3-0 win over what he felt was an over-physical Austria unit. “We got ready for the UFC today, but it was good,” he cooed. “Everyone was unharmed.” And Fabio Capello, who oversaw this and this, has been ruminating on England’s approach to World Cups. “This never-ending 66, the returning ghost, something with its white tentacles … and you can no longer perform in the way you should,” he roared. “The other teams get on with it and win. They don’t come up with these excuses. They’re losers’ excuses. It’s not a sacrifice, it’s not a prison.

Britain has been hit by a flurry of weak economic data, that undermines confidence that its economy is recovering from its winter slowdown. New figures show that: UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in March, the worst performance since 2012 The trade gap widened to a 19-month high, at £5.3bn Construction output posted another quarter-on-quarter decline. Economists warned that Brexit uncertainty may now be biting, making it harder for UK firms to win new business abroad. The drop in manufacturing output was driven by weaker demand for steel and electrical machinery. My colleague Larry Elliott says the figures are troubling: The manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics are troubling for three reasons. First, surveys had suggested a much better performance. Second, the 0.5% drop in production in the three months ending in April makes forecasts of a strong bounce-back from tepid growth in early 2018 look premature. Third, even if signs are correct that consumer spending is picking up because of falling inflation, the UK will have reverted to its old pattern of growth after a short interlude in which activity was better balanced. The markets have shrugged off last weekend’s fractious and unconstructive G7 meeting, which saw Donald Trump fall out spectacularly with Canada’s Justin Trudeau in a post-meeting tweet storm. Trump has now declared that trade should be truly reciprocal, as he continues to criticise other nations for their tariffs even as he threatens more of his own. European stock markets are all up in late trading, led by Italian optimism that its new government will not consider leaving the eurozone. FTSE 100: Up 50 points or 0.66% at 7731 points German DAX: Up 53 points or 0.4% at 12,819 points French CAC: Up 23 points or 0.4% at 5,473 Italy’s FTSE MIB: Up 738 points or 3.4% at 22,094 European car companies have taken a hit, though, due to fears they could be hit by new US tariffs. And it’s been another rough day for the UK retail sector, with discount chain Poundworld falling into administration. More than 5,000 jobs are on the line. That’s probably all for today, thanks for reading and commenting. GW Shares in European carmakers have fallen today, amid concerns that they could be dragged into a trade war between the US and Europe. Over the weekend, Donald Trump suggested he could impose tariffs on auto imports, using the same ‘national security’ argument he’s already used for steel. Trump told reporters that there’s an economic justification for tariffs: “It’s economic. It’s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.” Any new tariffs could make it uncompetitive for European carmakers to sell cars in the US, which explains why shares are under pressure today: However, several European carmakers including Fiat Chrysler and BMW actually have factories in America, building cars for export. New tariffs could encourage manufacturers to make more cars in the US, or it could force them to move production to cheaper sites. Greece has won more plaudits today as Athens’ leftist-led government unveiled a multi-bill of “urgent” reforms before the Greek parliament. The move officially launches the countdown to bailout exit in August, Helena Smith reports from Athens. As Greece’s deputy finance minister Giorgos Chouliarakis formally presented the reforms before MPs - saying their passage would finally permit the country to exit international bailout oversight and successfully complete talks on the key issue of debt relief – Athens received what amounted to some of the highest praise, yet, from the euro group chairman himself. After almost a decade of being dependent on international bailout funds, Greece was ready to stand on its feet again, said Mario Centeno, president of the group of euro area finance ministers. “Greece is a different country today,” the Portuguese finance minister told a conference in Lisbon. “Greece has the conditions to take on its own hands the process of its economic and social development, within the euro framework, and can always count on European solidarity if it sticks to the path of internal responsibility.” The high praise came as Chouliarakis said it was vital the draft bill outlining further pension cuts, labour market reforms and privatisations in the energy domain, was voted on this week so that Greece could complete its final review by creditors in time for the next euro group meeting on June 21. That is when Athens not only hopes to take stock of a new €12b aid disbursement – it’s last as a bailout programme recipient – but could finally embark on meaningful debt relief talks, he said. Greece’s €320bn debt mountain is by far the biggest in Europe making economic recovery impossible if it is not reduced. Chouliarakis told MPs: “Completion of the fourth and last review of the economic adjustment programme will permit the Euro group on the 21 June to discuss, conclude and decide on a packet of measures for the reduction of Greek debt. Consequently it should be obvious to all why the legislation is of urgent character.” Greece’s staggering debt pile will also be the focus of talks today between German chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde today. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened calmly, as US traders take the G7 meeting in their stride. The Dow Jones industrial average is 22 points higher, or 0.1%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also in the green (just). Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says investors aren’t surprised that Donald Trump fell out (badly) with other world leaders in Quebec. The mood in financial markets is relatively upbeat at the start of a very busy week, as investors shrug off the G7 meeting which didn’t exactly go to plan as Donald Trump rejected the prepared communique and left early. While everyone will have hoped for a better outcome from the meeting, I don’t think anyone is surprised given Trump’s views on trade and his combative approach to the country’s allies on the issue. Perhaps it was the expectation that this was a likely outcome that has led to investors shrugging it off and turning their attention to something more interesting, and there’s certainly plenty for them to focus on in the coming days. Newsflash: Jaguar Land Rover is moving the production of its Land Rover Discovery SUV vehicle to Slovakia, from Solihull in the UK. JLR says it will retool its Solihull plant to handle a new generation of electric, petrol and diesel models. But there could still be job cuts at the plant, close to Birmingham in the Midlands, as the changes are made. Kaye Wiggins of Bloomberg has more details: Discovery production will be moved from the beginning of 2019, meaning job cuts at the Solihull plant are possible before it ramps up staffing again, the people said. The investment, totaling hundreds of millions of pounds, according to the people, could cut both ways. While some agency-employed plant workers may lose their jobs, the decision to build electric cars at Solihull marks a major commitment to U.K. manufacturing amid uncertainty over Brexit. European stock markets are holding onto this morning’s gains, as traders scamper from their desks for a quick lunchbreak (or spill sandwich crumbs on their keyboards). The European-wide Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, thanks to rallies in London and in Italy. Italian stocks are buoyant after finance minister Giovanni Tria has insisted that Italy remained committed to the euro. Investors are putting the G7 meeting behind them, and concentrating on the imminent Trump-Kim summit in Singapore. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says. “The FTSE has made a strong start for the week, with bullishness back in vogue in spite of a geopolitical dust-up at the weekend’s G7 Summit in Canada. Investors appear to be writing off President Trump’s bickering with his colleagues as same old, same old (start in attack dog mode, dial back rhetoric later), perhaps more interested in the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. UK building firms are suffering from Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of the UK pound, says Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains. As mentioned earlier, construction output shrank by 3,4% in the three months to April. Almost every part of the sector suffered: Today’s figures also show that total construction new orders fell by 4.6% in the first three months of this year, which will drag on output in the coming months. Thirkettle says: “Today’s statistics prove the construction sector is still in troubled waters with continuing uncertainties, borne from Brexit, and the poor value of sterling impacting on the cost of imported materials, meaning many UK companies are delaying investment decisions. “The real test, however, will be in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies’ commitment to new projects over the last two years.” Yet more disappointing news: the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, from March to May. That’s according to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It’s better than the 0.1% recorded in the first three months, but it dashes hopes of a healthy rebound from the winter slowdown. Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.3%. Amit Kara, NIESR’s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, says the UK is only growing half as fast as its potential growth rate, partly due to the snow in March. Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak. One reason for sluggish growth is the disruption caused by severe weather in March, particularly to the construction sector. The latest data also shows a notable slowdown in manufacturing sector output that appears to be driven by both domestic and external conditions. By contrast, the retail sector and the dominant services sector may be recovering. At Poundworld in Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain’s demise, reports my colleague Helen Pidd. “Oh what a shame,” said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. “If someone comes to nick my chickens they’re not to know it’s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes.”. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny, explaining: “At Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for £1. It’s £1.50 at the supermarket.” Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of Glow sticks for £1 each and some bin bags. She told us: “I didn’t think a place like this would close. I’ m in every week buying things I don’t need.” Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie’s yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld’s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetic outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain which recently announced plans to open 45 stores down south. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Yorkshire frozen food retailer Jack Fulton and it’s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. The slide in the pound today is pushing shares higher in London (as a weaker currency is good for exporters). The FTSE 100 is now up 70 points today at 7750, as City traders continue to shrug off the G7 mess. Newsflash: UK discount chain Poundworld has gone into administration, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. This is the latest in a string of retail failures this year, following the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin. My colleague Rob Davies explains how last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm failed: Poundworld, which has a chain of 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. But plans to find a buyer for the business have now been abandoned, although the administrators are likely to seek buyers for parcels of stores. But two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with current owners TPG Capital. All this weak economic data is bad for the pound. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.335. It’s down a similar amount against the euro, to €1.134. The 1.4% tumble in UK manufacturing output in April has come as a nasty shock to economists, who had expected a small rise. It undermines hopes that the UK economy was bouncing back from its slowdown last winter. Brexit could be partly responsible for the drop in UK manufacturing output last month. Economics journalist Dharshini Davis suspects that firms may find it harder to win business, because of the uncertainty over trading relations after March 2019. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that trade war fears are already hurting UK exporters. Here’s his take on Britain’s widening trade gap: “The deterioration in the UK’s trade position in April is a concern and means that the UK’s trade deficit remains significantly higher than the historical average. This deterioration largely reflects a marked decline in exports in the month. It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters. “More must be done to support UK exporters by addressing longstanding issues, from the lack of practical support for exporters to chronic skills shortages.” And Donald Trump thinks he’s got trade problems.... This morning’s economic data paints a rather grim picture of the UK economy. Here’s the ONS’s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith: “Manufacturing fell in the three months to April with electrical machinery and steel for infrastructure projects seeing reduced production. International demand continued to slow and the domestic market remained subdued. However, oil and gas production grew strongly in the aftermath of the Forties pipeline closure at the end of last year. “While construction output saw a small bounceback in April after a poor start to the year, over the longer-term this sector continues to contract with significant falls across most types of work. “Construction orders fell for a second successive quarter after recent boosts from large rail projects. However, new housing orders reached their highest level since before the economic downturn. “The trade deficit widened as exports fell by more than imports, with exports of goods and services both declining. Exports of machinery, aircraft and pharmaceuticals all saw notable falls.” Make that a triple-dose of bad news! UK construction output fell by 3.3% year-on-year in April. That’s the fourth drop in a row, and the longest negative run since May 2013. In a double-dose of bad news, Britain’s trade gap with the rest of the world has worsened. The total UK trade deficit widened by £1.9bn to £9.7bn in the three months to April 2018, due mainly to falling exports of both goods and services. Here’s the details: Goods exports fell £3.1 billion, due mainly to falls in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, while services exports also fell £2.5 billion in the three months to April 2018. Falling volumes was the main reason for the declines in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft in the three months to April 2018 as price movements were relatively small. The UK’s trade in goods deficit improved £0.6 billion with countries outside of the EU and worsened £1.2 billion with countries inside the EU in the three months to April 2018. In April alone, the trade gap widened to nearly £5.3bn. Britain ran a surplus of £8.7bn on services, but that was more than wiped out by a £14bn deficit in goods. Total industrial production in the UK fell by 0.8% last month, dragged down by that worrying 1.4% slide in manufacturing. Energy production fell by 2%, thanks to the warmer weather. NEWSFLASH: Britain’s manufacturers have suffered their biggest monthly fall in over five years -- raising new worries about the strength of the economy. UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April 2018, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That’s the biggest monthly fall since October 2012, when it shrank by 1.8%. The ONE warns: There is widespread weakness with 9 of the 13 sub-sectors decreasing and this is a continuation of the recent slowdown in this sector. Over the last three months, manufacturing output has now fallen by 0.5% - the worst performance since May 2017. The ONS blames “decreases in electrical equipment (9.4%), and basic metals and metal products (1.8%).” More to follow.... Donald Trump told fellow G7 members that America was tired of other countries imposing unfair tariffs. The data, though, don’t back this up. According to the World Bank, the average tariff on goods traded between countries has now fallen to 2.9%, thanks to various trade deals. G7 countries actually have lower tariffs -- at just 1.6% for goods coming into the UK, France, Germany or the US. Of course, there are still significant tariffs on some goods - such as milk imports into China, or tobacco imports into the US. But by unilaterally slapping tariffs on steel imports, Trump risks driving up the global tariff burden. Germany’s economy minister has said the G7 meeting has bolstered unity among European Union members. Peter Altmaier told reports in Brussels that: “The commotion at the G7 summit in Canada has brought the European Union closer together. It is important we show unity at all levels.” Four EU members took part in the G7 meeting - Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Like Canada, the EU is expected to hit back at America with a range of retaliatory tariffs on July 1st, in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Chancellor Angela Merkel took an unusually blunt line, saying that Trump’s decision to withdraw from the G7 communique by tweet was sobering and depressing. She told the ARD broadcaster that: “We won’t allow ourselves be ripped off again and again. We will act too. The Canadian dollar is dropping this morning, in the face of deteriorating relations between Washington and Ottawa. The loonie (as it’s known in financial circles) has shed 0.3% against the greenback to C$1.296. That’s a modest fall, following Trump’s claim that Canadian PM Trudeau was “very dishonest and weak.” Trump is particularly angry about Canadian milk, where domestic subsidies and high tariffs protect Canada’s farmers from the vicissitudes of the dairy market. But that centralised ‘supply management’ system does seem to work; it avoids both bankruptcies and gluts by guaranteeing farmers a decent price. Trudeau is determined to support it. Ding! European stock markets are open, and rallying despite the lack of progress at the G7 meeting. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or almost 0.5%, with similar gains in Frankfurt and Paris. Spain’s IBEX has jumped by over 1%. Traders are jittery about the acrimony seen in Canada last weekend, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, but also hopeful of progress in Singapore. Van Dulken explains: Thankfully, there is more optimism about the US President’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Potential for a meaningful discussions about de-nuclearisation on the Korean peninsula could diffuse some of the tensions between US and North Korea, improve the global mood and gain Trump some brownie points after this weekend’s events at the G7. South Korea’s stock market has led the rally in Asia today, on hopes that Donald Trump’s next summit will be more productive than his last one. The Kospi index has gained 0.75% as traders prepared for the historic Trump-Kim meeting tomorrow. There are also gains in Japan and India, although China’s benchmark index has dropped into the red. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are hoping for a breakthrough: The US President left the G7 summit early in order to prepare for his meeting with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. The meeting will take place today in Singapore. There has been a bit of toing and froing about the meeting, but now it seems as if it is finally going ahead. Last summer there were some volatile sessions on global stock markets on account of the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea because of the regime’s nuclear weapons programme. The meeting between the two leaders could greatly improve political relations around the world. President Trump has launched another tirade at the rest of the G7, as he prepared for his summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Tuesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was a bad weekend for fans of the rules-based international order, as the meeting of top world leaders struggled to meet even the lowest expectations. Relations between America and the rest of the G7 look worse than ever, after Donald Trump left the meeting early, refused to sign the official communique, and accused his host Justin Trudeau of making ‘false statements’. Getting all the adults in one room is meant to deliver progress and resolve differences, but not this time. Instead, the G7 has taken another step backwards, with Trump accusing the rest of the world of treating America like a ‘Piggy Bank’. So, the US is sticking to its new tariffs on steel and aluminium, and Canada is vowing to hit back with its retaliatory tariffs on US goods from July 1 – despite being accused of treachery by Trump’s economic advisor. The scale of the debacle suggests that the alliances and structures build up over the last 70 years are now creaking alarmingly, raising the dangers of a full-blown trade war. The financial markets, though, are remarkably unconcerned by events in Quebec. Asian stocks have risen overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei gaining 0.5%. European markets are expected to rally too; Britain’s FTSE 100 is expected to creep higher today too. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are shrugging off the G7 “Markets appear able to shake off geopolitical risks with stocks showing firmness in the face of a pretty torrid weekend for free trade. Asian shares have risen and futures point to the FTSE opening up around 0.2%, with smaller rises for the DAX and CAC. After a stormy G7 meeting, the US seems to have turned its back on its allies and is prepared to ratchet up the pressure on trade. Ostensibly this should not be good for risk, though markets appear deaf at present to such rumbings. This is brinkmanship that may ultimately end up working to the advantage of the US; but it is also likely to depress investor sentiment, and therefore growth through the second part of 2018. Nevertheless, expectations coming into the event were exceptionally low and so there has been little negative reaction in the markets so far.

Toondah harbour is listed by the Queensland government as a “priority development area”, a state-significant site identified for accelerated development. It also sits on tidal flats that are considered internationally significant and home to endangered migratory shorebirds. Opponents say the plan is one of the most brazen examples of urban development sprawling on to a sensitive environmental site. It is also legally complex, requiring approval by both the federal and Queensland governments. Walker Corporation, a significant donor to both major political parties, last week lodged a revised plan for Toondah harbour, the third in three years. The first was delayed seven times while under environmental consideration by the federal government. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The plan includes a new port facility, room for more than 6,000 residents, a hotel and convention centre, and a 1,000-space carpark. In a letter given to nearby residents this month, Walker Corporation says the new plan was developed “in response to feedback from leading environmental and wetland experts, public submissions and the federal government”. It says improvements include a larger buffer zone to nearby Cassim Island, “a more organic and natural system of waterways”, a section of parkland, a conservation area, a koala corridor and a wetland education centre. Opponents say no alterations to the plan could compensate for their principal objection: that creating an artificial harbour and high-rise development would require the dredging and destruction of sensitive wetlands. Richard Carew, a lawyer and member of the group Friends of Stradbroke Island, said the plan, even with modifications, breached Australia’s obligations under the Ramsar convention, an international treaty for the protection of wetlands. “Reclamation of wetlands listed under the agreement is only permitted if ‘urgent national interests’ exist,” Carew said. “Our national environment protection laws adopt the agreement by specifically requiring the federal government to act consistently with it.” The proposal requires the approval of the federal environment minister. But the development plans themselves fall under state law and a fast-track for major proposals introduced by the Newman government and maintained by the current Palaszczuk government. Jo-Ann Bragg, the chief executive officer of the Environmental Defender’s Office Queensland, said the state laws did not allow for appeal once a decision had been made. “EDO Queensland have had calls from a wide variety of deeply concerned citizens and community groups who are really most unhappy that this sort of development is proposed with impacts on ... a very sensitive location,” Bragg said. “By and large the natural environment is not solidly protected through our planning and development system. There’s constant inroads into our natural environment and loss of habitat. In relation to koala habitat, we’re at a crisis point. “With Toondah harbour we need a different process here and the [state] government has the legal power to change that process. And really this is a touchstone of how serious the government is about protecting high value sensitive nature.” Peter Saba, the general manager of Queensland development for Walker Corporation, said the organisation had worked with a wetland expert to develop the masterplan. “What has been submitted is a world-class design which enhances the environment whilst providing the Redland community with a fabulous destination,” he said. “The master plan is defined by a more organic and natural system of waterways and marina coves embedded with wetlands and publicly accessible edges. “We have put a lot of work into ensuring we have a plan that suits the area and the community who will get to enjoy it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/11/martin-sorrells-wpp-exit-came-amid-bullying-and-sex-worker-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T18:37:44Z","webTitle":"Martin Sorrell's WPP exit came amid bullying and sex worker allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/11/martin-sorrells-wpp-exit-came-amid-bullying-and-sex-worker-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/11/martin-sorrells-wpp-exit-came-amid-bullying-and-sex-worker-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Martin Sorrell's WPP exit came amid bullying and sex worker allegations","bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell’s departure from the pinnacle of the advertising industry was triggered by staff claims that he had bullied junior employees, plus allegations the tycoon was spotted entering an address in a London red-light district. The account, which was published by the Financial Times on Monday, came a day after Sorrell “strenuously” denied paying for a sex worker using funds from WPP, the company he founded and developed into the world’s largest advertising group. Sorrell’s weekend comments were made after weeks of City speculation regarding the precise reason as to why the businessman had resigned, with the Wall Street Journal reporting on Saturday evening that the advertising group’s investigation into Sorrell had examined if WPP funds had been used to pay for a sex worker. The investigation found there was no proof of misuse of company money. Sorrell, who had previously enjoyed a stellar reputation within advertising and wider business, resigned in April before the investigation had concluded. The FT alleged that: In 2017, two WPP colleagues claimed to have witnessed Sorrell entering a Mayfair address frequented by sex workers; Sorrell had a reputation within WPP for bullying junior staff and had created a “toxic environment” and a “fear culture” at the company’s headquarters; The chief executive’s expenses had previously come under scrutiny by the company; WPP staff were puzzled as to why the chief executive requested advances on expenses from petty cash, despite having access to company accounts or credit cards; Sorrell sacked his chauffeur after his driver refused to start work at 7am, having driven Sorrell’s wife, Cristiana, home at 2am the same morning. Sorrell’s representatives told the FT that “great care and attention” was always taken by the company and the chief executive over his expenses and that he “denies there was any misuse of funds”. Sorrell’s spokesman did not add any comment to previous remarks on the saga. On Sunday he said: “Sir Martin signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down which precludes him from discussing any of the circumstances surrounding his departure. He has rigidly adhered to this obligation and will continue to do so. “As regards the allegations [that company funds were paid to a sex worker], Sir Martin strenuously denies them. He will be making no further comment at this time.” On Sunday WPP said: “WPP has been advised that it cannot disclose details of the allegations against Sir Martin Sorrell because it is prohibited by data protection law from giving such details. Sir Martin chose to resign at the conclusion of the investigation by independent legal counsel.” When the Guardian visited the Mayfair address cited in the FT report – an apartment above a branch of the bookmaker William Hill – the door was open. A sign reading “Beautiful model” pointed up the stairs to another door, bearing a placard that said: “Beautiful young lady. Please knock.” A middle-aged woman with a Scottish accent answered, while a younger woman could be seen behind her in the three-room apartment. The older woman gestured toward a dimly lit room containing a double bed and said: “Go on through, the girl will be in in a minute.” When our reporter explained that he was seeking comment for the Guardian, she said to come back in an hour. The next time the Guardian rang the bell, the younger woman answered the door. She said: “We don’t know this man and we don’t want to answer any questions.” According to a bystander, different people occupy the premises on different days, meaning the women the Guardian spoke to might not have been there on the day the alleged incident took place. The latest developments have emerged in the run-up to the advertising group’s annual meeting this week, when the company is braced for a tough reception from shareholders. Investors, who have routinely beaten up the board about Sorrell’s pay packets over the past few years, are also agitated about how the board had been planning for the departure of its 73-year-old founder, as well as seeking the detail surrounding his exit. The company said it will “answer questions as far as we can at the AGM but we won’t be able to elaborate on the allegation”. Investors are expected to ask about the effectiveness of WPP’s whistleblowing procedures. Sorrell, who was the longest-serving FTSE 100 chief executive until his departure, was paid £13.9m in 2017, £48.1m in 2016 and £70.4m in 2015. He is set to receive further payments related to 1.6m shares in a number of award plans that will vest over the next five years. The exact value depends on the company’s performance but at WPP’s current share price the awards are worth about £19m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/john-oliver-mueller-investigation-if-this-is-a-witch-hunt-witches-exist","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T13:57:59Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on Mueller investigation: 'If this is a witch-hunt, witches exist'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/john-oliver-mueller-investigation-if-this-is-a-witch-hunt-witches-exist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/john-oliver-mueller-investigation-if-this-is-a-witch-hunt-witches-exist","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on Mueller investigation: 'If this is a witch-hunt, witches exist'","bodyText":"On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the numerous ways Republicans and conservative media have attempted to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation over the past year. He began: “We thought we’d update you on the ongoing Trump administration scandals that we’ve been calling Stupid Watergate, a scandal potentially on the scale of Watergate but where everyone involved is dumb and terrible and bad at everything. “Last month marked the one-year anniversary of the Mueller investigation,” Oliver said, showing news segments of Trump-faithful pundits like Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson referring to the inquiry as a “witch-hunt”. “Yes, they’ve been derisively referring to the Mueller investigation as a witch-hunt, which is a little ironic because you just know if Giuliani, Hannity and Trump had been alive back when people burned witches, they would have front-row seats, toasting marshmallows while trying to conceal their boners,” the host said, adding that the so-called “witch-hunt” has thus far yielded 20 indictments and five guilty pleas. “If this is a witch-hunt, witches exist.” The host went on to note that support for the investigation had fallen from 62% in July 2017 to 54% in April 2018. “If you’re thinking, well, ‘I don’t watch Fox News, I tune all of that stuff out,’ it’s actually important that you know what’s been happening on it for reasons that, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, Rudy Giuliani explains best,” Oliver said. “Because when he was recently asked why he was going around spouting unsubstantiated nonsense, he offered this explanation.” In an interview, Giuliani explained that, because Trump’s fate will probably come down to the matter of impeachment, “our jury is the American people”. “He’s related by blood to his first wife,” Oliver said, “but he is right.” “It is the longstanding view of the justice department that you cannot indict a sitting president, so to the extent that Trump can be held accountable, it’s going to be through impeachment, where public opinion is key,” the host explained. Oliver then summarized tactics used by Trump’s supporters to delegitimize the investigation, like redefining the terms of the inquiry itself. “It is important to remember Mueller wasn’t tasked with finding proof of collusion. In actuality he was tasked with looking into links and coordination between the Russian government and anyone associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matter that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,” said Oliver. “That’s a pretty broad mandate. So saying the investigation has to shut down if there’s no collusion is like saying a game of Scrabble has to end because you fit all the letters in your mouth. “There’s also whataboutism,” Oliver added, “the practice of shifting the debate to someone else’s wrongdoing.” Oliver proceeded to share a clip from Sean Hannity’s show, in which the Fox News host wondered why people like Christopher Steele, the Clintons, Jim Comey and Susan Rice weren’t being prosecuted instead of Trump. “That is a lot of name to throw up on the screen and just say, what about them?” Oliver quipped. “Hannity’s point is that other people did bad things so therefore Trump’s bad things don’t count. Let me be clear on this: whether or not someone else did something shitty has no bearing over whether you did something shitty. If that were true, every movie that got a bad review could simply say, what about From Justin to Kelly?” Finally, Oliver explained how successfully the right has established its own counter-narrative to the special counsel’s inquiry “by framing it as part of a grand conspiracy to bring down Trump”. “Night after night, Hannity paints a picture where the investigation itself is one gigantic scandal, with the Democrats, the FBI, the Deep State and the establishment Republicans teaming up to bring down Trump,” the host added, noting that Hannity is fond of saying that “Spygate” makes “Watergate look like stealing a Snickers bar”. “None of this even addresses the most obvious question,” Oliver said. “If absolutely everyone from Hillary to the FBI to Trey Gowdy was in on a Deep State plan to sabotage Trump, how the fuck is he president right now?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-north-korea-summit-realism-should-trump-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T12:24:32Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the US-North Korea summit: realism should trump hope | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-north-korea-summit-realism-should-trump-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-north-korea-summit-realism-should-trump-hope","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the US-North Korea summit: realism should trump hope","bodyText":"Roll up, roll up. There’s “excitement in the air!”, he tweets. Don’t call it diplomacy. The man doesn’t understand the meaning of the word. Don’t dignify it as negotiation. He has two modes: bullying and flattery. Even if concrete steps are agreed, this is, in essence, a spectacle. The US president will make history when (barring last minute upsets, not entirely impossible) he sits down with the leader of North Korea in Singapore. But he will do so only in the narrowest sense: that he is doing something unprecedented. His motives are too egotistical and essentially trivial for lasting progress; and there are good reasons why his predecessors didn’t go first. Serious engagement between the US and North Korea is long overdue. Talking to enemies is hard but necessary – especially if the alternative is “fire and fury”. It must be done, however, in a spirit of realism, with a serious aim and with a strategy. The North Koreans have these things; they have waited decades for this; Donald Trump has not. His belated attempts to talk expectations down suggest he has begun to grasp some of the obstacles. All the more telling, then, that he still sees no need “to prepare very much”; “touch and feel” are what counts. There has been no cabinet-level planning meeting, usual before such an event. John Bolton may be currently out of favour, with Mr Trump relying on the marginally less hawkish Mike Pompeo. But the persistent – even inherent – dysfunction of the administration is alarming. Nor can its members simply work around the president. Indeed, Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un will reportedly hold a brief initial meeting alone except for translators, stoking fears of a concession such as US troop withdrawal made on impulse – the same way he granted the summit. A catastrophic row is possible, too, if Mr Trump’s ego is dented. More likely is a flashy but insubstantial announcement to sate his vanity as a dealmaker: a statement that both sides seek denuclearisation, for example, glossing over their vast differences on the subject. When the razzmatazz is over, both sides presumably seek tangible commitments. North Korea has real goals: recognition as a power to be dealt with respectfully (granted by the summit itself); a “new era” in relations with the US, giving it more leverage with China; a lifting of sanctions so Mr Kim can proceed with domestic economic development. But the North believes its identity and survival depend upon its nuclear capability. That is unlikely to change. There is room for movement: a freeze on ballistic missile and nuclear tests (Mr Kim has already told his people they don’t need further tests, and this would be easily reversible); the shuttering of the Yongbyon nuclear facility (verifiable but, again, reversible); even the handing over of some arms; a full declaration of the progress of their programme (not easy to check). But all this is a long way from the “complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament” initially demanded. So don’t ask whether the two sides should talk. Ask: how will this summit help? Can a meaningful and effective deal be reached? Could such a deal survive the Trump administration on one side – never mind whoever succeeds him – and the North Koreans on the other? Any lasting resolution will be multilateral; yet Mr Trump is a unilateralist. He withdrew from the Iran deal. He hires hawks. He recently threatened Pyongyang itself with regime change (probably by accident). En route to Singapore, he rejected the recently agreed G7 communique. Who would count on his promise of a security guarantee? This meeting is unlikely to make real strides towards tackling North Korea’s nuclear programme, an issue that has defeated brighter and better coordinated and prepared administrations. It may, in the long run, make things worse. Scotched plans could ratchet up the animosity on either side. A return to maximum pressure seems implausible; neither Beijing nor Seoul is likely to prove so obliging again. The summit has already done Mr Kim’s diplomatic work for him; since its announcement he has seen Xi Jinping twice, and a meeting with Vladimir Putin seems likely. Make the most of the show. Be prepared for the bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-calls-on-trump-to-honour-g7-commitments","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T16:58:13Z","webTitle":"Theresa May says G7 summit with Donald Trump was 'difficult'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-calls-on-trump-to-honour-g7-commitments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-calls-on-trump-to-honour-g7-commitments","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May says G7 summit with Donald Trump was 'difficult'","bodyText":"Theresa May has said the G7 summit where leaders clashed repeatedly with Donald Trump was “difficult”, but the UK intended to fully honour its commitment to the joint statement that the US has since disavowed. Speaking in the House of Commons, the prime minister said Britain would abide by the final communique signed by leaders in Quebec, which was dramatically abandoned by the president after the summit. “This was a difficult summit, with at times some very candid discussions,” May told MPs. “But the conclusion I draw is that it is only through continued dialogue that we can find ways to work together to resolve the challenges we face. “The countries round the G7 table have been pillars of the rules-based international order, which has benefited all our citizens and, I believe, the world as a whole. The United Kingdom, with our allies and partners, will continue to play our part in promoting that order to the benefit of all.” Trump disowned the agreement hours after leaving the gathering, launching a personal attack on the Canadian prime minister and accusing other countries of “robbing” the US. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the White House was “inhabited by a president committed to his slogan – America first”, who was set on dismantling multilateral agreements. Angela Merkel described Trump’s behaviour as “sobering and slightly depressing”, and suggested international leaders should be more polite to each other. “The situation is not pleasant,” the chancellor told German television in a rare and lengthy interview. “I don’t think that taking the rhetoric up a few notches is going to make things much better.” World leaders at the summit believed they had a deal until the US president pulled out of the previously agreed communique, which represented a minimal show of unity with deep disagreements between Trump and the other leaders about trade. Frustrations had been mounting over Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement, and most recently to change the rules for trade tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US nevertheless appeared to have agreed to a form of words on contentious issues after an all-night negotiating session by officials from all sides. US reporters travelling on Air Force One to south-east Asia only discovered when the plane landed at Crete to refuel that the president had changed his mind. The communique said the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan agreed on the need for “free, fair and mutually beneficial trade”, and the importance of fighting protectionism. “We strive to reduce tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers and subsidies,” the statement said. Like last year, the communique made it clear the US had a different view on climate change and how to tackle it from that of the other six countries, increasingly being referred to informally as the G6. No 10 sources said although the prime minister did not have a bilateral meeting with Trump in Quebec, the pair had spoken “in the margins” of the summit about the president’s visit to Britain in July. The trip will follow a Nato summit in Brussels, at which Trump is expected to increase pressure on other countries in the alliance to join the US and UK in committing at least 2% of GDP to defence spending. Trump is believed to have his eye on Germany in particular. Merkel admitted he “has a point” over the comparatively low German defence budget, which is 1.1% of GDP and not due to reach 2% before 2030. The German chancellor, who has been increasingly frank over her frustrations with Trump, did not hide her disappointment at having failed to persuade him to change his mind, particularly over trade tariffs. “Sometimes, I have the impression that the US president believes that only one side wins while the other loses,” Merkel said, adding that she preferred to see situations as “win-win”. Merkel said she would continue to engage with Trump in the hope of winning him round. She said the tensions that dominated the summit did not make her any less committed to the transatlantic relationship, but it was no longer something Germany could rely on. The US president would not be allowed to have the upper hand, she said, particularly regarding the trade tariffs. The EU’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs showed “[we] won’t let ourselves be repeatedly taken advantage of”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/tesco-sells-green-lemons-as-spanish-supply-sours","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T13:17:15Z","webTitle":"Tesco sells green lemons as Spanish supply sours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/tesco-sells-green-lemons-as-spanish-supply-sours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/tesco-sells-green-lemons-as-spanish-supply-sours","fields":{"headline":"Tesco sells green lemons as Spanish supply sours","bodyText":"Tesco has started selling green lemons after relaxing its quality specifications in an attempt to avoid shortages in its UK stores and reduce food waste. Although the skins are slightly green, the fruit is as zesty and robust as lemons that have turned completely yellow, while the flesh inside is ripe and edible. The UK’s largest retailer has lifted its colour requirements for lemons partly to help offset domestic food waste by adding up to an extra two days’ shelf life to the fruit as it ripens. There has also been a shortage of yellow lemons caused by poor growing conditions in Spain, which supplies the UK with the bulk of the fruit until the end of spring.South Africa’s lemon season traditionally begins in late June and it takes over as the UK’s main supplier. However, Tesco will take the greener South African lemons earlier than usual to avoid gaps in its supply. “These greener lemons that we now have on sale are already mature and perfect tasting inside but need longer for the skin to turn yellow,” said Tesco’s citrus fruit buyer Savia Weidinger-Reich. “With the South African crop, that happens towards the end of June as evenings cool, which helps the fruit to colour. The move not only means that shoppers will again be easily able to buy a fruit that is growing in popularity, but they will gain extra freshness.” Tesco said lemon sales had risen by nearly 10% over the last year as more people used them in recipes and juicing. The greener lemons – the same price as regular yellow ones – are unlikely to be confused with limes as they have the more distinctive, elongated shape of lemons. Last year, Tesco started selling green satsumas and clementines to reduce food waste. The retailer says it is committed to reducing food waste throughout its supply chain and works with farmers and suppliers to adjust crop specifications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/02/emtithal-mahmoud-emi-interview-slam-poet-activist-sudan","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-02T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Slam from Sudan: how Emtithal Mahmoud shook the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/02/emtithal-mahmoud-emi-interview-slam-poet-activist-sudan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/02/emtithal-mahmoud-emi-interview-slam-poet-activist-sudan","fields":{"headline":"Slam from Sudan: how Emtithal Mahmoud shook the world","bodyText":"Emtithal Mahmoud was brimming with rage and misery when she sat down to write her poem Mama. Her grandmother had just died in Sudan, her mother was on a plane to the funeral and she felt consumed by anger. “I wrote it in one of the darkest times of my life,” she says. “It felt like my grandmother had survived everything, the war, famine, and in the end it was not just cancer, it was lack of access to proper medical research. It was a very dark time. And that poem helped me get through it.” Hours after writing Mama, Mahmoud – also known as Emi, who was born in Darfur but moved to the US from Yemen as a four-year-old – performed it at the 2015 Individual World Poetry Slam Championship in Washington DC – and won the competition. Full of fury, Mama opens as a man asks Mahmoud: “Hey yo sistah, you from the motherland? … ’cause you got a little bit of flavor in you, / I’m just admiring what your mama gave you.” It becomes a paean to Mahmoud’s mother, who “can reduce a man to tattered flesh without so much as blinking”, who “walks into a war zone and has warriors cowering at her feet”. “Don’t talk about the motherland unless you know / that being from Africa means waking up an / afterthought in this country. / Don’t talk about my flavor unless you know / that my flavor is insurrection, it is rebellion, / resistance,” Mahmoud recited, bringing the audience to their feet and receiving a perfect score. In London on a flying visit to the UK – she’s been in Birmingham speaking on Philanthropy Age’s How to Do Good tour – Mahmoud is overflowing with charisma. She has so much to talk about, from working in refugee camps in Greece (she pulls out a wallet made from a life jacket a boy on Lesbos gave her) to meetings with the Dalai Lama (“He said: ‘There’s a lot of pain in Darfur and in Sudan’ and I was like, ‘There is’. He held my hand for a bit and I said, ‘I’m working on it and we’re with you.’”) But she’s getting ahead of herself. She turned 22 shortly after winning the slam, at which point her life started to become a little surreal. Still a student at Yale, where she was studying molecular, cellular and developmental biology and anthropology, Mahmoud was chosen as one of the BBC’s 100 most inspirational women in 2015, and wrote the poem The Things She Told Me to mark the honour. In the middle of her exams, she was invited by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to speak at a nuclear ethics conference. “It was terrifying,” she says. “I thought, ‘They’re going to use me. I’m going to be a token.’” One of her professors told her: “Everyone is going to come with their own agenda but you stay true to what it is you want to get out there.” Mahmoud went; she listened; she spoke for an hour, interspersing her poetry into her talk, putting a human face on the refugee crisis and on the atrocities of Darfur. She’s since taken part in round-table discussions at the White House, including with Barack Obama, she’s opened for Ban Ki-Moon at UN events, and spoke in New Delhi to launch the 100 Million child advocacy campaign alongside Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi. She’s nearly always the youngest person in a room. She’s recently published her debut poetry collection, Sister’s Entrance. It moves from the personal – love poems, the experience of growing up a black Muslim in the US – to the political. Head Over Heels stems from a question she was asked at her first UN general assembly meeting: “The one-millionth refugee just left South Sudan; can you comment?” “Our once country— / all west, and south, and east, and north— / so restless, the Nile couldn’t hold us together / and you ask me to summarise?” she writes. Her performance is blistering. “I wrote it afterwards, I was furious.” Her poetry, she says, expresses the real emotions behind the headlines. “It’s hard, in our world, when you see violence everywhere – you’re desensitised to it,” she says. “What I try to do is to change the approach, so it helps people feel like it’s OK to feel again and to recognise that it is scary and it does hurt, and , it’s OK to cry. And people do cry.” Since she’s graduated, she’s returned frequently to Sudan, setting up “poetry town halls” for locals to share thoughts in a safe space. Earlier this year, she walked from Darfur to Khartoum in 30 days to raise awareness for peace, in what she dubbed the One Girl Walk. Thousands joined her en route; sometimes, they marched through tanks. She was scared. She performed her poetry. “My parents got death threats every single day when I was walking. We were ... constantly under surveillance,” she says. “Their narrative was: ‘The Sudanese government has been conducting a weapons recollection programme and putting more security out there into the country, and security equals peace. Because there is security, there is peace, and this girl is walking because she wants to prove Sudan is safe.’ My narrative was: ‘If we can walk together we can work together, we can create and inspire a collective responsibility for peace. We’ll bring the peace together.’” Mahmoud will return to Sudan in July, where she has big plans for more community groups and workshops around the country. Mostly she is volunteering, saving the money she makes from events “run by magazines or businesses that pay very well … to do the kind of work you can’t get funding for.” Mahmoud writes to explore her feelings; she performs, she says, because she has somehow found herself this platform. “A lot of things are said about people like me - young people, black people, Muslim people, women,” she says. “The reason I perform is to answer those things, to be a voice I didn’t really have growing up.” Sisters’ Entrance is published by Andrews McMeel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/22/girl-balancing-other-stories-helen-dunmore-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T06:30:21Z","webTitle":"Girl, Balancing and Other Stories by Helen Dunmore review – her final work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/22/girl-balancing-other-stories-helen-dunmore-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/22/girl-balancing-other-stories-helen-dunmore-review","fields":{"headline":"Girl, Balancing and Other Stories by Helen Dunmore review – her final work","bodyText":"When Helen Dunmore died a year ago this month, at the age of 64, it seemed unlikely there would be more of her work to come. After a lateish start as a novelist (she was in her 40s when Zennor in Darkness came out in 1993), her output was prolific: around 50 titles in around 20 years, including novels, poetry and short story collections, children’s books and fiction for young adults. The work kept coming right to the end. Even last year, there were three new books: a novel, Birdcage Walk; a poetry collection, Inside the Wave (winner of the Costa book of the year award); and an illustrated children’s book, The Little Sea Dragon’s Wild Adventure. Her career may have been cut short but, as her son and literary executor Patrick Charnley writes in a foreword, “she felt satisfied with where she had got to with her work; there wasn’t something particular that she wanted to achieve that she would not now be able to do”. She had just one suggestion for him: “A collection of stories at some point might be nice.” She had gathered some together back in 2010, but hadn’t pursued the idea; others had been read on the radio or printed in magazines. She told him about the file she kept in the studio where she worked, on the eighth floor of a tower block overlooking Bristol. And she gave him the passwords for her laptop and iPad. It was left to him to decide how much editing was needed – and whether the stories (more than 30 of them) were worth publishing at all. Mostly they are. This isn’t a book written in the shadow of death, as Inside the Wave was; there’s not the same resonance and intensity, and some of the stories are slight. But there are new departures on the themes that preoccupied Dunmore: childhood, motherhood, war, friendship, forgotten lives. And where her subject is women under threat or siege, the writing takes off. The first group amount to a sequence, or what might have become a novel, featuring a girl called Nina. First, she’s a small child with earache; then a teenager struggling to cope with life in a bedsit; then an art student in a Yates’s Wine Lodge, shelling out for a round of drinks and wondering how much change she’ll get from a pound. The late 60s/early 70s period detail is wonderfully grim (coal bunkers, Baby Belling ovens, Ascot water heaters, Senior Service ashtrays, Ajax tins, drawers lined with newspaper, Vesta chow mein), as are the descriptions of Nina living on a diet of baked beans and boiled eggs. But the meticulous attention Dunmore pays to Nina’s every action lifts the prose beyond the humdrum: “She cradled one [egg] in each palm, then lowered them carefully into the roiling water. A plume of white ran out, coagulated and began to whirl as she quickly turned down the ring to two.” Despite this painstaking particularity, the stories are mere vignettes, frustratingly incomplete, until we reach the last of them, the title piece, in which vulnerable, patronised 17-year-old “little Nina”, left alone in a large house by the sea on Christmas Day, goes roller skating along the promenade with a friend of hers, the ominously named Mal. It’s an exhilarating adventure at first (the cold air stinging Nina’s cheeks, “as if it carried grains of ice”), but when they stop, far from town, in fading light, and Mal puts his hands on her neck (“You don’t think I’m going to hurt you, do you”), the mood turns menacing. To escape requires her to outwit him, and that’s the denouement – not a trick ending but a story that ends with an acrobatic trick. There’s menace of a similar kind in another story, “A View from the Observatory”, in which two young women, accessing a view of Clifton Suspension Bridge from Bristol’s camera obscura, happen on a woman running away from a man, then being caught; the couple drift out of range, “dancing but not dancing”, before the man reappears alone. The two observers don’t discuss what they have seen; it’s left to the reader to infer the worst. Dunmore didn’t live to see the #MeToo campaign but she’s there in spirit, outing male predators and, more subtly, allowing them to out themselves. The creepiest one here is a university recruitment officer whose speciality is meeting female Chinese students in his office after hours. He can’t understand why his offer to make tea is so frightening to them. But when he lets slip that he was dumped by his one serious girlfriend, and fantasises about slapping her face “until there is nothing left of her smile”, the reader smells a rat. He’s not the only unreliable narrator; nor is it only men who are wildly self-deluding. When the female narrator of “A Very Fine House” (title courtesy of Crosby, Stills and Nash) proudly takes us round her newly purchased Grade II listed home, we’re initially willing to be led. But the noises coming from the basement aren’t what they seem – and nor is she. When Dunmore’s characters talk themselves up, boasting of brilliant careers (as Sophie in “Dancer’s Feet” does) or adoring families (see Mrs Marion in “Chocolate for Later”), it’s as well to be suspicious – though once the truth emerges, what Dunmore leaves us feeling isn’t betrayal or anger, but pity. Compassion is one of her keynotes. She likes to give a voice to the voiceless: to addicts and self-harmers; to eccentric old ladies (like the one nicknamed Auntie Binbag) and Muslims wrongly suspected of terrorism; to the undervalued and overlooked. At times the stories are too right-minded for their own good and fall flat. “Stop being so kind and understanding,” you want to tell her. “And how about a few jokes?” But humour is not entirely lacking. One of the longest stories here, “With Shackleton”, set at the dawn of the 20th century, features a woman, Isabel, left holding the baby while her husband Stephen goes off on a polar expedition. Actually the baby, Clara, is now five; she was due to have a brother until Isabel miscarried. How much the loss has affected Stephen, “pregnant with his journey”, is hard to judge, but it has been punishing for Isabel, especially because Stephen’s mother Josephine is so unsympathetic (“I don’t really regard it as a family, if there is only one child”). Dunmore is the last person to go in for mother-in-law jokes but she has fun at the expense of Josephine, portraying her and her friends as “old she-elephants trampling and trumpeting and blundering their way through the jungle of north London”. A couple of other uncharacteristic pieces here move into the realms of fantasy and fable. More typical are the tributes Dunmore pays to literary forebears: John Donne, whose portrait it seems she once drooled over (“I would have done anything for you when I was 15”); Fanny Burney, who had a mastectomy, performed without an anaesthetic, when she was 59, and lived for another 29 years; Charlotte Brontë, whose most famous novel Dunmore reinterprets by bringing Grace Poole out of the shadows to diss the sly, spidery Jane Eyre and stake her own claim on Mr Rochester. The book ends with John Keats, whose last weeks of life, in Rome, are recalled through the eyes of his friend Joseph Severn. It’s not only Keats’s stoicism and humour that Dunmore homes in on (“Sometimes I think I am already buried, with flowers growing over me”), but the sketch that Severn made of him as he lay dying – an act of tender commemoration, much like this collection of stories: “His breath. A long dragging pause. Another breath. You can live an entire life between one breath and the next. That’s where my life was spent, in one night, in one room. The rest is memory.” Blake Morrison’s latest novel is The Executor. Girl, Balancing is published by Hutchinson. To order a copy for £14.99 (RRP £20) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern had her final day in the capital on Monday before heading home to Auckland in preparation for the birth of her first child on Sunday. She has said she will not hand over power to Peters until she heads to hospital. However, tensions have arisen as Peters, the head of the conservative NZ First party, refused to back a repeal of a controversial “three strikes” policy. The law, enacted in 2010, set up a three-stage system of increasing consequences for repeat serious violent offenders. On a third offence, a judge must issue the maximum possible sentence unless the court considers it would be manifestly unjust. Justice minister Andrew Little called the law the “high watermark of policy stupidity” and many academics and public policy experts have denounced it as ineffective. Little was due to announce the repeal on Monday but instead said NZ First did not back it. “They didn’t want that to be seen as separate from a broader programme of criminal justice reform,” he said. The leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges, said Little’s backtrack had “underlined cracks in the coalition”. “We’ll see the power dynamics of that and who’s really in charge,” Bridges told Radio New Zealand (RNZ). The reversal also comes as Peters files a court case against the heads of the Ministry of Social Development and State Services Commission and the attorney general on behalf of former ministers under the previous administration. Peters confirmed on Monday night that he was seeking NZ$400,000 in damages for breach of privacy after details about overpayments of his superannuation were leaked to the media last year. During last year’s election campaign Peters was found to have been mistakenly overpaid superannuation for seven years. The 73-year-old veteran politician repaid the money when the error was found. Ardern told RNZ Peters would recuse himself from any cabinet decisions to do with his lawsuit and said there were processes for dealing with the issue. “It hasn’t affected the ability of the deputy prime minister to do his job thus far … it’s a private matter not a political matter.” Ardern told the AM Show this morning that if her pregnancy ran over time she would likely induce labour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15012","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T23:00:08Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15012","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15012","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,012","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
