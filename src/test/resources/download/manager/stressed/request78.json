In an update for the first six months of its financial year, the group, which owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as the John Lewis department store chain, said it expected the tough retail climate to continue throughout this year as UK consumers were less willing to spend money against a backdrop of higher inflation and political uncertainty. As the government prepares for a fourth round of Brexit negotiations with the EU, the John Lewis chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said uncertainty was being throughout the economy and a “serious” parliamentary debate about Brexit was now essential. “Brexit is having an impact on everybody. Sterling is weaker and there is evidence to show that confidence is being affected. The issues related to leaving the EU are extremely complicated and we do want to see justice being done to that complexity. There needs to be serious parliamentary debate. “There is a very complex negotiation before us and the core principles of that need to be thrashed out in order to increase the chances of a successful conclusion to the negotiation. If not there is a greater risk of a disorderly outcome.” Mayfield’s warning came as he unveiled pre-tax profit at the John Lewis group had slumped 53% in the six months to the end of July, to £26.6m. Much of the damage to the bottom line was due to £56m of redundancy and restructuring costs designed to improve productivity and accommodate the increasing demand for online shopping. When these one-off costs were stripped out, pre-tax profit was down almost 5% at £83m as higher costs ate into margins. Group sales rose by 2.3% over the period, to £5.4bn. The department stores performed better than the Waitrose supermarket side of the group. Underlying profits increased 9.7% at the John Lewis stores to nearly £40m, while Waitrose profits fell 17.4% to £101m as costs rose three times faster than a 1.5% rise in prices. Waitrose boss Rob Collins said inflation in meat, fish and dairy had been very strong.Mayfield said the retailer had not passed on to shoppers the full extent of its own rising costs resulting from the fall in the value of sterling. “We are not expecting these headwinds to diminish.” he said. Aside from the cost of restructuring at John Lewis, Mayfield said profits had predominantly been affected by a squeeze on margins as tough competition was forcing the company to keep prices down despite rising costs. But it was a different story at Morrisons, where bosses said they had kept profit margins steady despite cost inflation by increasing sales and improving efficiency in its supply chain, much of which is managed in house. Underlying pretax profits at the recovering retail group rose 12.7% to £177m as sales rose 4.8% to £8.4bn. The chief executive, David Potts, said the retailer’s set-up, with two-thirds of its products sourced in the UK and much of its meat fish and vegetables processed in-house, meant the company “should be giving it your best shot to be holding inflation down for customers”. He said it was not possible to “defy gravity” on some products, such as butter and cream, where inflation had been very heady. But new avenues of distribution for Morrisons products, including selling Safeway-branded goods to the McColl’s convenience store chain from next year, supplying Amazon with groceries and a tie-up with petrol forecourt operator Rontec would all help boost productivity and margins despite rising inflation. Mayfield said sales were rising so far in the second half, but warned that a number of factors would weigh on profits. “Sales growth has continued in the first few weeks of the second half. We are well set for our all-important seasonal peak, but we expect the headwinds that have dampened consumer demand and put pressure on margins to continue into next year,” he said. In March, when John Lewis announced full-year results for 2016, the bonus for staff was cut to just 6% of salary, the lowest level since the 1950s and down from 10% the year before. Mayfield said the second half of the year would be crucial to determining the staff bonus for next year, because the business makes two-thirds of profits during the latter half."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/17/a-yes-vote-is-vital-for-the-mental-health-of-lgbti-australians-thats-a-fact","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T00:20:48Z","webTitle":"A yes vote is vital for the mental health of LGBT Australians.

That's a fact","bodyText":"With the authorisation of an unnecessary postal vote on marriage equality, the public debate has predictably turned into a circus. So it should perhaps come as no surprise that the intellectual equivalent of custard pies are being thrown. False claims by the no campaign that marriage equality would somehow constitute an attack on freedom of speech and set in motion a chain of events culminating in young boys having to wear dresses in schools are as imaginative as they are inaccurate. The question would perhaps better be phrased as follows: does Australia wish to stop senselessly discriminating against a minority group, or not? Despite the prime minister declaring that he has more important things to focus on than this issue, a yes vote is vitally important for the sake of equal rights as well as the message of acceptance it would send to LGBT people in Australia. Australia, like every other country in the world, has a long tradition of discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, the mental health effects of which are striking. Gay men and women have higher rates of a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse problems and suicidal thoughts and behaviour. These rates apply to young LGBT people too – who are more than three times as likely to have attempted suicide than their heterosexual peers. These higher rates of psychological distress and mental illness have been well explained by “minority stress” theory. Initially described in relation to the gay community, it could reasonably be applied to any minority group facing discrimination. The theory proposes that LGBT individuals are a disadvantaged minority group and face three additional types of stress not experienced by the majority: the objective experience of homophobic abuse, both physical and verbal; “perceived stigma” or the expectation of discrimination, which leaves people in a state of high alert and slowly chips away at their psychological defences; and the internalisation of negative attitudes or “internalised homophobia”, referring to LGBT people absorbing the negative attitudes around them which tragically fosters a misguided self-perception of inferiority. Subsequent research has bolstered support for the minority stress theory, linking the three ingredients of this toxic cocktail to high levels of distress and suicidal thoughts and behaviour. So it is clear as day that stigma and prejudice are compromising the mental health of LGBT Australians. It is fair to then ask whether or not marriage equality is the antidote to this problem, since it would not necessarily eradicate stigma and prejudice against LGBT people. We can, in fact, confidently say it would have a positive effect on their mental health – an American study found a significant reduction in mental health care visits and costs for gay men in the year after legalisation of same-sex marriage when compared with the 12 months prior. This was true for single men as well as those in a relationship, suggesting it may be the principle of acceptance rather than the actual ability to marry that makes a difference. Conversely, another study found that US states banning same-sex marriage saw a rise in the number of various psychiatric conditions, with nearly 3.5 times the prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder. So the connection between marriage equality and better mental health in the LGBT community is also clear. As well as being an equal rights issue, this is a public health issue, as matters of equality often are. One of the primary functions of any nation is to protect and enhance the wellbeing of its citizens. Since the institution of marriage is seen by many as a recognition by the state of the love and commitment between two people, excluding LGBT individuals from such an important rite of passage is discriminatory and perhaps even abusive. The clear evidence of the mental health ill-effects of discrimination against LGBT people should firmly banish outdated policies to the past where they belong. Governments are not the only institution guilty of stigmatising LGBT people, of course – my own profession of psychiatry also has a shameful history of systematic discrimination against them, with homosexuality classed as a psychiatric disorder until as late as 1973. Psychiatry was criminally slow in realising the distress associated with being gay was caused by societal attitudes. Now that we have this understanding it would be criminal to disregard it and to continue exposing LGBT people to damaging prejudice when marriage equality provides a clear path to changing attitudes and improving LGBT mental health.

The survey, by the Charles Darwin University, examined six Indigenous communities across the NT: Galiwin’ku, Yirrkala, Gunbalanya, Maningrida, Tennant Creek and Yuendumu. It found more than 85% of a sample group of 660 people did not have the literacy skills to operate independently in a tertiary educational institution or in the workplace, and there was a lack of assistance for people who wanted to improve their skills. “What it clearly identifies is that there is a gap in the education spectrum for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the NT,” said Prof Adrian Miller, CDU’s pro vice-chancellor for Indigenous leadership. “While we may seem to have looked after the young, looked after the teenagers – built their English literacy – this report shows that (despite best efforts) they are not getting the English and numeracy they need in school. Therefore, we have this massive literacy problem when they become adults.” The six communities have been taking part in the Whole of Community engagement initiative, which project leader Allison Stewart described as a “participatory action research project, partnering with people from the community to see what enables and what holds back education participation”. “In each community we found the community participated in the project in different ways and had differing priorities,” she said. Fifty-four per cent of NT Indigenous people speak an Indigenous language at home, and the proportion increases with remoteness, to a maximum of more than 80%. Almost 60% of people living in very remote regions of the NT are Indigenous, according to the 2011 census, where there are also higher rates of disadvantage including in health and housing. The report found that during community consultations, “Aboriginal people reiterated the centrality of their own languages to their cultural practice, identity and connection to country, however many understood the importance of supporting their children to learn English and wanted to improve their own (whether in employment or not)”. The report cited government analysis of 2008 data that found people who spoke an Indigenous language had better health, wellbeing, education and employment outcomes, and called for responses to recognise the benefit of bilingual education. “We really need [help]. Yolngu people want nurturing, we want mentoring programs to be happen, we want adult education to happen,” Rosemary Gundjarranbuy from Elcho Island told the ABC. Stewart said: “A lot of people said it was really important for themselves and their children to be literate in their own language and that English comes on as an additional language. “Some research has shown that children who are competent in their own language are more competent in speaking and learning English because they’ve built that language capacity.” Stewart and representatives from some of the communities were in Canberra on Wednesday to visit government departments and share their findings and recommendations. “We’re trying to get government to understand the need for more assistance in this area and the need for a policy in the NT for adult education and/or language literacy and numeracy,” Stewart said. Despite being a signatory to the Council of Australian Governments policy to raise adult literacy levels, it had no explicit reference to adult literacy in its economic development and Indigenous affairs policies, and had no direct application of government funding to the sector. Stewart said there was a lack of coordinated responses at the federal level. “Closing the Gap – the primary policy in this area – has no key performance indicators around adult education or around language, literacy and numeracy,” she said. “That has a flow on effect, and there’s no adult education policy or language, literacy and numeracy policy for the NT.” This was not new information and many practitioners have been pointing out the problem for years, she said. “Some very successful models applied but there’s never been any coordinated action in this area, there’s never been a policy commitment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/15/murphy-was-his-main-man-the-alleged-links-between-the-judge-and-the-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T18:00:11Z","webTitle":"‘Murphy was his main man’: the alleged links between the judge and the crime boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/15/murphy-was-his-main-man-the-alleged-links-between-the-judge-and-the-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/15/murphy-was-his-main-man-the-alleged-links-between-the-judge-and-the-boss","fields":{"headline":"‘Murphy was his main man’: the alleged links between the judge and the crime boss","bodyText":"Just how close was the former high court judge Lionel Murphy to the notorious crime boss of Kings Cross Abe Saffron? That question preoccupied investigators on the 1986 commission of inquiry into whether Murphy’s conduct constituted misbehaviour in office. The extent of their concern is revealed in documents released on Thursday, 31 years after the commission was terminated without making findings. The commission had before it two allegations that Murphy had lobbied New South Wales Labor politicians on behalf of companies associated with Saffron in order to win them lucrative contracts. One was for the refurbishment of Central railway station. The other was for the lease on Luna Park. The allegations were based on illegally taped conversations between Murphy and his friend, Sydney solicitor Morgan Ryan, which had formed part of the Age Tapes reports in 1984 and later led to the Stewart royal commission. But was Murphy doing it because of his friendship with Ryan, who was known to be close to Saffron? Or was there a more direct relationship? In July 1986, investigator Andrew Phelan met with Superintendent Drew at the 20th floor of NSW police headquarters to find out. According to his file note, Drew reassured him that “apart from what [crime figure] James McCartney Anderson had told Sergeant Warren Molloy, no link between Saffron and his honour had come to light”. What that particular link was is not disclosed. But Molloy, then special licensing seargent in the Kings Cross region, had extensive knowledge of Saffron’s operations. Molloy was overseas and did not return until a day after the inquiry was wound up, so Phelan never got to interview him. However, Phelan also noted that “we were told that the vice squad had been conducting a lengthy investigation into allegations that Filipino girls were imported under some racket involving [solicitor] Morgan Ryan to work as prostitutes at the Venus Room”. “It was suggested that Ernie ‘the good’ Shepherd, head of the vice squad may be able to tell us something about suggestions that Saffron procured females for his honour.” The police also confided that that they were investigating several allegations that had come out of the Stewart royal commission, “including the alleged involvement of his honour, Ryan, Saffron, the Yuens and police in the Dixon Street casinos matter”. The file on the commission of inquiry’s investigation into the Luna Park lease reveals that the main evidence they were relying on was from Mr Egge of the NSW police who had given evidence to the Stewart royal commission based on the phone taps he had listened to as part of illegal phone tapping that the NSW police had undertaken. They became known as the Age Tapes. Ryan had been one of their targets and conversations with Murphy had been picked up. In the early months of 1980, Murphy was alleged to have told his friend that he had intervened with the NSW premier Neville Wran on behalf of the Saffron-linked company to secure him the Luna Park lease. The government announced in early 1980 that all six tenders were rejected and eventually called fresh tenders. The winner was Harbourside Amusements. In its early incarnation it was controlled by a solicitor, David Baffsky, who was known to act for Abe Saffron, according to the commission files. But later it had Sir Arthur George and Michael Edgley as its public face and Saffron’s nephew as its secretary. The commission also sought help from the National Crime Commission and the Stewart royal commission into organised crime. They were sent the transcript of an interview with James West, part owner of Raffles nightclub who claimed that he had met Murphy at Saffron’s place, and that “Murphy was his main man, you probably know that”. At the time it was wound up, the commission records show it was planning to call Saffron, Ryan, Inspector Molloy and numerous denizens of Sydney’s crime world to give evidence. Murphy died a few months later. The truth or otherwise of his involvement with Saffron remains unproved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/sep/13/kings-review-halle-berry-toronto-film-festival-tiff","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T02:32:33Z","webTitle":"Kings review – Halle Berry and Daniel Craig fail to ignite baffling LA riots drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/13/kings-review-halle-berry-toronto-film-festival-tiff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/sep/13/kings-review-halle-berry-toronto-film-festival-tiff","fields":{"headline":"Kings review – Halle Berry and Daniel Craig fail to ignite baffling LA riots drama","bodyText":"Deniz Gamze Ergüven is the Turkish film-maker hugely admired for her 2015 debut feature Mustang, about five orphaned sisters growing up in a patriarchal society. Hopes were very high for this English-language followup here at Toronto, but the result is a baffling and frustrating disappointment. There are sparks of interest and some powerful moments, but it is structurally disjointed, tonally uncertain, unfocused and unfinished, with some very broad drama-improv-class acting from the kids and a frankly unrelaxed and undirected performance from Halle Berry. The setting is Los Angeles, during the Rodney King riots, and the cops’ trials are forever on TV in the background. The title appears to merge Rodney’s surname with that of Martin Luther King Jr, and perhaps alludes to the heroic nobility of those hardworking people having to live their lives while dealing with racism. Halle Berry plays Millie, a woman in South Central who bakes and sells cakes while running in her apartment a refuge for runaways and disadvantaged kids. They range in age from around 6 or 7 to 15: the little kids are running around innocently enough, but the older teens are dealing with growing sexual feelings and the boys need some privacy in which to jerk off — another oddly misjudged comedy scene, adding to the weird cutesiness and playfulness which undermines the desperate seriousness of what is about to happen. Millie is on her own, but she’s strangely attracted to the highly improbable hunk who lives next door, Obie, played with a Brit accent by Daniel Craig. (She has a fervent erotic dream about him, amusingly presented, and arguably no more random than anything else in this film.) Yet in the opening scene, Obie actually fires a pump-action shotgun out of his window, infuriated by the criminal disorder right by his house, so terrifyingly that Millie and the kids hide under their kitchen table. It sets his character up very strangely: we never see that gun, or really that temper, again. When the riots begin, Millie is beside herself with worry, and in fact seems to be beside herself with worry most of the time, understandably enough. In the violent chaos she is arrested, but then finally thrown out of the squad car — in cuffs — when the cops realise they have something more important to deal with. Obie happens entirely fortuitously to be driving past as she staggers, shackled, down the street, and it is the chance for him to give some gallant help. But later she and Obie have to drive out to stop their kids from looting some store, and she gets cuffed by a cop all over again, shackled with hunky Obie to a lamppost. But Obie somehow manages to break free by ripping off Millie’s jeans, tearing them into strips to make up a rope — because denim is so easy to rip with your hands — and using it to climb up the lamppost and get himself free and then come back with his tools to rescue her (again). This weird larky scene is the single silliest and most improbable part in the film. Meanwhile, Millie’s teen kids are involved in a tragic stabbing that has to do with sexual anxiety and sexual jealousy. It’s a strange narrative counter-current, left hanging at the end of this relatively short feature, which fails to absorb its emotional implications or how this microcosm of violence and dismay fits into the sketchily imagined bigger picture. There are some powerful moments in Kings, certainly. The convenience store shooting of Latasha Harlins — just days after the King beating, and without any prison sentence for its perpetrator — is shockingly portrayed, and Ergüven shows the flashes of random hysteria and chaos that a riot creates. But it’s a misstep for this talented director. Kings is screening at the Toronto film festival and a release date is yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/sep/14/we-need-more-analysis-and-less-emotion-in-the-marriage-equality-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T06:31:54Z","webTitle":"We need more analysis and less emotion in the marriage equality debate | Bede Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/14/we-need-more-analysis-and-less-emotion-in-the-marriage-equality-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/14/we-need-more-analysis-and-less-emotion-in-the-marriage-equality-debate","fields":{"headline":"We need more analysis and less emotion in the marriage equality debate","bodyText":"The debate on marriage equality has been strong on emotion but short on principled analysis. What foundations should guide us in determining this question? First and foremost is the principle of individual autonomy in relation to personal choices, which is a value that lies – or ought to lie – at the foundation of a free society. This principle was famously applied more than 50 years ago in the United States in the decision of Griswold v Connecticut. In that case, the supreme court struck down the law prohibiting the sale of contraceptives. The court said that people have a right to privacy, in the sense of a “zone of autonomy”, regarding intimate life choices. The court held that the more intimate the area, the less justification there was for the state to interfere. Clearly the choice of marriage partner is among the most intimate one can make, and in 2015 the court applied the same principle to invalidate laws restricting marriage to heterosexual couples. Apart from intruding on autonomy, the prohibition on same-sex marriage discriminates on grounds of sexual orientation. At its base, marriage is simply a contract licensed by the state. Discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in relation to whom one may marry is therefore as offensive as would be discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in relation to registering a transfer of land. Or, to put it differently, what principled difference is there between restricting whom one may marry on grounds of sexual orientation and restricting choice of marriage partners on racial grounds, as under apartheid in South Africa? What of the arguments raised by opponents of marriage equality that its legalisation would cause harms or infringe other rights? We can dismiss the bizarre argument that by recognising same-sex marriage the institution of heterosexual marriage would be harmed. A rational basis for this argument has never been presented, and it is difficult to see how it could be – unless its proponents believe that the opportunity to contract a same-sex marriage would somehow entice people away from heterosexual unions, a line of reasoning which would be valid only if one believed that sexual orientation was chosen rather than innate. The second circumstance which needs to be considered is the argument that respect for freedom of religion requires that business people be entitled to decline involvement in same-sex unions. Liberal (now Conservative) senator Cory Bernardi said that all businesses should be able to discriminate “for any or no reason” (including against same-sex couples), while Liberal National MP, George Christensen, said that venue owners, bakers and photographers should have the right to refuse custom to same-sex couples. Does this argument have any validity? First, the freedom of religion argument cuts both ways: Among the clauses in the freedom of religion provisions contained in s 116 of the constitution is one prohibiting the establishment of any religion. Compliance with this requires that the state be secular in its approach to public policy. Restricting marriage to different-sex couples reflects a particular religious perspective, and thus imposes a religious view on others, contrary to s 116. It is therefore the prohibition of same-sex marriage, not its legalisation, which constitutes a denial of religious freedom. Leaving aside religious celebrants, who would not be compelled to marry same-sex couples under any of the bills presented to parliament – what of the argument that religious freedom requires that people be able to refuse services to same-sex couples? A case of this type recently arose in the United States: The owner of a wedding cake shop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple. The Colorado court found that the shop owner had breached state law which prohibits discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in places of “public accommodation” – broadly defined as any place where a business offers goods or services to the public. The case has now been appealed to the US supreme court, where it is likely to fail. This is because, in a line of cases from the civil rights era, courts in the US have pointed the affront to dignity that is caused by discrimination and have upheld laws making it unlawful for businesses to discriminate on prohibited grounds such as race, gender, disability and sexual orientation. The mere fact that these cases involved contractual relationships did not immunise them from the reach of anti-discrimination law. In other words, although mutual agreement lies at the heart of contracts, which can therefore be said to be “private” in nature, once a business offers goods or services to the public, it steps into the public arena and breaches equality rights if it discriminates on a prohibited ground. For this reason, the argument that the religious beliefs of a person engaging in public commerce entitle them to discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation has no more validity than did the argument, also rejected by the supreme court, that the right to hold segregationist political beliefs entitled business owners to refuse custom to African Americans in restaurants or bus stations. In any event, the entire religious freedom argument suffers from a fatal flaw: Unlike in the case of a religious celebrant performing a sacrament, the sale of a cake is not a religious act. That is why non-religious marriage celebrants, cake-makers, photographers and limousine drivers ought not to be allowed to discriminate in the provision of what are simply commercial services. Unless a business were to offer its services only to members of a particular religion, there is no consideration of conscience which logically justifies discrimination against people on the ground of their sexual orientation. In Australia, anti-discrimination law prohibits discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation as well as on grounds of marital and relationship status. It also prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities and so would prohibit businesses from engaging in discrimination against same-sex couples. This is as it should be – and this is what opponents of marriage equality are trying to reverse.

The extent of online and real-world threats against public figures has been revealed after police investigated 102 crimes against MPs in the past year. A Scotland Yard unit set up after the murder of Jo Cox says it has so far dealt with 71 complaints of “malicious communication” including abusive messages or letters, five reports of harassment, four of racially aggravated harassment, 15 thefts and seven allegations of criminal damage. The Labour MP Rachael Maskell said it amounted to one in six MPs being affected. Maskell, who got death threats from the far right after Cox’s murder, said: “It does show the vulnerability of people in public life who stand up to represent their communities.” Theresa May has ordered an investigation into intimidation of parliamentary candidates leading up to the last election. The Labour shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, received a barrage of vile tweets during the campaign, and the PM said she was “horrified” by stories from colleagues about “intimidation, bullying and harassment”. A number of MPs have called for an end to anonymity online. The BBC chairman, meanwhile, has called for zero tolerance of abuse against journalists, especially female journalists. David Clementi said it was unacceptable for politicians to “stand by and watch” heckling of reporters at press conferences and said the corporation’s women in particular were being targeted by abusers on and offline. He gave no names, but the BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has been bombarded with sexist abuse online, hissed at and booed at Labour and Ukip press conferences, and labelled by the conservative-leaning Daily Telegraph as possibly the “most divisive woman on TV today”. * * * Cap doesn’t fit for DUP – Theresa May’s all-but-coalition partners have voted against the Tories in a symbolic victory for Labour. The Democratic Unionists supported Labour motions in favour of lifting the cap on NHS pay and opposing a rise in tuition fees. The Commons vote is not binding, but it is embarrassing for May and a sign that her party’s austerity policies may be on life support. In other life-and-death metaphors, George Osborne provided an insight into the gruesome workings of his mind when he reportedly told colleagues at the Evening Standard that he wants May “chopped up in bags in my freezer”. The prime minister’s spokesman responded coolly: “The contents of the former chancellor’s freezer are not a matter for me.” What May might say when she speaks in Florence next week is the subject of much speculation – the PM is to make an address on Brexit that will be watched closely for signs of her rhetoric softening after a tough start to talks with the EU27. * * * Flying high – Donald Trump’s treasury secretary wanted a military jet to fly him around Europe with his bride for their honeymoon. It would have cost $25,000 an hour. The premise was that being a cabinet member, Steve Mnuchin needed the jet’s secure communication facilities, even though he has no direct national security role. Mnuchin dropped the request after being told there are other ways to keep in touch. The case is being audited – along with why Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, needed to take a government plane to Fort Knox, Kentucky, for meetings that happened to coincide with a viewing of the solar eclipse. * * * Frank Vincent dies – The “man’s man” who played Phil Leotardo on The Sopranos has died after complications from open-heart surgery. Frank Vincent, who was 78, had also acted the tough guy in Martin Scorsese’s films Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Casino. “You have got to have a good sense of humour, you have got to be tough and you have got to know how to dress,” Vincent said in 2006 when he co-wrote A Guy’s Guide to Being a Man’s Man. The surgery on Wednesday in New Jersey followed a heart attack last week, according to reports. * * * Zeroing in – The history of the number “0” has been traced back to ancient Indian texts. Feeling blank about that? Here is maths professor Marcus du Sautoy from Oxford to get you enthused: “Today we take it for granted that the concept of zero is used across the globe and our whole digital world is based on nothing or something. But there was a moment when there wasn’t this number.” The concept of zero revolutionised mathematics, and while other cultures such as the Mayans and Babylonians had their own versions, the Sanskrit dots on this Bakhshali manuscript – dating from the 3rd or 4th century, and possibly part of a maths primer for Silk Road merchants – are the earliest known renderings of the symbol we use today. Lunchtime read: No peace in our time It is actually the law that you can only attack another country with UN approval, or in legitimate self-defence. But you wouldn’t know it from Israel bombing Syria this month, Donald Trump doing the same in April, Russia seizing Crimea in 2014 – or, going back further, the Iraq invasion of 2003 and Nato’s Kosovo intervention of 1999. Such interventions have become far from uncommon, despite violating the United Nations charter. Today, two international law experts ask how the norms of war have moved so far away from the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, signed by all the world’s nations and intended to bring an end to international armed conflict. Sport The independent inquiry into football’s sexual-abuse scandal has heard claims that Graham Taylor, the former England manager, was involved in a cover-up at Aston Villa. On the day the IOC had hoped all eyes would be on Lima and the awarding of the Paris 2024 and Los Angeles 2028 Games, it risked further embarrassment as fresh claims emerged surrounding the alleged buying of votes by bid teams for Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. In the Champions League, Roberto Firmino’s penalty miss proved costly for Liverpool, a John Stones double helped Manchester City to victory, Harry Kane, fortune and fortitude saw Tottenham beat Dortmund and Spartak Moscow fans launched a flare that travelled half the length of the Maribor pitch and was apparently aimed at the referee. And Canada’s chess federation is preparing to lodge a formal complaint with the sport’s world governing body after the country’s top prospect was berated for wearing shorts and called a “gypsy” by an official at a recent World Cup. Business The Bank of England is expected to leave interest rates unchanged today despite mounting fears over a renewed surge in inflation. Economists predict the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will vote 7-2 to hold rates at 0.25%. After Wall Street edged up to a record high on Wednesday, Asian markets have been steady, appearing to take poorer than expected Chinese data in their stride. China’s factory output grew 6% in August from a year earlier, while fixed-asset investment expanded 7.8%, and retail sales for August were lower than forecast. The pound has been buying $1.32 and €1.11 overnight. The papers The Guardian leads with claims that Graham Taylor was involved in covering up sexual abuse. Elsewhere, front pages are dominated by the news that a woman allegedly tried to gain access to Prince George’s new school. The Sun, Mirror, Metro and Daily Mail all splash on this, with the Mail also fuming at the “farce” that means relief efforts for the “too wealthy” British overseas territories thrashed by Hurricane Irma cannot come from the UK aid budget. The Telegraph and, more vehemently, the Daily Express lead on Jean-Claude Juncker’s words on the EU’s life after Brexit. The Scotsman reports on a school staffing crisis, while the Times focuses on claims by MPs that Amazon is facilitating tax fraud by foreign companies selling through its website. And the Financial Times says the Bank of England is grappling – before today’s decision on a potential interest rate rise – with unemployment at a 42-year low, but wages failing to bounce.

Last Friday morning, however, Qiao and his family set off for Beijing’s international airport to catch a Boeing 777 bound for the United States. “I’m leaving my country and I’ll miss it. Farewell,” Qiao, 47, announced on the social messaging service WeChat as he waited to board Air China Flight CA817 to Washington DC. He did not say when, or indeed if, he might return. In the nearly five years since Xi Jinping became China’s top leader, Qiao, a journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University and human rights advocate, had emerged as an increasingly isolated voice of dissent in a country where political opposition appears to grow more perilous by the day. China-based foreign correspondents and diplomats complain that under Xi – who is about to complete his first term in power – local scholars have increasingly shied away from discussing politically sensitive topics or, in some cases, meeting with foreigners at all. “The general climate for reporting in China deteriorated over the last year,” described a report released by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China in November 2016. “Many denounced pressure exerted on organisations and academia, and cited growing difficulties in securing interviews with sources and experts.” But Qiao appeared to shrug off the pressure, granting regular interviews to media outlets from across the globe including the Guardian, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Globe and Mail, Al Jazeera English and the Associated Press. He tackled thorny issues such as media censorship, ethnic rioting, elite politics and the Mao-style personality cult that some accuse President Xi of trying to cultivate. “I’m a typical Chinese person. I love my country and I want to change it,” Qiao told AFP earlier this year. Qiao declined to go into details about his decision to swap northern China for the east coast of the US. “I’m busy making a living,” he said in a brief WeChat message this week. But friends said he had decided to leave after seeing his academic career wrecked by his refusal to fall into line. Since 2014 Qiao had been banished from the classroom, apparently in punishment for his public support for ideas such as multi-party democracy and freedom of speech. In April this year Qiao resigned citing his frustrations at the political restrictions as a motivating factor. “A journalism professor [who] has to be against a free media. Even Tchaikovsky couldn’t play a symphony with enough sorrow for my situation,” he complained in an online letter. Shi Jiepeng, a fellow academic who also recently fell victim to the crackdown on liberal thinkers, said life had been made impossible for his friend. “People like him cannot find any jobs within the system,” said Shi, who was sacked from his job at Beijing Normal University in July as a result of his politically charged online posts. “There was still space outside the system but without the backing of an institution a scholar faces all sorts of inconveniences,” Shi added. He suggested financial difficulties had played a role in Qiao’s exit, since he would have lost the benefits that came with a university job, such as his daughter’s education. “Going to [America] is the least bad choice for him. But it’s not the best choice and he has no alternative but to choose,” said Shi. During his 2015 interview Qiao said he was well aware of the risks involved in speaking out in Xi’s ever more illiberal China. Just days before security forces had launched a notorious round-up of human rights lawyers and activists – later dubbed China’s “war on law” – spiriting some of the country’s best-known attorneys into secret detention. “Before Xi Jinping we feared only that they would delete our [online] posts. In the worst situation they would delete [your account],” Qiao said. “But since Xi Jinping came to power this changed. They began to arrest people.” Qiao avoided that fate. But with his departure last week he joined a growing list of liberal Chinese academics who are abandoning their homeland and seeking sanctuary overseas. “The situation in the last year has become not better but worse for intellectual life in China … It’s a sad time to be an intellectual,” said Jerome Cohen, a New York-based China expert who has been helping some of the refugee scholars arriving in the US. “It is not simple to get a permanent job abroad as good as the one you have had in China,” Cohen admitted. “But with the incentive of not being free to write and speak as they normally would, people scramble for whatever chance they can get. “People are trying to cope,” he added. “But they realise that they have at least five [more years of Xi Jinping] to deal with.” News of Qiao’s unexpected retreat was celebrated by friends and supporters on Twitter, which Qiao will now be able to use without having to use a virtual private network (VPN) to leap over China’s draconian internet controls. “Welcome to the free world,” wrote Zhou Fengsuo, a California-based exile who was forced from China after taking part in the 1989 Tiananmen protests. “Breathe free air,” suggested another. Two years ago Qiao said he dreamed of one day being elected to office in a democratic China and vowed to remain so he was ready to serve his country when that day came: “I have studied the transition of eastern European countries – usually it is professors, writers, lawyers and journalists who become politicians,” he said. “I want to be a congressman – to criticise, to supervise the corrupt government.” Did Qiao still harbour that dream, despite his decision to leave? “It seems he still does,” said his friend, Shi.

McGorry is the latest prominent Australian to voice his concern about the measure, which will see 5,000 welfare recipients drug tested at three trial locations. He has warned the policy fails to understand the intersection between mental illness and drug and alcohol addiction. The consequence will be to drive vulnerable Australians with a mental health issue away from the welfare system, and most likely into homelessness. “It’s an absolute disgrace,” McGorry told Guardian Australia. “It fails to recognise that mental illness and drug and alcohol problems nearly always coexist, they’re a health problem and not a lifestyle choice,” he said. “It shouldn’t be a justification for basically withdrawing welfare support because the consequences could be things like homelessness and major hardship.” McGorry’s criticisms come after the former Australian federal police commissioner Mick Palmer delivered a scathing assessment of the plan on Wednesday. Palmer, who was responsible for implementing tough Howard-era drugs policies, told the ABC the plan would simply not work, would harm those least able to change, and risked pushing people into crime to support their addiction. The legislation containing the drug-testing measure was due to be debated this week in the Senate, but has been pushed back until the next sitting period in mid-October. That gives more time for negotiations between the government and the Nick Xenophon Team, whose votes could be crucial in securing the bill’s passage. Some members of the Xenophon team have already expressed disquiet about the bill. The sole NXT lower house MP, Rebekha Sharkie, voted against it in the lower house, after last week describing the drug-testing measure as “devoid of logic”. The government has previously dismissed criticism from the medical community. It says the measure is a trial, which will be assessed for its effectiveness once it is up and running. The human services minister, Alan Tudge, said the aim was to create behavioural change by encouraging welfare recipients into treatment. That would not only reduce drug and alcohol use, he said, but improve employment prospects. “The overall objective of this ... and this is important, the overall objective is to identify those people who may have a drug habit, to assist them to get treatment and to hopefully get them off drugs and back into the workforce,” Tudge said last week. The social services minister, Christian Porter, has likened opposition to welfare drug testing to the medical community’s concerns over the “no jab, no pay” policy to boost child immunisation rates. Porter said that policy had proven to be a resounding success, and announced a strengthening of the scheme on Thursday. Labor remains hopeful it can stop the drug-testing measures in the Senate. The shadow human services minister, Linda Burney, said it was “almost inconceivable” that the government is pursuing the measure in the wake of a broad consensus of condemnation among experts. “We are hoping very much that we can stop this in the Senate. I understand that the Xenophon team are looking at this very clearly,” Burney said on Wednesday. “But when you have every medical expert and when you have law enforcement expertise saying that this is a bad idea, with no new investment, in drug rehabilitation, it is just a nonsense that the government is pursuing this,” she said. The 5,000 welfare recipients will be tested in Logan in Queensland, Canterbury-Bankstown in south-western Sydney, and Mandurah in Western Australia. A first failed test will lead to income management, and a second would see a welfare recipient referred to treatment. If the recipient fails to engage in treatment, they are liable for punishments, including the loss of income support. Any welfare recipient who fails twice will be required to cover the costs of their tests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/14/rule-makers-must-widen-rugby-union-appeal-to-young","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"Rule-makers must lessen fears for game and widen appeal to young | The Breakdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/14/rule-makers-must-widen-rugby-union-appeal-to-young","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/14/rule-makers-must-widen-rugby-union-appeal-to-young","fields":{"headline":"Rule-makers must lessen fears for game and widen appeal to young","bodyText":"The second round of the Premiership may have spawned considerably fewer tries and bonus points than the first, 25 and one compared to 40 and seven, but it is clear that the game is moving away from the overtly and suffocatingly physical. Even a team as renowned for its parsimony as Saracens has conceded three tries in each of its opening two matches. Defence has become a means to an end, rather than the end itself. The new scrum tweak may be frustrating because it effectively legitimises a feed that is not straight, but it is part of the trend, initiated in part because of awareness of the dangers of concussion, to dilute physical confrontation by making changes that speed up the game and spread play. Eddie Jones’s England are far advanced in the new way, better equipped than anyone else to have a tilt at New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup with their principle of playing at ever increasing pace. Player safety leads every change and amendment to the laws. Those running the game not only have a duty of care to those playing it, whether professional or amateur, but are also its custodians. The less appeal it has in an era of multiple choice, the harder it is to stimulate the young to take up rugby. The prospect of serious injury is a deterrent, as clubs are finding. Llanybydder in west Wales runs one side and regularly struggles to get a match-day 22, joking that at times they need a stool rather than a bench. A local wedding can be all it takes for them to have to call off a match. “I do fear for the game in Wales,” said the Llanybydder chairman, Mike Wilson. “I accept every club is different, but when I talk to people from elsewhere they tell me they share a lot of our problems. Some clubs are hanging by a thread. It isn’t the Welsh Rugby Union’s fault; it is the way society has gone.” Clubs in south Wales used to have a monopoly on participation in sport: every village seemed to have a pub, a post office, chapel, a set of rugby posts and occupants who worked in heavy industry. “There seems to be something going on all the time and rugby has been shoved down the pecking order,” said Wilson. Another committee member, Terry Breverton, believes the risk of injury is another factor behind reduced playing numbers. “It’s gone ugly at the top level, just big blokes bashing into each other,” he said. “I’d like to see a weight limit brought in for each side and more emphasis put on skill. A lot of the time at our level, people don’t want to play because of the risk of injuries, especially in our neck of the woods where there are a lot of farmers and other self-employed folk who can’t afford to have weeks off through injuries.” Injuries remain an occupational hazard: three Bath players failed head injury assessments during Saturday’s victory over Saracens at the Recreation Ground and Anthony Watson left the field with an injured shoulder (which proved to be a stinger as he has been passed fit for selection against Northampton this week) while at the Stoop, the Harlequins outside-half Demetri Catrakilis broke a bone in his throat and was unable to breathe for a few seconds after trying to tackle the Gloucester centre Andy Symons. The following day at Worcester, the home prop Nick Schonert suffered a broken ankle in the opening phase of play. The Lions captain Sam Warburton will not play again this year after aggravating a neck injury in training. As the game speeds up, it becomes a handicap for players to carry so much bulk; weight is coming off, not to the point where big hits and clear-outs go the way of the four-point try (and drop goal) but the sterility of a few years ago when there was little more to some matches than crash, bang, wallop and an aerial assault has been replaced by a greater sense of adventure – even if it has been cajoled by the rule makers and referees. The effect of the tinkering with the rules has been to make the sport less a contest for possession in its traditional areas, set-pieces and breakdown, without making it as overt as rugby league, and more a challenge to teams to do something with the ball. Purists baulk at scrum-halves no longer having to put the ball down the middle of a scrum, nor waiting for the referee’s command to put in the ball, but the aim is to ensure that the set-piece becomes a means of restarting play rather than a way of earning a penalty and producing another stoppage. Teams now have to work out ways of slowing down what is prime attacking possession. The lineout is more of a contest, much to Sale’s chagrin against Newcastle last Friday night, but very few throws are straight, while at the breakdown players have to make a judgment about when to jockey for possession. The intent is to make those who go to ground get back on their feet immediately and not slow the ball down. Defence coaches became used to having it their own way, but no longer. The scores in the opening round of the Premiership resembled those in Super Rugby, a tournament which used to be regarded with contempt by some in Europe for making tackling an optional extra. Now it can be seen for what it was, the desire to win rather than not lose. The wet weather partly dampened ardour last weekend, but as New Zealand have long shown, rain does not wash away skill. It comes down to attitude. • This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

The company, founded by two former Google employees and launched on Wednesday, is marketing five-foot-wide pantries that users can unlock with their smartphones to pick up non-perishable items. There are no humans at the “stores” – which are already stationed in spots like apartment buildings, offices and gyms – and a computer program automatically charges customers’ credit cards, according to Fast Company, which first reported on the startup. Although the boxes appear to be little more than glorified vending machines, the company’s executives have been widely mocked, and criticized for explicitly stating that their mission is to displace neighborhood corner stores and put family-owned shops out of business. “The vision here is much bigger than the box itself,” co-founder Paul McDonald, a former Google product manager, told Fast Company. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 ft away from you.” McDonald backtracked on Wednesday, claiming in a blogpost that he is not trying to put bodegas out of business despite his earlier statements to the contrary: “Challenging the urban corner store is not and has never been our goal.” The goal of disrupting a long-running industry and eliminating human interaction from the process of shopping at a convenience store is embedded in the roundly ridiculed Bodega name, which appropriates a commonly used term in the US for corner stores typically run by immigrants. “It’s sacrilegious to use that name, and we’re going to do whatever we need to do to fight this,” Frank Garcia, chair of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, told the Guardian. “It was devastating to find out … and it’s not fair to the local bodegas now that don’t have the angel investors that these guys have.” McDonald and co-founder Ashwath Rajan have secured funding from high-profile players in the tech industry, including investors from First Round Capital, Forerunner Ventures and Homebrew and senior executives at Facebook, Google, Twitter and Dropbox, Fast Company reported. Garcia said his grandfather was the head of the Latin Grocery Association in the 1960s and helped coin the term “bodega”, a name widely used for stores in New York City today. “It’s his legacy and the legacy of these immigrants who came here with nothing to start a little grocery store, and came up with a concept to really help the community against racism,” he said, noting that existing grocers often would refuse to serve Puerto Ricans. “Don’t use our community to make a fast buck.” McDonald claimed that the company conducted surveys in the “Latin American community to understand if they felt the name was a misappropriation of that term or had negative connotations” and alleged that 97% said no. Bodega did not respond to an interview request and did not answer questions about the nature of the survey and how much funding the startup has raised. In his blogpost, McDonald praised existing bodegas as “fixtures of their neighborhoods for generations” that “stock thousands of items, far more than we could ever fit on a few shelves”. He also said he was surprised by the social media outrage about the name, offering an apology “to anyone we’ve offended”. “Rather than disrespect to traditional corner stores – or worse yet, a threat – we intended only admiration.” He did not respond to a question about whether he was reconsidering the name. Critics have also condemned Bodega as the latest example of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs attracting large sums of money to provide a service for which there is little demand, aimed at catering to a wealthy population. Juicero, a startup that raised $120m to sell $400 juicer machines that were revealed to be the equivalent of two hands squeezing a juice box, recently shut down. McDonald told Fast Company he was unveiling 50 new locations on the west coast and plans to spread across the country, with more than a thousand “Bodegas” in place by the end of 2018. The boxes are supposed to use machine learning to assess which items are most in demand and adjust the supply accordingly, but some critics are already questioning whether the business model will be sustainable. Even if Bodega rapidly grows, many shoppers won’t want to abandon their local stores, said Trisha Chakrabarti, senior program and policy manager at Mandela MarketPlace, a nonprofit that supports local grocery stores and is based in Oakland, California, where Bodega is headquartered. “It’s about having neighbors in your community who know you, who have lived there and been in business for a long time, who have seen changes in the neighborhood and are responsive to customers needs,” she said. “That kind of personalization of service, you will never be able to find with an automated service.” Bodega is launching at a time when local bodegas are barely scraping by, said Chakrabarti. “These are marginalized business owners to begin with in places like Oakland, New York and San Francisco. Their businesses are threatened by ever increasing rents.” She said she was particularly shocked to see the startup founders openly boasting about striving to wipe out this industry: “I hope that they fail.” In New York, where there are a large number of Yemeni-owned corner stores, some are known for using “honor systems” in which they let regular customers pay at a later date if they are low on cash and have immediate needs, said Debbie Almontaser, board president of the Muslim Community Network. “They work with communities when they don’t have money, people living paycheck to paycheck that need milk and diapers,” she said. “All of their customers are just so grateful that they have this kind of trust in them ... I can’t imagine they would want to see these manufactured little kiosks in their communities.” Garcia said his organization would explore any legal options it may have to challenge Bodega’s name, adding that he hoped lawmakers would regulate this kind of business and not let the startup bypass government rules existing stores have to follow. He noted that even when 7-Eleven, the chain of convenience stores, has moved into neighborhoods with small businesses, executives have met with community leaders and representatives of bodegas. “At least they respected the community,” he said. “These guys have not.” At one residential skyscraper in San Francisco where a Bodega box is, tenant Nripesh Koirala said he would consider shopping from one since it’s convenient, but that he didn’t think the startup would threaten retail shops. “It’s just their arrogance if they’re saying they are going to replace stores,” said Koirala, a 23-year-old student. “At a corner store, there are a lot of things you can choose from and you can ask them questions ... You can’t talk to a vending machine.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cudjoe-key-florida","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T18:38:39Z","webTitle":"Cudjoe Key: the Florida community that was Hurricane Irma's ground zero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cudjoe-key-florida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cudjoe-key-florida","fields":{"headline":"Cudjoe Key: the Florida community that was Hurricane Irma's ground zero","bodyText":"It’s not hard to grasp that Cudjoe Key, a small community of about 1,700 people among the islands of the Florida Keys, was the ground zero of Hurricane Irma. Speedboats have been lifted like feathers from the sea and deposited on the roadside, camper vans overturned, gas stations flattened. It was here that Irma first made landfall in Florida on Sunday morning as a mammoth category four hurricane, an event that will forever be etched into the history of Cudjoe. The eye of the storm passed directly over its 700 or so houses, bringing a brief respite amid a serene and surreal calm, before bulldozing them again with winds of up to 130mph. Which is why Tony Pothul, 44, emerging from a house right by the southern edge of the key where Irma landed, cut such a strange figure. Surrounded by the debris of the storm all around, Pothul had barely a hair on his head out of place. Originally from Glasgow in Scotland, he came to live in Cudjoe Key about a year ago and sat out the storm taking care of the house, close to the water, on behalf of the homeowner from Montana. It’s no surprise that Pothul fared well through a historically powerful hurricane: the house is built like maximum security prison, its concrete living spaces raised on stilts about 30ft above the water line. Even then, Pothul says, you could feel the house shaking as Irma passed by, her immense energy able to rattle even the sturdiest property. Perhaps most surprising, Pothul’s two cars, both soft-tops, were utterly untouched. “Smart, huh?” he said. “I parked them on high ground out of the wind.” Others in Cudjoe Key have not fared so well. When Pothul was visiting a friend nearby in the neighborhood he heard a moaning cry, and approaching a house found that a man was crying for help inside. The man, who uses a wheelchair, had been flipped on his side during the hurricane and had spent 26 hours on the floor. His wife has Alzheimer’s and was unable to come to his assistance; Pothul found her standing on the porch of the house looking out. It is the plight of families such as this that emergency authorities are so worried about, labeling the Florida Keys a sight of an unfolding “humanitarian crisis”. When the Guardian visited Cudjoe Key on Wednesday, federal search and rescue teams were scouring residential areas looking for anyone in trouble. But the signs are that aid is arriving fast. The main highway through the keys, US 1, has now been opened all the way from Key Largo through to Key West, relieving the latter community, which had been entirely cut off, with diminishing resources of water and food. Evacuees are beginning to return to an uncertain immediate future, amid reports that a quarter of homes in the Keys have been destroyed. Where lanes have collapsed into the sea, they are now largely patched back together. Several military helicopters, including large supply vehicles, have arrived at the tiny airstrip in Marathon, another heavily damaged part of the keys. Florida state police are retaining a tight grip on the lower Keys, however, to allow search and rescue and emergency workers time to do their work without distraction. As you enter the lower Keys, a road sign says: “Curfew dusk to dawn. Zero tolerance.” Residents of these stricken communities continue to be held back at road blocks in the upper Keys, and the frustration and tension is starting to tell. At the main roadblock at the entrance to the lower keys, one desperate resident made a dash through the barrier in his car, setting off a police chase with two state trooper vehicles in hot pursuit. Other residents camped out in their cars beside the road, preparing for a very long wait before they would be allowed home. Betina Charles, 37, originally from Haiti, was trying to get back to Key West, where she cooks Haitian food in a deli called Win Dixie for $10 an hour. She’d spent the past week in a hotel on the mainland, heeding the evacuation order, but has now run out of money and has no idea how she will secure accommodation or food if she isn’t allowed to return home soon. “I need to get back so I can start working again. No work, no money, no food or nowhere to live, so what am I supposed to do?” she said. Back at ground zero in Cudjoe Key, Shane Harmon, 47, who works in the tourist business, fared relatively well. With his wife Tami, he sat out the storm in his house close to the water. The property is also on stilts, and was not badly damaged.

That leaves them stranded with two rusty bicycles, one of which has a wobbly back wheel, and only eight gallons of water remaining. “We listen to the radio, so we know there is a water distribution spot where we could go down the road,” he said. “The only thing is, it’s five miles away.

The Conservative election manifesto and the Schools That Work for Everyone consultation document said independent schools would be required to sponsor an academy or set up a free school to share their expertise. If not enough progress was made, then ministers would “keep open the option” of changing their tax status. While the government still thinks the independent sector can do more to help raise standards in state schools, the language has shifted considerably since the election. The Department for Education (DfE) confirmed on Wednesday that a new unit had been set up “to help broker voluntary partnerships between schools in the two sectors”. Asked if it was a U-turn on earlier proposals to scrap private schools’ charitable status, a DfE spokesperson said: “Independent schools already support thousands of state schools to help raise the educational outcomes of young people. We are focused on building on that work in partnership with the Independent Schools Council (ISC) and the sector, to open up more opportunities for schools and children.” The charitable status of private schools remains hugely controversial. A recent study of local council records indicated that private schools were set to get tax rebates totalling £522m over the next five years as a result of their status of charities. Charitable organisations in England and Wales are entitled to relief of 80% on the business rates payable on the buildings they use, and some of the country’s best-known private schools qualify under the rules. Barnaby Lenon, the ISC chairman, speaking at the launch of a new report on independent and state school partnerships on Wednesday, said private schools should be encouraged and thanked for their partnerships with the state sector, rather than being discouraged and told they are not doing enough. A former headmaster of Harrow school, Lenon said collaborations between the two sectors worked best when there was a “moral responsibility” and schools were working together. “Partnerships work less well when the only motivation has got something to do with charitable status or acting under perceived pressure from a government.” The education secretary, Justine Greening, said in response that she wanted to celebrate the work already taking place between fee-paying and state schools and said the government recognised it should not expect the same from all independent schools. “For some schools, yes, we want to see them becoming sponsors, or opening a free school. For other schools, we want to see them playing a leadership role, perhaps by having other involvement around school governance,” she said, adding that, for others, there were opportunities such as sharing expertise in subject areas or supporting teacher training."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/sep/14/ringo-starr-wants-britain-to-get-on-with-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T08:31:23Z","webTitle":"Ringo Starr wants people of Britain to 'get on' with Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/14/ringo-starr-wants-britain-to-get-on-with-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/sep/14/ringo-starr-wants-britain-to-get-on-with-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Ringo Starr wants people of Britain to 'get on' with Brexit","bodyText":"Ringo Starr has described his impatience for Britain to “get on with” Brexit, declaring that “to be in control of your country is a good move”.

The European commission is developing regulations that will allow broadcasters to make their online TV services – such as the iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4’s All4 – available to viewers across Europe, while only having to pay the makers of TV shows and films for the right to air their content in one country. UK TV and filmmakers earn almost £1bn annually selling their shows country-by-country to European broadcasters, earning a fee for licensing a programme in each territory. Critics argue that the commission’s proposals threaten to destroy that value by effectively creating one bargain basement pan-European licence fee for each piece of content sold. A cross-party group of seven MPs, including former culture secretary John Whittingdale, Labour shadow culture secretary Tom Watson and Scottish National party culture spokesman Brendan O’Hara, have written a letter calling on the government to oppose these aspects of the commission’s Digital Single Market agenda. “We are writing to urge you to issue a clear and definitive statement of the government’s position on those aspects of the EC’s agenda which currently threaten the future financing of UK film and television content and will result in poor choice for consumers,” says the letter, which has been sent to culture secretary Karen Bradley. “There is a cross-party consensus that the government needs to do more to support the UK audio-visual sector.” Europe is the second-biggest market for UK TV exports – only North America is bigger – worth well in excess of £400m in sales annually. A further £500m of the £2bn British global film exports annually are accounted for by sales across Europe. The MPs argue that if this overseas sales revenue is lost it will mean far fewer top quality British TV shows and films being made, and will threaten tens of thousands jobs. “Any intervention by the European commission which undermines the ability to license on an exclusive territorial basis will lead to less investment in new productions and reduce the quality and range of content available to UK and EU consumers,” said John McVay, the chief executive of Pact, the UK body representing independent TV and film production companies. The MPs say that the UK government needs to follow the lead of France, Spain and Italy, countries that have expressed opposition to Brussels’ proposals because of the potential impact on their domestic film and TV industries. The MPs say that the UK’s withdrawal from Europe will not insulate British producers from the problem because the 27 remaining EU countries will operate under the proposed system. “After Brexit, UK-based companies will still look to distribute content across the European market and engage in co-productions with European partners,” the letter says. “Any proposals that undermine the value of in this market will therefore have a major impact on the UK sector. The discussions at EU level are at a crucial stage and the UK has yet to publish a clear and unambiguous statement on this issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/sep/15/sports-quiz-week-football-champions-league-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T09:38:40Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: Dwight, slights, big fights and Champions League nights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/15/sports-quiz-week-football-champions-league-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/sep/15/sports-quiz-week-football-champions-league-boxing","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: Dwight, slights, big fights and Champions League nights","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/15/tracking-trump-clinton-memoir-daca-democrats-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Tracking Trump: Clinton warns of dystopia and Trump pivots on Daca","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/tracking-trump-clinton-memoir-daca-democrats-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/15/tracking-trump-clinton-memoir-daca-democrats-deal","fields":{"headline":"Tracking Trump: Clinton warns of dystopia and Trump pivots on Daca","bodyText":"There had been some doubt last week about how significant or long-lasting Donald Trump’s sudden overtures to the Democrats actually were. But after his debt-ceiling and disaster-relief deal with the Democratic leaders he calls “Chuck and Nancy”, Trump decided to repeat the trick this week with a different issue. Last weekend Just as he had for Hurricane Harvey during its march towards Texas last month, Trump spent the weekend tweeting out warnings about the latest forecasts for Hurricane Irma, which rampaged through the Caribbean and was due to strike Florida imminently. In Russia news, the Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller had notified the White House that his team would try to seek interviews with six current and former Trump aides as part of the investigation into Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election, including former press secretary Sean Spicer, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and interim communications director Hope Hicks. Another former White House fixture, ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon, continued a post-government media offensive with a warning that China – his bête noire – was “Germany in 1930 … It could go one way or the other.” Bannon was fired last month during chief of staff John Kelly’s ongoing attempts to get a grip on a dysfunctional White House, but some observers suggest the Breitbart chief still exerts a strong influence over the president. Chuck Schumer, who along with his fellow congressional Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi struck an unlikely legislative deal with Trump the week before, revealed the president’s reaction to media coverage of their pact. “I got a call early this morning,” Schumer said. “He said, ‘This was so great!’ Here’s what he said: ‘Do you watch Fox News?’ I said, ‘Not really.’ ‘They’re praising you!’ Meaning me. But he said, ‘And your stations’ – I guess meaning MSNBC and CNN – ‘are praising me! This is great!’” Monday Trump commemorated the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington with a speech at the Pentagon “making plain to these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large earth”. Also on the warpath was Bannon, who, in a TV interview in which he wore two shirts, accused the GOP establishment of trying to “nullify” last year’s presidential election and called on those in the administration who disagreed with the president to step down. He singled out economic adviser Gary Cohn, who had denounced Trump’s equivocating on neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. “If you don’t like what [Trump’s] doing and you don’t agree with it, you have an obligation to resign,” Bannon said. Tuesday At the risk of turning this column into Tracking Steve, it was notable that Bannon popped up again in Hong Kong, repeating his contention that stopping China’s road to world domination is the defining issue of our era, but more unusually taking care to heap praise on the country’s president Xi Jinping. “I don’t think there’s a world leader that President Trump respects more than the president of China,” Bannon said. “Xi is very impressive.” He added that a “very aggressive” Trump would arrive in China in November determined to “avoid a trade war, which is detrimental to both countries”. As Hillary Clinton’s election memoir hit the shelves, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed her criticisms of the president as an attempt to boost sales and called this a “sad” end to her political career. In the book, What Happened, the former Democratic presidential candidate draws parallels between Trump’s “war on truth” and the Soviet Union and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. In a rare dyspeptic outburst during what was generally a calm week on Twitter, the president lashed out at “people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me &amp; have zero access”. (He probably didn’t mean Clinton.) And there were reports the Trump campaign had begun to hand over documents to Mueller, as the special counsel’s investigation continued to tick away. Wednesday The Guardian reported that US congressional investigators were examining whether Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser who is one of the key figures being investigated by Mueller, secretly promoted a plan by private business interests to build US-Russian nuclear power plants in the Middle East while he was serving in the White House. They were also examining whether the proposal was still being promoted by the Trump administration, months after Flynn was forced out of his role. That evening Trump’s newfound love of bipartisanship seemed to bear fruit once more, with Chuck and Nancy leaving a White House dinner to say they had struck a deal to protect the so-called Dreamers the president had plunged into insecurity last week when he cancelled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme that gave them the temporary right to live, study and work in America. In exchange the Democrats had agreed to unspecified border-security measures, they said – but that did not include support for a wall on the Mexican border. Not so fast, interrupted Sanders, tweeting that there had “certainly not” been an agreement excluding the wall. Thursday But before long her boss was awake and contradicting her in true Trump style. On his way to visit Florida, the president told reporters he was “fairly close” to a deal with Democrats along the lines Schumer and Pelosi had suggested the night before. And he confirmed: “The wall will come later.” The reaction from Trump’s most vocal hard-right supporters was furious, with conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeting: “At this point, who DOESN’T want Trump impeached?” and Bannon’s Breitbart website running the critical headline “Amnesty Don”. It remained to be seen whether Trump’s rank and file supporters were similarly exercised. They may not be. The American public is divided on the issue of immigration, but there is widespread sympathy for the Dreamers, who were brought to the US illegally as children. A Politico-Morning Consult poll last week showed 54% wanting Congress to give them a path to citizenship, while 73% wanted to protect them from deportation. Any deal on Daca would still have to win considerable Republican support to pass, something the neglected Republican leader Paul Ryan pointed out. And the notoriously fickle Trump could always take umbrage at some perceived slight from Chuck and Nancy, or sense that the Democrats had not conceded enough ground, and back out. But for now, at least, it seemed Trump had calculated that he could gain more from reaching across the aisle on popular issues such as Daca and flood spending than from continuing with the frustrating experience of working with his own dysfunctional and disunited party on rightwing issues such as repealing Obamacare. Friday British prime minister Theresa May rebuked Trump for suggesting the people responsible for an explosion on a London tube train were known to the Metropolitan police. Early Friday morning, Trump tweeted: “Another attack in London by a loser terrorist. These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!” The perpetrators were as yet unidentified and it was not clear whether they were known to authorities. “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said. Trump was also sighted congratulating an 11-year-old who was invited to mow the White House lawn. The child runs a lawn service in a nearby neighborhood and had offered to clip the Rose Garden. A mirthful scene ensued when Trump failed in an attempt to greet him owing to the boy’s laser-like mowing focus.

TMZ reported that Vincent had a heart attack last week and died Wednesday during open-heart surgery at a hospital in New Jersey. Vincent was known not just for his role on The Sopranos, where through seven seasons his character rose to become the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family, but also for his roles in the Scorsese-directed films Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino. Most recently, Vincent appeared in an episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU. Last year, he was also the voice of Jon Gabagooli in the animated series Mr Pickles. Vincent, who was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, and raised in Jersey City, co-wrote a book in 2006 called A Guy’s Guide to Being a Man’s Man; James Gandolfini, who passed away in 2013 and was Vincent’s co-star on the Sopranos, wrote the foreword. The Blast reports that another of Vincent’s peers, the actor Vincent Pastore, sent an email to friends after hearing news of his friend’s death: “I just received a phone call that Frank Vincent has passed away … I’ll let all know about the services … We lost a great character actor and great man ... May he always stay in our memory.” Maureen Van Zandt, who played Gabriella Dante on The Sopranos, expressed her condolences on Twitter. “We lost one of our family today,” she wrote. “Frank Vincent. Wonderful actor and lovely man. Rest In Peace, Frankie.” The CNN newscaster Jake Tapper also shared his condolences via Twitter, referencing Vincent’s most famous line as Billy Batts in the 1990 film Goodfellas: “Now go home and get your shinebox.” In 2006, Vincent gave an interview to Ask Men on the heels of his book release. “The youth of today are so computerized and individualized that a lot of the stuff men used to know is lost on them,” he said. “That’s what we’re talking about: loyalty, respect, manners, and honor. You have got to have a good sense of humor, you have got to be tough and you have got to know how to dress.” This piece was amended on 14 September 2017. The Guardian originally gave his age as 78, but a statement from his family clarified that he was 80 when he died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/13/feyenoord-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T20:41:04Z","webTitle":"John Stones double helps Manchester City to easy victory at Feyenoord","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/13/feyenoord-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/13/feyenoord-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"John Stones double helps Manchester City to easy victory at Feyenoord","bodyText":"This was a handsome victory for a Manchester City side facing scant resistance from Feyenoord. Pep Guardiola’s team will encounter greater challenges in the Champions League but for now they deserve to enjoy a job done very impressively. City failed to win away from home in last season’s competition and Guardiola said: “Of course this was a perfect start. It’s important to play good.” City offered a supreme display of attacking in their Group F opener. Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus both scored, to take the pair to seven goals in five outings in all competitions. The manager has insisted they can dovetail, and the Argentinian-Brazilian combo is certainly proving him right. The Catalan also showered praise on the ever impressive Kevin De Bruyne. “He’s one of the best players I’ve seen in my life, in terms of [being able to do] absolutely everything,” he said. “He’s top, top quality. We are so proud and happy he’s with us.” This is some bouquet given that Lionel Messi is among the footballers he has previously coached. Pre-match, the City manager was eager to stop “dreaming” of Champions League success, yet his team had a fantasy first-half that ended in a 3-0 lead, the first goal coming after 100 seconds. David Silva raced along the left and forced a corner. What followed was simple for John Stones as he headed the Spaniard’s delivery at Brad Jones’s net. The ball hit Tonny Vilhena but squirmed over. There had been a party atmosphere before kick-off as Feyenoord fans regaled those in attendance with a version of Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline, but 10 minutes in and City had doubled their lead. Kyle Walker – recruited for just this kind of right-back play – whipped in a cross from which the lethal Agüero hooked home. It was a near-sensational start for City. Guardiola had made two intriguing selections. First was Ederson’s surprise inclusion, the goalkeeper making a swift recovery from the facial damage suffered when Sadio Mané clattered him during Saturday’s win over Liverpool. The Catalan’s second choice was of interest, though no surprise given his attacking ethos. Out went the defender Danilo and in came the Portuguese forward Bernardo Silva, the sole change. Giovanni van Bronckhorst was without Nicolai Jorgensen, who had top-scored with 21 in Feyenoord’s 15th Dutch title season, their first since 1999. What the manager needed, though, was a far firmer defensive block. Each time City roved forward they tore the home side apart. Feyenoord finally managed a foray towards the skull-capped Ederson on 20 minutes. Michiel Kramer took aim and Stones deflected the ball out for a corner. This was about to become a stroll for City, though. Yet again they came at Feyenoord with pace. Benjamin Mendy hit a rocket at Jones and when he saved, his team stood still. This was because Nicolás Otamendi was a postcode offside but Jesus was not when finishing and that was 3-0. By the interval it was virtually men-versus-boys. City ended the half toying with Feyenoord. Guardiola’s second-half instructions to his men were surely to simply keep on keeping on. Van Bronckhorst’s move was to replace Steven Berghuis with Jens Toornstra but, really, the head coach might have replaced any of his misfiring outfield players. City did indeed continue where they left off. Stones stifled an attack and found David Silva. An instant flick inside and De Bruyne was away. The move broke down but the excellent Belgian was soon stroking one of his incisive passes down the right as City continued to terrorise Feyenoord. This was now akin to a training exercise. The sky-blue shirts pinged the ball around and on the hour Guardiola could afford to take off Agüero for Raheem Sterling. A few minutes later City were four up. De Bruyne’s growing influence was fully illustrated as his perfect ball from the left allowed Stones to head home his second goal. “There is no doubt of his quality,” Guardiola said of the Yorkshireman. “He’s going to become an exceptional centre-back.” Watford, at Vicarage Road, are up next, on Saturday. Marco Silva’s side will hardly fancy facing Guardiola’s men then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/sep/15/how-big-tech-conquered-television-netflix-hulu-youtube-apple","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-15T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"How big tech became the new titan of television","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/15/how-big-tech-conquered-television-netflix-hulu-youtube-apple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/15/how-big-tech-conquered-television-netflix-hulu-youtube-apple","fields":{"headline":"How big tech became the new titan of television","bodyText":"In Hollywood, the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, nobody knows anything. But that was before technology companies rolled in sure of one thing: to conquer television you have to spend, spend, spend. The geeks are raiding their digital vaults to transform themselves into lords of entertainment – or at least owners of content – and in the process shape what we watch and how we watch. Apple has budgeted $1bn for original content and is reportedly eyeing the studio where Gone with the Wind was shot. Netflix and Hulu are vying for awards glory this weekend with Stranger Things and The Handmaid’s Tale, after one of the most intense marketing campaigns in Emmys history. YouTube is ramping up production of original shows and films with budgets and ambitions a world removed from kitten videos. Facebook is waving a billion-dollar checkbook and may splurge up to $4m an episode on new programming, with Snapchat possibly not far behind. Traditional broadcast and cable networks, giants which for decades shaped popular culture, are scrambling to keep up. “I think at this point ‘arms race’ might be an understatement,” said Craig Erwich, Hulu’s senior vice-president of content. It reflects the convergence of television, the internet and wireless technology. For traditional broadcast and cable networks it’s no longer enough to make hit shows. They must make them available for streaming and downloading on multiple platforms or risk losing advertising and subscription revenues. And to grab a share of those revenues, and to differentiate their products and services, technology companies must own content – either by buying or making it. Original content, especially prestige fare such as The Handmaid’s Tale, defines a company and fuels subscriptions, said Erwich, of Hulu. “This is something that we can own, that comes out of our DNA. Exclusivity is key.” For Apple, breaking into Hollywood could help offset declining sales of iPhones and iPads and shore up its music streaming service. Adding a library of shows and films to the service will give existing subscribers much greater value for their $10 monthly fee and should attract new subscribers. Should the content be available only on Apple devices, it will be an added incentive for people to buy them. The evolving hierarchy will be on display at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday when Stephen Colbert hosts the 69th Emmy awards. Hulu has 18 nominations – 13 for Handmaid’s and five for its first original documentary, The Beatles: Eight Days A Week. Amazon has 16 nominations. HBO remains an Emmy behemoth with 111 nominations, Westworld alone bagging 22. But Stranger Things, The Crown, and House of Cards have helped Netflix close the gap from previous years, the former DVD mailing service garnering a total of 91 nominations. Apple stumbled into original content with Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke, critically derided reality shows streamed through its music service. But since hiring Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg – Sony executives who shepherded hits like Breaking Bad and The Crown – and earmarking $1bn to build an arsenal of original TV shows, the iPhone maker is expected to become a formidable player. “That billion-dollar number is a very clear signal that Apple is a lot more serious about original content than a year or even six months ago,” said Jan Dawson, a media analyst with Jackdaw Research. “They want to produce quantity and quality. Game of Thrones-type stuff.” The tech company will inhabit Hollywood history if its original content division moves into the Culver Studios, a possibility first reported by the Financial Times. The iconic lot, formerly owned by RKO, Howard Hughes and Cecil B DeMille, was used to shoot The Matrix and Gone with the Wind. Gloria Swanson’s “night spirit” reputedly roams the studio. Apple declined to comment for this story. Amazon – which is reportedly in competition with Apple for the James Bond film franchise, with potential for 007 spin-offs – has also been linked to the studio. Netflix led the way when it decided being a platform was not enough. It decided “to become HBO faster than HBO can become us”, as content chief Ted Sarandos said in 2013. He meant that content creators would eventually create their own streaming platforms, and stop giving them to Netflix. He was right. Last month, Disney announced it would end its deal with Netflix and launch its own streaming service in 2019. Netflix, however, has been busy creating a vast library. Its budget for original programming soared from $300m in 2013 to $6bn this year, a massive war-chest that will fund the release of at least 20 shows. YouTube, despite boasting 1.5 billion logged-in-users per month, and 1bn hours watched a day, also feels the need to cultivate original content. It is scheduled to release more than 30 original shows and films through its subscription service, Red, this year, and more than 40 next year. “We want YouTube original programming to stand for premium, entertaining content,” said Susanne Daniels, global head of original content. She cited Step Up: High Water, a dance show; Cobra Kai, a Karate Kid-inspired comedy series; and partnerships with YouTube creators and celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Katy Perry. In addition, Facebook will spend as much as $1bn this and next year to cultivate original shows for its new Watch video platform, the Wall Street Journal reported this week. And Snapchat has signalled a move into scripted content. That should complement traditional broadcasters, not drive a stake through their heart, the company said. The cash torrents pouring into Hollywood have made some uneasy. “It’s like getting shot in the face with money every day,” FX’s chief executive, John Landgraf, told a news media event last month. Netflix turned heads by paying Dave Chappelle a reported $60m for two comedy specials. In such a climate competitors with smaller budgets struggle to afford big name talent. But the revolution has gifted viewers quality, choice and convenience in what has been called a golden age for television. And in theory, it’s also a gilded time for creatives – courted by old and new money, exhibited on multiple platforms. For those lower down the food chain, though, it can still feel like the old days. “For me and a lot of acting friends it’s like, why aren’t we working more? You still have to hustle, still do the grind, go to the auditions,” said Mike Funk, an actor. Acting gigs for online content often pay below state minimum wages, said Dea Vise, a casting director. “It’s much harder work, longer work and less money than ever before.” Some Netflix shoots push crews to breaking point, said one technician. “You have to cram more and more in. The schedules are insane. We’re exhausted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/13/from-silk-road-to-atms-the-history-of-bitcoin","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T06:21:32Z","webTitle":"From Silk Road to ATMs: the history of bitcoin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/from-silk-road-to-atms-the-history-of-bitcoin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/13/from-silk-road-to-atms-the-history-of-bitcoin","fields":{"headline":"From Silk Road to ATMs: the history of bitcoin","bodyText":"Bitcoin is a digital currency started in 2009 by a mystery figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity is still unknown. It is unlike traditional currencies because it has no central bank, nation state or regulatory authority backing it up. The “coins” are made by computers solving a set of complex maths problems. To spend them, users buy bitcoin and conduct transactions with them using exchanges such as San Francisco-based Coinbase. Rather than a central authority validating transactions, they are all recorded on a public ledger, called the blockchain. Bitcoin don’t actually exist but are digital keys are stored in a digital wallet, which can also manage transactions. The wallet exists either in the cloud or on computers, and can be linked to bank accounts. If using an online wallet, investors must be sure they can trust the provider, because if hackers breach its server’s security measures the bitcoin could be stolen. Typically, you can pay by bank transfer, mobile payments or with a Visa or Mastercard. There are also bitcoin ATMs, which allow for bitcoin to be exchanged for cash and vice versa, in London, Bristol, Brighton and Glasgow. A growing list of firms accept Bitcoin, including Tesla and Microsoft. Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21m – of which more than 15m are in circulation – which supporters claim make it more stable than government-backed currencies that can be devalued by central banks printing money. However, it has been very volatile and has quadrupled in value in the last nine months to more than $5,000 for each bitcoin. It lost 10% on Wednesday when Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan described it as a fraud. Bitcoin is often used as an anonymous way to carry out large cross-border money transfers, so has become linked to drug dealing and money laundering. It was used on the online black market site Silk Road, a platform for selling illegal drugs. On exchanges, fractions or “bits” can be bought instead of a whole bitcoin. Transaction fees vary according to the exchange or broker, but are typically up to 1% of the currency bought, plus bank transaction charges. Fees of up to 1% can also apply on sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/sep/15/solid-and-liquid-cats-didgeridoos-and-cheese-disgust-scoop-ig-nobel-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T23:01:17Z","webTitle":"Solid and liquid cats, didgeridoos and cheese disgust scoop Ig Nobel awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/15/solid-and-liquid-cats-didgeridoos-and-cheese-disgust-scoop-ig-nobel-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/sep/15/solid-and-liquid-cats-didgeridoos-and-cheese-disgust-scoop-ig-nobel-awards","fields":{"headline":"Solid and liquid cats, didgeridoos and cheese disgust scoop Ig Nobel awards","bodyText":"In ancient times, cats were worshipped as gods. Now a scientific paper arguing that the feline species may indeed transcend some of the usual physical boundaries has been recognised with one of science’s most sought-after accolades: an Ig Nobel prize. The theoretical treatise, entitled On the Rheology of Cats, argues that cats can technically be regarded as simultaneously solid and liquid due to their uncanny ability to adopt the shape of their container. The annual awards ceremony for research that “first makes you laugh, then makes you think” took place at Harvard University on Thursday evening, with three bona fide Nobel laureates, including the British-born economist Oliver Hart, on hand to distribute prizes. The 10 awards included the peace prize, given to a Swiss team for their discovery that taking up the didgeridoo reduces snoring and the economics prize, which went to an investigation into how contact with a live crocodile affects a person’s willingness to gamble. James Heathcote, a GP from Kent, received the anatomy prize for solving the long-standing mystery of why old men have such big ears (they don’t keep growing, gravity stretches them). Marc-Antoine Fardin, of the Université Paris Diderot and sole author of the cat paper, was inspired by an internet thread featuring absurd photos of cat-filled containers, ranging from sweet jars to sinks. “This actually raised some interesting questions about what it means to be a fluid and so I thought it could be used to highlight actually serious topics at the centre of the field of rheology, the study of flows,” he said. Fardin’s subsequent paper, published in the Rheology Bulletin in 2014, explores how to calculate a cat’s “Deborah number”, a special term used to describe fluidity, and speculated on how cats might behave if subjected to the “tilted jar experiment”. “If you take a timelapse of a glacier on several years you will unmistakably see it flow down the mountain,” he said. “For cats, the same principle holds. If you are observing a cat on a time larger than its relaxation time, it will be soft and adapt to its container, like a liquid would.” The ceremony also recognised a Swiss team for showing, in a randomised controlled trial, that didgeridoo playing reduces snoring and eases the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. This could be due to the improving effect on tongue muscles and the reduction of “fat pads” in the throat. Some – the patient’s spouse, for instance – might question whether the treatment would simply replace one noise nuisance with another that could prove equally burdensome. But the approach seems to be gaining traction: since the paper’s publication, one of its authors has switched career to work full-time as a therapeutic didgeridoo instructor and has already taught around 2,500 patients. Milo Puhan, a professor of public health and epidemiology at the University of Zurich and first author of the work, argues that the didgeridoo is “not worse than any other instrument”. Puhan said he was honoured to be a recipient, noting that some past Ig Nobel winners have subsequently upgraded to Nobel laureate status. “The president of my university was very excited about it,” he added. Other recipients include the French neuroscientists who were the first to identify the brain circuits that underpin a hatred for cheese. The brain imaging study, in which people were asked to smell cheddar, goats’ cheese and gruyère while lying in an MRI scanner, pinpointed a region called the basal ganglia as the neural epicentre of cheese disgust. The Harvard ceremony will also reward the observation by Italian scientists that many identical twins cannot tell themselves apart in pictures and the discovery of a female penis and male vagina in a Brazilian cave insect. Marc Abrahams, editor of the magazine Annals of Improbable Research and founder of the awards, said: “If you didn’t win an Ig Nobel prize tonight – and especially if you did – better luck next year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/13/european-parliament-calls-for-investigation-into-azerbaijani-laundromat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T17:53:36Z","webTitle":"European parliament calls for investigation into 'Azerbaijani Laundromat'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/european-parliament-calls-for-investigation-into-azerbaijani-laundromat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/13/european-parliament-calls-for-investigation-into-azerbaijani-laundromat","fields":{"headline":"European parliament calls for investigation into 'Azerbaijani Laundromat'","bodyText":"The European parliament has called for an investigation into revelations by the Guardian and media partners that Azerbaijan ran a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) slush fund to pay influential Europeans to paint a positive image of the authoritarian regime. MEPs have demanded a “comprehensive” investigation into “attempts by Azerbaijan and other autocratic regimes ... to influence European decision-makers through illicit means”, following a last-minute amendment to a report on corruption. In a separate move, the head of the Council of Europe, Thorbjørn Jagland, called for unprecedented legal action against Azerbaijan over its refusal to release a political prisoner in defiance of the European court on human rights. The Council of Europe and ECHR are not part of the EU, but the coincidence in timing shows how political repression and corruption in Azerbaijan is rising up the agenda of Europe’s institutions. Jagland’s intervention centres on opposition leader Ilgar Mammadov, who was jailed for organising and taking part in demonstrations in 2013. Judges at the ECHR found he was jailed for criticising Azerbaijani authorities but the government has refused to release him. At a meeting of Council of Europe ambassadors on Wednesday, Jagland called for the launch of legal proceedings against Azerbaijan for flouting ECHR court judgments – an unprecedented step in the 68-year history of the Council of Europe. “We cannot have political prisoners in Europe and we cannot have a situation in which Azerbaijan continues to deprive Mammadov of his liberty against the judgment of the highest court – which clearly stated his arrest and detention were arbitrary,” Jagland said in a statement released to the Guardian. “The time has come for Azerbaijan to think hard about its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and whether it still wants to fulfil them.” Azerbaijan signed the European convention of human rights in 2001 but its refusal to implement ECHR rulings has contributed to a slow-burning crisis for the court. Jagland wants to invoke the Council of Europe convention’s article 46.4, which could ultimately lead to Azerbaijan being ejected from the human rights body. This “nuclear option” has never been used before and would require action from European foreign ministers, following a court assessment. The politics of the oil-rich country were also being debated in the European parliament, when MEPs voted to set up a corruption investigation by 349 votes to 290, with 42 abstentions. “Following the recent ‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’ revelations, attempts by Azerbaijan and other autocratic regimes in third countries to influence European decision-makers through illicit means [the European parliament] calls for a comprehensive parliament investigation,” the text stated. The amendment was tacked on a report on corruption and human rights in non-EU countries. Drafted by Catalan MEP Jordi Solé, the amendment had been seen as a long shot unlikely to surmount opposition from the large centre-right and liberal blocs. In theory, the investigation could be wide-ranging as the amendment calls for a broad inquiry into “the influence exerted by such regimes”, but it remains to be seen whether it will even get under way. The European parliament has set up ad-hoc investigations into tax avoidance in Luxembourg, the Panama papers and the “Dieselgate” emissions scandal, but other calls for action have fallen on stony ground – for instance, a vote in favour of a European-Israeli-Palestinian parliamentary forum went nowhere. Failure to set up an investigation would damage the credibility of the European parliament, which struggles to make its voice heard on foreign policy, where it has limited powers. Solé said his group would push for “swift establishment” of an investigation. “We will insist that it thoroughly looks into the various responsibilities of all those involved in this massive money laundering and corruption scandal, including European banks, and holds them accountable,” he said. “The parliament needs to ensure that it has adequate safeguards in place to protect itself from such forms of pressure, which, ultimately, undermine our democratic credibility.” No members of the European parliament have been implicated in the Azerbaijan laundromat revelations, where bank records showed multiple payments to former members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly, Pace. One is Eduard Lintner, a German ex-MP and member of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrats. Another is the Italian former chair of the centre-right group in Pace, Luca Volontè. Belgian media said on Tuesday that the trail led back to two Belgian politicians. A joint investigation by L’Echo and De Tijd found that Liberal MP Alain Destexhe and former politician Stef Goris had set up a not-for-profit election observation organisation that received $800,000 between 2012 and 2014 from Lintner. Destexhe denies being involved in the management of the organisation, while Goris said he did not receive any money from Azerbaijan. Destexhe is the author of a Pace report on human rights in Azerbaijan that has been criticised for not mentioning corruption."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/13/theresa-mays-snap-election-cost-taxpayers-140m","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T16:54:48Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's snap election cost taxpayers £140m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/13/theresa-mays-snap-election-cost-taxpayers-140m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/13/theresa-mays-snap-election-cost-taxpayers-140m","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's snap election cost taxpayers £140m","bodyText":"Theresa May’s snap election that resulted in the loss of her majority cost the public purse more than £140m, the Cabinet Office has said. The department released the costings after being forced to ask for more money to cover the cost of the vote. In a written statement, Chris Skidmore, a Cabinet Office minister, said £98m was spent by returning officers to run the poll and a further £42m on posted material. The sum is an increase of 16% on the 2015 general election, which cost £123m, and 25% on the 2010 election, which cost £113m. However, it is slightly less expensive than the EU referendum of 2016, which came to a total of around £142m. The costs are higher than previous elections because it was a standalone event rather than being combined with local elections, which is usually the case for polls held in May. It covers the expense of millions of postal votes, poll cards and ballot papers as well as manning polling stations and counts across the country. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority also spends millions on “winding-up” costs for MPs who lose their jobs at the election. May’s lost majority also came at a price because the government offered an extra £1bn for Northern Ireland at the same time as striking a confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionist party. Jon Trickett, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “Theresa May has been left with egg on her face and the taxpayer is picking up the bill. The prime minister said there was no magic money tree to give nurses a proper pay rise. “But she spent £140 million of taxpayers’ cash on a failed bid to boost her majority that’s led to a zombie government.” The Cabinet Office said in a statement: “The House of Commons was invited to vote on whether or not to hold an early general election. Democratically-elected MPs voted in favour of holding the election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/sep/20/chester-europes-most-accessible-city","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T06:30:39Z","webTitle":"Roman holiday: how Chester became the most accessible city in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/20/chester-europes-most-accessible-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/sep/20/chester-europes-most-accessible-city","fields":{"headline":"Roman holiday: how Chester became the most accessible city in Europe","bodyText":"A step up to a restaurant and no threshold ramp in sight. A pub with its function room upstairs, making attending a friend’s birthday drinks impossible. A kerb that hasn’t been flattened, essentially imprisoning you in the road. To a wheelchair user, such as myself, some cities can feel like no-go areas. Moving around Durham and its seemingly endless cobbles and hills can be a nightmare for people with mobility problems; it’s the same in Bath. And I have spent years paying £40 for a taxi ride when working in central London because the tube is still largely inaccessible to wheelchairs. In Brighton, with its narrow lanes and frequent steps, I often can’t find a suitable restaurant. It’s the same the world over. Disabled tourists must often pay over the odds for accommodation because they need large, wheelchair-accessible rooms; Paris’s enormous kerbs are a menace. And eight out of 10 disabled people say they struggle when holidaying in the UK, according to research by the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity published this month. It highlights issues with everything from finding accessible hotel rooms to access to bars, restaurants and sightseeing spots. So when Chester was crowned the most accessible city in Europe this year – the first time in the seven-year history of the Access awards that a British city has been named – it came as something of a shock. The ancient city, famed for its extensive Roman walls and Tudor-style half-timber shopping quarters, is perhaps not an obvious contender for modern disabled access. “We’re not a city that has suddenly said: ‘Let’s make this accessible,’” says Graham Garnett, access officer at Cheshire West and Chester council, and the architect of the Access award bid. “It has been a commitment over many years.” He says it was this long-term approach that caught the eyes of the European judges rather than any big new developments. But with the accessible overnight tourism market now worth £3bn (and day visits bringing that figure up to £12.1bn, according to Visit England), it’s clear that investing in accessibility is a prudent marketing decision. The “purple pound” generally is worth £212bn a year. Chester can afford to make the investment. The prosperous city bustles with cafes and high-end shops. The famous walls alone – two miles of Roman, Saxon and medieval fortification that surround the city – have seen an annual investment of £500,000 since 2009. In my wheelchair, I find I can easily gain access to the walls. A slope and short passageway lead to what feels like a rooftop walkway, lined with autumnal trees and cushioned by nature and history. Though the camber occasionally lurches me sideways, I do not, to my relief, go crashing into the light railings, taking out the falconry and cathedral on the way down. The entire wall area is impressively wheelchair accessible. Where that isn’t possible for heritage reasons, tactile paving and additional handrails are there for people with visual impairments or mobility problems. From here, wheelchairs are able to access the Rows, Chester’s unique elevated walkways above its four main streets, which have enabled “double level shopping” since the 13th century – and are now 100% suitable for wheelchairs. It’s a rabbit warren of access. Seemingly hidden passages, filled with fairy-light-strewn cafes, emerge almost magically into the high street. In total, wheelchair users now have six access points to the Rows and 11 to the walls. There are also tour guides, city centre access guides, signs and online help via the DisabledGo website. The two-tier shops and medieval atmosphere would impress anyone, but it feels particularly novel as a wheelchair user, and it seems fitting that the access has developed over time: the street-level entrances have been there for more than 100 years; ramps were added a few decades ago; a lift in a department store then gave even more access. But it’s the seemingly mundane aspects of disability inclusion – transport and toilets – that probably gives Chester the edge over its competitors. All of the city’s public buses are fully accessible. Council policy requires all of its licensed taxis to be suitable for wheelchairs. They must also include additional features, such as induction loops and colour-contrasted grab handles. The city has seven Changing Places toilets, which include hoists and a changing bench for disabled people who can’t use standard accessible toilets. And there’s a council commitment to include one in any future renovation throughout the city. “Speaking to other [nations’] reps at the award ceremony, they were so impressed,” Garnett says. “Other cities in Europe don’t have that.” As well as having a designated access officer since 1991 – a rarity in a climate of council cuts – Chester has had a corporate disability forum, where 16 disability organisations can challenge architects and developers about access plans. The recent £38m renovation of Storyhouse – the new cultural centre, which includes a cinema, theatre and library – had disability access at its heart. It even has an accessible backstage for disabled performers. As part of the planning permission for the Northgate development, which will include shops as well as leisure and cultural facilities, hoteliers are required to provide two rooms with ceiling track hoists; they will be Chester’s first. A visit to Chester zoo confirms its well-thought-out access: there is free entry for personal assistants and free disabled parking, as well as multisensory experiences for visitors with visual impairments and advice for those on the autistic spectrum (such as guidance on finding quieter times to visit). I’m able to see the animals from accessible viewing areas – lowered fences with transparent screens – and use a lift to access the tree-high “realm of the red ape”. And yet, for disabled people, the difference between being able to visit a place and not often comes down to seemingly small details. Garnett tells me of a conversation with a tourist who wanted to visit the zoo, but wasn’t able to because she couldn’t find a hotel nearby with a ceiling hoist. “I investigated it and we didn’t have any in Chester. But they informed me there wasn’t one in Liverpool either. Or Manchester,” he says. “The nearest hotel with a ceiling track hoist was in north Wales.” In fact, the toughest competition in the accessibility stakes isn’t in the UK. Rotterdam, the runner-up for the award, has paid detailed attention to making public spaces accessible, ensuring walking routes have an unevenness no greater than 3cm, and encourages people to report problems by phone or online. Under its “rapid repair” scheme, the city will fix urgent complaints that affect access within 24 hours. It even boasts a wheelchair-friendly path to the high-water mark on the most accessible beach in the Netherlands. Axel Dees, the spokesman for Rotterdam’s access bid, cites a willingness to work with different partners across the city, as well as knowledge of disabled people’s needs as vital components to their success. “Accessibility is for, and from, everybody,” he says. “We build our city together.” The third-placed city, the Latvian spa town of Jūrmala, mirrors many of Rotterdam’s innovations. An 850-metre-long accessible trail links the city with the seaside, while reclining chairs and special wheelchairs for swimming are available on the shore. The city also provides tandem bikes for blind people and beach table tennis that features audible balls. It isn’t only leisure facilities that impressed the judges. Skellefteå, a coastal city in northern Sweden, was given a special mention for its commitment to improving the working environment for disabled people. “For many years, access to work has been among the top political priorities in Skellefteå,” says Alexandra Sundberg, the municipality’s accessibility coordinator. “We have joined officials from several different authorities under the same roof to make it easier to support those far from the labour market, many of whom have a cognitive challenge.” This approach starts early: the city’s playgrounds have been upgraded to ensure that they can be used by all children, and young disabled people get priority for summer internships. Chester, however, is not yet a disability utopia. The decking around the zoo is so bumpy for my wheelchair I feel seasick at one point. And after I head through the Roman gardens (a public park created to display a collection of Roman artefacts) and down a winding ramp to the Groves for a 30-minute boat cruise on the river Dee, I find I can’t get down the boat’s steps to the bar. But friendly staff ask – twice – if I would like anything, and a transportable ramp enables me to get on to the deck, a real rarity with a wheelchair. The award has placed Chester firmly on the accessibility tourism map: Garnett says “disability tsars” across Europe are now coming to visit the city. “We’ve had them from Dublin to Israel,” he says. “They want to see how it’s done.” And as I go through the city, I’m struck by a unique feeling: I’m being included – like anyone else.

From the success of La La Land on the big screen to Hamilton on stage, there’s a renewed interest in theater that’s been reflected in a wave of movie-musicals and televised live-concert experiences. All of this seems, to entertainment industry insiders, like the chorus following a crescendo, with theatergoers re-energized and Hollywood producers awakened, again, to the crossover potential and creative possibilities of stage work. “I think the snowball has been building for a long time,” said Megan Kingery, a co-producer on the Tony award-winning hit musical Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812. Hamilton is often credited as the driving force of this trend; Lin-Manuel Miranda’s bold blend of American history and hip-hop proved not just remarkably soluble, but also commercially viable, scoring a Broadway record in November for the most lucrative week ever, with $3m earned from just eight performances. Tickets for the show, which opened last month in LA and is coming to London, can cost upwards of $500. But despite what looks like a rapid ascent, there are no overnight successes, especially in theater. Richard Kraft, the creative director and producer of Disney’s La La Land in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl, believes the pop culture climate has warmed to musicals at just the right moment. “We have an entire generation that grew up watching Disney animated musicals,” he said. “They have no problem with the notion that a character breaks into song to express their feelings. All we needed were a few good movies or stage shows.” “Shows like Glee, Empire, and Nashville, movies like Pitch Perfect and the Step Up franchise, even America’s Got Talent and American Idol, have brought a musical sensibility to more mainstream entertainment that’s reminded people how much they love people singing,” adds Kingery. This year, studios and streaming services have sought to capitalize on this rebirth. Damien Chazelle, whose movie musical La La Land played no small part in this trend, has sold an eight-episode musical mini-series called The Eddy to Netflix. It’s Chazelle’s first foray into television and Netflix’s first venture into original musicals. Hugh Jackman, who sang his heart out in the film adaptation of Les Misérables, will helm the PT Barnum-inspired movie-musical The Greatest Showman in December. And the cross-genre embrace cuts both ways. “For too long, musicals were living in this specialty category,” Kraft explains. “We went through a period where musicals were living in their own bubble and something like Hamilton came along; a subject matter no one would think of, an approach no one would think of, done in a manner that was universally powerful.” The success of Hamilton has emboldened producers to try their hands at projects that might seem ill-suited for the stage. This spring, a musical version of the 2004 film Mean Girls, with a book penned by Tina Fey, will hit Broadway. And just a few months before, this December, the SpongeBob SquarePants musical, with songwriting contributions from Cyndi Lauper, Sara Bareilles, John Legend and David Bowie, will begin its first engagement in New York. But capitalizing on the familiar hasn’t always been a successful strategy for theater; the recent adaptation of American Psycho failed in New York and it remains a difficult task to corral financing for smaller shows that lack star power. “It may become harder to get financing of an obscure little work that doesn’t have any names attached to it or any commercial upside, but that’s always been a struggle,” Kraft says. “But it’s a more exciting time simply because people who are great in one field are willing to take the adventure of doing something for the stage.” Typical Broadway distribution and revenue models – “put a show in a theater and have people come see it,” Kingery says – have also been subverted and accelerated in the process. NBC and Fox have announced plans to bring Bye Bye Birdie and A Christmas Story, respectively, to the stage for live concert experiences, and Kraft’s La La Land in Concert, which premiered just months after the film’s release, has plans to tour the UK, Canada, Mexico, Turkey, Italy and Switzerland. “There’s now potential for streaming live productions, which is a conversation that’s been accelerated,” Kingery says. “There’s also the possibility for tours to start happening sooner than they might have in the past. It used to be that you would do a show and, if it was a hit, you might record a cast album. Now we’re seeing the potential for the cast album to be not just a marketing tool, but also a revenue source earlier in the process.” And while Broadway has always been a source of rich material for film-makers, Hollywood’s newfound willingness to appropriate theatrical works for its own purposes has, in turn, lured film talent to the stage. “The talent pool who consider themselves as Broadway performers has always been very narrow, but those walls are coming down,” said Kraft. “I have composers who have never thought of Broadway thinking, ‘Oh, what about doing that?’ All of a sudden, it’s no longer just a few blocks of New York and a little incestuous group of people making the same art over and over.” This enmeshing of theater and film has also been a boon for those who typically do stage work, too, making it easier to find work and sustain themselves. “The knowledge that you can make more money in Hollywood than you can in theater is not newly occurring to people,” Kingery says. “But there are more opportunities for composers and a greater pool of talent that’s writing and working all the time that you can draw on. So if there’s other media opportunities that can provide them with a way to stick around and stay writing, that only helps theater in the long run.” As long as the broad talent pools of Broadway and Hollywood continue their mutual embrace, Kingery and Kraft think this trend is sustainable, not least for the performers, writers, and composers who now attract the interests of Hollywood studio executives. “A rising tide raises all ships,” Kingery says. “Raising investment for theater has always been, and remains, a challenge. But one of the things that Hollywood financing allows theater to do is also to support the talent that goes into writing musicals. It takes years and years of dedication with very little financial reward. “But we’re like a bad boy band,” she adds. “Nobody ever really goes away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/12/theresa-may-eu-withdrawal-bill-brexit-stance-conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T07:58:55Z","webTitle":"Brexit bill: senior Conservatives warn May after vote for second reading","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/12/theresa-may-eu-withdrawal-bill-brexit-stance-conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/12/theresa-may-eu-withdrawal-bill-brexit-stance-conservatives","fields":{"headline":"Brexit bill: senior Conservatives warn May after vote for second reading","bodyText":"Conservative MPs have warned Theresa May that their support for her government’s Brexit legislation is not unconditional, as they demanded significant changes to the EU withdrawal bill within minutes of backing it. Parliament’s post-midnight vote resulted in the prime minister facing no rebellion from within her party, as the government secured a victory of 326 to 290. The result handed May an effective “Brexit majority” of 36 after seven Labour MPs – Ronnie Campbell, Frank Field, Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins, John Mann, Dennis Skinner and Graham Stringer – defied their own party whip to support the government, arguing that the referendum demanded the legislation be passed. The prime minister called it a “historic decision to back the will of the British people” and said the vote would give clarity and certainty through the Brexit process. “Although there is more to do, this decision means we can move on with negotiations with solid foundations and we continue to encourage MPs from all parts of the UK to work together in support of this vital piece of legislation,” she said. However, senior Tory backbenchers were among those racing to lay down critical amendments immediately after the vote, as a big queue formed in which MPs jostled to table their suggestions first. Significantly, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve teamed up with his Tory colleague John Penrose, to warn against a power grab by ministers through so-called Henry VIII powers. Their calls for change came alongside a series of amendments from MPs from across the House of Commons, including Brexit-supporting Labour politicians and the opposition frontbenches. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who led a vote against the bill because he argued it was so weak, called it a “deeply disappointing result”. He said: “This bill is an affront to parliamentary democracy and a naked power grab by government ministers. It leaves rights unprotected, it silences parliament on key decisions and undermines the devolution settlement.” Starmer argued that Labour would amend and remove the worst aspects of the bill but called the flaws “so fundamental” that it was hard to see it ever made “fit for purpose”. The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake called it “a dark day for the mother of parliaments”. While Penrose co-signed three amendments with Grieve because of his previous role as constitutional minister, he is also on the committee of the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory backbenchers that includes dozens of the party’s most ardent Brexiters. “The current draft of the repeal bill gives lots of power to ministers so we can deliver Brexit, which is essential, but it cuts parliament’s role right down,” he said. “If Brexit is supposed to take back control of our laws, it’s pretty hard to argue that the small number of genuinely important and substantive changes should simply be waved through parliament without thorough debate.” In an article for the Guardian’s website published on Tuesday, Penrose argues that he and Grieve want two key changes to the bill. First they are calling for a joint committee of the Lords and Commons to scrutinise the government’s planned use of the new powers, which could force parliamentary debates in the few cases where it was thought necessary. They also want to limit the “wriggle room which ministers are given” during the process. Although other ERG members are supporting May’s legislation, some have privately expressed support for Penrose’s position, with one senior figure telling the Guardian they had not campaigned for Brexit in order for it to turn into a “power grab”. They said many Brexiters would “sympathise” with their colleague’s calls, raising the prospect of a series of difficult parliamentary votes for May in the coming months. Grieve also planned to lay down other amendments including calling for a further bill to be required after MPs know what the Brexit deal looks like before this legislation can actually be enacted. He also criticised the removal of safeguards for people or businesses adversely affected by the application of EU law. “This bill is necessary if we are to leave the EU without chaos, and so irrespective of ones views on leaving the EU it is a necessity but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be subject to proper scrutiny nor does it justify the government taking powers which are excessive,” he told the Guardian. “I shall be doing my best to ensure the bill is functional.” The justice secretary, David Lidington, argued that there were safeguards within the bill on Henry VIII powers. He also made a concession to Tory backbenchers over the bill’s timetable – promising to extend the eight days given to debate if needed. But Grieve and other Conservative MPs, such as Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, could win support from colleagues, with sources suggesting the government was bound to make some concessions. The Conservative MP Robert Jenrick argued in parliament that there were concerns around the Henry VIII powers. He told colleagues that while at least 50% of the statutory instruments would make “immaterial technical changes” that would not concern MPs, there had to be a mechanism by which to “sift based on materiality”. Meanwhile, the Brexiter Edward Leigh argued for the government to take a magnanimous approach on Brexit, both inside parliament and towards European allies and to the demands of Scottish politicians. He said that Brexit supporters had long argued for parliamentary sovereignty called on May to be generous with amendments. He even suggested the government should offer the EU to pay towards financial commitments up to 2021 – even if there were not a legal necessity. Ken Clarke abstained on the second-reading vote, and the Conservative MP backed the opposition on the subsequent programme motion to timetable the bill’s progress. A number of backbenchers laid amendments, including Labour’s Chris Leslie – who said his discussions with Tory MPs made clear there was “an appetite to enshrine in the bill a requirement for proper parliamentary approval of the final withdrawal agreement”. Among the Labour MPs not voting with the party line was Caroline Flint, a former Europe minister in the strongly pro-leave Don Valley constituency, who abstained on the vote. She said she accepted the bill’s scope of powers would need attention but said it was not Labour’s job to kill it. However, speaking afterwards, Flint called on the government to be open to sensible amendments. “The Henry VIII powers, protecting rights and redress; guaranteeing parliamentary oversight – these issues can all be resolved. The government has to avoid a bunker mentality and seek cross-party agreement. I see no other viable way forward.” Others including Frank Field made similar arguments – and also planned to try to amend the legislation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/sep/25/cornwall-the-uks-new-literary-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-25T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Rugged coastline and hunky blokes: is Cornwall the UK's new literary capital?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/25/cornwall-the-uks-new-literary-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/25/cornwall-the-uks-new-literary-capital","fields":{"headline":"Rugged coastline and hunky blokes: is Cornwall the UK's new literary capital?","bodyText":"Where are most British novels set? Well, the smart money would be on London. But once you get out of the capital, I’d lay a bet on Cornwall being the landscape that inspires the biggest number of fictional backdrops. The rugged, dramatic coastline will have a lot to do with it, of course. Winston Graham’s Ross Poldark, recently seen on telly equipped with smouldering good looks and preposterous abs, would not carry half as many hearts aloft if his frequent (and, one suspects, often unnecessary) horseback gallops across the cliffs weren’t framed by the sun setting over the storm-lashed Atlantic. Daphne du Maurier has lured many a literary traveller to the county, just as Joss Merlyn and his murderous wreckers guided unwary ships on to the rocks in Jamaica Inn, or the siren call of the foreboding Manderley (in reality Du Maurier’s home Menabilly, near Fowey) in Rebecca. With a lighter touch, Lelant native Rosamunde Pilcher’s books have painted a picture of Cornwall spanning the generations crossed by family sagas such as 1987’s The Shell Seekers, while Virginia Woolf, though not born in the county, admitted to being “incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall”. Her novel To the Lighthouse took as its inspiration the view from Talland House in St Ives, where Woolf holidayed as a child, whose vista opens on Godrevy Lighthouse in the bay. But, of course, every UK county has its attendant classics. Perhaps a truer measure of how deeply a place is embedded in fiction would gauge how many contemporary novels are set in a place. By that yardstick, Cornwall is in very rude literary health. I holidayed in St Ives over the summer, and beat a path – as does anyone of taste and decency – to the St Ives Bookseller on Fore Street, the narrow, winding thoroughfare that runs behind the harbour front. In addition to the well-curated selection of commercial and literary fiction packed into its small space, it also carries a wide range of locally set fiction. And boy, is there a lot of it. A huge amount. Liz Fenwick is the queen – or certainly one of them – of the contemporary Cornish novel: A Cornish Affair, The Cornish House, A Cornish Stranger, Under a Cornish Sky … Fenwick knows her market, and has nailed it utterly. But while Fenwick’s gathering up readers like the fishermen with their lobster pots, she’s certainly not alone. Television presenter Fern Britton has forged a new career as a purveyor of Cornish lit, including The Postcard, A Seaside Affair and A Good Catch. Similarly, fellow journalist-turned-TV presenter-turned-recommender-of-books Judy Finnigan is treading a darker coastal path, with her Cornwall-set novels, including the spooky Eloise and thriller I Do Not Sleep, wearing an appreciation of Du Maurier lightly on their sleeves. There’s no great mystery in Cornwall’s prominence: people like to go on holiday, when they like to read, when they might enjoy the verisimilitude of a novel set nearby. And the Cornish landscape provides that beauty, that sense of myth, that romance in every sense of the word, that is just perfect as the location for any story. But the Cornish lit trend isn’t seasonal, like ice-cream parlours or mackerel fishing. The industry keeps going throughout the year. Indeed, there are a rash of variations on the theme of “A Cornish Christmas”, proving that romance is as likely to bloom under grey skies as it is a bright Cornish summer. Indeed, a quick search for “Cornish” on Amazon brings up 40-odd titles due out between now and the onset of summer 2018, from feelgood romances to cosy crime murders to sweeping family sagas. Publishers love a trend, of course: we saw it in the proliferation of “girl” titles two or three years ago, around Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl and Paula Hawkins’s The Girl on the Train. “Cornish” novels might be a slightly more niche trend – but if only someone could find a way to combine the two, they’d be on to a surefire bestseller.

My wife and I had just been out to dinner with friends. After a lovely evening, we thought we would check the headlines before going to sleep. It was only then that we became aware that something dreadful had happened. I’d only been in my role as medical director for the NHS in London for six months. My job is to provide leadership to doctors across the capital, and on hearing the news, my first thoughts were for my team – and my first instinct was to help. A string of incidents in the first few months of my job (the Westminster terror incident in March, and the NHS cyber-attack in May) meant I was already well rehearsed in responding to major incidents. I knew that the NHS England team in London would be needed to support hospitals for far longer than the immediate event. We must continue ensure we are resilient for the hours, days and even weeks afterwards. This means working in shifts to prevent people from burning out. By the time I began managing NHS London’s incident coordination centre the next day – just a stone’s throw away from the attacks – the sirens on London Bridge had died down, but business was by no means back to usual. We spent the subsequent days and nights linking up with hospitals, taking shifts to communicate across the system regularly and ensuring that no hospital became overloaded. Our teams plan for years to ensure that we’re prepared for all manner of incidents, and everyone pulls together and functions like clockwork from beginning to end. The incident centre is a state of the art situation room, the walls lined with panels of television screens and banks of computers; with phone lines able to contact any part of the NHS. At headquarters, it is often only when things are slowly resuming back to normal and the flurry of activity has died down that we can truly reflect on the horrific reality of what has happened. We are all humbled by the dedication of staff on the ground. As a paediatric consultant, I’ve seen the reality of devastating incidents through another lens. When I was a registrar, I treated traumatised young children for injuries from a house fire that killed their parents. I remember the smell of smoke pervading the A&amp;E department; having to deal with the children’s lung damage. I have counselled relatives whose loved ones have sustained horrific injuries, explaining what needed to happen, while trying to provide comfort in the worst moment of their lives. From the safety of the incident coordination room, it is therefore hard not to think of the paramedics who ran past police Swot teams toward danger despite the gun fire; the nurses who worked 36-hour shifts in their determination to keep patients alive; the junior doctors who came back into work on what should have been their day off. Being a doctor changes the way you think about an incident like this. While managers might be thinking about the number of patients needing the most urgent medical attention and how to return to business as usual, I still had my clinical hat on. I still remember what I learned from my own time at a major trauma hospital. From the control room, I found myself reminding hospitals’ medical directors to check that their staff weren’t trying to be heroic – a common issue in such intense circumstances. After each incident, we take time to debrief, to reflect and learn from what happened. There are still some things to learn, and work is under way with colleagues in Manchester to help us better support people after incidents like terror attacks – for example, assessing whether they need support with post-traumatic stress disorder or bereavement counselling. Despite this, we have seen that when crunch time comes, the system can respond magnificently. It was partly this remarkable resilience that attracted me to the NHS in London in the first place. The capital has a history of transforming the way we do healthcare. In 2010, London became the first city in the world to implement a coordinated trauma system for an urban population of 10 million people. Studies have shown that since the redesign, hundreds of patients now survive where previously they would have died. The system was tested in these incidents, and many have commended the NHS for how it responded. Everyone came together as needed: from our doctors, nurses and the ambulance service, to those working in blood transfusion services and those who provide equipment and supplies. I continue to be proud to be part of London’s resilient and extraordinary NHS.

But at the Saitama Arts theatre on the outskirts of Tokyo, there wasn’t much time for that. The revered 80-year-old director had been midway through rehearsals for a new production of Measure for Measure. The show was due to open in a matter of days. “The afternoon of his funeral, we had to get back to work,” recalls his producer Miyako Kanamori. “One of the cast gave a speech to everyone: ‘Ninagawa would have said, Don’t even bother going to my funeral – rehearse!’ So that is what we did.” Kanamori and I are in a waiting area backstage, Ninagawa’s favourite spot, she tells me. There’s a table with a framed photo of the director, a prayer card and a few bouquets of roses: an impromptu shrine. I’ve travelled to Tokyo because another kind of mourning rite is about to commence: the company has painstakingly prepared a touring revival of Ninagawa’s famed sakura (cherry blossom) version of Macbeth, originally created in 1980. The cast is fresh, but everything else – the extravagantly decorated samurai armour and silk kimonos, the richly furnished 16th-century-style set, the evocative soundtrack – is as close to the original as possible. When it visited the Edinburgh festival in 1985, this Macbeth was declared an “overnight legend”, with critics praising its bold gestures and painterly beauty. It had a special place in the director’s heart, says Kanamori, not simply because it made his reputation overseas but because it was the first time he found a form that connected to European audiences. “He wanted to go back to the origin, point zero, and do it again.” It’s not hard to see why audiences were so overwhelmed. Macbeth – played by the Japanese star Masachika Ichimura – is a strutting samurai, bound by a strict code of honour to his warlord ruler and his extensive army. The Witches are cackling, white-faced male kabuki actors who chant shrill incantations beneath billowing clouds of cherry blossom. Three decades after it first visited Britain, Ninagawa’s Macbeth still makes much homegrown Shakespeare look pallid. Although the director was often described as a quintessentially Japanese artist, what we see on stage is an artful arrangement of cross-cultural influences. Macbeth’s battles with his conscience take place against a soundtrack that mingles Buddhist chant with Barber’s Adagio for Strings. Yūko Tanaka’s Lady Macbeth dresses in a sakura-splashed kimono, but plays Schubert on the cello. (So keen are the producers to honour Ninagawa’s intentions that Takana’s instrument will travel to London on its own plane seat.) “It’s a real amalgam,” says Shoichiro Kawai, who teaches at the University of Tokyo and worked closely with the director during his last years. “Ninagawa was always looking to meet Shakespeare’s world, but in ways that would make sense both to Japanese and western audiences.” As well as being gorgeous to look at, the ever-present sakura carries a message that underscores the play’s fascination with death. “People often say that cherry blossom is in every Japanese person’s soul,” says Kanamori. “Just as the blossoms don’t last long, life doesn’t last long. It’s a Buddhist idea, but of course the theme is also very strong in Macbeth.” Later, an assistant shows me through to the theatre’s archive, where we look through books of designs done in Ninagawa’s crisp and vivid hand. One sketch depicts a brooding red moon hovering over the scene of the hero’s death. Born in 1935 just a few miles from where the Saitama theatre now stands, the young Yukio at first wanted to become a painter, only to fail the exams; searching for a new direction, he entered drama school and became an actor. He was 30 before he directed his first show. “In a way, he did become a painter, but on stage,” Kanamori says. “And he remained interested in art to the end. He was very impressed by Damien Hirst.” Early Ninagawa productions were combative and contemporary, heavily influenced by the “atom-bomb literature” movement of the postwar period and often staged in non-traditional spaces. In one production, the cast entered dressed as riot police, only to be attacked by the audience. Ninagawa later recalled how in 1972 a young man, unpersuaded that the director’s approach was serious enough, threatened him with a knife. (Ninagawa took the message to heart, later writing: “If there are a thousand young men in the auditorium, I should expect a thousand knives.”) Yet, despite making a reputation in the so-called Little Theatre movement, Ninagawa yearned to work on a larger canvas, and when he was approached by a producer offering to collaborate on a new version of Romeo and Juliet in 1974, he agreed. It featured a cast of 65 and music by Elton John – many of his contemporaries were appalled. Ninagawa directed more than 100 productions, sometimes as many as six a year, often returning to plays numerous times. Shakespeare remained his lodestone, particularly in productions he brought to the UK in collaboration with the producer Thelma Holt. After the success of Macbeth in Edinburgh, the director moved on to The Tempest, which cleverly relocated the play to the island of Sado, drawing parallels between Prospero and Zeami, the founder of Noh theatre. He set A Midsummer Night’s Dream in a Zen-style rock garden – a playful response to Peter Brook’s Chinese-influenced “white box” production. For the RSC’s Complete Works festival in 2006, he offered a version of Titus Andronicus that was as starkly minimal as an ink-wash painting. He tackled Hamlet eight times, once declaring that, with this play, “I am answering the question of who I am”. He had a reputation for being more than a little tyrannical: there are stories that he once threw an ashtray at an actor he thought was being lazy in rehearsals. Kanamori laughs while acknowledging this: “He was a gentle soul, but he made great demands. Every morning, as soon as I woke up, my first thought was, ‘What does Ninagawa want today?’ I wasn’t even his wife!” Later, watching the curtain call for Macbeth, I see a photograph of the director being lowered from the flies to join the actors on stage. At the sight of their hero, many in the audience roar and leap to their feet. Perhaps it’s a trick of the light, but Ninagawa looks as if he might just approve. • Macbeth is at the Barbican, London (box office: 020-7638 8891), 5–8 October, and Theatre Royal, Plymouth (box office: 01752 267222), 13–14 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/11/leadership-hopeful-warns-wrong-leader-could-turn-ukip-into-uks-nazi-party-henry-bolton","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T17:28:27Z","webTitle":"Ukip risks becoming 'UK Nazi party' if it selects wrong leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/11/leadership-hopeful-warns-wrong-leader-could-turn-ukip-into-uks-nazi-party-henry-bolton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/11/leadership-hopeful-warns-wrong-leader-could-turn-ukip-into-uks-nazi-party-henry-bolton","fields":{"headline":"Ukip risks becoming 'UK Nazi party' if it selects wrong leader","bodyText":"One of the favourites to become Ukip’s next leader has warned it could become the “UK Nazi party” if it selects the wrong candidate to succeed Paul Nuttall. Henry Bolton, a former army and police officer who claims the backing of Nigel Farage, said that the party could “easily slip towards the ideals of national socialism”. Bolton, who warned last week against what he termed “the dominating rise of Islam in our country”, did not specify which of his opponents he was referring to. However, the comments seem primarily aimed at Anne Marie Waters, an anti-Muslim activist who has close links to the far right and has described Islam as “evil”. Bolton, a former candidate for Kent’s police and crime commissioner, also took aim at what he described as “Islam bashing” under Nuttall’s leadership, which saw Ukip policies at the June election include a ban on full-face veils in public for Muslim women. These policies, described as an “integration agenda”, were the brainchild of Peter Whittle, a Ukip London assembly leader who is another prominent candidate in the battle to become the new party leader, with a decision due at the end of the month. Bolton said: “I genuinely fear the election of the wrong Ukip leader could have serious ramifications for the country.” “The clear majority of the members I know joined the party due to its fearlessness in tackling the real issue that mattered to the man on the street. However, under the wrong leadership, we could see a swing away from our traditional, secular values and stances towards something far darker.” Targeting any particular group was wrong, Bolton said, and “very reminiscent of the policies invoked under both fascist and communist regimes during the 20th century”, and could lead to persecution. He continued: “Frankly, seeking to blame one section of our community for society’s ills is not patriotism; it’s a form of totalitarianism that goes against everything Ukip as a political force has ever achieved.” Waters has proved a deeply divisive figure in Ukip, and was barred from standing for the party at this year’s election because of her opinions. She was deputy leader of the UK arm of Pegida, the far-right anti-Islam group, has praised Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, and described Islam as “an expansionist, political, totalitarian and supremacist faith, commanded to world domination”. Waters’s campaign is being assisted by Jack Buckby, a far-right former member of BNP. Buckby was also a candidate for anti-immigration party Liberty GB contesting the 2016 Batley and Spen byelection triggered by the murder of Jo Cox by a far-right terrorist. Almost all of Ukip’s 20 MEPs have said they would quit the party if Waters won. Whittle’s focus on Islam as part of what he terms a patriotic “national revival” has also raised disquiet among some in Ukip, with several senior figures predicting the party could also split if he won. Other candidates have similarly robust views about Islam. Another favourite, John Rees-Evans, has warned what he said was “an insidious growth in the influence and effect of Islam on Britain” and believes there are parts of London where police never go “for fear of their lives”. At a hustings event in Gillingham, Kent last week, Bolton used similar language. While he warned anti-Islam policies should not be Ukip’s “main thrust”, he spoke of the issue as being a priority. “One of those common themes is, indeed, the dominating rise of Islam in our country,” he told the audience. “It is a thing that concerns people because they see their identity, their way of life, their British culture being eroded. There are concerns over the rule of law and effective policing.” Ballot papers are currently being sent in an election seen as too close to call. Aside from Bolton, Waters, Whittle and Rees-Evans, two other candidates are seen as in with a chance of winning – MEP Jane Collins and London Assembly member David Kurten. The final hopeful, Aidan Powlesland, whose main claim to fame was proposing at June’s election that the UK finance Brexit by mining the asteroid belt, is seen as an outsider."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/12/secondary-schools-struggling-to-get-enough-teachers-says-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T23:01:19Z","webTitle":"Secondary schools struggling to get enough teachers, says watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/12/secondary-schools-struggling-to-get-enough-teachers-says-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/12/secondary-schools-struggling-to-get-enough-teachers-says-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Secondary schools struggling to get enough teachers, says watchdog","bodyText":"Secondary schools are struggling to recruit enough teachers to keep up with retiring staff and rising pupil numbers despite annual expenditure of about £21bn on their teaching workforce, the government’s spending watchdog has said. Tens of thousands of teachers left England’s schools before reaching retirement age last year, and headteachers are finding it difficult to fill posts with good quality candidates, according to the National Audit Office. A report released on Tuesday concludes that the Department for Education cannot show that its attempts to keep teachers in the classroom are working or demonstrate value for money in keeping with the NAO’s remit. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders’ union NAHT, said the report was “pretty savage but entirely justified”. “As the report says, the government cannot get away from the fact that it does not keep data on local supply and demand and cannot show that its interventions are improving teacher retention. “As such, the DfE is scrambling around in the dark, wasting money and without a clear plan to tackle recruitment and retention. It’s a national problem. So it needs a national solution,” he said. The report found that 34,910 qualified teachers left the profession for reasons other than retirement last year. There was a 4.9% fall (10,800 staff) in the numbers of secondary school teachers, it said. A survey by the NAO found 85% of secondary school leaders did not think they had been given enough support by the government to retain high-quality teachers, while 67% said teachers’ workload was still a barrier to keeping people in the profession. Nearly all – 97% – thought cost was an obstacle to improving the quality of their workforce. Schools filled only half their vacancies with teachers who had the right experience and expertise, the survey found, and in about one in 10 cases, the post was not filled. There were differences across the country, with the north-east having the smallest proportion of schools reporting at least one opening (16.4% of secondaries), compared with 30.4% of schools in outer London and 26.4% in the south-east. Auditors said DfE initiatives to support the teaching workforce have been “relatively small scale”, estimating that the department spent £35.7m in 2016-17 on teacher development and retention, as well as an estimated £34.2m on schemes aimed at improving teacher quality. In comparison, in 2013-14, £555m was spent on training and supporting new teachers. The watchdog concludes: “Having enough high-quality teachers in the right places is crucial to securing value for money for the £21bn that schools spend on their teaching workforce. “Performance against national indicators suggests progress. These indicators, however, mask significant variation between schools and concerning trends, especially in secondary schools. “Schools are facing real challenges in retaining and developing their teachers, particularly when they are also expected to make significant savings by using staff more efficiently.” Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said there was a risk that pressure on teachers would grow. “Since having enough high-quality teachers is essential to the effective operation of the school system, these are issues that the department needs to address urgently.” A DfE spokeswoman said there were 15,500 more teachers in schools than in 2010, and “significant sums” were being spent on teacher recruitment. “We recognise there are challenges facing schools and we are taking significant steps to address them,” she said. “We have established a £75m fund to support high-quality professional development in those schools where teacher retention is an issue, and we are making it easier to advertise vacancies. “In addition, we are working with Ofsted to tackle workload and will continue to engage with the profession to better understand the specific challenges and how we can address them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/sep/12/uk-to-offer-eu-deals-on-foreign-policy-and-joint-military-operations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T23:01:19Z","webTitle":"UK to offer EU deals on foreign policy and joint military operations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/12/uk-to-offer-eu-deals-on-foreign-policy-and-joint-military-operations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/sep/12/uk-to-offer-eu-deals-on-foreign-policy-and-joint-military-operations","fields":{"headline":"UK to offer EU deals on foreign policy and joint military operations","bodyText":"Britain will offer to agree positions on foreign policy with Brussels and contribute to joint military operations after leaving the EU, according to the government’s Brexit position paper on defence. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said it was important to make sure the UK’s “commitment to European security is undiminished” after Brexit, citing collective efforts to bring Iran to the negotiating table and the united response to Russian aggression in Ukraine as areas of successful EU action in the past. “In recent years, the European Union has helped achieve crucial foreign policy goals,” he said. “We want this EU role to continue after we leave. This is why, in addition to stronger relations with EU member states, we also envisage a strong UK-EU partnership on foreign and defence policy following our departure. This will allow us to continue our work in tackling the shared challenges we face worldwide.” The new position paper strikes a more positive note about EU defence and foreign policy matters than expected, after Theresa May put security cooperation on the table as a bargaining chip to get a good trade deal when she wrote her letter to the EU triggering article 50 in March. A senior Whitehall source said Nato would remain the “cornerstone of the UK’s defence” and Britain remains opposed to the idea of a collective EU army but cooperation with Brussels remained vital in the face of global threats to security. The position paper does not deal with Home Office matters such as policing and crime cooperation, which will be covered by a separate document detailing whether the UK wants to stay in Europol and its approach to intelligence-sharing. The defence document, due to be published in full on Tuesday, will signal a “willingness to partner with the EU in the face of ever-growing global threats”, including illegal migration, terrorism, cyber threats and state-based threats. Britain’s aim will be to replicate a security partnership outside the EU “that is deeper than any other third country and that reflects our shared interest”, continuing with joint defence projects such as combating piracy off the Horn of Africa and work on the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, said it was in the UK and EU’s mutual interest to work closely together. “Today’s paper highlights Britain’s world-class diplomacy and defence capabilities, our leading contribution to international development, and our desire to continue to use these as part of a deep and special partnership with the EU,” he said. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, highlighted the UK’s military capacity, including the largest defence budget and navy in Europe, as well as troops and planes deployed on land, air and sea across the continent. The government has already been at pains to reassure Nordic and Baltic countries that the UK’s approach to security in the region will not change after Brexit in the face of Russian aggression. Labour MP Chris Bryant, a leading supporter of Open Britain, said the government’s intention to share a deep foreign policy and security relationship with the EU was welcome, but “makes a mockery of their threat to leave the EU with no deal”. “Doing so would overnight end our security relationship with Europe, putting our citizens and theirs at risk. It is high time the government dropped its absurd no-deal threat,” he said. “Finally, the Brexiteers seem to be waking up to how important the EU has been in advancing peace and security. The foreign secretary used to claim the EU played no role whatsoever in keeping us safe but today he praises its ‘crucial’ role in helping us to achieve our foreign policy goals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/12/buzz-building-for-opening-of-zeitz-mocaa-africas-tate-modern","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T11:20:56Z","webTitle":"Contemporary, controversial and coming soon: Cape Town's vast new art museum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/12/buzz-building-for-opening-of-zeitz-mocaa-africas-tate-modern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/12/buzz-building-for-opening-of-zeitz-mocaa-africas-tate-modern","fields":{"headline":"Contemporary, controversial and coming soon: Cape Town's vast new art museum","bodyText":"The invites have been sent for the opening night, the displays readied in 80 galleries spread over nine floors, and 24,000 tickets have sold out in a matter of minutes. For a few short days there is quiet. The calm will not last. In Cape Town, on one of the world’s most recognisable waterfronts in the world, a vast new art museum, the biggest ever in Africa, is about to open, creating the biggest buzz in the continent’s collective creative world for many years. The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA) has already been described as “Africa’s Tate Modern”. This is, observers say, to underestimate its importance. Housed in a converted grain silo overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, against a backdrop of docks, the city and Table Mountain, the new museum is one of the most striking buildings to have been constructed in Africa. It is also the continent’s first such institution devoted to contemporary art. “It really is significant … [And] the significance is not just for my lifetime … but in 200 or 300 years from now,” said Kudzanai Chiurai, a 36-year-old Zimbabwean artist whose work is being shown in one of the new museum’s inaugural exhibitions. The museum, built with $38m (£29m) of private funds but open to the public, will house the collection of the German businessman Jochen Zeitz, along with a series of temporary exhibitions. The opening, nine years after the project was launched, underlines the massive new global interest in African art. “Before the first world war the most exciting artists were French; in the 1990s they were Chinese. Now the hot new place for contemporary art is Africa,” gushed the Economist in May. South Africa, where many of the continent’s most important contemporary artists work and live, has a vibrant scene with successful dealers who have built a global presence. But there has been little public support or appreciation of contemporary artists and many struggle to find recognition. “[The new museum] gives an opportunity to archive the contemporary scene as it happens. In South Africa in particular we have had many, many artists over the decades whose work gets forgotten. A museum can create a narrative of the development of art. Galleries are more temporary, and a museum does not necessarily have the same interest in commercial gain,” said Sisipho Ngodwana, associate at Stevenson Gallery. Not all are enthusiastic about the opening of the MOCAA. Speaking at the Johannesburg art fair last week, Mbadi Mdluli, a 40-year-old multidisciplinary artist and master’s student in fine arts at Wits University said she knew little about the new museum. Mdluli contrasted the creative scene in Johannesburg, the commercial capital, with that in Cape Town, a city which despite deep social problems is often regarded as a playground for wealthy white locals and international tourists. The new museum will have top-end restaurants, cafes, shops and a 28-room boutique luxury hotel on its upper levels. “If the museum is in Cape Town it should stay there. It is a very different place to Joburg. In Cape Town there is a seriousness about the art. But almost anything goes here. It’s a bit more real. Cape Town is really for those who can go to Europe and buy a freaking Picasso,” Mdluli said. Others from elsewhere in Africa also had some misgivings. “People say the museum a big deal, but for me it’s a tiny idea,” said Daudi Karungi, a dealer who runs a gallery in Kampala, Uganda, and was exhibiting at the art fair. “You do a beautiful museum but who is going to go there? This is not Europe where people go to museums all the time. What is urgent is the education of artists, the public, critics and collectors. People should celebrate it but it doesn’t mean it will make a significant difference.” Mark Coetzee, the director of the MOCAA, defended the institution against charges of elitism. “A historical museum talks about the past, a contemporary museum speaks about now, the present … Museums are not places for observation of beauty; they are central to political debates and that’s where artists want to be,” Coetzee, raised in Cape Town, said. Politicians in South Africa confronted with the challenge of dealing with deep poverty, minimal growth and entrenched inequality have not always appreciated contemporary artists. In 2012, Jacob Zuma launched legal action against a gallery for displaying a supposedly indecent painting of the beleaguered president which showed him in a pose reminiscent of Lenin, but with his genitals exposed. Some condemned the artist as racist. Herman Mashaba, the mayor of Johannesburg, has pledged to clean away graffiti in the city which many critics say are important works of contemporary art. South Africa is entering a period of political instability, with a bitter contest under way to succeed Zuma at the head of the African National Congress (ANC), the party which led the liberation struggle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime and has ruled for more than two decades. Coetzee believes MOCAA is a response to South Africa’s deep problems that is not only justified, but essential. “People say who cares about art? Who needs it?” the 53-year-old art world veteran said. “But contemporary museums … have become a public meeting place where you are challenged by ideas you can hopefully learn from … where you can discuss taboos and have a conversation about something that is different to you without killing each other.” • The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa opens on 22 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/sep/20/how-to-eat-well-for-350-a-day-by-the-scrimping-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T15:02:04Z","webTitle":"How to eat well for £3.50 a day – by the scrimping experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/20/how-to-eat-well-for-350-a-day-by-the-scrimping-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/sep/20/how-to-eat-well-for-350-a-day-by-the-scrimping-experts","fields":{"headline":"How to eat well for £3.50 a day – by the scrimping experts","bodyText":"Students aren’t best known for their cooking. It’s an unwritten rule that any article about freshers must also mention baked beans. But you can hardly blame today’s undergrads when, according to a recent National Union of Students (NUS) survey, nearly half are worried about being unable to afford basic groceries such as bread and milk. “The survey shows that students aren’t just worried about future debt, but the costs of day-to-day living,” says Izzy Lenga, NUS vice president for welfare. “Money worries play on the minds of students and add pressure when they need to be concentrating on their studies. It can affect your grades and your mental health. I know it affected me when I was a student.” The union’s research found that students spend an average of £24.32 on food a week (or £3.47 a day). We asked four thrifty experts how students can improve their menu on a budget. Ruth Bushi, editor of Save the Student Downsizing to budget brands is the place to start, and can save hundreds of pounds a year on the typical student spend. Use a comparison tool when you next stock up: load a basket at mysupermarket.co.uk and it’ll tell you which shops can do you a better deal. It’s also worth checking multiple aisles – chilled drinks, for example, are often cheaper in the long-life section, even for the same product. Ditto frozen or loose, versus fresh or pre-packaged. Cashback apps like CheckoutSmart can also help you claw back some of your spending through offers, money back and freebies. Home-grown veg, salad and herbs are another easy way to eat for less: they stay fresher for longer, so are less likely to go to waste. You don’t even need a garden – herbs thrive in old yogurt pots and jars, salads in bowls, and veg in pots, pans and recyclables. See balconygardenweb.com for urban inspiration. Finally, bring boxes! Containers with lids are the best kitchen kit – use them to freeze leftovers, pack lunches, and store stuff so it doesn’t go off (or Awol) before you get to use it. Jack Monroe, blogger at Cooking on a Bootstrap I have a simple formula for cooking on a bootstrap budget, one that was borne of scrabbling through bare cupboards and down the back of the sofa for forlorn bits of shrapnel in order to feed myself and my son. It may seem odd and convoluted to start with, but it quickly becomes second nature. First, take a sheet of paper and fold it into four equally sized sections. Label each: “carbs”, “proteins”, “fruit and veg” and “sundries”. Next, go through your kitchen and meticulously write down everything you have, according to category. Pasta, potatoes and flour all go in the carbs section. Beans, pulses, lentils, tinned meat, fish, dairy products, nuts, seeds and eggs, can all be filed under proteins. Fruits and vegetables should speak for themselves, but also include tinned foods and any other lurking ingredients that can reasonably be squirrelled into the plant-based category. That can of mushroom soup? Vegetable. If it isn’t a starch, a protein, or a fruit or veg, it’s probably a sundry. Dried herbs, fresh herbs, spices, salt, pepper, cooking oil, stock cubes, soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce – anything that adds a touch of grace and flavour to your meals can be filed here. It may take a while the first time you do it, but it’s invaluable once you do. Once you have your list, you can start to mentally put things together to create good, balanced meals. And it helps to quickly identify what exactly you need to buy, far more thoroughly and methodically than rushing round the supermarket trying to ignore the screaming offers and remember what it is exactly you wanted to cook this week. If your carb section is heaving (as mine often is) but your fruit and veg section is lacking, well, you know what you need to buy more of! And vice versa. I use this method to cut down on food waste, and also to get creative with what I have. You can use this chart to plan meals effectively throughout your time at university – just type an ingredient into the search bar on my blog or the BBC Good Food website, and up will pop a host of recipe ideas. Ruby Tandoh, food writer You can’t eat well unless you shop well. When I was at uni in London, I could do neither. I’d skulk into the heaving Tesco Metro at rush hour after lectures, grab whatever pasta-and-sauce quick-fix I could and get out pronto. The next day, I’d have to do it all over again. I was haemorrhaging money and I was this close to turning into an ambulant tube of penne myself. I needed a change. So, one lecture-free morning, I slung on an empty backpack and walked 10 minutes to the weekly market. I stopped by the Pakistani food store on the corner, where packets of frozen parathas (the ultimate snack if you fry them and slather with jam – sacrilegious but true) and chickpeas were half the price of the supermarket ones. I ambled by the bustle of the Turkish store, and found shiny veg that made me actually want to cook. All of this technicolour delight, and just an hour of my day, meant my cupboards were full for a week, without the nightly trauma of being bled dry at the minimarket tills and the shame of being caught coming home with a pot noodle and a packet of mini rolls under my arm. You don’t have to sidle down to the farmer’s market with a wicker basket, or turn into some wholesome wholefoods convert. You can still bask in the holy light of the supermarket and allow yourself the occasional slump into beans-on-toast monotony. But if you can bear to do your shopping in more than one shop, take a moment, and linger over the foods that interest you. Rather than forking out for ramped-up convenience store stuff, you’ll find your wallet and your belly plumper. You can’t argue with that. Ricky Willis, blogger at Skint Dad First, I like to create a meal plan and a shopping list. Instead of planning a week at a time, get enough recipes and meal ideas for two – or even longer if you have the freezer space. That way, you can bulk-cook dishes, batch them off into the freezer and reheat later to save time in the long run. If you don’t have freezer space, look to buy store cupboard essentials and toiletries in bulk as the overall price comes down. If you’re in shared accommodation, you could split the costs with your housemates. While making your meal plan, be realistic in your menu choices – you’re unlikely to get beef wellington on your budget, but why not switch the meat to minced beef instead. Keep thinking about other ingredients you can swap out: vegetarian meals are usually cheapest of all. At the shops, you may need to think on your feet. Finding yellow-sticker reductions can make you feel like you’ve found gold, but you’re going to face competition from other bargain hunters. And remember, it’s not necessarily a good deal if you weren’t going to buy it in the first place. Follow Guardian Students on Twitter: @GdnStudents.

These are just some of the abuses and outright exploitation that Newham council’s private rented licensing scheme has uncovered. Yet it could be cancelled by the government later this year if communities secretary Sajid Javid decides not to renew the scheme. The signs are not good. The government has already turned down an application from Redbridge council for a similar licensing scheme and former housing minister Gavin Barwell, now the prime minister’s chief of staff, has declared these common-sense schemes “misjudged and nonsensical”. The vast majority of landlords are responsible and the private rented sector has an important role to play in addressing the housing crisis, but rising rents and a lack of regulation has left many people vulnerable to exploitation by criminal landlords. Urgent action is required to address the scandal of illegal evictions, extortionate rent rises and the provision of sub-standard accommodation that fails to meet even the most basic health and safety standards. Yet the government has offered no solutions and has shirked its responsibility to fix what even the prime minister has called Britain’s “broken housing market”. While ministers sit on their hands, Labour councils are acting to tackle the problems renters face. In 2013, Newham council in east London was the first in the country to take decisive action to safeguard vulnerable families and individuals in the private rented sector by introducing borough-wide licensing, making use of powers given to councils by Labour in 2010. Under private rented sector licensing, landlords are required to register any properties they rent with the council and must agree to a set of conditions to ensure that properties are of a good standard and properly managed. Councils know which properties are being rented and have extra powers to enforce standards. The success of this type of scheme speaks for itself: in Newham alone, the council’s figures show that more than 1,215 landlords have been prosecuted and 28 of the worst offenders have been banned. A total of 25 letting agents have been subject to penalty charge notices or other legal action and more than £2.8m in council tax has been recovered. Through Newham’s landlord licensing scheme, a significant number of landlords are of interest to HMRC because of potential discrepancies between declared rental income and Newham’s records. Analysis by Newham council and the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that across London tax evasion by landlords could be costing the Exchequer up to £200m a year. Newham’s licensing scheme also commands widespread support from residents, the local police, fire services, neighbouring boroughs and the mayor of London Yet pioneering schemes like Newham’s are now under threat. In 2015, the Government curtailed local authorities’ powers to introduce landlord licensing schemes and required them to be approved by the secretary of state. Newham’s scheme is up for renewal and there is a very real danger that the government may veto it. The private rented sector is growing rapidly – a third bigger than in 2010. In Newham, nearly half of residents now rent privately, which makes the landlord licensing scheme more important than ever. Failing to address exploitation carries a huge human cost on the lives and life chances of individuals, families and children growing up in overcrowded, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, with little security or stability. Failing to tackle criminal landlords who exploit their tenants also risks giving reputable landlords a bad name. Everyone concerned with fixing the broken housing market and driving up living standards in the private rented sector should be watching this decision closely. Ministers should backresidents, good landlords, and all private sector renters by renewing Newham’s successful landlord licensing scheme.

The three novels he did write, beginning with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, had energy, spectacular violence and superb plotting. Larsson’s weird, sometimes clunky prose style was forgiven because there was real chemistry – empathy, even – between his two stars, the computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and the journalist Mikael Blomkvist. The series made a fortune and, as no good deed goes unpunished, it has been turned into a franchise. The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye is the second instalment to be written by the Swedish biographer and novelist David Lagercrantz, translated by George Goulding. The Girl in the Spider’s Web (2015) sold very well and this new outing has been published with full blockbuster treatment. Damaged, dysfunctional heroines are common in thrillers, as are layers of gendered trauma, but Larsson’s Salander was a fabulous, surprising character – a feminist superhero, an Amazonian queen, a Lolita who fought back. Obsessive and antisocial, she was forged in the crucible of violence she experienced as a child. She took the kind of revenge on rapists and paedophiles that most only fantasise about, taking on powerful, corrupt men with righteous but lawless violence. With Blomkvist, she was the glamorous half of one of the oddest but most effective and entertaining crime fiction couples. Blomkvist, the old-school social justice warrior with a penchant for underdogs and a hatred of social hypocrisy, provided a perfect foil. The Girl Who Took an Eye for an Eye is billed as the revelation of the appalling things done to Salander when she was a child, but the narrative meanders between a bewildering array of storylines that never come together. The story starts with Salander in prison for unconvincing reasons. When she does wander on to the page, she gets beaten up or does stuff on her computer, but remains ghostly and uninhabited. The author commits the cardinal thriller sin of telling rather than showing what she does: there are long, mansplaining sections about genetics and social research that made me pray to Elmore Leonard, the god of economical thriller writing, who famously instructed that writers should “try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip”. Lagercrantz has turned Larsson’s eccentric and feral feminism into a simple inversion. This time there are two female arch-villains after Salander. One is an ageing, ailing Mad Scientist with a doctor’s bag of syringes and lethal poisons who is determined that nothing of her social eugenics programme will be revealed. The other is a ludicrously cartoonish gang boss who ends up hospitalised by Salander’s quick fists and is in cahoots with a pair of nasty brothers – billed as Islamists – who have hired her to persecute their jailed and silent sister. There are identity-switching twins who make the antics of Sebastian and Viola in Twelfth Night seem pedestrian, and many references to Salander’s evil twin. The reader is repeatedly told that Salander and Blomkvist are driven by a desire for justice, but because we spend so little time in close-up with the book’s heroine, it is not convincing. There is a sluggishness to the plotting and much of the tension relies on orchestrated interruptions and delays, which irritate. Lagercrantz has all the elements of the Millennium series at his disposal, but the adrenaline is missing: it feels as if one has gone to a restaurant, ordered a rare steak and been served soggy fish fingers instead. • Margie Orford’s Water Music is published by Head of Zeus.

West Midlands police said its professional standards department had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place during a search of a premises in Coventry on 24 August. The force said it had received an official complaint and referred the matter to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The assistant chief constable Alex Murray said: “What was said was not right and the officer has been removed from frontline duties pending further assessment. The officer has already expressed remorse and is very apologetic over his comments. “We expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our officers and staff, and we will always take complaints from members of the public seriously.” The footage starts by showing officers talking to a man, named locally as Jack Chambers, 24, who is sitting down and smoking. One officer asks Chambers why he did not open the door to let the police in, to which he replies: “Because I was fucking half asleep ... I didn’t know who you was and you were climbing up the window like thieves.” Chambers then says: “Police? That’s even worse. I’ve been seeing all kinds of videos, I have.” One officer is then heard to say: “You’re going to go Black Lives Matter on us, are ya?” Chambers replies: “Yeah” and laughter is heard. The officer then responds: “You would be the first one I would shoot if I had a gun, definitely.” Chambers replies: “Oh, fucking hell.” The officer appears unaware that the exchange is being recorded. Desmond Jaddoo, a Birmingham-based community activist, called for the officer to be removed from duty. He said: “My concern as an activist is, taking into account the current climate and deaths in custody and also community relations, this goes no way in building trust and confidence with the police. “I would also say, I see this not being a hate crime but other criminality.

The evidence shows this time and time again. Think of the much-mocked Northern Powerhouse event earlier this year, with its dearth of female speakers, or the all-male panel – now colloquially known as a manel – which too many conferences showcase. Many men are sufficiently annoyed by this to sign up to pledges, refusing to talk on platforms in which there is insufficient gender diversity. This is progress, but it’s depressingly slow. In STEM fields the problem is probably more acute than in, say, humanities. We are long way from seeing a transformation in scientific leadership despite the numbers of women rising through the hierarchy growing steadily. The UK parliament is another arena where women are in a minority and the atmosphere is often – as Harriet Harman, amongst others, has spelled out – not female-friendly. But I would have hoped parliament would collectively be aware of diversity issues in STEM. Instead we have a depressingly homogeneous line-up of eight men on the new Science and Technology Select Committee announced this week. Yes, you read that right. Eight men. A group completely unrepresentative of the population will now make important recommendations about UK science. It isn’t the fault of the science minister, Jo Johnson, because the mechanism by which members of the committee are chosen makes it all too easy for a non-representative slate of names to be put forward and appointed. The rules for select committees say “individual political parties … should arrange for their members of select committees to be elected within each party in a transparent and democratic way. Each party group can decide on its own method of election.” So, perfectly legitimately, each party can produce its own list of candidates which, when aggregated with others, is found to contain not a single woman. This presumably could happen for any of the select committees; now it has produced this ridiculous result for science. In principle they could all turn out to be from London or the North West of England, or have read PPE at Oxford (like so many Cabinet members). In fact, as far as I can judge, the geographical distribution of members is wide and only one (Neil O’Brien) seems to belong to the PPE cohort. Encouragingly, he was previously a special advisor for Theresa May on industrial strategy, so he clearly has thought about some of the key topical issues that the committee will want to look at as it develops the new strategy. At least two of the new members are lawyers. No one ever said that science was only for scientists but it is discouraging to see that although one of the new members – Graham Stringer – has a chemistry degree, he is a trustee of climate change-denying Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation. Not what we need in a group considering scientific evidence for the good of our country’s future. But what is very clear is that no one thought it was important to ensure there was a woman, let alone two or three, on this group. Chi Onwurah immediately springs to mind: a professional engineer who regularly talks passionately about science and technology issues – and gender. She’d also add a further BAME voice alongside that of Clive Lewis, but unfortunately she is disbarred as a shadow cabinet minister. However, there are certainly other well-qualified women. Women such as the veteran MP the Right Honourable Margaret Beckett who, before she became an MP, worked in a metallurgy department as a technician; Sarah Wollaston has been a practising doctor; Heidi Allen has a degree in astrophysics. And that’s before one accepts that you can usefully sit on this committee even without a science background; including them would have expanded the potential field of female MPs very considerably. However, if the political parties are short of inspiration themselves, the Campaign for Science and Engineering has drawn up a handy list (men and women) of MPs in the current parliament with connections in science. But clearly, as with the existence of manels, simply a bunch of names were nominated or put themselves forward. They were duly appointed and no one thought twice about the overall composition of the committee. It is not encouraging for young female scientists to see that parliament apparently cares so little about their futures that they couldn’t even come up with even that long-derided sole token woman. We’ve ended up with a committee unrepresentative of the balance in parliament (around a third of which is female), never mind the 50% of women in the population. I am not a believer in quotas in general, but perhaps here I’d make an exception. Yesterday social media was a-Twitter with fury. Both Jo Johnson and Norman Lamb (chair of the committee) have expressed their frustration with the outcome; Jo Johnson explicitly said this needed to be resolved to yield a committee with “basic legitimacy”, and Lamb tweeted this morning that “… it has to be sorted. We can’t proceed unless women are elected to committee.” All is not lost. I am told there are still three places to fill. Someone should go and twist some women’s arms to put themselves forward. However, being asked to stand “because we really need a woman on this committee” will now seem demeaning. If someone had only stopped to think before publishing an incomplete but all-male list, this own-goal could so easily have been avoided. Now, any woman who joins the committee will be labelled as “just filling a gap”, reducing their effectiveness and probably their satisfaction too. Perhaps the eight men should all resign and the process be restarted with a little more thought given to the possible unintended consequences of established procedures.

Three of the other writers shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker prize had never written one before – although to regard master fabulist George Saunders as a debutant simply because he has hitherto devoted his creative energies to the short form is something of a cheat. The other two – Emily Fridlund and Fiona Mozley – we can certainly allow, as well as noting that their novels, History of Wolves and Elmet, privilege the complicatedly unreliable stories of solitary children in solitary places, both made vulnerable by the violence of adults. In a shortlist that seems to reject conventional realism and celebrate precarious and unstable narratives, our half-dozen to watch is completed by Ali Smith’s Autumn and Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West. Smith’s novel, written against the clock as the summer of Brexit unfolded last year, manages to capture the immediacy of a divided country while weaving in an echo of the prizewinning How to Be Both by revivifying a forgotten artist. Hamid’s Exit West is a novel of migrants and refugees that slips the confines of particular reality by constantly crossing and recrossing the borders of genre and form. It’s worth remarking that the shortlist doesn’t represent – as sometimes happens – a rupture with the longlist. The novels that have fallen by the wayside, including Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad and Mike McCormack’s Solar Bones, were also characterised by their willingness to take liberties with form, the better to unsettle their readers. Saunders’s novel Lincoln in the Bardo takes the inhospitable narrative to an extreme; when the novel opens, the reader has no clue what’s going on, and little in the way of footholds. Fragmentary, multi-vocal, buffeted by changes of scene, mood and tone, the narrative is an exercise in supreme irony: all this made-up stuff, and yet a real historical event – the death of Abraham Lincoln’s son, Willie – is at its centre. Although it divided critics, one can see what compelled the Booker panel: set largely in an afterlife filled with sorrow, terror and love, it emerges as an enlarging and humane novel. Bookmakers certainly seem to have agreed, making the novel immediate favourite to win. In its theme of the responsibility that comes with power, and of the personal set against the vast crisis of the American civil war, Lincoln in the Bardo also resonates with contemporary socio-political preoccupations. And anxiety is present across this list: how we live, what binds us to one another, what constitutes identity in the midst of disintegration and displacement. Even Auster’s 4321, which appears to be centred on an individual history and consciousness, yields to the idea of chance, to the arbitrariness of an apparently obvious trajectory, to chaos. As ever, the interests of the judging panel prove illuminating: this year, one can see how novelist and short-story writer Sarah Hall and Nabokovian Lila Azam Zanganeh may have championed narrative playfulness and indeterminacy, and how travel writer Colin Thubron would have significant things to say about the evocation of place. The chair, Baroness Lola Young, used to sitting on the boards of the National Theatre and the Southbank Centre as well as in the House of Lords, would have kept them in order. But perhaps most riveting is the figure of artist Tom Phillips, whose “novel” A Humument consists of an original text, repeatedly altered by deletion, collage and drawing, over the course of many decades. The idea of a piece of art that remains deliberately unfinished, hovering between forms, always ready to mutate, seems in some sense the presiding spirit of this fascinating shortlist – and might even point us towards the future of novel: a provisional artefact in a shifting culture.

Askew is an outlandishly talented folk multi-instrumentalist, playing fiddle, vielle, recorder, bagpipes, harp, shawm and drum deftly and tenderly throughout.

The Pop-Up Globe that’s appeared in the grounds of Melbourne’s Myer Music Bowl serves a kinder purpose, if one no less Shakespearean. It will be staging four of Shakespeare’s plays and a contemporary work with a Shakespearean theme over the course of a repertory season that opens on 21 September and runs until 12 November. The Globe, of course, was Shakespeare’s own famous London playhouse. Built in 1599, it was destroyed by fire in 1613, resurrected in 1614, and “closed by (the) ordinance” of the dastardly Puritans in 1642. By 1645, the history’s dullest religious zealots had had the vocational home of Britain’s greatest theatremaker razed to the ground to make way for tenement buildings. But one should never underestimate the patience of British vengeance; in 1997, a replica Globe was erected in London not too far from the original site and has served as a working theatre ever since. Melbourne’s present pop-up owes its existence not to this theatre, so much as it does the depiction of the same in a picture book for children. According to Miles Gregory, the artistic director and instigator of the Pop-Up Globe, the idea came to him while reading to his three-year old daughter. “The Globe popped up and she said, ‘Daddy, can we go there?’”. As they were living in Auckland, New Zealand, at the time, his initial answer was no. But Gregory had spent his “whole life fascinated by Elizabethan amphitheatres”, and had a collection of degrees in Shakespearean scholarship obtained from universities in Britain, so inspiration soon took hold. Using extant sketches of the second Globe made in the 1630s, Gregory sought to replicate not the replica, but the authentic experience of up close, stripped back Elizabethan theatre from the second Globe’s design. “The project was big and exciting and seemingly impossible,” he says ... and it was completed in 15 months, just in time to coincide with Shakespeare’s 400th birthday celebrations in February 2016. He capitalised on the project by mortgaging his house, and with the support of a friend he’d known since he was four. As a gamble, it’s paid off – the Pop-up Globe has completed two seasons in New Zealand, and already sold 40,000 tickets for its first repertory rotations in Melbourne. Three companies with a total personnel of 90 travel with the show, as does its wardrobe of 500 bespoke costumes. The size is warranted for the programme; no less than 14 individual shows are staged every week of its season. It’s a relentless schedule replicated in the physical construction of the theatre itself; the whole Pop-up is assembled over just six weeks, and packed down in less than three. Those expecting the smell of the greasepaint and roar of the crowd to emanate from galleries of tiles and timber should be prepared. “This is not a lime and hair museum,” Gregory says. While the audience pit before the stage still demands its patrons stand, and the roof is every bit as open to the rain, the structure swaps the tiles of the original for corrugated iron and timber stalls for metal scaffolds – “honest material”, according to Gregory, and always sourced locally. Gregory’s own delight is in the strength of illusion conjured on his pared-down stage, its power over the audience. “They come to see the building,” he smiles, “but they come back … for the performances.” Repeat viewings are affordable. Those wishing to experience Henry V, As You Like It, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello or Around The Globe in 60 Minutes can do so for standing tickets starting at $20.33. The fancy option of a somewhat royal-like private box is available from $150 with refreshments included.

Evan Williams, one of the co-founders of the network, said Trump’s election highlighted a wider issue about how social media platforms were helping to “dumb the entire world down” and undermining our sense of truth. Earlier this year Trump said he would not be president if it “wasn’t for Twitter”. Williams was asked whether Trump’s prolific use of Twitter had given him pause for thought, during an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He replied: “The much bigger issue is not Donald Trump using Twitter that got him elected, even if he says so; it is the quality of the information we consume that is reinforcing dangerous beliefs and isolating people and limiting people’s open-mindedness and respect for truth.” Williams, who has previously apologised for Twitter’s role in Trump’s election, added: “There is a media ecosystem that is supported and thrives on attention, period. And that is what’s making us dumber and not smarter, and Donald Trump is a symptom of that.” He blamed advertising models that compete for the attention of internet users. Williams told Today: “I don’t think Twitter is the worst case of this. It is the ad-driven media that churns stuff out on a minute-by-minute basis and their only measure is whether or not someone clicks on it. “Therefore quoting Trump’s tweets, or quoting the latest stupidest thing that any political candidate or anyone else says, is an effective way to exploit people’s basest instincts. And that is dumbing the entire world down.” Speaking about his post-Twitter venture Medium, a site which hosts long-form journalism, Williams said: “What we are trying to do is give people an alternative. There needs to be information we can trust, which means it has to be funded not by advertising alone. Because that distorts everything.” He also spoke of how he had become disillusioned about the ability of the internet to make people more intelligent. “One of my big learnings, over the last couple of decades, is that access to information alone doesn’t make us smarter. The fake news thing is one small part of it; another even bigger part of it is the quality and depth of the information. Is it actually building our understanding or deepening our understanding of the world or is it just noise?” And Williams conceded that internet companies could do more to tackle online abuse. He said: “Providers of information systems and the platforms that our media get disseminated on have a big responsibility. It includes removing stuff. “We are evolving our understanding of what abuse is and how protecting free speech is a lot more nuanced than it sounds. You can be an ardent believer in free speech and also realise that someone’s speech is limiting someone else’s willingness to speak. I’m optimistic that the systems are going to get much better [at tackling online abuse].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/13/football-transfer-rumours-jack-wilshere-arsenal-fenerbahce","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T08:11:05Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Jack Wilshere to leave Arsenal for Fenerbahce?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/13/football-transfer-rumours-jack-wilshere-arsenal-fenerbahce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/13/football-transfer-rumours-jack-wilshere-arsenal-fenerbahce","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Jack Wilshere to leave Arsenal for Fenerbahce?","bodyText":"The morning after Celtic Park staged a glittering celebration of all the wholesome good our transfer market can achieve, let’s salivate over a little more. Chelsea needed neither Neymar nor Kylian Mbappé to help them dispose of inadequate opposition and Diego Costa was, as is now usual, kept very much at arm’s length too. He could – at long last – agree a £53m return to his previous club, Atlético Madrid, as soon as this week, thus keeping himself away from that scary round white thing for a few more months – until the Spanish side are allowed to make it formal. Proving that the Mill is not cowed by thorny legal ground, we proceed next to the saga of William Carvalho to West Ham, made hilarious in its own right by the sex toy-invoking squabble between the Hammers and his current club, Sporting Lisbon, over whether they ever really made an offer for the Portugal international. Anyone really care? West Ham’s supporters might if, as reports suggest this morning, whoever is managing the team at the time gets his man in January. Both parties will presumably have to kiss and make up over some port and pastel de nata first. Where would you send an injury-afflicted Premier League star who, ravaged by time and not the scintillating prospect he once was, simply wants to play some footy? Fenerbahce, apparently, in the case of Jack Wilshere – who could link up with his old chum Robin van Persie and supply bullets for Vincent Janssen after Christmas, talks having apparently begun. Wilshere has, though, already rejected the overtures of another Turkish side, Trabzonspor. If Wilshere leaves, Arsenal fans might yet be able to console themselves with the continued presence of Mesut Özil, whose contract is ticking down at a fair lick. With serious interest from other big clubs not really materialising, Arsène Wenger is yet to give up hope on the German prolonging his stay. Over to you, Alexis. Barcelona may well get their hands on the Nice playmaker Jean Michael Seri when January kicks in; presumably the Spanish side are suitably contrite after apparently failing to make up their minds between the Ivorian and Philippe Coutinho in the dearly departed summer window. The current Barça crop seem to have spooked Juventus into an attempt to bolster their back line. Tuesday night’s 3-0 win over Juve at the Camp Nou was pretty resounding and perhaps the Italian champions will respond by intensifying their reported interest in the Napoli right-back Elseid Hysaj. Finally, if you were Roy Hodgson would you take the road home to Croydon or seek one final megabucks pay deal in China? The new Crystal Palace manager decided on the former, rejecting two offers from the Chinese Super League in order to get down to brass tacks on the training ground with Damien Delaney."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/13/michael-flynn-promoted-us-russian-nuclear-project-from-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T11:12:20Z","webTitle":"Michael Flynn 'promoted US-Russian nuclear project from White House'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/michael-flynn-promoted-us-russian-nuclear-project-from-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/michael-flynn-promoted-us-russian-nuclear-project-from-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Michael Flynn 'promoted US-Russian nuclear project from White House'","bodyText":"US congressional investigators are examining whether Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, secretly promoted a plan by private business interests to build US-Russian nuclear power plants in the Middle East while he was serving in the White House. The retired three-star general, who once led a chant of “lock her up” against Hillary Clinton at the Republican national convention, has emerged as a central figure in multiple investigations into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Among startling new details unearthed by investigators working for a congressional committee is that the nuclear power plan Flynn was allegedly secretly promoting, during the campaign and once he joined the White House, involved a Russian state-owned company currently under US sanctions. They are also examining whether the proposal is still being promoted by the Trump administration, months after Flynn was forced out of his role. A letter released on Wednesday by top Democrats who are investigating Flynn, who was forced to resign from his post in February because of questions about his links to Russia, accused him of violating federal law when he failed to disclose a trip he took to the Middle East in June 2015 to promote the US-Russia project, as well as several contacts with foreigners that they allege ought to have been declared. The lawmakers said the apparent disclosure violations carried a penalty of five years in prison and that new information they had discovered over the course of their ongoing investigation into the US-Russia project had been provided to Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is leading a federal investigation into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the Kremlin in the 2016 election. Omissions of such meetings and trips could emerge as a powerful tool for federal investigators, who can use the threat of jail and other penalties to persuade subjects who are under investigation to cooperate in exchange for leniency. The congressional letter states that Flynn refused to provide the committee with any explanation of the trip, but did not deny allegations that the Middle East trip and other foreign contacts had been omitted from his security clearance renewal application in 2016, and concealed from investigators who were conducting a background check on him. It said that consulting groups that were allegedly working with Flynn on the project, X-Co Dynamics and ACU Strategic Partners, provided information to the committee and are being asked to provide more documents. There is no suggestion that either company is under investigaiton. The letter also alleges that Thomas Cochran of ACU, who provided the congressional investigators with some information, said that even after Flynn was fired from his post, the proposal the retired general promoted continued to be seen as part of the Trump administration’s diplomatic “toolkit”. Cochran said that he believed it was seen by both the US president and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, as a “valuable private sector mechanism” for stabilising and improving relations with Russia. The joint project was also seen as a way to accelerate US-Russia cooperation in the Middle East. A copy of the letter, which was sent by Democratic congressmen Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel to individuals who allegedly worked with Flynn on the proposal, reveals stunning new allegations about Flynn’s contacts with foreign business associates, all of which were allegedly kept from public view while he was serving as the nation’s chief intelligence official in the White House. At the heart of the investigation lies a proposal that was allegedly developed by Flynn and others before the 2016 election campaign to create a US-Russian partnership that would build and operate nuclear power plants in the Middle East. The committee said it had confirmed from three sources that, as part of this plan, Flynn travelled to Egypt and Israel in June 2015 to promote the project, where he met with government officials. According to Cochran, an official at ACU Strategic Partners, which worked on the project, Flynn made the trip in part to argue that the plan he was proposing would be in Israel’s best interests. The plan called for the creation of an international consortium of US, French, Dutch, Russian, Gulf Arab, British, Ukrainian, and Israeli companies to design and build 40 nuclear power reactors. The plan included a service to maintain control of dangerous spent fuel. One slide provided to the committee said that Rosoboron, a Russian state-owned weapons exporter that is under US sanctions, would provide “total regional security” for the project. Two email chains about the project that were provided to the committee were said to show that Flynn and others were in communication with Omar al-Khaldi, a major general and the chief executive of the design and development bureau of Jordan’s King Abdullah. Lawmakers said they had received no specific information about the identity of foreign government officials that Flynn communicated with before, during, or after his trip. Investigators are also still investigating the names of other Trump campaign officials who allegedly discussed the project with Flynn. The lawmakers said they were seeking all documents and communications from the two consultancy groups who were working on the project that refer to Flynn’s foreign travel and meetings with foreigners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/sep/11/museum-of-miners-art-to-open-as-part-of-bishop-auckland-culture-drive","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T12:12:08Z","webTitle":"Museum of miners' art to open as part of Bishop Auckland culture drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/11/museum-of-miners-art-to-open-as-part-of-bishop-auckland-culture-drive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/11/museum-of-miners-art-to-open-as-part-of-bishop-auckland-culture-drive","fields":{"headline":"Museum of miners' art to open as part of Bishop Auckland culture drive","bodyText":"A unique collection of paintings by Durham miners, many made by men who spent their working lives underground and their nights painting on kitchen tables, in attics or garden sheds, will go on display in the first museum in the UK dedicated to such art. The museum is being created in a former bank building on the marketplace in Bishop Auckland. It includes works by Norman Cornish, the most famous of the group, who left the pits at the urging of his wife to become a full-time artist and spent the rest of his life recording the small streets, shops and people of Spennymoor, where his studio is preserved in an exhibition at the town hall. There are also many works by Tom McGuinness, a miner until he was made redundant in the wave of pit closures in the 1980s, who earned enough money from his art to build a coveted indoor bathroom but then installed a printing press in the space instead. There are several paintings by Bob Olley, still painting at 77, who originally trained as a signwriter before working in a mine where the drift shafts stretched up to three miles under the sea. There is a print of the painting that has paid his bills for years, through copies and reproductions: The Westoe Netty, six men at a heavily graffitied urinal while one cheeky lad turns round to grin as he pees on the leg of his neighbour. When the painting was first exhibited, Olley’s local council tried to have it banned. When a neighbour banged on his door to tell him that the urinal was being demolished, he rushed with friends to salvage it, and it has gone to the Beamish outdoor museum. The collection began when a man came into the Bishop Auckland library and asked the librarian Gillian Wales if he could put something on the noticeboard. “He gave me a bit of paper which I unfolded, expecting to read about a community show or a charity jumble sale – and instead I was astonished to read that he was a painter, and his own work was going into an exhibition in London,” she recalled. The man was Tom McGuinness. Later, in conversation with Bob McManners, a GP in the town, she discovered he was equally fascinated by McGuinness. The pair were so startled by the quality of his work, his knowledge and the seriousness with which he took his vocation – he hitched lifts to evening art classes after shifts and frequently walked miles home afterwards – that they bought a painting each. As they discovered more painters, including Cornish, they bought more and more pictures, began writing about the artists and set up their own imprint to publish the books. Wales and McManners’ collection of more than 400 works, valued at more than £600,000, has been transferred to a new trust, Gemini, and will be permanently displayed in the handsomely converted bank building. The mining art museum is the first in a string of developments in the town and its castle, the former palatial home of the prince bishops, once second in power only to the king. There will be a museum of Spanish art in another former bank on the marketplace, a new building for a museum of faith within the castle walls, a new restaurant within the restored walled gardens, and two derelict hotels brought back to life. All are intended to restore the fortunes of the town and its hinterland by attracting thousands of visitors and generating hundreds of jobs. The first museum opens next month, and the 29-metre viewing tower of a new visitor centre is already rising. The scale of the project is audacious, and the cost equally so: David Maddan, chief executive of the Auckland Castle Trust, said they had secured grants of £11.4m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and a further £10m from other private funders and grants, leaving a gap of around £110m which Jonathan Ruffer, an investment banker, who launched the whole scheme by buying the castle and its contents, proposes to cover himself. “He is very committed to it,” Maddan said, with dry understatement. The mining paintings record working lives and a society in the pit towns that have almost vanished. Olley is delighted they are being collected in a permanent exhibition to keep the memory alive. He doesn’t miss the dirty, dangerous work – a painting by Tom Lamb, Laar Coal, shows his own brother working in a seam barely the width of his shoulders – but he does miss the humour and camaraderie of the workforce. “It won’t take long until all we have left is the paintings,” Olley said. “It’s good that it went, but it went too quickly – in Germany they spent years training the workforce before closure; here they just turned the lights out.” • The Mining Art Gallery will open in Bishops Auckland on 21 October 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/sep/10/renato-sanches-wonderkid-celebrity-swansea-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T09:58:05Z","webTitle":"Renato Sanches, the invisible wonderkid, goes from celebrity to the Liberty | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/10/renato-sanches-wonderkid-celebrity-swansea-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/sep/10/renato-sanches-wonderkid-celebrity-swansea-city","fields":{"headline":"Renato Sanches, the invisible wonderkid, goes from celebrity to the Liberty","bodyText":"Football has always tended to eat its young. Although not, perhaps, with such gleeful, richly rewarded haste as this. The ballad of Renato Sanches, European football’s great invisible wonder kid, is set to enter its latest phase on Sunday afternoon as Swansea City take on Newcastle United in their first game since Sanches joined on loan from the dingiest corners of Bayern Munich’s Säbener Strasse training complex. From obscurity to celebrity to entropy to the Liberty. And all in less than two years. It is now 23 months since Sanches made his first-team debut for Benfica as a thrillingly ragged, thrillingly high-grade 18-year-old from the tough side of Lisbon. The timeline of that career parabola bears repeating. Nine months on from his debut, a previously ailing Benfica won the league, driven on by some extraordinary, bullocking performances that earned Sanches a (then) huge-money transfer to Bayern Munich. In June he scored a brilliant goal in the Euro 2016 quarter-final against Poland, was voted the best young player of the tournament and stood pretty much unchallenged as the most eagerly coveted teenage talent in world football. The same month Lothar Matthäus compared his influence – favourably – to that of Cristiano Ronaldo. Pep Guardiola called Sanches “by far and away one of the best young players in Europe”. In October, 12 months on from his debut, he was voted the Golden Boy of European football. At which point, it seems fair to say you might have got fairly long odds on Sanches preparing less than a year later to make his Swansea debut as a summer replacement for Jack Cork. But then the speed with which Sanches has become cold product is just as striking. Aged 20 he has to date made 42 starts in club football. This season he has seven minutes of proper football to his name, at the tail end of a year that saw him register no goals and no assists for Bayern Munich’s steamrollering Bundesliga champs. At the end of which he will make his debut in English football not for Manchester United, who tried to sign him at least twice, nor for Chelsea or Liverpool, who both had a shot this summer, but for a team who are among the favourites to go down, and who have never paid more than a fifth of his market price for a midfielder. It is a career-fade all the more baffling given the basic nature of Sanches’s talent. This is not some flickering vision of fragile promise, but a player who announced himself as a ruggedly assertive presence, able to shoot, tackle and pass, to work the angles and rhythms of central midfield. And yet a very obvious brittleness remains. In June Sanches played 40 minutes for Portugal Under-21s against Slovakia having not been seen for three months and produced a performance of grippingly amnesiac midfield brilliance, all clumsy, shanked passes, returning touch and at the end the most beautiful pass for Portugal’s second goal. Paul Clement, whose contacts at Bayern helped secure the deal, is well aware of the sensitivity of his situation. “The fact that I have already worked hard to get him here means he can come here with confidence. He’s going to a club that really wanted him and a coach that really wanted him,” Clement said on Friday morning. “I think there will have to be a certain amount of patience we show with him, given what’s happened to him in the last season. But he’s going to be hungry to do really well this season, so that he can perform at a much higher level next season in European football.” All of which does seem some way off for a player who arrived in Swansea on Thursday night and who will have had just two training sessions before the Newcastle game. What is certain is the reassembling of Renato Sanches will take time. And that the question of how good he can be will only begin to be answered when the reality of just how bad he was at Bayern is fully digested. Mark Lovell is the Bayern Munich correspondent for ESPN and watched Sanches close-up last season at the Allianz Arena. “There were too many headless chicken, frenzied running about-type performances,” he says. “Sanches was the worst passer in the Bayern squad last season. He was too keen to impress in his cameos and ended up giving the ball away cheaply, which was really noticeable in the first season after Pep [Guardiola]. I think expectations got the better of him. “If Swansea are more realistic, with the message that he is far from a world-beater aged 20, then he might do quite well. And despite me only pointing out his failings, Bayern haven’t given up on him and want him back next season.” One problem for Sanches was that he spoke no German, just as he speaks no English or Welsh now. Swansea’s Portuguese coach Nelson Jardim will act as translator but the awkwardness of Sanches’s public appearances only emphasises the sense of slight immaturity. Sanches did not want to leave Benfica but the club could hardly refuse the greatest deal in its history: a fee that could rise to €45m for a player who cost €750 plus a promise of 25 footballs for his local club, Aguias. And perhaps one issue with Sanches is that a strength from his development years has become a weakness in the glare of stardom. He is a genuine favela player, a kid from a tough upbringing who played his junior years in local teams rather than in an academy and had to be persuaded to leave Aguias for the lush pastures of Benfica’s training complex across the river Tagus. The simplicity of his style, not to mention his prodigious physical power and stamina, were wonderful assets in that first year and right on into the European Championship, where Sanches kept the ball without fear in the centre of the pitch. That confidence is vital to his game. At his best Sanches loves to take risks, to be bold in his passing, to produce moments that can decide a game. In Portugal, teams took to pressing him with two or three players when he picked up possession, wary of his ability to carry the ball 30 yards or so with startling ease. Sanches, who came from nowhere, and still has not really done much, seemed to be learning on his feet, growing with every game, trajectory set towards the sky. All of which makes his move from Benfica look more destructive, a case of instant gain above all else, stocks being cashed in as the price rose. Benfica were desperate to keep him, with a year in the Champions League to look forward to. The agent Jorge Mendes pushed the move through. At the end of which nobody will ever know where Sanches might have been now had his development not been interrupted. It is a common theme in modern football, the insistence on monetising prodigious ability as soon as it becomes evident. Anthony Martial springs to mind. Time will tell, but Kylian Mbappé certainly seemed to be in just the right place last season. “There are examples of others where it has worked fine,” Clement said. “Rooney to United worked. Ronaldo to United. We are going to try and make sure this one works well. It’s for one year and we have to accelerate it quickly to work. It will certainly be a strange new environment for him, but he’ll play a lot and will suit Swansea’s style of play.” And this really does seem to be the key. Whether in Bavaria, south Wales or north of the Tagus, Renato, the captive prince, just needs to play."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/10/noel-edmonds-says-litigation-funder-will-bankroll-his-300m-battle-with-lloyds","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T15:27:19Z","webTitle":"Noel Edmonds says litigation funder will bankroll his £300m battle with Lloyds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/10/noel-edmonds-says-litigation-funder-will-bankroll-his-300m-battle-with-lloyds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/10/noel-edmonds-says-litigation-funder-will-bankroll-his-300m-battle-with-lloyds","fields":{"headline":"Noel Edmonds says litigation funder will bankroll his £300m battle with Lloyds","bodyText":"Television presenter Noel Edmonds says deep-pocketed investors are willing to bankroll his £300m compensation battle with Lloyds Banking Group. Edmonds’ legal claim stems from the fraud scandal at the bank’s HBOS Reading arm which affected more than 60 small business owners. In July, the former DJ and children’s TV presenter upped his compensation demand from £73m to £300m. “I have a major litigation funder … who has seen my case so [Lloyds] can’t beat me on deep pockets,” Edmonds told the Mail on Sunday. Litigation funders provide financial backing to claimants they believe have a good chance of being awarded damages in a legal dispute. In return, the investors receive a fee or a percentage of any eventual settlement. The sum sought by Edmonds is three times the £100m pot Lloyds has set aside for customers affected by the fraud. The £300m is to cover losses relating to the collapse of the celebrity’s entertainment firm Unique Group a decade ago, as well as the “distress” and “public humiliation” he has suffered. Lloyds had denied there was any wrongdoing at its Reading branch until two of its former employees were convicted of fraud in February. A group of six bankers nicknamed “Britain’s Wolves of Wall Street” were jailed for a combined 47 years and six months for their part in the £245m loans scam which destroyed several businesses. The jury heard the corrupt financiers spent the proceeds of their fraudulent activities on superyachts and sex parties. The scam took place between 2003 and 2007, predating Lloyds’ rescue of HBOS during the financial crisis. Among those convicted was former HBOS banker Mark Dobson, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. Edmonds claims Dobson effectively became a shadow director of Unique. He also claims HBOS prevented him from selling shares in another business, UBC, so that he could repay a loan. Edmonds has led a high-profile campaign against Lloyds, admitting that he came close to taking his own life following the fraud. Two-thirds of the compensation figure is based on his estimate of what Unique could have been worth today, with the remainder to cover the loss of speaking engagements, the fire-sale of assets – including his vintage car collection and image rights – as well as the emotional toll of the episode. He told the Mail on Sunday that “HBOS had robbed me of my marriage, my family, my businesses, my longstanding friend and business partner, my income, my investments, my self-respect, my reputation, my privacy, my physical and mental health. It cost me my security, my image rights, my collection of classic cars – and very nearly my life.” After the fraud trial Lloyds set up a compensation scheme for the 64 victims. The bank says that 29 offers have now been made, and 14 have been accepted so far. In a statement Lloyds said: “Since the end of the HBOS Reading fraud trial, we have been working hard to provide fair, swift and appropriate compensation. But, as we have met and spoken with victims, many have asked us for more time to provide input.” It added: “We are committed to doing everything we can to support those affected … and we are continuing to make good progress in getting offers to the victims of the fraud.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/10/merkel-backs-iran-style-diplomatic-solution-for-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T15:43:50Z","webTitle":"Merkel offers German role in Iran-style nuclear talks with North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/merkel-backs-iran-style-diplomatic-solution-for-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/10/merkel-backs-iran-style-diplomatic-solution-for-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Merkel offers German role in Iran-style nuclear talks with North Korea","bodyText":"Angela Merkel has offered German participation in any future nuclear talks with North Korea and suggested that the 2015 agreement with Iran could serve as a model for negotiations. The chancellor’s intervention reflects growing alarm in Europe that Donald Trump is worsening one nuclear crisis by repeated threats to use military force against North Korea, and seeking to trigger a second one by torpedoing the Iran deal to which Germany, France and the UK are among the signatories. “If our participation in talks is desired, I will immediately say yes,” Merkel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview published on Sunday. She pointed to the example of the agreement sealed in Vienna in July 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the UN security council and Germany, describing it as “a long but important time of diplomacy” that ultimately had a good end. “I could imagine such a format being used to end the North Korea conflict. Europe and especially Germany should be prepared to play a very active part in that,” Merkel said. In exchange for sanctions relief under the Vienna deal, Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme as a reassurance to the international community that it could never build a bomb. North Korea, on the other hand, is believed to already have a nuclear arsenal which it insists is not up for negotiation. Kim Jong-un hosted an elaborate banquet in Pyongyang over the weekend for military leaders, scientists and technicians to celebrate the country’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. The regime says the underground blast on 3 September was a two-stage thermonuclear device, or hydrogen bomb. The state news agency, KCNA, published photographs on Sunday showing Kim beaming with two of the scientific minds behind the country’s surprisingly fast progress - Ri Hong Sop, the head of the country’s nuclear weapons institute, and Hong Sung Mu, the deputy director of the ruling party’s munitions industry department. The UN security council will convene on Monday to consider a US resolution that would impose an embargo on oil exports to North Korea and technical imports from the embattled state, as well as a partial naval blockade giving UN member states the right to board and inspect ships suspected of sanctions-busting. China and Russia are expected to try to water down the resolution, while European council members are nervous that the Trump administration could consequently abandon the council as a forum for dealing with the North Korea crisis if it does not get its way. “I think the Europeans worry about the US going off the deep end,” said Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. European anxiety has already been aroused by Trump’s repeated emphasis on a possible military solution of last resort to contain North Korea, which many analysts fear increases the chance of miscalculation and a preemptive strike by either side. The UK defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, said on Sunday that “the dangers now of miscalculation or some accident triggering a response are extremely great”. North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme must be halted before it developed a ballistic missile capable of hitting London, he said, but a war must be avoided “at all costs”. “The United States is fully entitled to defend its own territory, to defend its bases and look after its people,” he said. “But this involves us. London is closer to North Korea and its missiles than Los Angeles.” Theresa May’s government is concerned about Trump’s stated intention to extricate the US from the Iran deal, which some diplomats worry is motivated principally by his determination to obliterate all aspects of Barack Obama’s legacy more than by material shortcomings in the agreement. British officials see the deal as an important diplomatic achievement but, with Brexit looming, the government is fearful of alienating Trump, on whom it will have to rely for a speedy and favourable bilateral trade deal. Trump has signalled he might not certify Iranian compliance with the deal to Congress in mid-October, when he is due to give his next endorsement. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency earlier this month confirmed that Iran was abiding by the limits set down in the agreement, but the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Trump could withhold certification even if there were no technical violations, by judging the deal no longer to be in the interests of US national security. European leaders will seek to persuade Trump not to abandon or weaken the agreement at the UN general assembly, which Trump is due to address for the first time on 19 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/sep/10/jose-mourinho-mark-hughes-hand-shake-sworn-at-manchester-united-stoke-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T09:14:31Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho refuses Mark Hughes handshake after believing he was sworn at","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/10/jose-mourinho-mark-hughes-hand-shake-sworn-at-manchester-united-stoke-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/sep/10/jose-mourinho-mark-hughes-hand-shake-sworn-at-manchester-united-stoke-city","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho refuses Mark Hughes handshake in belief he was sworn at","bodyText":"José Mourinho refused to shake Mark Hughes’s hand after Manchester United’s 2-2 draw with Stoke City because he believed the Welshman told him to “fuck off” during the game. In the second half at the Bet365 Stadium Mourinho and Hughes clashed and at the close the Portuguese shook hands with some Stoke staff but not their manager. Afterwards Mourinho would not elaborate on whether he had refused to shake, though Hughes was adamant United’s manager did so. However it is understood Mourinho thought he was told to “fuck off” by Hughes when moving near him on the touchline during the match. Mourinho also believed Hughes had told the referee, Neil Swarbrick, to send him to the stands for encroaching into the Stoke technical area. This followed an incident in which Hughes seemed to be upset at a United foul from which his team were awarded a free-kick. The view at United is that Mourinho had wanted to organise his defence for the dead ball and that Hughes shoved him as he moved near. Afterwards Hughes said: “I pushed him because he was in my technical area. Maybe that is why he didn’t want to shake my hand. It has to be viewed as a negative result for him. Sometimes managers of top-six clubs don’t take negative results too kindly. Maybe he reacted in the wrong way.” Mourinho was irritated when asked about the incident. “I don’t speak about stupid things, I’m too old for that, talking about stupid things is for stupid people,” the Portuguese said. “I prefer not to answer the question because your question is a bad question. Because it looks like is my fault, is my problem. And your question is not correct, I am sorry.” Hughes has previously been involved in similar arguments with Tony Pulis (twice), Roberto Mancini, Martin Jol and Arsène Wenger. “In fairness I have my history with handshakes,” he said. “Maybe it’s me. I’m not quite sure I seem to get involved on handshake issues, I offered my hand but José didn’t want to take it from me, maybe he was a bit upset about the result, sometimes these top managers don’t have these results too often and can get upset.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/sep/10/rainbow-connection-tens-of-thousands-say-i-do-to-marriage-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T06:47:36Z","webTitle":"Rainbow connection: tens of thousands say 'I do' to marriage equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/10/rainbow-connection-tens-of-thousands-say-i-do-to-marriage-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/sep/10/rainbow-connection-tens-of-thousands-say-i-do-to-marriage-equality","fields":{"headline":"Rainbow connection: tens of thousands say 'I do' to marriage equality","bodyText":"Sydney’s rally in support of same-sex marriage was the largest demonstration in favour of marriage equality the country has ever seen, with organisers saying more than 30,000 people attended. Crowds spilled out of Town Hall Square in central Sydney, out across George Street and made exiting Town Hall station difficult for a time. The atmosphere at the rally was one of celebration, despite the seriousness of the subject and the pain and anger being expressed by some of the speakers and attendees. Before the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and the deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, took to the podium, the audience was wowed by Tim Blackman, a young Indigenous teacher from a school in Mount Druitt. “We are here to say the message of equality and acceptance is centred around a very simple, very easy 13-letter word: ‘yaaaaaaaaaaas’,” he said to laughter and applause from the audience. As a member of the NSW Teachers Federation, he said thousands of teachers around the country were fighting for the rights of their LGBTI+ students – “your right to be who you are, your right to attend a safe school and your right to be fabulous”. Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, spoke of union branches opening their doors to marriage equality campaigners to run phone campaigns and of unionised tradies covering over homophobic graffiti with rainbows. “We do this because our hearts beat with equality,” McManus said. “It’s what we believe in. We believe in a simple thing – an injury to one of us is an injury to all of us. When one part of our human family hurts, when one part of our human family is not equal it diminishes every single one of us.” Before the speeches began, the Sydney Gay And Lesbian Choir entertained the waiting crowds with songs about marriage. During the speeches, the crowd appeared determined but jovial, with serious points interspersed with jokes, and throughout the speeches a large rainbow beach ball bounced around the audience. Michelle D’Croix and Tammy Ward attended the rally with Michelle’s dog, Guapa. “My best friend, who is a gay male, has two children with a female couple and they’re marching today – I think their parents should be recognised,” Ward said. She said she was attending also for the “good atmosphere” and for people to “gain awareness that you don’t have to be gay to be marching today”. “There’s enough hate – just be nice to people,” Ward said. Paige Murphy, 24, and Benjamin Derome, 25, attended the rally together, both saying they were there to “support friends and community”. “It is quite overwhelming – a great turnout,” Murphy said. She said she was worried that not all marriage equality supporters would return their survey forms. “I think with a lot of young people we need to encourage everyone to send their votes back. Because it’s not a compulsory vote, not everyone might send their vote back and get a say at all.” How to contribute You can share your marriage equality images and videos by clicking on the blue “contribute” button on this article.

He keeps hiring the worst. Nasa is next","bodyText":"According to 2016 election exit polls, only 38% of voters considered Donald Trump qualified to be president. 17% of those who thought him unqualified voted for Trump anyway, perhaps because he promised that as a wealthy businessman, he would be able to hire the best people to advise him. That was a claim his daughter Ivanka explicitly made in her speech at the Republican National Convention: Unfortunately, Trump has not lived up to this promise. In many cases he’s hired some of the worst people imaginable. Who worse to lead the EPA than a man whose primary qualification is having sued the agency 14 times on behalf of polluting industries? Who worse to lead the Midwestern states EPA than a woman who the EPA cited for failure to control air pollution in Wisconsin and who deleted all mention of human-caused climate change from her department website? Who worse to lead the Department of Energy than a man who wanted to eliminate the department (until he forgot - oops)? Who worse to be the Department of Agriculture’s chief scientist than a right-wing birther radio host with no scientific background? And these are only the administration officials in positions related to energy and the environment. There are of course exceptions where Trump nominated people who are at least qualified for the job, but in many cases it’s hard to imagine worse choices. And now we can add Trump’s selection to lead Nasa to the list - Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma. Bridenstine is a climate denier Scientists and astronauts are usually chosen to lead Nasa, for obvious reasons. Bridenstine is neither – he’s a member of Congress (and would be the first politician ever to lead Nasa), formerly executive director of the Tulsa Air and Space Museum and Planetarium and a Navy Reserve pilot. He reeled off this string of climate denial myths on the House floor in 2013: global temperatures stopped rising 10 years ago. Global temperature changes, when they exist, correlate with Sun output and ocean cycles. During the Medieval Warm Period from 800 to 1300 A.D.—long before cars, power plants, or the Industrial Revolution—temperatures were warmer than today. The first myth looks particularly bad in retrospect, with 2014, 2015, and 2016 each breaking the record for hottest global temperatures. But even at the time it was a baseless claim. While the rise in global surface temperatures did temporarily slow up to around 2013, global warming never stopped. More heat was stored in the oceans and other factors also acted to temporarily slow the rise in surface temperatures, but as long as we keep pumping carbon pollution into the atmosphere, the long-term global warming trend will continue. Over the past 50 years, global surface temperatures and solar output are negatively correlated, meaning they’re going in opposite directions. While global temperatures have risen rapidly, solar activity has slightly declined. Ocean cycles are just that – cycles. They go up and down and have no long-term trend, unlike global temperatures. And global temperatures are now significantly hotter than during the Medieval Warm Period, and rising fast. As is the case for most politicians who mangle climate science to this degree, Bridenstein’s denial appears rooted in opposition to policy solutions. In a 2016 interview, he argued that climate policies will damage the American economy, and in 2013 he criticized the Obama administration for spending too much on climate science research. Those comments, and Bridenstine’s beliefs about Nasa’s mission, may very well be the reason Trump nominated Bridenstein to lead the agency. Bridenstine and GOP don’t want Nasa doing climate research Nasa does some of the best climate research in the world. For example, Nasa scientists published a 2010 paper in Science showing that carbon dioxide is the principle control knob governing Earth’s temperatures, which directly contradicts recent assertions by members Trump administration who have claimed otherwise. But Republicans have decided that they don’t want Nasa doing climate research. For example Trump’s proposed budget would terminate four Nasa Earth science missions as part of a $102 million cut to the agency’s Earth science program. His space policy advisor suggested eliminating Nasa’s climate and Earth science research altogether. Republicans in Congress have been trying to slash Nasa’s Earth science budget for years. Some Republican policymakers have suggested that the agency’s climate resesarch could be absorbed into Noaa, because they want Nasa focused on space. The problem is that aside from the needless difficulty of shifting scientists and their research from one government agency to another, these policymakers aren’t proposing to increase Noaa’s budget to pay for that climate research. Quite the opposite – Trump’s proposed budget would also cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Noaa’s research funding. Currently, Nasa’s institutional objectives include “The expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.” In Congress, Bridenstine introduced legislation that would change that objective to “The expansion of the human sphere of influence throughout the Solar System.” Like his fellow Republicans, Bridenstine wants to shift Nasa away from its world-class scientific research toward space exploration. “Best” is subjective, but Trump’s picks are terrible for science Of course, what’s “best” is a subjective determination. If your goal is to eliminate government regulations – particularly those that protect public and environmental health and scientific research – then the Trump administration might indeed be considered the best. If you care more about industry profits than our health and the well-being of our children and grandchildren, then you might think Trump has hired some excellent people. But if you care about our health and future welfare, or about the scientific community’s ability to keep studying the dangers posed by human-caused climate change, then it’s hard to imagine worse choices than Trump’s (anti-)environmental team. To a man and woman they seem interested in little more than maximizing short-term profits of polluting industries to society’s long-term detriment.

Irma severed links with the outside world and left thousands of tourists and local people desperate to escape after it pounded islands along the north-eastern edge of the Caribbean. However, the islands were spared another battering on Saturday when Hurricane Jose had “markedly less” impact than first feared. Irma wrought extensive damage after it hit the isolated islands of St Barts, St Martin, Anguilla and the British and the Virgin Islands group, leaving 22 people dead. “We are all safe but in a state of shock,” said Natalie Drury, a resident of the British Virgin Islands. “We desperately need help as soon as possible. Food, water, shelter. I’m extremely concerned about health and safety – there is sewage absolutely everywhere.” Drury, who lives who lives with her husband on Tortola, the biggest and most populous of the British Virgin Islands, told the Guardian she was in a “state of disbelief” about the destruction she has witnessed. “I can’t believe my eyes. I can’t even begin to describe the utter devastation around. It feels like nothing is left,” she said, adding that only concrete buildings, some of them badly damaged, were still standing. “It’s worse than anyone could have imagined. The country is going to need some serious help. I have no idea how many people have died. We were told yesterday it’s gone up to 10, but obviously that’s all rumours. Nobody knows yet.” The house in which Drury and her husband have sought shelter has no phone or Wi-Fi connections. The couple were hoping to return to their home, which they had not seen since Irma hit the island, and check on their neighbours. “We will grab anything of any value as looting has already begun,” Drury said. “The town has been emptied, every shop has been looted.” She and her husband are staying in another house that has become a place of refuge for several people who have lost everything. “We now have 11 people, one baby and seven dogs,” Drury said. The pleas for relief came amid criticism of the British government’s response to the disaster. On Saturday, the foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, announced a package of £42m ($55m) for the relief effort in the British territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks &amp; Caicos. “The UK government is doing everything it possibly can to help those affected by the hurricane,” Johnson said. About 500 British troops have been sent to the area of the Caribbean hit by Irma, with the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, saying that the relief operation was “well under way”. Marines, engineers, medics and specialists, including army and RAF personnel have been deployed in the region. The area endured more high winds on Saturday as Jose, a category 4 storm, passed through, closing airports and halting emergency relief efforts by boat. However, France’s meteorological agency said on Sunday that Jose had “markedly less” of an impact on the French islands of St Martin and St Barts than anticipated. The agency had issued its highest warning, saying the Category Four Hurricane Jose could become a “dangerous event of exceptional intensity”. But “there’s not a cloud in the sky”, one AFP reporter at the scene said. “Thanks to a passage which was further away than anticipated, the effects on the territory were markedly less,” the meteorological agency said. The US national hurricane centre had warned on Saturday that Jose was nearing category five strength – the highest rating for a storm – bringing fears of more destruction for islands in the eastern Caribbean such as Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla days after they had taken the full brunt of Irma. But the forecasters said on Sunday that Joe was “gradually weakening” as it moved away from the northern Leeward Islands. The government of Antigua discontinued the tropical storm warning for Barbuda and Anguilla."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/10/whiff-of-discontent-as-china-bans-imports-of-soft-european-cheese","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T05:05:11Z","webTitle":"Whiff of discontent as China bans imports of soft European cheese","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/whiff-of-discontent-as-china-bans-imports-of-soft-european-cheese","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/10/whiff-of-discontent-as-china-bans-imports-of-soft-european-cheese","fields":{"headline":"Whiff of discontent as China bans imports of soft European cheese","bodyText":"Soft European cheese has fallen on hard times in China. Customs officials have banned a host of soft, mould-ripened cheese for containing “too much bacteria”, with authorities reportedly alarmed the mould contained colonies of bacteria that had not been officially approved. The ban mainly affects French and Italian cheese, including brie, camembert, gorgonzola and roquefort, as well as the English delicacy stilton. Sinodis, a distributor of foreign-based cheeses in Shanghai, sent a letter to customers announcing “cheese products containing certain moulds cannot temporarily be imported in China”. The company has stopped importing a laundry list of nearly 50 kinds of cheese since 23 August. The ban started in July in some cities, but was expanded nationwide this week. “There is no good reason for the ban, because China considers the same cheese safe if produced in China,” William Fingleton, a spokesman for the delegation of the European Union to China, said in an email. “This effectively means that China is banning famous and traditional European cheeses that have been safely imported and consumed in China for decades. The entire Chinese market for soft cheeses is now closed.” China imported more than £300m of cheese last year, according to customs data, but the statistics do not specify which varieties made up the bulk of that. Most of the strong, pungent cheeses affected by the ban are unpopular with Chinese people and are mostly consumed by foreign residents. The news sent expats scrambling to buy cheese from remaining stocks. Online cheese shop Cheese Republic said in statement confirming the ban: “In my opinion: no bacteria = fake cheese.” Chinese health regulations permit only a few types of bacteria in dairy products, but there is an exemption for “cultures that are traditionally used for food production”. That exemption does not apply to imported goods, but it is not clear what made authorities crackdown on cheese now. Hard cheese such as cheddar, comté, gruyère and manchego are unaffected by the new rules, but the arbitrary nature of the ban on soft cheese has European officials worried. “The European cheese industry is extremely concerned by this ban,” Fingleton said. “We are concerned that potentially many other types of cheeses may be affected in the future in the same way.” There are currently tonnes of cheese being wasted because it cannot clear customs, Fingleton said. Cheese industry representatives have asked the government for clarification, but have not received any clear answer, he said. The EU is currently surveying member states before it lobbies China to update regulations covering cheese. China previously banned British cheese in 2014 when the food standards agency complained about hygiene standards at an unnamed dairy, but later lifted the prohibition. Italian mozzarella faced a similar ban in 2008 when the government ordered a recall, believing some products contained carcinogens. China’s food safety watchdog, the general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine, and the county’s customs department did not respond to requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/14/brexit-last-thing-needed-lot-on-plate-young-people","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"We had a lot on our plate already: Brexit was the last thing we needed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/14/brexit-last-thing-needed-lot-on-plate-young-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/14/brexit-last-thing-needed-lot-on-plate-young-people","fields":{"headline":"We had a lot on our plate already: Brexit was the last thing we needed","bodyText":"One of the many annoying aspects of the Brexit referendum fiasco is that it has diverted attention from so many pressing domestic economic and social problems. Yet those of us who are unrepentant Remainers still regard the struggle as worthwhile. Brexiters may argue that the prospect of short-term economic damage was exaggerated during the campaign, and, as I acknowledged in a recent column, it was. But that this is a case of “so far, not so bad” is beside the point. The damage will hit us if we go ahead with leaving our largest market and indulge the extreme Brexiters’ fantasy of contriving wonderful new markets in far less important countries from the trading point of view – markets, that, strangely enough, already exist. A point made by a number of us to older Brexiters was, and still is, that they were not being too mindful of the interests of their children and grandchildren, who have grown up with the freedom to travel, work and study throughout the European Union and now see all this threatened. But it is becoming more and more obvious that the younger generation are threatened not only by the prospect of Brexit – and I repeat, to the BBC and others: it hasn’t happened yet! – but by an accumulation of economic problems, epitomised by the depleted condition of so many public services. And not only the younger generation. It seems to be widely accepted that the referendum result was to a considerable extent a protest vote against the economic and social problems – housing, the health service, social care, transport, you name it – that have resulted from neglect by successive governments, and were undoubtedly aggravated by the banking crisis and post-crisis austerity. Now, among my older friends who are concerned about the state of the nation now, and the prospects for young and old alike, is the Cambridge economist Robert Neild, who, at the age of 93, is as sharp as ever. Robert was chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the 1960s – repeat, the 1960s – and has seen a thing or two. In a recent paper he has argued forcefully that many of this country’s problems with public services stem from the simple fact that those services are woefully underfunded. Thus the “tax take” in this country amounts to 35% of gross domestic product, whereas the average in the European Union I still hope we won’t leave is 40%. He points out that, since public spending amounts to a third of GDP, an increase in the tax take here to the European average would finance a 14% increase in public spending, and provide the wherewithal to answer all those critics whose standard response to any suggestion of higher public spending is “where is the money coming from?”. At which point I cannot resist noting that a prominent Conservative Brexiter once admitted to me that he particularly likes France because of the health service. Which brings us to the present outcries about the state of the NHS. This is, as usual, against the background of the prevailing view in this country that we should have Scandinavian levels of public service while enjoying US levels of taxation – or, in the extreme rightwing Brexiters’ case, Singaporean levels of taxation. The scale of the resistance to “tax and spend” in Britain was manifested when Gordon Brown, as chancellor, made Herculean efforts to prepare the nation for a 1% increase in employer and employee national insurance contributions in an effort to bring the health service up to continental standards. Evidently, there is some way to go. More and more people, such as the admirable anti-Brexit campaigner Lord Adonis, are evoking the spirit of the Attlee postwar government to address the current crisis. It is a formidable task – as indeed it was for Attlee, who met dreadful opposition at the time, even though he has been sanctified by modern historians. When it comes to the rightwing press, there is nothing new under the sun. The current social crisis and prospect would be less daunting if Brexit were not piled on top of it. In which context I could hardly believe my ears last week when Chancellor Hammond was quoted as telling our fellow Europeans that it made no sense to put in place “unnecessary barriers” to British demands. All the “unnecessary barriers” have been put in place by Britain’s bizarre decision to leave the EU. There is also a prevailing view that the government is involved in some kind of “negotiation”. I fear that this constitutes a gross misunderstanding of the situation. When, after realising that membership of the European Free Trade Area was unsatisfactory, successive British governments applied for, and eventually succeeded in obtaining, membership of what is now the European Union, we had to negotiate terms of membership. Now, if this narrow and ill-informed referendum decision is not reversed, we have to leave the club. When you leave a club, there is nothing to negotiate: you pay what you owe and you leave. Better to Remain! Moreover, it is not as if our European counterparts did not have enough on their plates already. Our fellow Europeans can be forgiven for asking what planet the British think they are on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/16/five-mind-body-and-soul-festivals-for-2018-yoga-spa-music","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Five fantastic mind, body and soul festivals for 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/16/five-mind-body-and-soul-festivals-for-2018-yoga-spa-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/16/five-mind-body-and-soul-festivals-for-2018-yoga-spa-music","fields":{"headline":"Five fantastic mind, body and soul festivals for 2018","bodyText":"Soul Circus, Cotswolds Launched last year, Soul Circus offers a programme of yoga and pilates, plus live music, DJs, healthy food supplied by local farmers and thought-provoking talks.

Formal etiquette is, thankfully, history. But in this newly democratic realm there are still ways we can behave for the good not just of our fellow diners, but also restaurant staff and the venues we love. In the past few months, I’ve noticed chefs on social media making pleas for drunk patrons not to grope staff, and taking rude customers to task. So, to prevent that kind of thing and more from happening, here are the new rules of dining. No-show no-no With restaurants facing their toughest trading conditions since 2008, no-show bookings that leave tables empty is a hot topic. “We’d easily get eight in a 60-cover service at Sticky Walnut [in Chester] and that can absolutely be the difference between making money and not,” says owner Gary Usher. Staff would phone absent customers who, if they picked up at all, would be rude or blase. OpenTable suspends user accounts after four no-shows in 12 months. But unless you are a swine who books several tables across town and idly chooses one at the last minute, it should never come to that. If you need to cancel, simply let the restaurant know as early as possible, so it can refill that table. Accept also that, increasingly, restaurants will demand your credit card details when booking and charge you if you no-show without explanation. It is not personal. It is survival. Usher’s restaurant now holds card details to secure bookings during popular services: “I was nervous. We’re not a destination. But it’s a deterrent. The no-shows stopped immediately.” Dietary requirements You may see mouthy chefs on social media moaning about vegans, but many modern restaurants will accommodate not just allergies, but a spectrum of ethical, medical and lifestyle dietary requirements – biting their tongues where necessary. “Avoiding gluten through dinner then treating yourself to a brownie happens a lot. It drives chefs to distraction but it shouldn’t matter. Many people consider it acceptable,” says Ben Wright, co-owner of the north-west’s Joseph Benjamin and Porta restaurants. “We do everything we can. We recently had someone in with a white-food-only diet.” But the onus is on diners to communicate their requests early and clearly when booking. Chefs cannot rework dishes mid-service. “We’re not mind-readers,” says Vicky Roberts, manager at York’s Le Cochon Aveugle. “We serve a blind tasting menu so we’re hot on checking dietary requirements. It’s amazing how many ‘vegetarians’ eat chicken and fish.” Group booking When tasked with a group-booking, play nice. Do not book somewhere inconsiderately pricey (real friends discuss a ballpark spend-per-head beforehand), at a contentious time slot or as part of some passive-aggressive power play. This is not an opportunity to challenge your parents’ provincial tastes. Being a finicky foodie does not give you licence to drag noncommittal friends to that new Szechuan offal place. Ultimately, friendship should trump food quality. Be considerate: compromise. Queue here Most points of conflict (queue jumping, people placeholding for five mates etc) have melted away. The voguish London restaurants that attract them – Kiln, Pastaio, Hoppers – now generally use virtual waiting lists and text callbacks to manage their queues, so you can wait in a pub not in the rain. Yet in this fast-casual sphere, diners need to learn to vacate tables promptly. Is there any greater frustration than being kettled in a tiny bar/holding pen as you wait for a table, watching people take an eternity to finish their drinks, get their coats on and leave? Sling yer hook. Communal living From street food markets to hip cafes, we increasingly find ourselves sharing – or begrudgingly, not – communal tables. This horrific trend necessitates some basic rules. Do not spread your bags, coats and laptops everywhere. Sit in a way that uses space efficiently. Do not claim seats for people who are not there yet. This is first come, first served, fast-turnover seating. Pass the time and the salt, be civil, but do not pursue conversation. People are here to enjoy their precious free time, not (ye gods!) make pottering small-talk with strangers. Child care In restaurants, children should be seated and not heard. Break out the tablets (electronic ones, not tranquilisers). Staff and other diners are not obliged to entertain, indulge or corral your children back to the table. In adult restaurants, do not get huffy because the kitchen declines to make child-friendly tweaks to dishes/add chips/nip out to Tesco for a pizza. Want to prioritise your kids? Take them somewhere family-friendly. Staff relations The base level of dining competency is, obviously, to treat waiting staff like equals who are providing a professional service. Say please, say thank you. Accept interruptions gracefully. Ask questions about the food, but do not quiz staff about their accents, background, hair, tattoos, personal life or anything else that might make them feel uncomfortable. Do not make dumb jokes at their expense. At its most rewarding this is a joint performance. Smile, even if you don’t feel like it. Do not project your bad mood. Pretend, as waiters have to. Tip: if you really want to enjoy that expensive tasting menu, engage in the rhythm of service and stop taking toilet/fag breaks just as the next course arrives. Addendum: don’t touch the staff In 2018, you might assume it is a given that customers must not pet, grope or manhandle waiters. But having browsed Twitter and seen chefs such as Stevie Parle reminding diners to “Keep your hands to yourself” – and Guinea Grill landlord Oisin Rogers proudly relaying his team’s zero tolerance approach: “She told him she would cut his arm off if he touched her again” – it needs reiterating: DO NOT TOUCH THE STAFF. Sharing and sharing alike “Small plates designed for sharing,” reads the menu, often erroneously (try splitting three croquetas between four or evenly dividing a burrata salad). Plus, who wants to only get a few forkfuls of the dish they really fancied? No. To guarantee small-plate satisfaction, we need rules. Namely that everyone gets a first pick of at least one dish – to eat or share as they see fit – then a further two loosely negotiated sharing dishes “for the table”. Quiet zone Phones in restaurants? A non-issue. Egotistical chefs dislike diners photographing dishes (they crave reverent diners and loathe blurry online shots of their work), but other guests? Unconcerned. Even people preening for at-table selfies is more ludicrous than intrusive. In 2018 does anyone really take offence at someone briefly texting, tweeting or answering an email at lunch? No. Gastrospods Are you droning on about the provenance of the heritage tomatoes again? Is everyone glazing-over? Please desist, foodies. You chose a good restaurant. Well done. Now where is that wine waiter? Cakeage Restaurants exist to sell you things, like dessert. If you want to bring your own birthday cake to eat, you cannot moan about “cakeage” (corkage charge for cakes). As an alternative, the Sticky Walnut staff will present your cake so you can blow the candles out, but you cannot eat it. “People would bring Sainsbury’s frangipane tarts in. I make frangipane tart. And birthday cakes. Why would I let you eat that here?” asks Gary Usher. Not so private party Cakeage arises because large parties (balloons, party poppers, top-volume bantz with other tables) have a tendency to treat restaurants like home. If you want to take over, book a private dining room. Otherwise, consider the comfort of fellow diners. “I had to ask one group to leave when their excess noise deteriorated to singing Another One Bites the Dust and clapping-out traumatised neighbouring diners,” says Ben Wright. Complaints procedure The British are notoriously bad at complaining face-to-face (hence the rise of the cowardly keyboard warrior). We do not complain often and when we do we can really lose it. “Nervous people don’t always become shy; some get blunt and aggressive,” says Wright. We need to learn how to complain confidently. Rather than emailing later (“Emails are easily misinterpreted,” says Roberts), complain in person and promptly. “I’ve shouted ‘thief!’ down the street at a woman who refused to pay for the soup that she ate every spoonful of, but ‘didn’t like’,” says Wright. Where possible, stick to objective facts: this dish is salty/burned/cold. Not liking something is opinion. Likewise, arguing a dish is inauthentic could run and run. Pulling out the pompous but-I-holiday-in-Sicily-every-year card proves nothing. Keep calm, be clear and do not demand a freebie. Restaurateurs want to resolve issues and make sure you leave happy, but they have procedures. Transparent blagging rankles. Wright: “Freebie-hunters are rarer in indie places but staff in chains robotically apologise and give away free stuff, perpetuating the issue.” As for threatening a restaurant with a one-star TripAdvisor review, don’t. At best, it sounds petty and self-important, at worst like blackmail. Tipping point After recent scandals about restaurants deducting charges from card tips, diners began to ask if staff would prefer cash. Laudable. Until you discover that, for example, some waiters are disingenuously asking for their 10-20% in cash in order to avoid pooling it – despite that being the (arguably, fairer) system that the staff voted for. “I’ve given up asking,” says exasperated Restaurant magazine editor, Stefan Chomka. “I always tip cash explicitly for the person serving me but if it’s shared out, fine. I don’t want to start trying to understand the machinations of a business every time I eat out.” Tip generously in cash, but the sooner others follow Camber’s Gallivant hotel (prices and wages raised, all staff are on above Living Wage Foundation rates, tips are discouraged), the better. Paying up Splitting the bill evenly is the only way to pay without rancour or tediously itemising every drink and side. Occasionally you will pay more, but it evens out over time. Happily swallowing that discrepancy confirms to friends and family that, actually, their companionship is of greater value to you than what you ate. If it is not (if you are skint, on a diet, teetotal and resent subsidising your boozy mates etc), decline the invitation. Better that than everyone else dreading the moment when you start quibbling sourly about the bill. There are exceptions: perhaps there’s a designated driver at the table and you have all hammered the wine. Someone has brought four kids along and you only have one. But, even then, any discount should be offered by the drinkers or parents. Demanding it strikes a jarring, selfish tone. Above all, do not ask the staff to split the bill for you. They are busy. Use the calculator on your phone. Pay up, tip well. Goodnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/12/philip-dunne-nhs-remarks-face-constituents","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T13:51:11Z","webTitle":"Philip Dunne, sacked after his NHS remarks, must now face his constituents | Tess Finch-Lees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/philip-dunne-nhs-remarks-face-constituents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/philip-dunne-nhs-remarks-face-constituents","fields":{"headline":"Philip Dunne, sacked after his NHS remarks, must now face his constituents","bodyText":"The sacked health minister Philip Dunne was booed and heckled at a local meeting recently, for hiding behind his ministerial role as a pretext for abandoning constituents (of whom I’m one) to the ravages of NHS cuts. His callous comments on Monday, undermining the NHS beds crisis by suggesting sick patients can sit on seats in A&amp;E, came as no surprise to me. The irony is that, while Dunne boasted about the abundance of seats (beds are so 1970s) in his own constituency, on Christmas Eve, there weren’t even any seats available in A&amp;E. Patients waiting had to sit on the floor and staff had to step over them. Stripped of his ministerial mantle, Dunne must now return to face the problems in his own backyard. In Dunne’s consituency, Ludlow, a pensioner had to threaten hunger strike to get a bed in a local community hospital and women are afraid to have babies because the maternity unit shuts for prolonged periods of time. Babies are dying avoidable deaths in this affluent county. Last year, Jeremy Hunt ordered a review of a cluster of baby deaths. At least seven babies’ deaths between September 2014 and May 2016 have already been ruled avoidable. The tragic, heartbreaking loss of little lives before they’ve even begun. The parents of some of those babies have told me they despair that cuts to maternity services means lessons are not being learned and more babies could die unnecessarily as a result. If a pensioner has a fall on the streets of Ludlow, it is not unusual to wait more than an hour for an ambulance, whatever the weather. Then it’s another hour to A&amp;E. Assuming you’re still alive, there may (or may not) be a chair for you to sit on. Worst-case scenario, you’re dead on arrival, in which case, you’ll be taken directly to the onsite mortuary which has benefited from a £1.4m investment. This should have coincided with the axing of one of the county’s A&amp;E units. In considering their “pathways of care” it seems health bosses deemed the one that leads to the mortuary cheaper than that of saving lives. They tried to play us off against each other: “Choose one or the other.” We united as a community, across political and geographical boundaries and replied: “Both.” If both A&amp;Es are already drowning and unable to cope, how can removing one be safe? Not once in our five-year battle has Dunne joined us on our marches. Not once has he intervened on our behalf to seek the funds required to deliver healthcare safely in one of the most rural and worst-funded counties in the country. A local woman had to wait six months to see a neurologist, despite suffering blackouts, acute migraine and projectile vomiting. She protested but was told the NHS consultant was only taking on private patients for at least six months. She saw no point in asking Dunne for help because, “his allegiances are with his party and not his constituents”. When our NHS is described by the Red Cross as a “humanitarian crisis”, and NHS doctors take to social media daily to beg for help, alarm bells should ring. The facts speak for themselves. We can’t trust the Tories with the NHS. They reneged on their 2010 manifesto promises not to subject beleaguered NHS staff to any more top-down reorganisations. Instead they instigated the biggest reorganisation in NHS history via the Health and Social Care Act. This compels tendering for contracts, £16bn of which have been awarded to private contractors, such as Virgin Care, since 2013. Hunt held on to his position because he has not yet finished the job, which according to a book he co-authored, indicates “denationalising the provision of health care in Britain” (Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party, p78). Accountable Care Organisations are integral to that plan. This American model restricts access to hospitals (because it’s expensive) prioritising care in the community instead. As a therapist, I remember the same promises being made in relation to mental health 20 years ago. In reality, the hospitals were shut but the money never found its way into the community. The NHS is now picking up the pieces of this catastrophic policy. Since my child was nursed back to health by NHS heroes after being seriously injured in a car crash a few years ago, I’ve been involved in NHS campaign work. I’ve seen ordinary people mobilising in communities throughout the country, valiantly holding the front line. But the attacks are coming thicker and faster and we’re losing ground now at a rapid rate. Without help from our MPs and the media, nationally and locally, 2018 will be the year the NHS flatlines. Pretty soon there’ll be nothing left to salvage from the wreckage. • Tess Finch-Lees is a human rights journalist and broadcaster and has worked as a therapist in the NHS"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/19/chainsaw-juggling-human-cannonballs-and-coco-the-clown-the-astounding-250-year-story-of-circus","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Chainsaw juggling, human cannonballs and Coco the Clown!

The astounding 250-year story of circus","bodyText":"1. Roll up for the riding school In 1768, Philip Astley, a former cavalry officer, opens an equestrian school in London, close to the site that is now Waterloo station, giving riding lessons in the morning and performing trick riding stunts in the afternoon. Performances take place in a circular ring but it’s not called a circus. Within two years, acrobats and clowning are part of the mix. 2. Tightropes and tumbling The first structure to be called a circus was the Royal Circus, built in 1782 by Astley’s protege and rival, Charles Hughes, close to what is now St George’s Circus in south London. Feats on show included horsemanship, tightrope walking, trampoline and tumbling acts. A decade later, Hughes took circus to the court of Catherine the Great in Russia, and one of his pupils, the Scotsman John Bill Ricketts, opened the US’s first circus in 1793, with President George Washington as one of the early attendees. 3. The tent goes up Joshua Purdy Brown erects the first circus tent in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1825. It was a year before the first circular tent – which, together with the sawdust ring, became so associated with travelling circuses in Europe and America. The tent was one of the most important features in allowing circus to develop, reach new audiences and perform in all weathers. Prior to that, it was performed outside or in roofless canvas structures. In 1840, Thomas Cooke brought the circus tent to the UK. 4. The fantastic Fanque Pablo Fanque, born William Derby in 1810, was the first black circus proprietor, touring the north of England in the mid-19th century. He performed equestrian stunts for Queen Victoria and hundreds turned out for his funeral in 1871. He was immortalised in John Lennon’s 1967 song for the Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album, entitled Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite. 5. Swinging with Jules Jules Léotard gives the first public performance of an aerial trapeze act in 1859, which he developed by hanging swings above his father’s swimming pool in Toulouse. The water broke his frequent falls during training. During public performances, he had to make do with mattresses or no protection at all – as when he flew above the heads of diners at the Alhambra in London on Whit Monday in 1861 – because the safety net was not invented until 1871. Léotard also gave his name to the one-piece costume, and inspired the music-hall ditty The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze. 6. Cannonball!Fourteen-year-old Rossa Matilda Richter, who performed under the stage name Zazel, was the first recorded person to be launched out of a spring-style cannon. It launched her 20ft before she landed in a net in a performance at the Royal Aquarium in 1877. American showman PT Barnum had travelled to London to see the performance – and he booked Richter and her act. She continued to perform it for another 14 years, until her career was ended when she was shot from a cannon in New Mexico, the net failed and she broke her back. 7. Greatest Show on Earth PT Barnum, the man who is supposed to have declared “every crowd has a silver lining”, had already found success with a sideshow in New York when, in 1881, he formed a partnership with James Anthony Bailey to found Barnum and Bailey Circus, otherwise known as “the Greatest Show on Earth”. The Ringling Brothers soon began their rival touring circus, eventually buying out Barnum and Bailey in 1907. In the UK, Bertram Mills and Billy Smart were major players in the touring circus business. 8. All in the air Juggling dates back to ancient Rome, where it was performed alongside chariot races and staged battle entertainments. Born into a circus family in 1896, the juggler Enrico Rastelli was an early-20th-century circus superstar, commanding impressive fees for manipulating objects. Over the last 20 years, juggling has developed not just technically but also aesthetically, with companies such as Gandini Juggling and Compagnie Jérôme Thomas creating shows that play with form and emotion. The Gandinis’ Pina Bausch-inspired 2010 show Smashed was a game-changer. 9. Coco the Clown is born Love them or hate them, clowns – descendants of the jester figure, dating back to ancient times – are an integral part of the circus experience. Clowns entertained audiences at Philip Astley’s equestrian shows and are a feature of most traditional circuses, though less prevalent in contemporary circus. In the UK, the most notable were Coco the Clown, who was born Nicolai Poliakoff in 1900 in Latvia, and was a staple with the Bertram Mills Circus, and Charlie Cairoli, who performed at Blackpool Tower Circus every summer from 1939 to 1979. 10. Railroad revolution The advent of railways in the 1830s had a huge influence on circus: now companies could travel widely with ease. PT Barnum had a train to transport 1,000 staff, 30 elephants and a big top. The Ringling Brothers, meanwhile, had their own specially designed 60-car trains. Without the railways, circus would never have become such a popular entertainment in the US. One of the worst rail disasters there took place in 1918 in Indiana, when a locomotive ploughed into a circus train, killing more than 80 people from the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, the country’s second-largest troupe at its height. 11. Soviet and Chinese circus boom State-sponsored circus was developed in the USSR and China. (Chinese acrobatic tradition dates back more than 2,000 years.) Lenin nationalised all circus in 1919 and set up state circus schools, and the Chinese industry received a boost in 1949 when the People’s Republic of China set up circus schools across the nation. The Chinese government believed performances could bring in much-needed foreign currency. Chinese performers now perform internationally in western shows such as Cirque du Soleil, and troupes from China tour regularly across the world. 12. Theatre looks to the big top Theatre may have often looked down its nose at circus, but it has happily borrowed from it. In Peter Brook’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1970, the actors employed plate-spinning, acrobatics and sat on trapezes. Adrian Noble’s 1983 Comedy of Errors was set in a circus ring with the Dromios as red-nosed clowns, and Vesturport’s 2003 version of Romeo and Juliet at the Young Vic had the lovers’ death scene played out on aerial silks. Emma Rice’s work, with its swinging metaphors, has often borrowed from circus. 13. Political tricks Ra-Ra Zoo were 1980s pioneers of new experimental British circus, and their influence has spread out into contemporary circus in the UK. Operating on a structure of equal pay, and using agitprop and satire to make political circus, notable shows included Juggling With a Social Conscience, Domestic Bliss and the all-female clown show, Angels and Amazons. 14. Dalí brought to life The 1982 London visit by Le Cirque Imaginaire was an eye-opener for British circus. Like watching a Salvador Dalí painting brought to life, this collaboration between Jean-Baptiste Thierrée and Charlie Chaplin’s daughter, Victoria, reinvented circus and its possibilities. It also featured their children, James and Aurelia, who have produced some of the most mesmerisingly strange circus of the last 20 years. 15. Soleil not sawdust Canadian troupe Cirque du Soleil was founded in Montreal in 1984 by street performers Guy Laliberté and Gilles Ste-Croix. Its distinctive brand of dazzling, high-quality acts wrapped up in a theatrical framework has banished the idea of circus as a lowbrow spectacle played out in a sawdust ring, and pushed it into the realm of slick entertainment. The company’s annual revenues are estimated to exceed $800m (£575m). 16. Motorbikes and chainsaws Danger has always been a feature of circus, but Pierrot Bidon upped the ante in 1986 with contemporary French circus Archaos. Instead of horses there were motorbikes; juggling took on a new jeopardy when it was done with chainsaws; and performers flung themselves from forklift trucks in anarchic and often fiery displays. Like Circus Oz in Australia, Archaos was one of the animal-free outfits that gave circus a rock’n’roll vibe. 17. Join the circus Cardiff-based NoFit State Circus, founded in 1986, combine the idea of the travelling circus with contemporary aesthetics and the tools of theatre including design, video and narrative. The company collaborate with the local community and live, work and travel together like old-style troupes. They also use contemporary techniques to stage shows, including 2012’s immersive promenade show, Bianco, in which the action happened all around the audience. 18. Wizards of Oz Australian company Circa began as Rock n Roll Circus in 1987, very much in the mould of Circus Oz, but changed its name and its style in 2004, under the direction of theatre director and circus enthusiast Yaron Lifschitz. Since then it has been at the forefront of contemporary circus, creating a pared-back aesthetic in which the trick itself becomes a metaphor. 19. De La Guarda flies high De La Guarda’s 1997 visit to the London international festival of theatre was a revelation. Here were circus skills being used to create a club-like experience, in which the audience was herded into a space with a paper ceiling across which humans flew and chased each other, before breaking through the paper and snatching audience members into the sky. 20. Doomsday acrobatics Les 7 Doigts de la Main is a Canadian troupe founded in 2002 by performers who had worked with Cirque du Soleil and wanted to create contemporary circus with more intimacy. Their 2006 show, Traces, was a game-changer: a piece in which the five young performers – lost in a doomsday scenario – not only displayed their stunning acrobatic skills but also their personalities and relationship. They’ve inspired others, including rising outfit Barely Methodical Troupe, the National Centre for Circus Arts graduates whose first show, Bromance, was very much from the same mould. 21. Angels over Eros Piccadilly Circus Circus was one of the final events in the London 2012 festival. Brilliant and influential circus producers Crying Out Loud curated a witty pop-up event that turned the area into a real circus featuring 247 international performers across 12 spaces. It culminated in Les Studios de Cirque’s piece Place de Anges, in which Piccadilly Circus was invaded by flying angels who dropped 1.5 tonnes of feathers over Eros. You could glimpse feathers still floating days later. 22. Risky business Death-defying stunts are often a marketing tag line in the industry – although not always. Ringling Circus changed the name of the Wheel of Death to the Space Wheel to make it more family friendly. Circus acts have remarkably few accidents, because risk is well managed, yet numerous stunts have gone wrong – there are at least 30 recorded deaths from the human cannonball alone. In 2013, Cirque du Soleil performer Sarah Guyard-Guillot died after a 15-metre fall during a performance of the troupe’s Las Vegas show, KÀ – the first death in the company’s 30-year history. 23. Festival fever The Edinburgh fringe has become a major platform for international circus and for emerging UK talent, through the efforts of producers Crying Out Loud and Underbelly, who in 2015 launched the Circus Hub. The biennial CircusFest at London’s Roundhouse and Bristol’s Circus City are major UK festivals, and events such as the London international mime festival and the London international festival of theatre have been influential in showcasing circus. 24. The animal ban In 2017 Scotland banned the use of wild animals in performance. England is likely to follow suit after a public consultation found 94.5% of the public supported the ban. (Many English local authorities already refuse to license circuses featuring wild animals.) It was not always so, with trained animals starting to appear on the bill from 1810 onwards in England. In the early part of the 20th century, there were likely to be more animal acts than humans in the ring. The US Ringling Brothers Circus gave its last performance in 2017 after 146 years on the road, claiming there had been a sharp drop in ticket sales after the company stopped using elephants. 25. Women’s upswing In the 19th and 20th centuries, some of the most celebrated circus performers were women, including high-wire walker Maria Spelterina who in 1876 became the first woman to walk across the Niagara Falls on a rope, and Katie Sandwina (AKA Lady Hercules), who juggled cannonballs. Despite female-led companies such as Mimbre and Upswing, women have been underrepresented in British circus. But the lineup at CircusFest at London’s Roundhouse in April 2017 indicates the start of a shift in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/15/dementia-towns-japan-ageing-population","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T02:55:43Z","webTitle":"'Dementia towns': how Japan is evolving for its ageing population","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/dementia-towns-japan-ageing-population","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/15/dementia-towns-japan-ageing-population","fields":{"headline":"'Dementia towns': how Japan is evolving for its ageing population","bodyText":"It took a round of golf to convince Masashi Tsuda that something was really wrong with his memory. Then in his mid-50s, the sales rep couldn’t remember the four-digit number for his changing-room locker. Months earlier, he had struggled to get to grips with his office’s new computer system. On another occasion, his mind went blank as he was about to give a work presentation. Despite twice being reassured by doctors that stress was the cause of his moments of absent-mindedness, Tsuda was eventually diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease five years ago. His wife, Kazuko, wipes away tears as she recalls the ensuing trauma. “We had just rebuilt our house, but all of the plans we had made together were shattered in an instant,” she tells the Guardian at a cafe she runs in Matsudo city, east of Tokyo. “I lost eight kilograms in weight and all my hair fell out. When it grew back, it was white.” Her husband is not alone. Japan is at the forefront of a dementia crisis that experts warn will affect other societies with burgeoning elderly populations in decades to come. According to the health ministry, 4.6 million people are suffering from some form of dementia, with the total expected to soar to about 7.3 million people – or one in five Japanese aged 65 or over – by 2025. Faced with spiralling health and welfare costs and a shortage of professional caregivers, towns and cities across Japan are attempting to move away from a medicine-based, institutional approach towards care to one that involves the entire community. In 2015, Japan’s government released its Orange plan – a comprehensive package of measures to tackle dementia ranging from more specialised medical staff and the development of new drugs, to regular home visits and support for family caregivers. Matsudo, however, put services for people living with dementia at the centre of its welfare policy much earlier, in 2010. And for good reason. By the end of the decade, more than 28% of the city’s 480,000 people will be aged 65 or older. It means a commensurate rise in the number of people living with dementia, says Junko Yoshida, of Matsudo’s elderly welfare department. “We realised a while ago that with the rising number of older people living here dementia was going to be a huge challenge,” says Yoshida. Currently, just over 11,000 people in the city in receipt of nursing care have some form of dementia, compared with around 8,000 just seven years ago. But they do not include a large number of people who have yet to be diagnosed. If they are included, local officials estimate Matsudo will be home to as many as 26,000 dementia sufferers by 2025. Spearheaded by city hall, the plan includes raising public awareness among residents as well as businesses, such as banks and taxi services, which regularly come into contact with older people. There are cafes and drop-in centres for dementia patients and their families. From last summer, the city began distributing stickers carrying a QR code that can be ironed onto items of clothing to help police locate the families of people who have wandered from their homes. In return for attending a 90-minute lecture, residents can become “dementia supporters” who identify themselves with a bright orange bracelet. To date, 21,490 people have qualified as dementia-aware, while more than 3,000 regularly take part in neighbourhood patrols. Several times a month, small groups of volunteers put on bright orange bibs and walk around neighbourhoods to distribute leaflets carrying information on dementia services and, occasionally, to help people in distress. “We tend to pass by the very new houses as they’re occupied by young families,” says Manami Yoshii, a local welfare official while on patrol in a Matsudo suburb on a chilly January afternoon. “But if we see an older house that has the curtains drawn during the day or a big pile of newspapers in the mailbox, we tell the police.” Hiroyuki Yamamoto knew exactly what to do when, one morning two years ago, he spotted a woman pushing a bicycle who, despite the rain, did not have an umbrella. She told him she was on her way to a town in Nagano prefecture, hundreds of miles away. Thanks to his awareness training, he managed to keep the woman talking until the police arrived to escort her home. “A friendly greeting is the start of everything,” says Yamamoto, a regular patroller. “You don’t just suddenly ask people if they’re OK, as that could alienate them. It’s better to comment on the weather, or say something nice about their dog. We can usually tell if something is wrong by the way they respond.” The number of people with dementia who go missing in Japan has reached crisis levels, reaching a record high of 15,432 in 2016, according to the national police agency – a rise of more than 25 percent from the previous year. In Matsudo, the patrol initiative has produced results. Over the past six years, there have been more than 180 cases of people exhibiting signs of the condition found wandering the streets, all of whom were reunited with their families. When they are not on patrol, dozens of dementia supporters run cafes for people with the condition and their families. “It’s a casual place for people to come and talk openly over a cup of tea,” says Yukari Sakamoto, a cafe volunteer whose 69-year-old mother has the condition. “I can see that she gets a lot out of being able to talk at her own pace.” After a series of minor mishaps at home while she was out at work, Kazuko Tsuda persuaded her husband to attend a day-care facility, where he and other people with dementia do light exercise, sing karaoke, grow vegetables and go on supervised walks. Kazuko, who bought her cafe shortly before he was diagnosed, still struggles to cope with Masashi’s mood swings, but takes comfort from signs that he still appears to recognise her as his wife of more than 30 years. “If I had one wish, it would be for my husband and I to do things together,” she says. “He’s a proud man … so it would help if he could also be given some sort of easy work to do. Yes, he has Alzheimer’s, but that doesn’t mean he has no dignity.” The Tsudas’ names have been changed at their request."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/12/tim-rollins-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T13:24:51Z","webTitle":"Tim Rollins obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/12/tim-rollins-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/12/tim-rollins-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Tim Rollins obituary","bodyText":"Tim Rollins, who has died aged 62 of cardiovascular disease, was a conceptual artist and pioneer of socially engaged art. Always more interested in people than theory, Rollins made work in collaboration with young people from disadvantaged areas of New York City, and exhibited it under the moniker Tim Rollins and the KOS, or Kids of Survival. Typically, the group painted on to pages torn from a classic book of western literature, mounted as a grid on large-scale canvases. Made collectively, the work ranges in aesthetic: Amerika (1984-89), a series of paintings in which a tangle of elongated drooping trumpets, painted in gold acrylic over pages of the Franz Kafka novel, recall abstract expressionism. In Animal Farm (1989-92), depictions of world leaders, each with the body of a beast, overlay Orwell’s parable. At the Hayward Gallery’s alternative art school, Wide Open School, in 2012, the group took inspiration from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, using ink, mustard seed, glue and apple juice to paint on Felix Mendelssohn’s score for the play. This process has remained consistent since the group’s inception in the early 1980s. Then, Rollins was a fashionable figure on the downtown scene, and got to know artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. In the summer of 1981, having worked on a New York City board of education project, Learning to Read Through the Arts, Rollins was introduced to George Gallego, principal of Intermediate School 52 in the south Bronx, then regarded as one of the worst in the city. Accepting Gallego’s invitation to teach art to seventh-grade (12- to 13-year-old) children, Rollins was shown to classroom 318. As planes from LaGuardia airport roared overhead, he was handed his art supplies: two strips of staples (but no stapler), 12 pencils, 12 paper clips and two pieces of chalk and a rubber. He proved an inspirational teacher, coping with more than 30 pupils to a class, from whom he demanded high standards: Angel Abreu, a current member of the KOS, now aged 43, recalls being set a test on his first day, which required the date the Cubist manifesto was written. With a boombox installed, and covered in graffiti, the classroom became known as the “hip-hop Sistine Chapel”. Rollins organised an extracurricular art club, the Art and Knowledge Workshop, for his most enthusiastic students, meeting every day after school and at weekends to create collaborative paintings. At one such meeting, one of the “kids”, Carlos Rivera, then 12, drew on the pages of a book. “I wanted to kill him at first,” Rollins recalled, “but it looked really great. And I was blown away by the fact that here was this dyslexic kid who had captured the essence of the book in a drawing on the book.” It became the group’s leitmotif. In 1984 Rollins received an $8,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and moved his club to a community centre three blocks away. There, members of the KOS read the likes of F Scott Fitzgerald, Mary Shelley and Martin Luther King out loud, while others responded to the texts with paint. Rollins was tough with his young collaborators – whom he paid a generous wage – caring little for feelings in the pursuit of the art. While the majority found this inspiring, and several of the early members remain part of the KOS today, a few were critical of his methods. In 1991, New York Magazine ran a piece airing these views, which caused several of the remaining KOS to write to the magazine in Rollins’s defence. Previously, in a New York Times article in 1988, Rollins had said: “I couldn’t do what I do without the kids; they couldn’t do without me. It’s kind of like a baseball team. Without this, I’d be just another boring conceptual artist.” Tim was born in Pittsfield, Maine, to Carlton Rollins, who worked on the production line for the Northeast Shoe Company, and Charlotte (nee Hussey), a hospital secretary, both Pentecostal Baptists. Tim attended Warsaw junior high school and then Maine Central Institute, a private high school that waived its fees for local children, before studying art at the University of Maine. In 1975 he moved to New York to attend the School of Visual Arts, where he was taught by the conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth. On graduation Rollins studied art education and political philosophy at New York University and assisted his former teacher, which helped him become part of the downtown scene. Then, he was known as much for his red jumpsuits and relationship with the B-52s singer Kate Pierson – which lasted 15 years from 1981 – as for his work with Group Material, a collective he had co-founded in 1979 with friends from art college. Rollins had begun teaching in 1981, and one of his classes had made artworks in response to the Atlanta child murders that were dominating the news at that time. Rollins exhibited the results that summer at Group Material’s East Village storefront, sowing the seed for his future collaboration with the KOS. Using his artworld connections, Rollins and the KOS were included in a show at Gladstone gallery in 1985, delivering a 12-metre painting to SoHo by subway. The work caught the attention of the dealer Jay Gorney, who gave the group a solo exhibition in 1986 at his hip East Village space, from which the advertising mogul Charles Saatchi and publisher Si Newhouse both bought works. The group was featured in the Whitney Biennial the same year, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art and MoMA, New York, acquired paintings for their collections soon after. In 1987 the group was included in that year’s Documenta in Kassel, Germany, and Rollins quit teaching. The following year they exhibited at the Venice Biennale and had their first show in the UK at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham. In 1989 the gallerist Maureen Paley invited them to show at her Interim Art space in London. They were included again in the Whitney Biennial in 1991. A feature-length documentary, Kids of Survival: The Art and Life of Tim Rollins and KOS, won an Emmy in 1997. Animal Farm – New World Order is currently on display at Tate Liverpool. For the Hayward’s Wide Open School in 2012, the group led a workshop on Puck, the mischievous elf of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. “Puck is a creature who loves to create transformations just for the sheer, mischievous joy of it,” said Rollins. “Puck is our role model – the ultimate artist.” Rollins is survived by his mother, and by his brother, Ronny, and sisters, Carlene and Cindy. • Tim Rollins, artist and teacher, born 10 June 1955; died 22 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/12/baftas-film-sexual-assault-vote-not-allow-casting-couch-glory","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T12:31:47Z","webTitle":"With sexual abuse rife in my industry, how can I vote in the Baftas? | Bridget Lawless","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/baftas-film-sexual-assault-vote-not-allow-casting-couch-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/baftas-film-sexual-assault-vote-not-allow-casting-couch-glory","fields":{"headline":"With sexual abuse rife in my industry, how can I vote in the Baftas?","bodyText":"The film business is in an almighty mess – caught between a past it was shimmeringly proud of, a present where everyone in it is affected by its crimes, and a future of camera-shaking uncertainty. The fact that issues of harassment and sexual assault have started to hit the industry’s bottom line can only be a good thing. But so far we’re only watching the opening scenes – when it comes to revelations of sexual misconduct, it’s still early days. Isn’t it astonishing that a term was actually coined to enshrine the sexual favours expected of would-be stars? The casting couch – a place both literal and figurative where women especially (but by no means exclusively) were expected to give up and give out in order to further their careers – or maybe, as punishment for failing to submit, be raped. For every offender like Harvey Weinstein, there must have been a bevy of enablers. From financiers to terrified runners, from bullied assistants to business partners, people surely knew. Fellow artists said nothing because they wanted to keep working. Unfortunately, everyone who didn’t speak, act or walk away is also implicated, however helpless they felt. However unfair it seems. Feature films are entertainment. Many people wish, dream and desire to be part of their creation. But complicity with rape, threats or violence in the making of a film is being an accessory. As I watch this season’s Bafta film entries, I’m now not only acutely aware of what’s on screen that I might or might not applaud – the writing, performances, direction, music, effects, makeup and hair – but of that other world behind the camera. I can’t know what might or might not have gone on in each individual case, but I can’t not be aware of its relevance. I try to make choices in my day-to-day life in line with my own sense of morality: what and where I buy, which people or causes I support. But when it comes to the task of rewarding individual films with my vote, some of the essential criteria for those choices are concealed. I’m watching films, but voting blind. There’s no card at the end of a film stating that “no performers or employees were physically or psychologically damaged in the making of this film”. Would that such a thing were possible. Already, not harming animals is a legal requirement, and the statement is displayed. Some producers now strive for their films to be environmentally neutral, and state that. Both these measures require a serious level of accountability and evidencing. Surely the human toll should be equally measured and valued? Customers – audiences in this case – should be able to buy and consume entertainment with the same clear conscience they can buy responsibly sourced clothes and food. But as long as that isn’t happening I can’t possibly cast a vote for this year’s awards. Not all my friends and colleagues agree with my choice. Some argue that it penalises the innocent cast, crew and many others involved in making this year’s Bafta entries. I can’t disagree. It does. But right now, the only thing I can do that feels right by my own conscience is abstain – until I can be sure what I’m rewarding, and at what cost it was achieved. Finding out later that I’ve enabled even one perpetrator to bask in momentary glory is something I’m not prepared to sign up for. Meanwhile, let the casting couch be consigned to the museum. Not some quaint marker of human history to be marvelled at, but something to be ashamed of, alongside tools of torture and other instruments of barbarism. • Bridget Lawless, a screenwriter, is setting up the Staunch book prize for thrillers in which no woman is beaten, stalked, sexually exploited, raped or murdered"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/12/my-next-guest-needs-no-introduction-with-david-letterman-review-the-talk-show-legend-makes-a-lukewarm-return","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T13:23:48Z","webTitle":"David Letterman meets Barack Obama – has the talk show legend lost his edge?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/12/my-next-guest-needs-no-introduction-with-david-letterman-review-the-talk-show-legend-makes-a-lukewarm-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/12/my-next-guest-needs-no-introduction-with-david-letterman-review-the-talk-show-legend-makes-a-lukewarm-return","fields":{"headline":"David Letterman meets Barack Obama – has the talk show legend lost his edge?","bodyText":"In May 2015, David Letterman bowed out after 33 years of being America’s most irascible late-night television host. It was a grand affair. A who’s who of American pop culture were there: Steve Martin, Alec Baldwin, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Tina Fey and Jim Carrey all made jokes at his expense, while making sincere comments about his impact on America, and them. The Foo Fighters played Everlong over a montage of his best bits, tears were shed and then … well, late-night moved on. Stephen Colbert and the Jimmys (Fallon and Kimmel) took over. Dave disappeared, resurfacing briefly with a beanie hat and unkempt beard to berate “Trumpy” on the front cover of New York magazine. If he was going to have a third act, it became clear it might not be a straightforward one. Another guest on one of Letterman’s final shows was Barack Obama, who is the first guest on his comeback show: My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman (Netflix). It’s a monthly interview where Letterman will gently grill guests including George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai and Jay-Z. If this first outing is anything to go by, it might be a bit too gently for its own good. After a lukewarm opening in which we see Dave in his office, apparently on the phone trying to set up the interview, there is some patchy back-and-forth with the audience – we’re in a theatre, not a studio – before Obama is unveiled. The conversation is all very respectful (the two are genuinely friends), and at times funny and quite moving. Obama talks about his mother and his childhood and affectionately discusses trying to keep up with his daughters and the perils of dad dancing. He also acknowledges where he might have gone wrong while in office: too much focus on being presidential, not enough on the disappearing middle class. There is also a conversation about the polarised state of the US. “People watching Fox News are on another planet,” he says to big laughs, but he means that they’re getting information and facts that are completely different from someone who might listen to public radio. It’s playful and polite, but ultimately pedestrian. There’s not one mention of Donald Trump, which is understandable for Obama (he’s avoided mentioning him since leaving office), but Letterman has chastised his late-night predecessors for not being hard enough on him. It’s an omission that grates. The problem is that Letterman has lost his sense of mischievousness. His interviews on the Late Show always worked best when something was at stake. David Cameron, then prime minister, was made to look stupid by Letterman when he couldn’t answer questions on the British citizenship test, for example. Letterman loved to prod and poke at his guest’s sensitive spots – sometimes cruelly – but almost always for the benefit of the interview. Here, he’s mostly in retreat. Toward the end of the interview, the pair discuss the life of civil rights activist and politician John Lewis. It’s a loving tribute to one of America’s progressive stalwarts, and it ends with Letterman seeking Obama’s forgiveness for going on a booze cruise to the Bahamas rather than joining the freedom marchers in the 60s. “Why wasn’t I there?” Letterman asks, fighting back tears. It seems as if Letterman is looking for answers – let’s hope he doesn’t forget what made him so good in the first place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/16/fast-and-furious-live-stage-show-behind-the-scenes","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Fast & Furious Live: it's got ice, tanks, a plane, a submarine – and lots of explosions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/16/fast-and-furious-live-stage-show-behind-the-scenes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/16/fast-and-furious-live-stage-show-behind-the-scenes","fields":{"headline":"Fast & Furious Live: it's got ice, tanks, a plane, a submarine – and lots of explosions","bodyText":"The Liverpool Echo Arena looks like it is in the grip of a military coup, one in which some international playboys and some camp policemen have unaccountably become embroiled. There are toolkit buggies and gigantic tanks, slicked-up sports cars and Beemers all dressed in white, as if they’re wearing giant nappies – but those are just LED coatings, to make them light up like fast-moving car Christmas trees. This is the rehearsal for Fast &amp; Furious Live, a tyre-shredding extravaganza that has cost £25m to put together. The arena is 50 metres by 25, which would look enormous for any normal purpose. But for driving cars in, the sheer level of accuracy required just to go from one bit to another, let alone chase each other and have near scrapes, is absurd. It’s like asking someone to do open-heart surgery with a baseball bat. To really love a film is to leave a part of yourself in it, a part that would prefer to live in it for ever. We’ve all got that about something. I never realised enough people would feel that way about the Fast and Furious films to make such a show viable, but that’s because I wasn’t paying attention. It is Universal’s biggest franchise of all time, grossing $5bn (£3.6bn) in total. Since the debut of the first film in 2001, in which dadmobile the Honda Civic was elevated to glamour-car status, the franchise has grown into this magic money tree, spawning eight films and even surviving the death of its lead, Paul Walker, in 2013. (He perished in a car crash, and the next film was completed using his brothers as stand-ins, digitally overlaying Walker’s face.) It all started with an article in Vibe magazine about underground drag-racers in Manhattan, who would take over a mile of road for a minute and race each other to the point of disintegration, at speeds in excess of 160mph. Director Rob Cohen used hundreds of this drag-race fans in the first film, The Fast and the Furious, along with their cars. Later in the franchise, the necessity of a plot brought in heist elements. And now shooting guns and burning rubber has made global superstars of a cast that has included Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Gal Gadot, AKA Wonder Woman. The live show’s drivers, whittled down to 11 from 2,000 applicants, have been training for 16 weeks at an RAF base in Lincolnshire. Their precision is extraordinary: it’s one thing being able to judge a stopping distance to a millimetre, but for three drivers to be able to do it alongside one another looks like telepathy. Even they are amazed. Granted an exclusive set visit, I run into Bruno Poet, a self-effacing, top-of-the-ladder lighting director who I actually worked with as a student, putting on something or other, probably Arturo Ui. He says: “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like this.” Neither have I. There’s an oil tanker bigger than a bus just sitting there waiting for something bad to happen. The Lykan, a malevolent-looking sports car at the best of times, moves so fast and makes such an incredible noise, it’s a genuine surprise whenever it doesn’t kill someone. Amid all the pyrotechnics, 3D projections and, of course, cars there is a plane, a train, tanks, Ski-Doos and even a submarine. It’s a bit like being at a young dictator’s birthday party. “This is the first theatrical car show that’s ever existed,” says Hannah Johnson, the 26-year-old associate producer, “in the sense that there’s a story and characters. If you’re a petrolhead, you’ll come and see the cars – but the vehicles themselves have personalities. The way Sebastian drives the tank, the way he moves the turrets, he’s really given it a character. Our lead, the bad guy, never speaks. But the cars he drives say it all for him.” Elysia Wren, who playsspiky and unromantic lead cop Sophia Diaz, describes the story arc of the live show: “We lead the audience through our mission to catch a guy called Tyler Cane, who was in the last film. We use them to help us, keep them on their feet.” The cars, people keep telling me, are the stars. (They’re also fond a saying: “Teamwork makes the dream work.”) It’s the cars that do the actual fighting, it’s the cars that are the good guys and the bad guys. The latter are ominous and aggressive, while Diaz’s blue GTR has a kid of sprauncy, Scrappy-Doo energy, as scenes from the films are projected on to various parts of the arena and merge into real objects. This is the work of Kate Dawkins, the 3D projection mapper with a godlike ability to conjure wonders out of thin air. So the submarine will start off as a virtual projection and, when it comes to rest, metamorphose into an actual metal one. “We have content that comes from the screen into the physical environment,” says 48-year-old Dawkins. “We jump that void and that’s very new. Not a lot of shows try that because it is very complex. The 3D mapping usually serves as just a kind of backdrop.” Dawkins, a biker who worked on the Olympic ceremonies, can make it look like you’re in Rio one minute and the Arctic the next. “It’s amazing how many times we’ve done the plane landing,” she says, “just to check it looks right.” As this virtual aircraft lands, it transforms into the actual one sitting in the arena, and then real Ski-Doos shoot across the stage as the virtual ice beneath them cracks to reveal a submarine that doesn’t look real at first but actually is (I’m almost certain that’s what I saw). You don’t have to love the films to enjoy the show, and nor do you need to be a petrolhead. But, I think, as I walk past two guys setting an engine ablaze, it will certainly help if you enjoy seeing things burst into flames. None of the cars is literally crashed in the show, though. That’s all showbiz magic – unlike the films, one of which got through 300 vehicles and not all of them Hondas. There are a lot of assumptions made about the action genre: that only men like cars and explosions, only men like Top Gear, only men like to watch things chasing other things. But with a female associate producer, a female car choreographer (yes, that’s an actual thing) and way more female stunt drivers than you’d expect, this doesn’t feel like a boy’s own adventure at all. Almost everyone has motor racing in their background, if not their blood. Hannah Johnson has a racing-driver father. “That’s obviously very skilled,” she says. “But this? My dad says sometimes, ‘I could do that’ – and I’m like, ‘I’m not sure you could.’” Stunt-driver Michelle Westby, 30, used to race in a banger she built herself, but couldn’t make a living out of it. “I was working in construction,” she says, “in a hard hat and hi-vis, before I got this.” We are in the dressing room, sitting at a table with nothing on it but a bra. “I was wondering who left that there,” she says, picking it up, “and realised it was mine.” Jess Hawkins started driving when she was eight, becoming the British go-kart champion at 13. She was making a living coaching a nine-year-old go-karter called Vinnie when this came along. “I got the lap record in my first ever race in a car,” she says. “I did Formula 4, Formula 3 and was tipped as one of the three most likely females to get to Formula 1. Not any more, though, obviously – I’m too old.” Given she’s only 22, isn’t this rather a harsh self-appraisal? “They’re all about 17,” she explains. In theory, they could all swap cars. But, as Hawkins explains, “because we’ve had a bit of seat time, we love the cars we’re in. But I love all the cars, to be honest.” They talk as if they’re working at Battersea Dogs Home, with endless tenderness. Except it’s for cars. The director of Top Gear once said doing the show was like organising a holiday for 12-year-old boys, then taking grown men on it. This is like burrowing into the anguished adventurousness of teens of either sex – with all that chasing and danger and yet more chasing and near-missing. It is alarming to watch, if only because you have to make peace with the fact that none of us is as far away from teenhood as we think. And the urge to watch things blow up never really goes away. But, despite the screaming engines and the screeching tyres, this new leap for the franchise is ultimately about something more than horsepower, according to Dawkins. “The final link is bringing the audience in,” she says. “That’s where the energy is.” Fast &amp; Furious Live premieres at the O2 Arena, London, on 19 January, then tours across Europe and the UK; fastandfuriouslive.com From carer to stuntdriver She may be the youngest driver in the team, but Jodie Rasburn has easily the most professorial air. While she may come across as somewhat distracted, there’s only ever one thing the 20-year-old is thinking about – cars. “My dad used to do driving,” she says, “and I’d go to events with him.” At the age of 14, at an arena in Essex, Rasburn took up drifting – the motorsport that involves oversteering a car so that it careers along at about a 45-degree angle to its direction of travel, wheels spinning furiously and looking as if it’s just about to roly-poly off into the barriers. “If you get into it at a young enough age,” says Rasburn, “you have a lot of courage because you just don’t care. A lot of our training here was about un-training. We had a lot of habits that didn’t work – they were too hard on the cars.” Is it a challenge to turn the vehicle into an actor? “I feel like I get into the acting, I feel myself in the car. Then there’s the adrenaline – as soon as the lights go on, bang, you’re into driving mode. When you know you’ve nailed it, there’s nothing like that.” Rasburn had a job, as well as a daredevil hinterland, before all this: “I was a carer, looking after dementia patients,” she says. Fast &amp; Furious Live is a five-year run. “I can’t even think about what I’ll do afterwards,” she says. Then, almost in disbelief, she adds: “I’ll be 25.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/12/ruth-davidson-no-second-eu-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T11:32:00Z","webTitle":"Ruth Davidson says there should be no second EU referendum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/12/ruth-davidson-no-second-eu-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/12/ruth-davidson-no-second-eu-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Ruth Davidson says there should be no second EU referendum","bodyText":"The leader of the Scottish Conservatives has said she does not want a second referendum to be held on EU membership, while expressing her frustration at delays to plans to protect Scotland’s interests in the Brexit bill. In an interview on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland, Ruth Davidson said: “I would quite happily never see another constitutional referendum in my lifetime because I find them divisive. I’ve always said that you shouldn’t keep running referenda until you get the position you like personally.” She added that she would be seeing Theresa May on Monday to talk about the highly contentious clause 11 of the EU withdrawal bill, which has been attacked as a power grab by Nicola Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart, Carwyn Jones, fuelling intense pressure from the Scottish Conservatives to amend it. On Tuesday, it emerged that the amendments had been postponed because of unexpected delays in Whitehall, and would have to be introduced in the House of Lords in the spring instead, leading to SNP accusations that Scotland had been “sold out”. Davidson emphasised the complexity of the process, saying: “I’m frustrated too. I wish that this had already been nailed down but it is taking longer than we thought.” She insisted that the work on the amendments was continuing, and that David Lidington, who replaced Damian Green as minister with responsibility for negotiations with devolved administrations, had spoken to Scotland’s deputy first minister, John Swinney, on his first day in office. Davidson said: “The work that’s going on between the civil servants of the UK government and the Scottish government is taking longer than we had thought and anticipated and I find that frustrating. “It also requires political input as well, so ministers are talking as well – one of the very first phone calls that David Lidington made when he became the new cabinet secretary in charge of part of the guts of Brexit was to John Swinney to have that discussion.” “I know that colleagues have sat down with [Scottish Brexit minister] Mike Russell as well. I’m going down to see the prime minister.” Questioned about the prime minister’s recent reshuffle, she said: “I think reshuffles are almost impossible to get entirely right.” After expressing disappointment earlier this week that Justine Greening – whom she described as “a real role model for LGBT+ Conservatives” – had been sacked, she added: “Justine Greening and I have been friends for a long time and I appreciated the voice she brought to government,” but said she had not spoken to the former education minister since Monday. Davidson was also categorical that she did not have ambitions to move from Holyrood to Westminster. “Not at all. This is my home. Scotland is the only place I’ve lived and worked in my life and this is where I’m staying.” She said: “I get quite frustrated by all these people coming up from down south, other media organisations, and they don’t understand that being the leader of the opposition in Scotland, being a potential first minister, is a bigger job than many of the cabinet jobs down south and certainly larger than being on the backbenches, and that’s where my commitment lies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/15/fire-and-fury-inside-the-trump-white-house-by-michael-wolff-digested-read","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff – digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/15/fire-and-fury-inside-the-trump-white-house-by-michael-wolff-digested-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/15/fire-and-fury-inside-the-trump-white-house-by-michael-wolff-digested-read","fields":{"headline":"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff – digested read","bodyText":"On a snowy January evening in 2017, disgraced head of Fox News Roger Ailes and Donald Trump’s right-hand man Steve Bannon met for dinner in a New York brownstone. “We’ve got a problem,” said Bannon. “Trump doesn’t get it. He doesn’t realise the bad guys are the bad guys.” “There’s only one thing for it,” replied Ailes. “We’ve got to bring in Michael Wolff to write a book about him. He can be relied on to be as unreliable as the Donald. Hopefully, no one will believe a word.” A couple of months earlier, on election night, Trump and his family were gathered in the penthouse of Trump Tower. The mood was buoyant. The plan had always been to lose the presidency and the polls seemed to confirm he was on track. Then the first results came in. “I’ve done it! I’ve done it!” yelled Trump. “Congratulations Mr President!” said his son-in-law Jared Kushner. “Thank you,” said Trump. “It’s taken me weeks to get to the next level of Call of Duty. But who are you calling Mr President?” Melania crept off to her bedroom to weep bitter tears of despair. “Now I’ll have to stay with the creepy pussy-grabber for at least another four years,” she sobbed. “Never mind,” said Wolff, leaping out of a cupboard. “At least you’ve got me.” The early days of the presidency were spent turning the Oval Office into a soft-play area with three TVs tuned to cartoon channels. This suited Trump perfectly as it allowed him to get on with not running the country. “I’m going to Make America Great Again bigly. So bigly you won’t believe it. FACT!” he would repeat, while stuffing his face with a Big Mac. For Bannon, the main priority was to help Trump with his remedial reading lessons and to stop world leaders phoning him. Life went much more smoothly when there was nothing going on to remind the president he was the president. “He’s a fucking idiot,” declared Rupert Murdoch after being accidentally put through to Trump during a cartoon ad break. “No, he’s not,” said Ivanka, who still hadn’t gotten over the fact she wasn’t president. “He’s actually a cretin.” Within weeks, the White House split into two factions. Those close to Bannon and those close to Jared and Ivanka – collectively known as Javanka. The Bannon camp would brief Wolff about how stupid and unstable Trump was and how he believed there had been no harm meeting Vladimir Putin as he didn’t know who he was; while Javanka told Wolff how stupid and unstable Trump was and how he had made his hair out of Elton John’s transplant off-cuts. “You’re not going to believe this,” Bannon told Wolff. “But the president is near enough certifiable and has the mental age of a five year old.” “That’s amazing,” whooped Wolff. “I’d always thought he was a strong and stable genius.” With the Lego wall in his bedroom the only part of his programme to take shape, Trump began to get frustrated. To relieve the boredom, he decided to sack most of the people in his office, along with the director of the FBI, before retreating to Mar-a-Lago for a round of golf where he got the Japanese prime minister to caddy for him before asking: “What shithole country is Japan in?” This only added to the pressure and his remaining aides became increasingly concerned about the administration’s total failure when Trump did once appear to do something that seemed vaguely rational. Though no one could quite remember what it was. Even Wolff was concerned that his book might be turning into a collection of facts that most people already knew. Normality soon resumed, however, with Trump beginning each day by attaching weights to the end of his penis in order to increase its size. “I have the biggest penis, the biggest. I really do. That’s a fact,” he would tweet, before spraying himself with disinfectant and going off on a playdate with Tony Blair. “Thanks so much for coming over to the US, Tony,” said Wolff. “It will be a big boost to UK sales. Now can I quote you as saying that British intelligence services were bugging Trump?” “No.” “Too late.” Six months in and the White House was in paralysis, with Trump having run out of people to sack. General Kelly took charge after suggesting the president start a nuclear war with North Korea. “It’s all absolutely terrible,” said Bannon from the bedsit where he was now living. “No, it’s not,” cried Wolff. “It’s just fantastic.” Digested read, digested: Fake news!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/12/marriott-apologises-to-china-over-tibet-and-taiwan-error","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T10:10:07Z","webTitle":"Marriott apologises to China over Tibet and Taiwan error","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/12/marriott-apologises-to-china-over-tibet-and-taiwan-error","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/12/marriott-apologises-to-china-over-tibet-and-taiwan-error","fields":{"headline":"Marriott apologises to China over Tibet and Taiwan error","bodyText":"The Marriott International hotel chain has apologised and condemned “separatists” in China after the Beijing government shut down its website over an online questionnaire that suggested some Chinese regions were separate countries. China’s Cyberspace Administration, the internet watchdog, said the hotelier had “seriously violated national laws and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people” after a customer survey listed Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries. The regulator ordered Marriott’s website and booking applications to close for a week. The company, which operates more than 100 hotels in China, quickly responded with a profuse apology distancing itself from charges of supporting separatist movements. “Marriott International respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. We don’t support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,” the company said in a statement. “We sincerely apologise for any actions that may have suggested otherwise.” The company’s Chinese website was replaced with a similar statement, adding it was only taking reservations over the phone. Marriott has previously described China as its biggest market. Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950 to bring the region under Beijing’s control while Hong Kong and Macau were returned to China in the 1990s after colonial rule, although both are governed separately from the mainland. While China claims Taiwan, the island has been governed separately since 1949 and maintains formal diplomatic relations with a handful of countries. The Chinese government frequently erupts with outrage at any perceived contradiction to its territorial claims, claiming such statements upset all of China’s 1.4 billion citizens. Even local activists who have called for greater autonomy for regions within China have faced harsh prison sentences. Many on social media echoed that outrage. Some travellers were cancelling their reservations in response, according to Chinese media reports. “Everyone should do the same as me and abandon [Marriott] in protest. Let’s all switch to Hilton,” one user wrote on social media. Dozens of other comments had a simpler message: “Marriott, get out of China.” China’s tourism regulator ordered other hotel operators to review their own websites to avoid similar mistakes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/17/deadly-african-gold-rush-people-smugglers-northern-chad-mines","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T07:13:23Z","webTitle":"The deadly African gold rush fuelled by people smugglers' promises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/17/deadly-african-gold-rush-people-smugglers-northern-chad-mines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/17/deadly-african-gold-rush-people-smugglers-northern-chad-mines","fields":{"headline":"The deadly African gold rush fuelled by people smugglers' promises","bodyText":"Refugees from the troubled Sudanese region of Darfur, who are living in camps in neighbouring Chad, are being drawn into an African gold rush in a desperate effort to pay smugglers to get them to Europe. Digging in holes 50m deep, Sudanese refugees are risking their lives in an area not only littered with landmines but also beset by violence, which claimed at least 25 lives last year. Lowered by rope into the darkness below, they spend hours at a time hacking away at the hard rock by torchlight. The hope is to find a nugget of gold big enough to pay the thousands of pounds demanded by smugglers to take them through Libya and on to boats that offer the chance of a new life in Europe. Nasrudin Omar Bahar, 29, invested his life savings of £200 to join a group heading to the gold mines of Tibesti, in Chad’s far north. “I had the idea that I could get enough gold to go to Europe,” he says. “I didn’t care which country I went to. My dream place was somewhere where there is peace, serenity and a good living.” But Bahar now lies on a bed in a mud hut in the Farchana refugee camp close to the border with Darfur. He fled Darfur in 2007 when the Arab militia known as the Janjaweed attacked and burned his village of Tandikoro. Vibrations from the heavy machinery needed to crush the mined stones caused the shaft to collapse on top of him. The rockfall left him paralysed from the waist down. He explains that living conditions in the camp were what drove him to leave the settlement. “Life was very difficult and we couldn’t support ourselves … Then I heard of a group who were going looking for gold, and so I left the camp,” he says. Word of the potential riches to be made in the gold fields has spread around the settlements. In Goz Beïda, Mohamed Jouma Ahamed, 41, the inspector of schools in Djabal camp, said that his brother Ahamed had joined the gold rush in the hope of making enough to buy his passage to Europe. “Staying here isn’t easy, and so we would prefer to go to Europe,” he says. “There are many young boys who attempt to go to Europe by sea through Libya. “They go to the region in the far north of Chad where they search for gold, and they get cash and pay smugglers to take them over to Libya. My brother went to Tibesti to search for gold and got some, and the smugglers took them in cars to Libya.” Around 323,000 people who escaped the fighting that broke out in Darfur in 2003 live in camps on the Chadian side of the border with Sudan. Attempts to persuade them to return home have foundered amid fresh outbreaks of violence, with thousands of people fleeing over the border into Chad in recent months. The headman of Tenbeba village in Darfur, Mahamat Khatir Idriss, 60, describes how he and about a thousand others had to flee when the Janjaweed attacked after years of rapes, beating and intimidation. “There is no negotiating with them. They came with their guns and we were prisoners in our own village,” he says. “When our children went to get food they were beaten, when the women went to get water they were assaulted. There was rape.” He and many of the villagers eventually reached Treguine camp in eastern Chad. He said they had been powerless to defend themselves from the Arab militia, who have been blamed for carrying out much of the violence against the black African farmers during the long-running conflict. He accused troops from the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (Unamid) of failing to protect civilians from attack. “Soldiers would come and take information when something happened, but they didn’t do anything.” He says they were given phone numbers to call Unamid for assistance but claims the UN forces would not intervene to prevent attacks. “Even when we call them, they don’t come. They didn’t fight to protect the local people. They go away.” Another of the villagers, Fatna Idriss Adam, 25, says they had been persecuted by “the Arabs”. She describes how the Janjaweed attacked the village in August, killing a policeman and setting fire to houses, forcing the villagers to flee. “Some were on foot and some were on horses. The Arabs were shooting, and three people were wounded and one was killed. I was in the fields. I heard the shooting, so I ran across the river with my baby.” She says the trouble started when one of the Janjaweed was arrested by local police for trying to graze his cattle on a farmer’s land. The Janjaweed took revenge by killing a policeman and driving out the villagers. The Sudanese government has been accused of exploiting traditional rivalries between the nomadic Arab herders and the settled black African farmers, arming the Janjaweed to take on rebel non-Arab groups. “We lived with a kind of fear between the two communities,” Adam says. She and hundreds of other villagers have resolved to stay at Treguine and have started building houses on land allocated to them. “Here it is better because the Arabs will leave us in peace,” she adds. At the height of the conflict in Darfur, between 2003 and 2005, the plight of refugees from what was described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis was often in the international spotlight. But now those supporting the refugee camps – including the European commission’s aid organisation, Echo – are concerned that funding is drying up. There have been attempts to persuade the refugees to return by arranging for small groups of their representatives to visit Darfur to assess the security situation. But one of those who visited last year, Adam Ismail Abdallah, 38, says they had returned to the Djabal camp more convinced than ever that Darfur remained unsafe. “Everything was the same – the killing, rape, everything,” he says. “The Arab tribes … are living on our land, in our villages.” It is against this background that the discovery of gold in northern Chad has tempted some in the camps to believe there may yet be a way out of their predicament. Gold was discovered around Tibesti in 2012, and since then people have flocked to the mines from across the region. A report published last year noted that the thousands of prospectors included refugees from Darfur. But competition is fierce and last year dozens of people died in violent clashes between miners. Others struggle to make enough to survive. Bahar says he barely makes enough to buy food. But for him, there is a happy ending – of sorts. Despite his catastrophic injuries, his dream of reaching Europe did not die at the bottom of the mine shaft. Finland has agreed to grant him asylum and he is due to be flown out of Chad with his sister Manira at the end of the month. This reporting was funded by the European commission through Echo, the European civil protection and humanitarian aid operations"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/readers-editor-on-my-years-as-your-voice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"The readers’ editor on… my years as your voice | Stephen Pritchard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/readers-editor-on-my-years-as-your-voice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/readers-editor-on-my-years-as-your-voice","fields":{"headline":"The readers’ editor… on my years as your voice","bodyText":"Nowadays, you couldn’t sell a newspaper on Christmas Day even if you tried, but things were different in the 18th century when the Observer struggled into life. In 1791, then a mere three weeks old, the paper came out on Sunday 25 December, confident in finding readers in an age before mass entertainment and a complete commercial shutdown. Buried beneath an editorial praising William Wilberforce for his campaign “for the abolition of the odious slave trade” and alongside other smaller items announcing, to pick at random, news that a Shrewsbury bride had given birth an hour after her wedding, was a single sentence quietly announcing the death in Vienna of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, “the celebrated German composer”. Now, originally in this my last column as readers’ editor, I thought it might be mildly amusing to correct what I perceived to be the error of calling Mozart German, 226 years after the event. But I was wrong. As readers were quick to point out, in Mozart’s time, Salzburg was an independent city state within the Holy Roman Empire and would not be annexed by Habsburg Austria until 1805, so no correction was necessary. Oh, the shame of it. Inaccuracy is, of course, as old as journalism itself, but it has taken the trade centuries to recognise that it should correct its errors, not through some kind of misplaced piety but in order to keep trust in its work and to maintain an accurate record of life’s passing show. Yet even today, there are several British newspapers that believe that admitting to their mistakes is somehow shameful. The idea that we ought to be as transparent as we can about the job we undertake sprang last century from the United States, where, ironically, when we remember the current president’s absurd dismissal of the “fake mainstream media”, they believed that a constitutional guarantee of press freedom carried with it the responsibility to get it right and admit when they erred. That idea arrived in the UK at the Guardian 20 years ago and then to the Observer, where I was installed as readers’ editor nearly 17 years ago. Correcting errors is a visible expression of a desire to be transparent, but it is only a small factor in maintaining accountability. While I’ve written close to 1,000 corrections since I took on this job (mostly serious, but some, it must be said, included purely for their amusement value), they have only ever represented the least of the work. More important has been the constant dialogue with those who feel injured by our coverage and seek redress or those who cannot understand why the paper apparently ignores what to them is a burning issue. And there are the loyal readers who look upon their Observer as more than a mere newspaper – it is an integral part of their lives. They seize the telephone or dash to their keyboards when they detect a decline in standards or a drift away from the liberal values they believe the paper is here to espouse. The Observer’s presence on the web was small when I started out, but it is now read online by millions around the world who never see the printed paper. They may not feel any particular attachment to the title, but their views about a story are every bit as valid. Whether you read in print or online, your wisdom, suggestions and complaints have inspired my columns on our journalism, though, of course, we have not always seen eye to eye. I’ve never been here to agree with everything that complainants say. While Britain has been slow to adopt this form of media self-regulation, newspapers, TV and radio around the world continue to see its value, attested to by the international membership of the Organization of News Ombudsmen, which it was twice my privilege to chair. In what can sometimes be a lonely job (finding fault with the staff’s work hardly makes you the most popular figure in the newsroom), having contact with colleagues around the world was a welcome source of solace and sagacity. My last column also marks the end of my 30 years on the staff here; years that have seen six editors come and go and the paper transformed in at least eight redesigns on its journey from broadsheet, through Berliner to tabloid from next week – a full-circle return to a size nearer to that of those first 18th-century issues. I’ll be here until the end of the month, so let me have your thoughts on the new digital and print formats – and beyond that keep writing to the email address below. The Observer needs to hear from you. observer.readers@observer.co.uk This article was amended on 15 January 2018 to remove a correction concerning Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/12/bbc-sound-of-2018-poll-sigrid-winner","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T10:40:04Z","webTitle":"Sigrid wins BBC Sound of 2018 poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/12/bbc-sound-of-2018-poll-sigrid-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/12/bbc-sound-of-2018-poll-sigrid-winner","fields":{"headline":"Sigrid wins BBC Sound of 2018 poll","bodyText":"The BBC’s annual Sound Of poll has announced its winner for 2018: 21-year-old Norwegian pop star Sigrid. With her heartfelt, earnest voice and anthemic electro-pop production, the singer broke through with her debut single Don’t Kill My Vibe, released in Feburary 2017, and followed it up with Strangers in November – both were critically acclaimed, though she is yet to reach the Top 40. She also performed at 2017’s Nobel peace prize concert, and contributed the song Everybody Knows to the soundtrack of superhero movie Justice League. The poll is voted for by around 170 insider figures across the music industry and the media, who are asked to name their three favourite new acts who haven’t yet had a Top 10 hit. Sigrid said winning was “crazy … I’m just really happy and proud of what my team and I have achieved together”. The runner up is Rex Orange County, aka Hampshire-raised songwriter Alex O’Connell, whose breezy, rickety mix of R&amp;B and guitar pop has already earned him guest spots with US rapper Tyler, the Creator. Also in the top five are female Manchester MC IAMDDB, picked by the Guardian as one of the 40 most exciting new artists this year; 19-year-old US pop star Khalid, who has already reached the Top 20 and has guested on hits with Calvin Harris, Logic and Marshmello; and British quartet Pale Waves, one of only two bands in the 16-strong longlist. Sigrid added that she was “honoured as there are so many other artists I look up to who have won this before me”. Previous winners include Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding.

The novel came out in Turkey in 2006. It tells the story of a Turkish family and an Armenian-American family, mostly through the eyes of four generations of women. It is a story about buried family secrets, political and sexual taboos, and the need to talk about them, as well as the ongoing clash between memory and amnesia. Turkey, in general, is a society of collective amnesia. Shortly after publication, I was sued for “insulting Turkishness” under Article 301 in the Turkish criminal code, although nobody quite knows what either “Turkishness” or “insulting” means in this context. The ambiguity of its wording allows the article to be interpreted to stifle freedom of speech and the freedom of the press; and for the first time, a novel, a work of fiction, was put on trial under the article. The words of the Armenian characters in The Bastard of Istanbul were plucked out of the text, and used as “evidence” by the prosecutor’s office. As a result, my Turkish lawyer had to defend my Armenian fictional characters inside the courtroom. The whole thing was surreal and I was acquitted. What I remember of those anxiety-ridden days today, however, is neither the trial process nor the ultranationalist groups organising protests on the streets and spitting at my photo and the EU flag, but the amazingly heart-warming, uplifting and inspiring feedback I received from readers. The majority of fiction readers in Turkey are women – Turkish, Kurdish, Alevi, Jewish, Armenian, Greek … women of all ethnicities, cultures and classes . In Turkey, if women like a book, they pass it on to other women. A book is not a personal possession. The same copy is read on average by five or six people, underlining different sentences with different coloured pens. Even though Turkey’s written culture, media and publishing industries, especially as you move up the ladder, remain male-dominated, it is mostly women who are the bearers of memory and it is mostly women who keep multiple traditions of storytelling alive. Nonetheless, although words were dangerous in Turkey in mid-2000s, the situation for writers and publishers was never as dire or dark as it has become today. Over the past decade Turkey has been sliding backwards, at first gradually and then at a bewildering speed. Authoritarianism, Islamism, nationalism, isolationism, and sexism have all been on the rise, systematically feeding and encouraging one another. It has not helped that the prospect of Turkey’s EU membership was shattered. As the country became more and more distanced from Europe, the growing gap was exploited by nationalists and Islamists. The ruling elite began to talk about joining the Shanghai Pact instead of the EU. Today Turkey’s relations with the EU are at their lowest point. The AKP government has become increasingly undemocratic, inward-looking, illiberal and intolerant. In April 2017, a controversial referendum and a narrow (51% to 49%) vote means Turkey will change from a parliamentary democracy to a state in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds an absolute monopoly on power. Turkey has become a shocking example that the ballot box in itself is not enough to sustain a democracy. If there is no rule of law, no separation of powers, no media freedoms, no academic freedoms and no women’s rights in a country, democracy cannot thrive or survive. Today my motherland is a polarised and bitterly politicised country where thousands of intellectuals have lost their jobs. There is an increasing number of court cases against academics, journalists, writers, thinkers and commentators. One of the country’s most celebrated cartoonists, Musa Kart, has spent five months in prison and even though he was released under judicial supervision, still faces up to 29 years in jail. The Cartoonists Rights Network International has issued a statement describing the trial as “an embarrassing effort on the part of the Turkish government to further disappoint its own people”. The most difficult profession in Turkey is journalism. Since the bloody coup attempt in 2016, more than 160 media outlets have been shut down and a widespread purge was introduced. With more than 150 journalists in prison, Turkey has surpassed China’s sad record, becoming the world’s leading jailer for journalists. Many more have been blacklisted, sacked, stigmatised, or had passports confiscated. The cases against academics are equally worrying. Academic freedoms are being destroyed one by one. More than 4,000 academics have been expelled from universities throughout the country. Those who were signatories to a peace declaration in 2016 have lost their jobs, with no chance of finding a job at another Turkish university; many are being prosecuted and prevented from travelling abroad. One of the most disturbing arrests was of Osman Kavala, a leading human rights and peace activist, businessman and philanthropist who is greatly respected by democrats, liberals and minorities in Turkey. With self-censorship increasingly widespread, there is far less civil public debate. Across social media and mainstream media almost every week someone new is being targeted, attacked, lynched. The International Press Institute (IPI) is looking into more than 2,000 separate cases of online abuse in Turkey directly targeting journalists. The impact of all this on women’s rights is enormous. When countries go backwards and slide into populism, authoritarianism and nationalism, women have more to lose than men. Today some of Turkey’s biggest fights for democracy are carried out by women. In 2016 the Turkish government put forward a bill that pardoned child rapists if they agreed to marry their underage victims. The MPs who came up with this abominable idea were clearly more interested in preserving an abstract notion of “family honour” than the lives of millions of women and girls. In the face of widespread reaction from the public, the bill was put on the backburner. But the same MPs were eventually able to pass another bill that allowed muftis, religious officials, to perform civil marriages. In a country where one out of every three marriages involves a child bride, this is a very dangerous development. It will increase the number of child brides and cases of polygamy. It will enable conservative/religious families to marry off their daughters at a younger age and without any supervision. When multiple women’s organisations expressed their concern about the bill, and women took to the streets to protest, President Erdogan said that it would be passed “whether you like it or not.” Domestic violence against women is escalating at a frightening rate and there is no investment in women’s shelters. The government’s rhetoric is based on the sanctity of motherhood and the sanctity of marriage. Under the AKP, women’s rights have been melting away. Meanwhile Islamist newspapers are running pieces against women’s shelters and some organisations are launching petitions to make women travel in “female priority” carriages on trains. Women-only pink buses are already running in several cities. Gender segregation will neither lessen sexual harassment nor provide a solution to the cycle of violence. “When women go to police or the prosecutor for protection, they are either sent back home, they try to reconcile [couples] or they receive a protection order only on paper,” says Gulsum Kav, of the We Will Stop Femicide organisation. Equally alarming are the changes in the education system: in the new curriculum Darwinism will not be taught. In the early 2000s around 60,000 students attended imam hatip schools, designed to train Muslim preachers. Today that number is 1.2 million. In order to avoid the Islamicisation of the national education system, the families who can afford it send their children to private schools. and the percentage of children in private education has increased from 7% to 20 %. There is also a sad exodus under way, and Turkey is experiencing a brain drain like never before. Many academics, intellectuals, activists, journalists, liberals and secularists are leaving the country. But many more remain. And they try to keep their spirits up. Turkey’s civil society is far in advance of its government and Turkey’s women are clearly not giving up the fight for their rights. This is still a country of mesmerising contrasts, brave and beautiful souls. But now, more than a decade after The Bastard of Istanbul was first published, it is heartbreaking to see that nations do not necessarily learn from their mistakes. History does not necessarily move forward. Sometimes it goes backwards. Turkey, once regarded as a glowing bridge between Europe and the Middle East, and a role model for the entire Muslim world, has become an undemocratic and an unhappy country. • Reading Europe – Turkey: The Bastard of Istanbul is on Radio 4 on 21 and 28 January at 3pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/22/housing-whistleblower-praised-by-corbyn-at-risk-of-eviction","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T12:04:51Z","webTitle":"Housing whistleblower praised by Corbyn at risk of eviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/22/housing-whistleblower-praised-by-corbyn-at-risk-of-eviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/22/housing-whistleblower-praised-by-corbyn-at-risk-of-eviction","fields":{"headline":"Housing whistleblower praised by Corbyn at risk of eviction","bodyText":"A whistleblower praised by Jeremy Corbyn for exposing how a housing association for vulnerable people tried to evict a dying man because of his “negative impact” on a proposed sale has himself been threatened with eviction from the same property. Rory Graham died from bladder cancer in November after being told by his landlord, Peter Bedford Housing Association (PBHA), which specialises in supporting excluded adults, that his continued occupation of his north London home for 24 years was “delaying the sale”. Before he died Graham, a retired biochemist with mental health problems, said he was being bullied and pestered to move by PBHA. Speaking to the Ham &amp; High local newspaper, he said: “I assumed they would lay off when I was collapsing with cancer, but they didn’t.” Graham’s plight was highlighted by Andrew Stanney, a former nurse who helped care for him in his final days and lives in one of the other eight flats in the converted house that PBHA is still trying to sell. Corbyn, who represents the neighbouring constituency, personally thanked Stanney for raising concerns about the case. After Stanney admitted to a PBHA official that he had contacted the media about his neighbour’s treatment, with Graham’s approval, he was warned he could also be evicted. It comes at time of growing concerns about poorer households being driven out of desirable areas by housing associations. The house, which is now worth up to £3m, is believed to have been donated to PBHA in the 1960s. Stanney is one of seven property guardians, who, as well as paying rent, currently occupy the house to help prevent vandalism, squatting and disrepair. Just before Christmas, Global Guardians, which manages the contract for PBHA as it tries to sell the home, warned him that he was in breach of the agreement by talking to the press. In reply, Stanney said he felt duty bound to raise concerns about Graham’s plight. He said: “Having supported vulnerable adults my whole lifetime, it was clear the duress Rory was under. His own eviction was contributing to his fight against cancer. Whilst I am aware of a non-disclosure case in my contract, I am also duty-bound to report issues around vulnerable adults.” When Stanney asked whether Global Guardians planned to evict him for breach of contract, it urged him to “refrain from discussing any details about the property owner or Global Guardians as this would attract unnecessary attention”. It also asked him to disclose what he had revealed. The company denied it had threatened him with eviction and insisted it had only reminded him of contractual obligations. Stanney told the Guardian he was aware of the risk of speaking out. But he added: “What happened to Rory was so moving, I just think sod this: if they try to evict me, I’ll just scream louder.” A local group, Heathview housing co-operative, is trying to persuade PBHA to allow it to manage the flats. Jessica Jacobs, the chair of Heathview, who met Graham before he died, said the property should return to social housing as a tribute to him. In a letter to PBHA, she said: “We all left feeling so sad that Rory would soon be ending his life with the same feeling of precariousness that he had first come to the housing association with … his legacy should not be lost.” Clare Norton, PBHA’s chief executive, said selling the house would help it invest in its other 270 properties and develop homes for people in need. She pointed out that the association offered Graham alternative flats before he died. “I don’t accept that we did pester and bully him. I do accept that it was distressing for Mr Graham, and that was very unfortunate,” she said. “We are a charity and it is incumbent on organisations who find themselves in difficult financial circumstances to maximise the resources that we have to help as many people as possible. We are not going to be able to achieve those things if we don’t sell that property.” Norton denied that PBHA had asked that Stanney be evicted for talking to the press and promised to look into his circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/20/namibia-desert-wildlife-holiday-empty-pico-iyer","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Damaraland, Namibia: where ‘each day lasts 100 hours’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/20/namibia-desert-wildlife-holiday-empty-pico-iyer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/20/namibia-desert-wildlife-holiday-empty-pico-iyer","fields":{"headline":"Damaraland, Namibia: where ‘each day lasts 100 hours’","bodyText":"I walked out into the desert just as the sun was beginning to show above the mountains. I’d been advised not to step out of my bungalow in north-west Namibia while it was dark: there were lion tracks only a few steps away. But now a spotted eagle owl was flapping out of the bushes and beating its broad white wings across the dry emptiness in front of me, and the world was reborn and golden. A guide at the lodge, Johan, had offered to take me on a walk across the red-dirt silence, and as we set off in the early light, he pointed out rhino tracks in the dust, and a path laid out by a mountain zebra. “Try not to step close to a rock,” he said – the landscape was nothing but rock – “there could be a horned adder underneath it.” This wasn’t music to the ears of someone who has phobic dreams about serpents even of the non-venomous kind. Namibia was, in fact, proving a challenge on every front to a decidedly urban creature who generally finds his delight amid the late-night commotion and cosmopolitan excitements of Havana or Beirut. A landscape of wild pigs and a Skeleton Coast had never held much appeal for me. But I’d been invited to give a talk in the southern African wilderness and the price of admission, I’d been told, was nine days of rattling across the desert. And as Johan led me through the stillness, gauging the wind with his fingers, pointing out black desert rhinos where I saw only rocks. I realised it wasn’t just all I was seeing that was opening me out, but also all that I couldn’t see or do. For once, I was living at a speed not determined by smartphone and text message and flashing bulletin; for days on end I heard no klaxon or siren or beep. The world was coming to me unedited, subtle and alive, and even though that made for challenges – was that a twig poking out from under the rock or a poisonous snake? I noticed that I never needed to check the time in Namibia. Every day lasted a hundred hours. “Listen,” said Johan, stopping with sudden intensity. “The roar of a lion! That’s a sound you’ll never forget. You feel it more than you hear it, no? It vibrates inside you. You can catch it five miles away.” Days earlier, the sound that vibrated most loudly across my life was the news headlines scrolled across the TV screen, announcing the same non-event they had announced nine months before on TV. It’s funny how challenges shift. My biggest challenge on holiday used to be filling the days till they burst. But what had looked to be the biggest challenge of a trip to Namibia – a country twice the size of California but with a population a fifth that of Greater Los Angeles – was turning out to be its biggest liberation. Within minutes of landing in the capital, Windhoek, I was stepping into a nine-seater plane to fly low above undulating sand dunes before touching down again not far from a river where four elephants were drinking from a water hole. We landed on a dusty airstrip in the middle of nothing, and a muddy jeep was waiting to bump me along a barely visible path and deposit me at a remote camp in Damaraland in north-central Namibia, 60km inland from the Skeleton Coast. That night, at a long table under the stars, the lodge’s regional manager threw back her head and cried, “Wow! Wow!! Wow!!!” Johan was pointing a laser torch to pick up patterns in the planetarium sky. Next morning, a villager called Bravo was picking up a piece of elephant dung and explaining how, as a Himba tribesman (he pointed out the palm frond-and-mud hut where he lived in his off hours) he heated up the mighty droppings and used them to cure headaches and nosebleeds. I knew that humans could restore the wild, but I’d never guessed that wilderness could so vividly restore humanity. As the days stretched on, I was freed from my customary vicious cycle – that I’m in such a hurry, I can’t see what a hurry I’m in. After a few days offline, I could see more clearly the two lawsproblems of being online: so long as I’m looking at a screen, I can’t see the larger picture; and so long as I’m connected to Beijing, Washington DC and Antarctica, I’ve lost all connection with what’s around me. As Johan instructed me in the forgotten luxuries of looking and listening, I realised that Namibia was giving me zoom-lens and wide-angle in the same breath, partly because I carried no camera. I walked through damp fog encircling the Hansel-and-Gretel cottages of Swakopmund – blond Germans were still everywhere – and visited a harbour town on the Atlantic only a few minutes from the desert. I came within a few feet of a leopard, crouched under a bush, and saw a pangolin bundle itself into a scaly ball that not even a lion could penetrate. I heard about the conservancy system that has given Namibia new hope: poachers, who know the land as they might a lover’s lips, have been appointed to be its caretakers, and villagers learn that they can earn more from sparing a rhino than from selling its horn for half a million Namibian dollars. The Queen of Wows, as I thought of her, told me how she’d ascended from doing the laundry at the lodge to overseeing a string of lodges across the region, and thereby supporting nine siblings and her father back in the village. Bravo explained how the dung showed that an elephant had passed through an hour ago, moving to the west. I couldn’t instant-message these pieces of information to a soul, which meant that they stayed inside me, reverberated in the silence and took root. The average person reading this article will take in more data today than Shakespeare did in his entire lifetime. Which means they aren’t really taking in much at all. In the desert I was returned to a human scale and the pleasure, at times, of there being nothing I could possibly do. At the end of my nine days in the wilderness, I noticed that I’d made exactly one phone call – from the capital, to remind my wife when I was coming home – and I hadn’t heard a word about presidential tweets, terror attacks or Kardashian body parts. The workers at a 90-room hotel one morning couldn’t find a way to open the cash register, which seemed an excellent augury; the international arrivals area at an airport turned out to be a tent. Were I Bravo or the Queen of Wows, I might well be hugely grateful for all the possibilities that Skype and smartphones and 24-hour news channels open up. But I was coming from the opposite end of the spectrum, an accelerating world gone dizzy with weapons of mass distraction, and it was almost shocking to encounter the world – the self – I seldom have time to notice these days. As we continued on our near-silent walk, Johan told me how he’d worked for three years in a bank in the city, until the woman he fell in love with asked him what made him truly feel rich. Slapped awake, he retuned to the stillness and a life outdoors. And I told I him how, when I began travelling, 30 years ago, most of us were hungry to get as much information as we could about the world; but now that the world is vibrating in our palms around the clock, all we seem to long for is the chance to get away from too much information and back into a clearing in which we can remember what we care about. I looked out at the mountains above the ochre path and realised that the old saw may actually be true: luxury is measured by all you can afford to do without. • Pico Iyer’s most recent book is The Art of Stillness (Simon &amp; Schuster, £7.99).

Quoting some frightening prices for receiving emergency treatment abroad, the FCO is hoping that the Costa del Insurance will be the first destination for British travellers during 2018. The FCO said it can cost from £4,000 for medical repatriation aftercare following a heart attack in France to £80,000 for an air ambulance due to a fractured hip in Thailand. Comparison website GoCompare makes similar warnings, citing the example of a woman who had a fall while skiing in Austria, tearing her anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and needing surgery to repair them. Her bill for treatment was £9,439. Travel insurance is by no means mandatory, and policies are often riddled with so many get-out clauses that plenty of consumers have been left wondering why they bothered. Many frequent travellers on short-hop trips to Europe will argue that insurance is barely worth the cost, and that the European Health Insurance Card (Ehic) provides a basic level of health protection. But Julia Longbottom, consular director at the Foreign Office, says arranging travel insurance should be at the top of your holiday essentials before heading overseas. “Travellers are losing thousands of pounds in medical bills and their families are having to find the money to help cover the cost or even repatriate them, Having the appropriate travel insurance in place will help ensure that you get the support you need, should something go wrong overseas.” she adds. She warns against relying on the Ehic as it does not cover some costs such as repatriation. Travellers should also remember that the level of free public healthcare can vary between countries, so British nationals may not have access to the same specialist treatment that they would at home, the FCO warns. There is also no clarity as to what happens to the Ehic after Brexit. But while basic travel policies are cheap and easy to buy for anyone who has not suffered serious medical problems, getting reasonably priced cover for those who have suffered serious medical problems can be a nightmare. Research by MoneySuperMarket.com this week found that premiums typically double or treble if the insured declares a significant previous problem such as a heart attack or angina. Last June, the Financial Conduct Authority asked for evidence of the challenges faced by consumers who have, or have had, cancer, in accessing affordable travel insurance. “The golden rule when arranging cover is to be scrupulously honest when asked about your medical history, even if you have fully recovered, are not taking medication or receiving treatment, and have been given the all-clear by your doctor. If you leave something out, the insurer might challenge your claim and ask to see your medical records, says MSM’s Kevin Pratt. Later this month, a new insurer is set to launch promising a fairer deal for those with previous conditions. Bought By Many says its customers won’t face a 30-minute interrogation into every aspect of their medical history. Instead, the company will ask whether their doctor has passed therm fit to travel. Bought By Many’s boss, Steven Mendel, says cancer suffers are regularly charged more than £2,000 to cover a week in Europe. “Getting a quote is a frustratingly slow process, with insurers asking intrusive medical questions. And prices are often high for people with the most serious conditions, meaning they may make the risky decision to travel without insurance and potentially face huge medical bills if they need treatment. Some decide not to travel at all,” he says. The company will formally launch on 22 January. Another company that claims to offer affordable cover for the over-65s with existing conditions is EhicPlus. Feeling lucky? If you choose not to declare a previous condition – accepting that you won’t be covered if it reoccurs – can the insurer turn down a medical claim for an unrelated matter? The Association of British Insurers says a failure to declare medical conditions could invalidate your policy if the withheld information would have led to the refusal of cover. In practice, it says, insurers will assess if any non-disclosure that has subsequently come to light was the cause of or a contributory factor to the claim. Non-disclosure of a heart condition may well not be connected to say, tripping over a paving stone and injuring your ankle. “In making this judgment insurers will seek expert medical guidance and will be mindful of the view that the financial ombudsman may take,” says a spokesman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/15/long-hunt-for-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T16:00:03Z","webTitle":"'We will get him': the long hunt for Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/long-hunt-for-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/15/long-hunt-for-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi","fields":{"headline":"'We will get him': the long hunt for Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi","bodyText":"Day and night for the past three years, an unprecedented number of the world’s spies have zeroed in on a patch of Iraq and Syria to hunt for one man. Their target, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terrorist group, has eluded them all. But only just. The most wanted man on the planet has been traced to a specific place at least three times in the past 18 months alone. And despite the protection of a devoted network, there have been other sightings of the reclusive leader, reported by Isis members shortly afterwards and confirmed later by intelligence officers. Being a fugitive in the digital age, or in a losing cause, clearly has its shortfalls. One 45-second mistake on 3 November 2016 almost cost Baghdadi his “caliphate” before its collapse last year. As Iraqi and Kurdish forces advanced on Mosul, Baghdadi took up a handheld radio in a village between the west of the city and the town of Tal Afar. Spies based in a listening post further north were stunned as his distinctive voice exhorted followers to stand their ground. “He spoke for 45 seconds and then his guards took the radio from him,” said a senior member of the Kurdistan Region Security Council who monitored the call. “They realised what he’d done.” That rare moment of ill discipline allowed the network of spies chasing Baghdadi to trace him in real time. But then, as on at least two other occasions, there was no time to act. Baghdadi’s entourage knew his cover had probably been blown and whisked him away. Late last year, he was also traced to a village south of Baaj, again through the brief and careless use of a communications device. The connection was picked up by a signals intelligence network that has penetrated web and phone use in Isis areas. However, it was too fleeting to deploy fighter jets circling above on permanent hunt for targets, and there was no confirmation of exactly where he was hiding. The morsels of chatter have helped fill in a picture of Baghdadi’s movements – and temperament; the cast-iron discipline of his immediate circle has weak spots after all. His senior leaders, however, have had far more trouble with communications discipline, and slip-ups have often led to their demise. According to Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi expert and writer on Isis, Baghdadi is literally the last man standing among the group’s founding members. “Out of 43 main leaders, Baghdadi is the only one left,” he said. “Out of 79 senior leaders there are only 10 left. The mid-level commanders (124) constantly change positions and posts due to deaths of other members. Every six months their roles change, they either get killed or replaced.” ‘Everything changed when he arrived’ Before being killed, some Isis leaders spoke on intercepted phones about having been in meetings with Baghdadi, or having known his movements. Their mistakes offered glimpses of his capacity and methods as leader. However, more has been gleaned about the terrorist tsar’s habits and leadership by people who have seen him regularly in parts of north-western Iraq and north-eastern Syria, and reported the encounters afterwards to regional and western spies. From late 2014 until her capture in May the following year, Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar had served tea to Baghdadi in the town of Omar in north-eastern Syria, whenever he came to visit her husband, the Isis oil “minister” Abu Sayyaf. “All I did is put the tea behind the door,” she told the Guardian. “But I knew he was there. He used to come often.” Bahar, otherwise known as Umm Sayyaf, said she was not allowed to see Baghdadi but was in no doubt when he was around. “He used to visit my husband and talk business. Everything changed when he arrived.” Abu Sayyaf was killed in a raid by US commandos, who took Bahar to Erbil, where she has been held ever since. She denies being a senior member of Isis, but her contact with the group’s leader has helped paint a picture of him. A more comprehensive psychological profile of Baghdadi and his movement patterns had been drafted by US and British spies by mid-2015. Two years later, his area of travel had shrunk, as had the Isis “caliphate”. Intelligence agencies in Iraq and Europe believe that for most of the past 18 months, Baghdadi has been based in a village south of Baaj, and has travelled in a small range between Abu Kamal, on the Iraq-Syria border, and Shirkat, south of Mosul. Three intelligence agencies have confirmed that Baghdadi was seriously wounded in an airstrike near Shirkat in early 2015. Separate sources have confirmed to the Guardian that he spent several months recovering in Baaj. Even now, his movements remain limited by his injuries. According to witnesses who saw him in Abu Kamal after the end of the Muslim festival of Ramadan, he was looking tired and drawn, a shadow of the confident, black-robed figure who ascended a pulpit in Mosul’s Great Mosque of al-Nuri in mid-2014 to proclaim the “caliphate’s establishment”. Hashimi said: “Isis has resorted to being a shadow government. They still control small parts of Anbar and Euphrates river but they are sleeper cells. There is no leadership structure, it has dissolved. They do not hold meetings any more – and if they do it is never in the same place twice. They don’t even pass oral messages to each other any more. They use Signal and Telegram [encrypted apps] to communicate. “They’ve cut back the men by 50%. The main budget cannot be touched any more. Leadership no longer matters. “I’ve met with [foreign fighter] Abu Hamza al-Belgiki, who feels betrayed, as do all of them. They had been instructed to fight for Mosul till their deaths. When the battles intensified in the city the senior leaders and those close to Baghdadi all fled, leaving these fighters behind. They feel fooled. They have been fooled.” Threat remains Throughout the rise and fall of Isis, a debate has continued in intelligence circles about whether Baghdadi being dead or alive would make a difference to the group, and if the organisation still poses a threat to regional order and global security. A senior regional intelligence figure and a counterpart in Europe both say the threat level from the organisation has barely changed, and that Baghdadi’s survival could be used by his followers as a rallying call. Officials say the branch responsible for planning attacks abroad has been left relatively unscathed by the losses of fighters and land. “They are a complex administration filled with ex-intelligence officials,” Hashimi said. “They deal with recruiting, arming and transporting fighters and collect the financial contributions and alms. Out of 35 branches, 33 are run by two Iraqi men: Abdullah Youssef al-Khatouri, nicknamed Abu Bakr, and Abu Tiba Ghanem al-Jboori. We believe one is in Turkey and the other is in Scandinavia.” Shiraz Maher, the deputy director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, at King’s College London, said Isis was trying to convince its followers that military defeat had changed little, particularly in its capacity for planning attacks abroad. “In the next 24 months there will be concerted attempts to attack the west,” Maher said. “The narrative of vengeance is important. “What we are seeing in the support community is a fatalistic resignation about what has happened. “In their narrative, they say the US could only defeat the “caliphate” by attacking it from the air but didn’t have the guts to fight on the ground. Had that been the case, they say, they would have won. “Isis says it will return, and in the meantime it’s asking people to carry out attacks in its name. They’re also repositioning themselves politically, for example, with Trump’s declaration on Jerusalem, claiming to be the rightful guardians of that cause. This is the mutation of an idea, not the end of it.” And as Isis regroups, so does Baghdadi. A US military assessment is that he is probably hiding in the Euphrates river valley, along the border with Syria. However, regional officials say he has returned to a tract of land between the Tharthar basin and the desert, nearer to where it all began for the now diminished leader and his downsized terror group. “He’s on his last legs,” a regional official said. “We will get him this year. Finally.” Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/11/arthur-miller-scorned-public-mourners-of-marilyn-monroe-archive-reveals-harry-ransom-center","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T16:21:50Z","webTitle":"Arthur Miller scorned 'public mourners' of Marilyn Monroe, archive sale reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/11/arthur-miller-scorned-public-mourners-of-marilyn-monroe-archive-reveals-harry-ransom-center","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/11/arthur-miller-scorned-public-mourners-of-marilyn-monroe-archive-reveals-harry-ransom-center","fields":{"headline":"Arthur Miller scorned 'public mourners' of Marilyn Monroe, archive sale reveals","bodyText":"Arthur Miller’s anger at the death of his second wife Marilyn Monroe is expressed in an excoriating and never before published essay from 1962, in which the playwright attacks the “public mourners” who “stand there weeping and gawking, glad that it is not you going into the earth, glad that it is this lovely girl who at last you killed”. The playwright’s essay is one of many unpublished works found in an extensive archive of manuscripts, notebooks and letters that has just been acquired by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, for a sum the New York Times put at $2.7m (£2m). Drafts of Miller’s plays All My Sons, Death of a Salesman, The Crucible and A View From the Bridge are in the archive, which the Times said stretched to “322 linear feet of material”. There are also more than 50 of the journals in which the playwright recorded ideas, drafts, bits of dialogue and reflections on his life, from the 1940s to the 2000s. “It’s rare to see a writer document his process in such a rich and complete way,” said Eric Colleary, the Ransom Center’s Cline curator of theatre and performing arts. “Given the scope and scale of Miller’s archive, researchers and artists can look forward to significant new insights into one of America’s greatest playwrights and public intellectuals.” Many unpublished works feature in the archive, including the 1962 essay about the death of Monroe – to whom he was married from 1956-61 – which Miller revised over a number of years but never published. “Instead of jetting to the funeral to get my picture taken I decided to stay home and let the public mourners finish the mockery,” he wrote. “Not that everyone there will be false, but enough. Most of them there destroyed her, ladies and gentlemen.” Part of the archive relates to the investigation into Miller by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Miller’s play about the Salem witch trials, The Crucible, drew heavy parallels with the communist witch-hunts of the time. Miller refused to support the decision by director Elia Kazan to provide the names of suspected communists to the committee, and in a 1952 letter to Kazan’s wife Molly, who had attacked him for this decision and for drawing parallels between witches and communists in The Crucible, he defended his approach. “This committee’s mentality, and the atmosphere which it has engendered after almost 15 years of ceaseless propaganda, are such as to throw perfectly honest people into a kind of nameless fear which is utterly destructive of a sane order of life,” wrote Miller. In another response to criticism of The Crucible – this time from the American Bar Association, for being “disparaging of lawyers” – Miller also showed his lifelong commitment to defending free speech. “The growing sensitivity of people to any sort of open and frank discussion of important issues is no service to civilisation, let alone law and order. I wrote a play about a man who happened to be a salesman, and several organisations of sales people flew to arms. Now it is the lawyers. If I am to back away from these objections you must surely see that I shall be forced to write about people with no occupation whatever,” he responded in 1953. “But then café society will probably feel put-upon … In defense of my right to speak, therefore, and to write the truth as I see it, I must insist upon the play as it stands.” The Ransom Center, which is already home to archives of playwrights including Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett and David Mamet, said that Miller first donated early play manuscripts and notebooks to its collection in the early 1960s, and that the new acquisition “greatly extends” its archive. “Arthur Miller is one of our country’s finest playwrights, one who gave dramatic form to themes that are central to our still-evolving American story,” said Ransom Center director Stephen Enniss. “For years to come, all primary source research into this major American playwright’s life and work will begin here.” Miller’s son Robert A Miller said that the family was “pleased to have found a fitting home for Dad’s voluminous notes”. The new materials will be catalogued within two years, and the collection will then be available to researchers and the public."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/11/rodin-work-show-parthenon-marbles-london-british-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T20:00:37Z","webTitle":"Rodin's work to go on show in London next to Parthenon marbles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/11/rodin-work-show-parthenon-marbles-london-british-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/11/rodin-work-show-parthenon-marbles-london-british-museum","fields":{"headline":"Rodin's work to go on show in London next to Parthenon marbles","bodyText":"The French sculptor Auguste Rodin is returning to the British Museum, which in his lifetime he visited so often he said he “haunted” it. His own works, and drawings he made on notepaper filched from his hotel just across the road, will be displayed beside some of the Parthenon marbles, which he regarded as the greatest works of art of all time. The loans coming from Paris, for the exhibition opening on 26 April, will include Rodin’s own copy of his most famous sculpture, The Kiss, a work seen as shockingly erotic in his day. The plaster cast, kept in his studio for the rest of his life, was made from the original marble, and later versions of the sculpture were copied from it. It will be displayed beside the ancient Greek statues that inspired it, the two reclining goddesses, one lying voluptuously back across the lap of her companion, from the east pediment of the Parthenon. Rodin’s figures are naked, and the women clothed – the museum’s curator Ian Jenkins described them as “eroticised by their draperies” – but both groups were carved from single massive blocks of marble. The goddesses lost their heads in antiquity, while the heads of Rodin’s couple are blurring back into their marble. “The Kiss is the finest and most relevant response in art to the Parthenon sculptures,” Jenkins said. Another of the Rodin sculptures depicts the goddess Athene wearing the Parthenon on her head as a diadem. Jenkins suggests that Rodin has portrayed her actually giving birth to the temple, as she herself was born from the head of Zeus. The exhibition will recreate the effect Rodin himself sought in displays in his studio, where he showed his new works side by side with classical sculptures. The loans from Paris – Rodin left the entire contents of his home and studio to the French state on his death in 1917 – will include some of the fragments of antique marble he collected by the crate load, including shattered heads, disembodied arms, hands, eyes, lips, a single sandalled foot, and scores of fingers and toes. Rodin revered above all the 5th century BC Greek sculptor Phidias, believed to be the genius who designed the Parthenon sculptures, though the actual marble carving would have been carried out – as Rodin’s was – by craftsmen following his clay originals. Bénédicte Garnier, curator of the Musée Rodin, said the sculptor cherished the belief that some of his fragments were the work of Phidias. “We believe now sadly that this is not true – but it is possible that some of them could perhaps have been part of the Parthenon.” Creating the exhibition will involve partly emptying one of the British Museum’s most popular and most controversial galleries, built to house the Parthenon marbles stripped from the Acropolis in Athens by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century. Their arrival in the UK was contentious then and has been ever since, with repeated demands from the Greek authorities for their return. Some of the most superb of the carvings, including figures from the pediment and the frieze, will be moved into the Rodin exhibition: Jenkins said it was the most significant intervention since the present gallery was created. One panel from the Parthenon frieze, a man turning back and shading his head to call to his companion, will be paired with the sculpture in which Rodin came closest to direct imitation. His Age of Bronze, a standing naked man with one arm raised, was so realistic the artist was accused of casting the bronze from a plaster cast taken from a living man. In other works, he emulated the battered originals by creating figures without heads or arms. “By doing so he created a new genre of contemporary art – the headless, limbless torso,” Jenkins said. Rodin never actually visited Greece. His knowledge of the Parthenon came from books, and the sculptures in the Louvre and the British Museum. He first visited the Bloomsbury museum in 1881, and returned at least 15 times. In 1902 he said “in my spare time I simply haunt the British Museum”. His last visit was months before his death in 1917. He usually stayed in the Thackeray, directly opposite the main entrance of the museum. In 1915, it was advertising “electric light throughout, bathrooms on every floor”, and offering bed, breakfast and table d’hôte dinner for 8s 6d – but rather surprisingly for the temporary home of a French artist, it also boasted that it was a temperance hotel. Hartwig Fischer, director of the British Museum, said that although other artists had been inspired by the Parthenon sculptures, Rodin had responded “with a passion that was to last a lifetime”.

Jürgen Klopp is keen to add the Guinea international to his squad for the second half of the season following the £142m sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona. An agreement to purchase Keïta for his £48m release clause this summer was settled last August, with Liverpool also expected to pay a premium of around £6m to complete the central midfielder’s move to Anfield. However after Coutinho’s British record transfer to Barça last week, Klopp is hopeful Leipzig could be persuaded to allow the 22-year-old to leave five months earlier than planned. Despite failing to reach the Champions League knockout stage, the Bundesliga side are understood to be reluctant to sanction the move this month and have asked Liverpool to increase their offer by €20m (£17.8m). That would take the total cost of the transfer past the £70m mark, with Klopp having already spent £75m bringing in the defender Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in this window. Leipzig are fifth in the Bundesliga table before the resumption of the league programme this weekend and would prefer to keep Keïta until the end of the season as they attempt to qualify for the Champions League once more. They also face Napoli in the last 32 of the Europa League next month, although reports in Germany have suggested the player signed from Leipzig’s sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2016 has been pushing for an early move to Anfield. Keïta will meet Leipzig officials before the weekend to discuss his situation, although the coach, Ralph Hasenhüttl, insisted on Thursday he does not expect his star player to leave the club this month. “Nothing has changed,” he said. “We don’t have reason to sell before the summer. I think Naby wants to finish the season in a good way in Leipzig.” Nonetheless Keïta is believed to have stopped learning German and instead started English classes as he prepares for life in the Premier League. He was pictured at training on Thursday before Saturday’s match against Schalke amid speculation his move could be close. Klopp has previously indicated he is in no rush to find a replacement for Coutinho. Monaco’s Thomas Lemar – who is valued at £90m – is under serious consideration but is likely to be targeted in the summer if the Keïta deal can be brought forward. However the Monaco coach, Leonardo Jardim, has admitted he would be powerless to stop the 22-year-old leaving if his valuation is met. “Today the market is open. You know how crazy the market is,” he said on Thursday. “Things happen that even a club like Monaco cannot say no to. It happened to Liverpool [with Coutinho]. Things are as they are. The numbers today are incredibly big. Everything can change. The things I can say today are not true tomorrow. “In the last two transfer windows, last summer and this winter, the numbers have gone up enormously. I still want to keep Lemar. If I stay here for 10 years I want Lemar to stay with me for 10 years. He is young, he can still play for 10 years. He has a lot of qualities, I like him a lot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/12/hmrc-struggling-fallout-paradise-papers-leak","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T00:01:14Z","webTitle":"HMRC 'struggling to deal with fallout of Paradise Papers leak'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/12/hmrc-struggling-fallout-paradise-papers-leak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/12/hmrc-struggling-fallout-paradise-papers-leak","fields":{"headline":"HMRC 'struggling to deal with fallout of Paradise Papers leak'","bodyText":"HM Revenue and Customs is struggling to cope with a growing workload, including investigating revelations contained within the Paradise Papers, according to parliament’s spending watchdog. The public accounts committee has warned that it is “far from confident” that the tax authority has sufficient resources to scrutinise claims published in the Guardian last year arising from a leak of 13.4m files. In a report released on Thursday, MPs concluded that the Paradise Papers leak had highlighted the “potentially dubious practices of many high-profile individuals and corporations” that use offshore tax havens. The committee said the tax authority was having to make tough decisions about the allocation of its own resources, while implementing Brexit changes and 15 major programmes across government. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said that HMRC’s “high-wire act” is facing “potentially catastrophic consequences” for taking on too many tasks at the same time.” She added: “HMRC accepts something has to give and it now faces difficult decisions on how best to use its limited resources – decisions that must give full consideration to the needs of all taxpayers. “These are serious, pressing challenges for HMRC, requiring swift and coordinated action in government.” Most of the documents – 6.8m – relate to a law firm and corporate services provider that operated together in 10 jurisdictions. Among dozens of revelations, which were published in 96 media outlets, the papers showed how the Queen’s private estate invested in a Cayman Islands fund and the offshore dealings by Donald Trump’s cabinet members. The report points out that a previous leak of data, known as the Panama Papers, resulted in 66 criminal or civil investigations and an expected additional tax revenue of £100m. MPs have recommended that the tax authority should respond to the latest disclosures by March and tell the committee how much additional revenue is likely to be at stake. “HMRC now claims to be better equipped to deal promptly with any large-scale leak of data,” the report said. “However, the speed with which cases can be investigated depends on whether they are civil or criminal, as criminal cases will take longer to prepare. We are far from confident that HMRC has sufficient resources to deal with the full scale of the recent allegations.” It points out that HMRC has requested documentation but has not yet received a response. A Guardian spokesman said the tax authority has powers to request data from the organisations concerned and investigate these matters. “We have only had access to the data through our partners at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),” he said. “We understand that HMRC has already been in touch with them.” Tax officials have told the committee that projects linked to the UK’s EU withdrawal could add 15% to its workload, the report said. The committee said the transformation programme under way at HMRC – involving office closures, relocation of staff into 13 regional centres and digitalisation of tax returns – is “not deliverable” as originally envisaged due to the increased pressures. It added that the agency estimates it will fall short of its 2020 target of £717m savings by £10m. It gave HMRC a deadline of April to set out how it will respond to growing pressures. Revenue sources said that the BBC, ICIJ and the Guardian have not yet handed over documentation related to the Paradise Papers, which could take months to analyse. An HMRC spokesperson said: “Following the Paradise Papers data leak, HMRC continues to look very closely at the information disclosed in the public domain, to see if it reveals anything new that could add to existing leads and investigations. “Since 2010, HMRC has secured an extra £160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance, including £2.8bn from customers who tried to hide money abroad to avoid paying what they owe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/11/wolff-fire-and-fury-administration-author","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T17:39:57Z","webTitle":"My problem with Fire and Fury?

The behind-the-scenes toadying it took","bodyText":"Michael Wolff, author of the White House expose Fire and Fury, has been subject to a lot of comparisons this week – mostly to his own target, Donald Trump. How fitting, it is remarked, that an author who some say operates under the banner of “truthiness” – that is, with a certain elastic approach to fact – should be the man to take down its greatest practitioner. The person I’ve thought about in relation to Wolff, however, is Joe McGinniss, the author of Fatal Vision – a true crime book published in 1983 that attracted a notorious lawsuit by its subject, Jeffrey MacDonald. MacDonald, who was serving a life sentence for murdering his wife and two children, sought damages on the basis that McGinniss had gained access to him under false pretences, feigning belief in his innocence, then putting out a book condemning his guilt and diagnosing him as a “narcissistic sociopath”. What was remarkable about this case was the sympathy drummed up by the lawyers for MacDonald, whose hurt feelings and sense of betrayal were considered by at least half the jury to be persuasive enough to punish the journalist who caused them. When the jury failed to return a verdict, the publishers settled out of court with MacDonald for a sum in the hundreds of thousands. MacDonald posed no danger to the free world, of course. He was a common murderer. But the distaste reserved for journalists who flatter and seduce in person only to murder in print is one that has been largely turned on its head by Wolff. Look at me, he has implied: while other journalists have been consistent in their toadying, only I have had the courage to flatter Trump then reverse-toady. Make no mistake, Wolff’s toadying was spectacular. As Jonathan Martin points out in the New York Times this week, the opening of Fire and Fury paints a vivid portrait of a dinner in which Trump, Roger Ailes and Steve Bannon are quoted at length, but in which the author fails to disclose that the venue – a “Greenwich townhouse” – was his own, and he the host. It is assumed that the stakes are so high, the ends justify the means and, rightly, no one is feeling sorry for Trump. For many journalists, however, the methodology behind Fire and Fury leaves a slight queasiness: a suspicion that the sucking-up part of Wolff’s approach is not entirely explained away by the heroism of a man in “deep cover”. Doctor dilemma An acquaintance whose wife is expecting their first baby asks if I can recommend a paediatrician, and I hesitate before answering. My children’s doctor, apart from bearing a resemblance to Harold Shipman, meets our needs in every way. He is kind and efficient and a prompt returner of phone calls. I know from other New York parents, however, that his approach is unusual for this city. “He’s quite … relaxed,” I say, and my acquaintance looks taken aback. “I mean, 99% of the time he tends to think your kid is OK.” “Oh no,” said the man. “No, no, no. My wife is a type-A New Yorker, that’s not going to work.” “Yeah,” I shrug. “He’s a good doctor for a British person. But it sounds as if you should carry on looking.” Golden oldie There was a brief flap over the appearance of Kirk Douglas at the Golden Globes, and whether it was impolitic to invite the old rogue to a ceremony pushing back against sexual harassment. But all I could wonder at was how a human being could look so old and not only continue to function, but be poured into a suit and wheeled out on stage. Douglas at 101 was like something from Black Mirror, a spectacle that at least afforded us a break from partisan division for a nightmare – extreme old age – we can all get behind fearing. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/21/starwatch-moon-star-clusters-pleiades-hyades","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T21:30:31Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: the moon and a pair of star clusters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/21/starwatch-moon-star-clusters-pleiades-hyades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/21/starwatch-moon-star-clusters-pleiades-hyades","fields":{"headline":"Starwatch: the moon and a pair of star clusters","bodyText":"The Moon approaches two star clusters on the evening of 26 January.

The nature of the opponent means Jürgen Klopp may decide to play things safer than normal, and specifically in midfield – deploying former City player James Milner alongside, say, Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can. Alternatively, Klopp may decide to be Klopp and simply go for it. That could be revealing in terms of how he sees the centre of his team shaping up post-Coutinho. There has been talk of a specific player having been targeted to fill the gap, but in the short term Klopp will have to look from within, which will likely mean a place for the fit-again Adam Lallana. The more interesting choice would arguably be Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who after a slow start to life at Anfield has impressed on a consistent basis. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s desire is to play centrally regularly and he may now get his wish, starting with Sunday’s mouthwatering contest. SN Oxlade-Chamberlain senses chance to step up for Liverpool Liverpool must pay extra £18m to bring forward Keïta deal 2) Underrated Mahrez has a chance to shine No one doubts the class of the 2015 player of the year, Eden Hazard, but could it be that the 2016 winner of that award is underrated? Leicester are not complaining but the lack of offers for Riyad Mahrez so far this month is puzzling because he would enhance any squad in the Premier League. It is true that unlike Coutinho, for instance, Mahrez allowed his performances to dip when he wanted a move away but that is far from unusual and his ability remains exceptional, as he has demonstrated again in recent months. There is every chance of him serving another reminder of his rare ability this weekend at Stamford Bridge, the new home of Ross Barkley, who hopes to one day become as good as the Algerian. That might help attract bids from hesitant suitors and, more pertinently as far as Leicester are concerned, bring closer the prospect of Leicester returning to Europe next season. PD Football Weekly Extra: Carabao Cup semis and VAR in action 3) Wenger wary of repeat performance from winger Fraser When Bournemouth met Arsenal at the Vitality Stadium last season, Arsène Wenger’s side were simply unable to cope with the searing pace of Ryan Fraser and found themselves 3-0 down, only to mount a stirring comeback to rescue a point once the winger was forced off through injury. The Scotland international has been a regular in the Cherries’ line-up since scoring against Southampton in early December and will surely be given the opportunity to repeat his heroics of a just over a year ago. With Fraser having notched a further confidence-boosting brace against Everton in his most recent Premier League excursion, Arsenal’s defenders will need their wits about them to stop history repeating itself. Serving the final match of his touchline ban, their manager could endure an uncomfortable afternoon in the Vitality Stadium press box. BG Manchester United offer Arsenal £25m for Sánchez Wilshere says ankle injury is not as bad as first feared Barney Ronay: Wenger gets a hack’s view of the action 4) Allardyce to stick with pace attack against Spurs? Everton’s season is in effect over. Out of Europe and both domestic cups following last Friday’s FA Cup defeat to Liverpool, Sam Allardyce’s men have 16 Premier League fixtures to play, knowing they are in no real danger of getting relegated and will struggle to secure a Europa League place. Motivation may be hard to come by for those in blue as they face Tottenham at Wembley but that should not be the case for Allardyce, if he is keen on remaining as manager beyond this campaign. The 63-year-old has done a good job dragging Everton up the table and making them more defensively solid but his approach has been less than adventurous. This has to improve if Allardyce is going to be accepted long-term by most Everton supporters – but hope can be taken from the arrival of new £27m striker Cenk Tosun and the performance at Anfield. Ademola Lookman, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Yannick Bolasie looked a real threat as an advanced unit, linking up well and going forward at pace, seen most clearly in Sigurdsson’s equaliser. It will be intriguing to see if Allardyce starts all four players against Tottenham. After all, his job prospects may depend on it. SN Allardyce heads to Wembley with nothing to lose but Everton future 5) Pellegrino the latest manager on borrowed time Mauricio Pellegrino comes across as an intelligent man so he will be fully aware of just how precarious his position is right now. Following Stoke City’s sacking of Mark Hughes, Southampton are the only club in the bottom four not to have changed their manager this season, while two clubs just above them – Crystal Palace and West Ham United – have prospered having made such a change. There is only a limited amount of time before the powers-that-be at St Mary’s decide enough is enough. Under Pellegrino’s charge, Southampton have won just four league games and appear to have lost any semblance of an identity. They are neither exciting going forward or particularly sturdy at the back and relegation has become a real possibility – Southampton are currently out of the drop zone on goal difference alone. Pellegrino badly needs something from their trip to out-of-form Watford. Lose and it is hard not to see a Premier League trigger being pulled yet again. SN Where have the Premier League’s mid-table clubs gone? 6) Burnley to rediscover form at Selhurst Park? Burnley have rightly received a lot of praise this season, but Sean Dyche’s men are in a slump right now and are in danger of undoing their good work from the first half of the campaign. While they can be excused the 4-1 beating at Manchester City in the FA Cup and deserve credit for securing a 2-2 draw at Manchester United on Boxing Day, there have also been some disappointing results in a six-game winless run, including a goalless draw at Huddersfield and a last-gasp 2-1 defeat to Liverpool. Burnley travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday in seventh but could find themselves steadily sliding down the table if they don’t start winning soon. Dyche can take heart from their last trip to Selhurst Park for a 2-0 victory in April. For supporters and neutrals who would love to see Burnley maintain their pursuit of European football, now would be the ideal time for a repeat result. SN Crystal Palace close in on Getafe goalkeeper Guaita Burnley sign Spurs winger Nkoudou on loan 7) Newcastle hope to cope without captain Lascelles Rafa Benítez will be well aware that Carlos Carvalhal masterminded two victories over his team while in charge of Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship last season. Despite the renowned passion of their supporters, Newcastle’s record at home this season is far from special: three wins in 11 league games, the most recent coming against Crystal Palace in October. Swansea will fancy their chances against a team once again deprived of their captain Jamaal Lascelles, who was injured last weekend. Newcastle have lost four of the five league matches they have played without their central defender this season, conceding an average of three goals per defeat. In the 17 games he has played, the average number of goals they have shipped is less than one. While it would be misguided to suggest these statistics are entirely down to Lascelles, they provide fairly incontrovertible evidence that his influence cannot be overstated. BG Newcastle set to decide on Beardsley’s future next week 8) Will West Brom’s long wait for a league win go on? When Brighton whupped West Brom 3-1 in September, it was the Seagulls’ first top-flight win for 34 years. That would be like if West Brom did not win again in the Premier League until 2051. Can you imagine that? Yes, you probably can. Victory has proved beyond the Baggies in all of their last 20 league matches, including the last eight under Alan Pardew. That does not necessarily mean the club was wrong to ditch Tony Pulis but does increase the doubts about the wisdom of replacing him with Pardew. The new manager has at least tried to make West Brom more adventurous but without tangible reward. The strikers remain erratic and there has been little improvement in the supply lines, with Nacer Chadli and Grezgorz Krychowiak still below par andSam Field, whose emergence was the highlight of Gary Megson’s caretaker tenure, fading from view. If they lose to Brighton again they will be 10 points below Chris Hughton’s side and ominously adrift of almost everyone else, too. PD No action taken against Livermore over altercation with fan 9) Reinforced Huddersfield seek statement win As in the last transfer window, Huddersfield have acted quickly and shrewdly this month, strengthening areas that needed addressing. The signing of Terence Kongolo and likely arrival of Norwich’s Alex Pritchard give David Wagner important new options and it will be interesting to see how he uses them. Kongolo is available to face West Ham and his arrival on loan from Monaco offers the possibility of introducing a back three. That might be one way for Huddersfield to increase their firepower, especially if Pritchard arrives to share creative duties with Aaron Mooy. West Ham could have several injury absentees so their visit to the John Smith’s Stadium represents a good chance for Huddersfield to move a step closer to survival while ensuring West Ham remain in danger. PD Transfer window interactive: the biggest January deals 10) A happy Monday for post-Hughes Stoke? Like the revolution, the first match of Stoke’s post-Mark Hughes era will be televised, as they travel to Manchester United on Monday night. At the time of writing, the identity of Hughes’ replacement is yet to be confirmed, but whoever is in charge for this match, it constitutes something of a free swing for a team in the relegation zone but far from doomed. Given the likelihood of a new manager bounce (or perhaps more pertinently, the old manager’s absence) and the fact Stoke are unbeaten in eight Monday night Premier League matches, it would not be a huge surprise to see the Potters emerge with a point.

To explain: it would be a tad unfair to blame the demise of Countdown on the death of Richard Whiteley; it’s not as if the show’s producers made an executive decision to have him rubbed out to cut costs. But it would also be disingenuous not to acknowledge the show’s painful decline since his passing, a decline during which the shark has been vaulted time and again. SHARK No 1: the show’s inability to settle on a decent replacement for Whiteley. Warm, suave, ladies-of-a-certain-age’s man Des Lynam seemed the perfect successor, but when it became apparent that neither he (based in Worthing) nor the show (Leeds) were willing to relocate for the purposes of convenience, he was rejected like a bad organ. Des O’Connor came and went in a pastel-coloured blur of oily smarm and presentational incompetence. Then came Jeff Stelling, a fine broadcaster when it comes to communicating the giddy excitement of a late Hartlepool equaliser on Soccer Saturday, a fish entirely out of water on a pensioner-friendly TV quizshow. Finally, in 2012, Countdown settled upon Nick Hewer. A man entirely lacking in stage craft, personal warmth or charisma, Hewer was previously best known for his “Yes, absolutely, Sir Alan” role in The Apprentice. Since moving to his front-of-house position, Hewer has been as ill-at-ease as a journeyman bass guitarist suddenly called upon to provide Slash-style shredding. He is, frankly, hopeless; his grey functionality the polar opposite of Whiteley’s freewheeling, gormless charm. When he attempts to weave an anecdote, time seems to stretch and warp like the liquid metal flesh of the T-1000. Except much less interesting than that sounds. SHARK No 2: the failure to replace Carol Vorderman. The one thing anchoring Countdown to its glorious past was cut loose in 2008 in an unforgivably public display of cost-cutting. She was replaced by Rachel Riley, a ruthlessly efficient maths automaton seemingly assembled by a committee of single male World of Warcraft enthusiasts with but a tiny iota of Vorderman’s chutzpah and sense of the absurd. Since leaving Countdown, Vorderman has been living la vida loca in a way that somehow seems at odds with Riley’s froideur: learning how to fly planes, hanging out backstage with Rag’n’Bone Man and basically hammering home that she is not just too expensive for Countdown, she’s bigger than it as well. Truly, you don’t know what you’ve got till it, or in this case she, is gone. SHARK No 3: a much smaller shark – perhaps a hammerhead, but a shark nevertheless – has been the show’s recent random selections of micro-celebrities to sit in Dictionary Corner alongside Susie Dent. The policy seems to be “flick to any page in the Red Pages and stick a pin in it” – recent “GODs” (Guardians of Dictionary) include June Sarpong, TV money-saving bore Martin Lewis, Jack Whitehall’s dad and the bloke who played Boycie. Put it all together, and you have a Countdown that is a hunched, wan shadow of its glorious former self.

Her follow-up, The Light Jar, is another mystery/thriller wrapped around psychological themes. Nate’s dad ran off with a colleague when he was six. Now 11, Nate and his mum are bedding down in an abandoned cottage, on the run from Gary, her emotionally abusive boyfriend. When his mother fails to return from a shopping trip, Nate must fend for himself – and convince Kitty, a girl who lives in the neighbouring stately home, that he has not been abandoned. Domestic abuse is tricky territory for young readers (this is a “middle-grade” novel, as Americans have it), and there are moments here when Nate – and Kitty’s – predicaments feel almost unbearably bleak. There is a terrifying passage in which Nate has a panic attack in an enclosed space, and we come to understand his attachment to a jar filled with fairy lights that he keeps by his bed. Plotting is Thompson’s forte – she deftly handles a thread in which Nate and Kitty solve clues from a decades-old treasure hunt, and her drip-feeding of details about Gary’s nastiness and Kitty’s tragic backstory had me rushing to turn the page. Less successful are Thompson’s dips into magical realism. Passages in which imaginary friends turn up to help Nate navigate his troubles are presented as routine, with none of the transporting imagery of the best fantasy writing.

And we can listen to the BBC’s Ed Stourton weaving it again on Radio 4 this week’s Book of the Week, his own Auntie’s War. It goes like this. The commitment to truth in the news led to huge respect, not just at home but across Europe. From a dull, preachy, rather puritanical radio station among so many, it became a beacon of hope. This was largely true, but the real question is: who was primarily responsible for it? Because, like all the official BBC histories, this one sidesteps the real issue – the furious struggle in and around the BBC over wartime broadcasting to Europe, and the role of the controversial figure in charge, Noel Newsome. As director of European broadcasts, Newsome led what is still the biggest broadcasting operation ever mounted, in 25 different languages for a total of just over 25 hours a day, across three wavelengths. It was he who set out the strategy to use news as a weapon on war – it had to be not just true but also recognisably British. Newsome and his deputy, Douglas Ritchie, presided over the V for Victory campaign, designed to foment a spirit of resistance in occupied Europe – so successful that Joseph Goebbels tried to organise his own V campaign to subvert it. And it was Newsome who, frustrated with the pettifogging delays of the BBC bureaucracy, persuaded the Foreign Office to take control of the European Service from the BBC. In practice, he came under the control of the diplomat Ivone Kirkpatrick, the man who had just interviewed Rudolf Hess after his unexpected flight to the UK, and “Kirk” let Newsome get on with the job. Stourton’s book tells the story with great atmosphere and names Newsome and Ritchie properly. But even in the book, he does not get to the real reasons why the BBC is still so nervous about it. There was postwar embarrassment at the BBC about the V for Victory campaign and its instructions for sabotage, assassination and industrial action in the sort of style that would later be used for making Christmas decorations or collecting silver paper for the lifeboats. But it seems likely that it was the bid for independence from the BBC which was never forgiven by Auntie. Newsome was sacked by the BBC at the end of the war and remains almost unmentioned in the official BBC histories. “There were giants in Bush House at that time, and battles of giants,” wrote a member of his staff, Maurice Latey, later eastern Europe editor. “At the centre the massive figure of Noel Newsome … engaged in epic contests with Hugh Greene, in charge of German broadcasts – six or seven feet of quiet implacable determination beside a basilisk stare – and the late Darsie Gillie, in charge of French broadcasts, six or seven feet of gesticulating vehemence which earned him the nick-name of ‘the semaphore’.” The two-hour BBC epic to celebrate 50 years from VE Day in 1995, a two-part documentary called What Did You Do in the War Auntie?, devoted just seven minutes to the European Service. Only a few of the Colonel Britton broadcasts by Ritchie, or Newsome’s The Man in the Street broadcasts, remain in the BBC’s archives. History was also in the hands of Newsome’s bitterest critic. Hugh Greene was to inherit the world as director general. Newsome had to wait for the historian Asa Briggs, in his mammoth history of broadcasting in the UK in 1970, to give him his place as “the central figure in the organisation … and the most industrious, lively and imaginative of all its wartime recruits”. I never met Newsome (full disclosure: he married a relative of mine). He died in 1976. But it was Newsome and Ritchie who really created the myth of the BBC, by using news as a weapon – not quite what the myth suggests – with all the resources of culture and music and humour. Hitler’s propaganda chief Goebbels warned in 1944: “There is one way in which the British, despite the narrowness of their political thinking, are ahead of us – they know that news can be a weapon and are experts in its strategy.” So they seem to have been right. It is time they took their full places in the history books. • David Boyle is author of The Berlin Affair, an Enigma thriller"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/11/number-of-a-and-e-patients-treated-within-four-hours-at-lowest-ever-level","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T12:02:53Z","webTitle":"Percentage of A&E patients treated within four hours at lowest ever level","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/11/number-of-a-and-e-patients-treated-within-four-hours-at-lowest-ever-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/11/number-of-a-and-e-patients-treated-within-four-hours-at-lowest-ever-level","fields":{"headline":"Percentage of A&E patients treated within four hours at lowest ever level","bodyText":"The percentage of A&amp;E patients being treated within the politically important four-hour target has reached its lowest ever level, with hospitals managing to care for just 77.3% of patients within that time last month – far fewer than the 95% target covering all types of urgent and emergency care. Fewer than four out of five patients were treated and then admitted, discharged or transferred by emergency departments based at hospitals in England during December, what the NHS calls type 1 A&amp;E units. That was the worst performance since records began – even worse than the previous low of 77.6% recorded in January 2017 and the 79.3% recorded in December 2016. A record number of patients were also admitted to hospital as an emergency last month – 392,277 – in another illustration of the intense and growing pressure that the NHS is under. Patients are suffering as a result of hospitals’ inability to treat anywhere near the 95% of A&amp;E arrivals they are supposed to, senior doctors have said. “These figures support the messages we have been getting from our members about conditions across the NHS and the struggle they are facing to provide safe and compassionate care in exceedingly difficult conditions,” said Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents acute and general medical specialist hospitals. “The data hides the misery and lack of dignity some people are being treated with and it is a potentially worrying side note that the Care Quality Commission is postponing inspections during ‘winter’.” There were 24 flu-related deaths in the last week of 2017, taking the total number of flu-related deaths to 48 so far this winter, official figures from Public Health England show. Separate figures from NHS England also showed that hospitals and ambulance services in England came under intense strain last week. A&amp;E units had to temporarily divert patients elsewhere 32 times in the week that began on New Year’s Day. That is an admission by a hospital trust that it cannot safely care for the number of patients turning up at its emergency department. A surge in the demand for care has forced England’s 153 acute trusts to divert patients, either to another trust or the A&amp;E of another hospital they run, a total of 182 times so far since late November. Gloucestershire hospitals NHS trust had to deploy that tactic seven times last week – the most among the 153 acute trusts. Gateshead Health NHS foundation trust had six diverts at different times on New Year’s Day, when the closure of most GP practices for the long holiday weekend was likely to have increased the number of people seeking help. Reacting to the figures, Theresa May said flu was partly to blame for delays in A&amp;E departments. “One of the issues that determines the extent of that pressure is flu and we have seen in recent days an increase in the number of people presenting at A&amp;E from flu, and the NHS today has launched their national flu campaign. And I would encourage people to act on the advice that the NHS is giving, and also encourage NHS staff who haven’t had the flu vaccine yet to have that vaccine. “We have put more funding into the NHS for these winter pressures. We’re putting more funding into the NHS overall. But, in terms of these winter pressures that we see the NHS under, there have been a number of measures that we’ve taken that have helped. For example, for the first time ever, urgent GP appointments being available through the Christmas period. That was a decision taken to improve the service for people, but also to ensure that the NHS had that better capacity to deal with these winter pressures.” The Liberal Democrats claimed the figures showed that ministers had to agree to abandon their longstanding policy of giving the NHS “inadequate” funding or risk having “blood on their hands” as a result of patients receiving poor care. “Theresa May cannot ignore this crisis any longer. All the government has offered is inadequate sums of money which barely keep a dysfunctional system going”, said Norman Lamb, who was a health minister in the coalition government until 2015. “Every day patients are dying and experiencing dreadful failures of care. So the message to the government is clear: sort it now, without delay. Ministers have a choice: agree to work with others to deliver a proper, sustainable settlement for the NHS or be left with blood on their hands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/11/fast-eddie-clarke-motorhead-guitarist-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T13:01:36Z","webTitle":"Motörhead guitarist 'Fast' Eddie Clarke dies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/11/fast-eddie-clarke-motorhead-guitarist-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/11/fast-eddie-clarke-motorhead-guitarist-dies","fields":{"headline":"Motörhead guitarist 'Fast' Eddie Clarke dies","bodyText":"Motörhead guitarist “Fast” Eddie Clarke has died at the age of 67.

The musician, born Edward Allan Clarke in Twickenham in 1950, joined Motörhead in 1976. Along with drummer Phil Taylor and frontman Lemmy, he is considered to have been part of the best-known Motörhead lineup. The trio released their self-titled debut album in 1977 and produced hits including Ace of Spades. Clarke also provided lead vocals on numerous Motörhead tracks. Clarke left the band in 1982 and was replaced by Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson. Clarke subsequently formed the rock band Fastway with UFO bassist Pete Way. The band released seven albums and toured with AC/DC. In later years, Clarke reunited with his Motörhead bandmates. In 2000, he made a guest appearance at their 25th anniversary concert at Brixton Academy, London. He also joined Lemmy in 2014 to play Ace of Spades during a Birmingham Arena show.

Three years ago, I sat down and told him: “The idea of having sex just with you for the next 40 years – I can’t do it any more.” But I had come to realise that my life was built around something I didn’t believe in: monogamy. We had been together for 12 years and had two children, now nine and seven. I love being a mother and I set the bar high from the start – cloth nappies and cooking from scratch. But I needed something more in my emotional and sexual life. Marc’s reaction was remarkable; he agreed to support me and open our marriage to other partners, although it wasn’t really what he wanted. We started counselling to try to identify the best of what we had, to save it and protect it. Sex is a big part of a relationship, but it is only a part. We didn’t want it to scupper us. If that sounds difficult, it was. I don’t think we could have done it if we hadn’t spent most of our marriage reading, talking and exploring together. I quickly embraced the dating scene and discovered another side of my sexual self. I enrolled on lots of sites, where you are asked specific questions about yourself and your preferences. It was illuminating: do I like this? Yes. Do I like that? Well, let’s see. They were the kind of questions I’d never been asked before – and had never asked myself. I became convinced that traditional relationships are like an air lock. You meet someone. It’s amazing and it’s rare, and then you lock it; you shut the windows and doors, and you try desperately to keep it all to yourselves. Then the air turns sour because there’s no oxygen. You might make a sexual mistake on the spur of the moment because you are craving some – any – contact. Why not live in a world where you can have room for that connection, that spark? I think most people’s reaction was that Marc should have kicked me out. My immediate family have been supportive, although my mother is still ambivalent. We discuss everything openly, and she understands where I’m coming from, but worries that I’m going to end up on my own. If I do, though, it will be because I have chosen that. People who choose to be polyamorous often do so after delving deep into themselves and their desires, so it runs close to the kink scene, which was also something I wanted to explore. There’s a temptation to think that, had Marc and I explored these things together, our marriage might have worked without opening it up. I’m not sure that it would have, though, given that he wasn’t into it. It can seem quite intimidating, but I was so ready for it. The first time I went to a fetish club, I felt like I was at home – that I’d found my people. I now have a partner of two years, Andrea. We work as a couple, but we also have sex with friends. He’s the only partner I have introduced to my children. I love Andrea and I’m very lucky to have him, but I don’t want to live with him – we both value our solitude too much. He and I can flirt with other people and ask for their number, but I still feel jealous sometimes. He went away with another woman and, yes, it was difficult. Meanwhile, Marc and I realised we were no longer compatible. I had changed too much. We still share the family home and parent our children together. We still get on. We have counselling together, we spend Christmas together – we are still reading and learning as we used to. We wanted to keep all the bits that worked. We have had to learn so much about communicating better, and I think the children have benefited from that. We have explained that Dad needs one person to be with and Mum needs more people to make her happy. The talk is ongoing; we won’t wait to sit them down when they are teenagers, expecting them suddenly to get it. Understanding polyamory is complicated, but monogamy is fraught with ambiguity, too. You can craft your own polyamory, but I’m not sure I would want more than two or three other partners. I’m hoping two people I met recently will become lovers, but there’s no rush. People assume that I’m constantly having sex, but it’s not as simple as that. I want an emotional and mental connection with someone, so it takes time to build up to that. Monogamy, meanwhile, feels more like a competition where you need to bag someone before anyone else does. None of that applies in a poly setup, which is incredibly liberating. Think how strange it would be to have only one friend. You can’t get everything from one platonic relationship. Why would you try with one lover? But it’s a challenge: you’re swimming against the cultural norm and it’s difficult emotionally, with or without the support of an existing partner. On top of that, the amount of work involved in maintaining multiple relationships, sexual and platonic, is huge. Andrea and I look to the future, but there are no expectations. We are part of a broader community and we think developing that is more important. Put it this way: I don’t see myself sitting on a park bench at 80 with one other person. I’d like to be part of a group of people, a community. We seem to want a silver bullet for everything. One God. One partner. But life is plural. Marc’s view I’d realised for a few years that Anita wasn’t completely happy, so it wasn’t a total shock when she told me she wanted to explore non-monogamy. It was upsetting to hear that what we had wasn’t meeting her needs, but it was very important to me that she was happy. If that meant her exploring a different relationship style, then I would be there to support her. I did a lot of reading around the subject of ethical non-monogamy. It makes a lot of sense intellectually, but it doesn’t resonate with me emotionally. It didn’t feel right. I was prepared for our marriage to continue, with me being monogamous and Anita having other partners, but that proved more difficult than we envisaged. I completely support Anita. I’m glad she has been able to share with me what she’s discovering about the honesty and communication needed to make polyamory work. It’s also true of monogamous relationships, and I hope to take what I have learned from this experience into my future relationships. What I have always wanted – and still do – is to be with one partner, long-term, with whom I can share all of life’s rich experiences, to enjoy the journey and the inevitable changes together. Anita and Marc have been amicably separated for over a year and continue to co-parent their children. • As told to Camilla Palmer Appetite, a novel by Anita Cassidy, is published by RedDoor at £8.99.

All extra charges for using a credit or debit card to pay for goods and services have now been banned, which means no more nasty surprises at the checkout, says the government. But some companies are already finding sneaky ways to get around the ban – such as simply renaming the fee so that it removes any reference to cards. Earlier this week, online takeaway company Just Eat faced a customer backlash after it scrapped its 50p card payment charge and replaced it with a 50p “service charge” on all orders, which applies whether someone is paying with cash or a card. Meanwhile, some businesses and government departments such as HM Revenue &amp; Customs have taken what some might feel is the fairly drastic decision to stop accepting personal credit card payments altogether. Until now, fees for paying with plastic – most commonly a credit card – have been routinely levied on everything from low-cost flights and tax bills to cinema tickets and takeaway meals. Many small shops and businesses also imposed a fee. Sometimes it was an extra charge of perhaps 1% or 2%, while in other cases it was a flat fee, which could add as much as 15% to 20% on to the bill. But the ban taking effect from Saturday ends all that, and means you can’t be penalised for choosing to pay by card, whether it’s online or in store. Some commentators have warned that many companies will simply hike their prices to compensate for the loss of this money. And shops and pubs can continue to impose a minimum spend – usually £5 or £10 – before they will accept a card. However, one spin-off of this new regime is that it arguably makes paying for goods with a reward credit card more attractive. Until now, the fee you had to pay when buying some items cancelled out the benefit you would get from using a cashback/points card. ● So what’s this all about? This practice, known as surcharging, has been common for years, with many businesses and organisations charging people to make card payments, or for using services such as PayPal. Action had already been taken to cap the costs that businesses face for processing card payments, reducing the so-called interchange fee, and now card-charging has been outlawed entirely. In July 2017, when the Treasury issued a press release about this, it was headlined “Rip-off card charges will be consigned to history after ministers act to end these unfair fees … ” This change is actually the result of an EU directive relating to Visa and MasterCard surcharges. However, the Treasury says the UK has gone beyond the EU’s requirements by also banning charges for holders of American Express cards and users of services such as PayPal and Apple Pay. ● How much of a rip-off was this? There don’t appear to be any recent official figures for how much these surcharges were costing consumers, but the government calculated that credit and debit card surcharges totalled between £316m and £630m in 2010. It suggested a “best estimate” of around £473m for that year. ● Who were the worst offenders? These fees have long been a moneyspinner for many businesses. For example, Just Eat, which has 9 million UK customers, revealed in 2016 that “payment card/admin fee revenue” accounted for about 13% of its total revenue. With it forecasting its revenue for 2017 at between £500m and £515m, that’s a lot of money to have to wave goodbye to. So – surprise, surprise – Just Eat isn’t waving goodbye to tens of millions of pounds. Instead, it could end up pocketing even more money than before. Last Monday the company cheekily replaced its 50p card surcharge with a 50p service charge on all orders, which even applies if you pay the restaurant in cash. The company says applying the charge equally across the customer base “ensures fairness for all”. But the move sparked an outcry, with some customers calling for a boycott of the firm. ● Who else charged a card fee? Some government departments and official bodies. Until yesterday, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency added a flat fee of £2.50 to vehicle tax payments by credit card, and its own data suggests it raked in more than £8.5m a year in these charges. That’s based on the fact that it collected 3,422,021 charges of £2.50 in 2009-10. The good news is that as of Saturday, there will be no charge for anyone using a personal credit card to pay for vehicle tax. The taxman has taken a different tack. Until Friday, HMRC charged a fee for paying a tax bill using a personal credit card. This ranged from 0.374% to 0.606%. Now that it can no longer do that, HMRC is, as of Saturday, not accepting personal credit card payments. Only a small minority of payments to HMRC were made this way – it was 0.8% in 2016-17 – and it insists it never made any money from the surcharges. A spokesman says that because it can no longer pass on the cost of the fees, it would be “unfair” to expect other taxpayers to pick up the tab. He adds: “There are a range of ways for people to pay us depending on the type of tax being paid, including debit cards, direct debit, Faster Payments and Bacs.” Corporate, business and commercial cards are not affected by the change. ● What about airlines? Ryanair and easyJet were charging a credit card fee of 2% and 1% respectively. However, easyJet scrapped its fee on 14 December. Ryanair, meanwhile, told us last week it would comply with the new law, and that the 2% fee “will no longer apply”. Until Friday, Flybe charged a 1% fee for bookings made by credit card or PayPal, and 2.5% for Amex cards. It told Guardian Money last week it would “continue to accept bookings paid by debit and credit cards”, but did not disclose further details. The airline criticised the change, saying it “will inevitably result in price increases as businesses seek to recoup the associated costs they must incur, which includes processing usage and covering fraudulent transactions. This will disadvantage the majority of those who now choose to rather pay for goods and services by cash or with a debit card”. ● And cinemas? The Empire Cinemas chain was this week still imposing a 70p “card handling fee” for tickets bought online with a credit or debit card. For someone buying a £3.95 ticket, an extra 70p on top amounts to a surcharge of almost 18%. Empire did not respond to Money when we asked how it would be reacting to the ban, but it may decide to follow the example of other chains such as Vue and Everyman, which impose an online “booking fee” of, typically, 75p. ● Any others? Many local authorities were, at the time of writing, still charging handling fees when people paid for certain services by credit card. Ealing council’s fee was a chunky 2.5%, while Richmond upon Thames charged 1.65%. Some councils are expected to stop taking credit cards as payment. What are people saying? Consumer body Which? says it is important this new law does not result in price increases, minimum spend limits or even cards being refused by retailers, and adds: “The government and regulator need to closely monitor the situation.” Commenting on the Just Eat move, Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief of the website Money.co.uk, says it’s wrong for companies to rebrand credit card fees as service charges, adding: “The law was changed to stop businesses from profiting from unnecessary credit and debit card fees, so this makes a mockery of the law which is trying to protect us from getting ripped off.” Who charged what Ryanair 2% easyJet 1% Flybe 1%/2.5%* Norwegian 1.99% HMRC 0.374% to 0.606%** DVLA £2.50 Empire Cinemas £0.70 Just Eat £0.50 The Empire Cinemas and Just Eat fees were for credit and debit cards, while the others only applied to credit cards * Was 1% for credit cards, and 2.5% for Amex cards ** Fee depended on type of card (these were rates for personal credit cards) • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/11/india-man-carves-road-through-hills-children-attend-school","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T13:48:55Z","webTitle":"Indian man carves road through hills so children can attend school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/11/india-man-carves-road-through-hills-children-attend-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/11/india-man-carves-road-through-hills-children-attend-school","fields":{"headline":"Indian man carves road through hills so children can attend school","bodyText":"A man in a remote eastern Indian village has single-handedly carved a five-mile (8km) road through hilly terrain to help his children attend school. It had been taking Jalandhar Nayak’s three sons about three hours each way to navigate the narrow, rocky route to class. So two years ago the vegetable seller from Odisha state picked up a chisel, a garden hoe and pickaxe and began building a shorter route. His efforts came to the attention of government officials this week when he was featured in a local media bulletin. “My children found it hard to walk on the narrow and stony path while going to their school. I often saw them stumbling against the rocks and decided to carve a road through the mountain so that they can walk more easily,” he told News World Odisha. “Nayak’s effort and determination to cut mountains to build a road left me spellbound,” the local administrator, Brundha D, told reporters. He said Nayak, 45, would be paid for the time he had spent building the path between Gumsahi village and the school in Phulbani, according to the Press Trust of India. The family are the only remaining residents of Gumsahi, with the rest of the village having left for areas with better roads and amenities. Nayak had planned to work for another three years to build the remaining four miles (7km) required to complete the road – a job that has now been taken over by the local government. “The district collector has assured me [he will] complete the construction of the road to my village,” Nayak said. Footage of Nayak labouring has been aired on national TV, showing him carving out the route and struggling to line it with small boulders. His story is being compared with that of Dashrath Manjhi, a labourer from Bihar who spent 22 years building a road through a mountain, reportedly reducing the route between two districts by 42km. Manjhi’s efforts, which have inspired several films, were prompted by injuries his wife suffered while trying to cross the mountain to bring him lunch. He died in 2007 and received a state funeral."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/barmaid-waitress-late-night-banter-restaurants-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T11:30:19Z","webTitle":"I’ve been a barmaid and a waitress.

I know exactly what late-night banter means","bodyText":"In the nearly 12 years since its publication, Bill Buford’s account of his adventures in the kitchen of Mario Batali’s restaurant Babbo has become something of a classic: a touchstone for food writers of a certain generation, as Helen Rosner put it recently in the New Yorker. And I suppose I understand why. Heat stinks to high heaven of blood, sweat and other intimate bodily fluids; it’s nothing if not intimately done, if that’s the kind of thing you’re after. But I, for one, have never been keen. “Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential has a lot to answer for,” I wrote, when I reviewed Heat in 2006. “Even as he set out to demystify the commercial kitchen, he built it up as a place where only the most macho men could work – and Buford can’t help but follow the same path.” Both books were, I thought, only really interested in one thing: “This might be summed up, not very politely, as: look at the size of our dicks.” It was this line that I thought of first when I read that in New York Batali has stepped back from his restaurant empire following allegations of sexual harassment; that so, too, for similar reasons, has Ken Friedman, the proprietor of, among other establishments, the Spotted Pig, where Batali was a regular; and that, following both these announcements, their friend, Anthony Bourdain, has been doing some heavy soul-searching (“To the extent which my work in Kitchen Confidential celebrated or prolonged a culture that allowed the kind of grotesque behaviours we’re hearing about all too frequently is something I think about daily, with real remorse,” he has said.) In 2006, unlike most other reviewers, I was critical of Buford’s book. But I was also feebly cautious. I kept my tone jokey; I refused to join the dots. Why, I now wonder, was I not more explicitly condemnatory? I’ve worked both as barmaid and waitress. I know exactly what late-night “banter” means when it’s your backside that’s up for grabs. Go back to Buford’s depiction of Batali’s world and it’s all there in plain sight: the off-colour “jokes”, the groping, the suggestion that – for a man at least – unbridled greed is thrilling and visceral, and may be applied with equal vigour to food or sex. (Appetites, of all kinds, have often been seen as a plus in the show business-y world of the top restaurant; they denote character.) What isn’t there, however, is the sense that such things might be causing suffering; that Batali might have victims as well as outwardly game employees. Buford may not always like what he sees; sometimes, he admits to qualms. But if his book was a recipe, this would be his good pinch of Hemingway. Publishing has since moved on, of course. Bourdain and his imitators already feel like relics, which may be one reason for the soul-searching. The question now is: will the allegations against Batali and others change restaurant culture for the better? Perhaps. Friedman’s company has, for instance, recently appointed a human resources director (previously, complaints had to be taken to restaurant managers). My guess is, though, that in smaller, less starry establishments little will change, in the US or here. For the waitress, the potential for harassment is, in any case, not restricted only to her boss or co-workers. It comes from her customers, too: a motley, ever-changing cast over whom even the most forward-thinking human resources manager has no control. Such men and her employer may even seem to work together at times, each protecting the other; in my pub, the customer was always right, and the landlord was always his new best friend. This woman will just go on thinking of her tips, joining in with the grim jokes at the pass, and hoping against hope that tomorrow is better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/12/how-death-got-cool-swedish-death-cleaning","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T06:52:40Z","webTitle":"How death got cool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/12/how-death-got-cool-swedish-death-cleaning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/12/how-death-got-cool-swedish-death-cleaning","fields":{"headline":"How death got cool","bodyText":"Last spring, at Green-Wood cemetery in Brooklyn, where the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat is buried, another conceptual artist, Sophie Calle, launched an installation called Here Lie the Secrets of the Visitors of Green-Wood Cemetery. For the next 25 years, anyone passing by will be able to write down their most intimate secrets and bury them in a grave designed by the artist. The cemetery also hosts moonlit tours, cocktail parties, dance performances, and even yoga classes. Death is hot right now, and upbeat gatherings in cemeteries are just a small part of the trend. One of the chief desires of our time is to turn everything we touch into a reflection of who we are, how we live and how we want others to view us – and death is no exception. Once merely the inevitable, death has become a new bourgeois rite of passage that, much like weddings or births, must now be minutely planned and personalised. Not since the Victorian era’s fetishisation of death, with its all-black attire, elaborate mourning jewellery and seances, has death been so appealingly packaged. Every death must be in some way special and on-trend. Finally, the hipster can die as he lived. If you fancy an environmentally friendly burial, you can choose to be wrapped in a biodegradable artisanal shroud, decorated to your specifications by the bespoke company Vale for $545. (It’s just $68 for pets.) Or you can be buried, as the celebrated California chef Alice Waters says she wants to be, in a burial pyjama suit seeded with mushrooms that help your body decompose more quickly. A few years ago, artist Jae Rhim Lee delivered a Ted talk while wearing one such suit – a black hooded one-piece threaded with white veins infused with mushroom spores. On stage, Lee cheerfully explained that she is training mushrooms to eat her when she dies by feeding them her hair, nails and dead skin so they recognise her body. For people less concerned about the environment and more worried about the terrifying prospect of dying alone, there are now solutions (or at least partial ones). You can hire a death doula, a trained professional who will assist at the end of life in the same catch-all manner that birth doulas are there during labour. You can request a home funeral, in which your friends and family pay their respects to your corpse in the comfort of your living room, with every detail as carefully planned as a wedding. And before that day arrives, you can discuss the facts of death with like-minded souls at a Death Cafe, a meeting of the global movement started by Jon Underwood in 2011 (who died last summer of acute promyelocytic leukaemia) as a way for people to gather and reflect on mortality. One of the people pioneering this new way of approaching death is Caitlin Doughty, a young, Los Angeles-based mortician who looks like a lost member of the Addams Family. She has written a bestselling memoir, hosts a YouTube series called Ask a Mortician and has founded a “death acceptance collective” called The Order of the Good Death, whose youthful members promote positive approaches to mortality. “It’s OK to be openly interested in death practices,” Doughty told me while driving through LA one afternoon last autumn. “It makes you an engaged human who cares about all aspects of life. Ghettoising it as an interest particular to goths, weirdos or people obsessed with murder creates a dearth of honest conversation about death in the western world.” This growing interest in alternative “death practices” began as a way to skirt the commercialism and uniformity of the funeral industry. And it appeals to a diverse set of people. “This desire for a pine box in the ground brings together hippies and libertarians, stay-off-my-land gun owners, certain religious people, Trump voters who don’t want big business ignoring what they want,” Doughty said. “They might not all have the same back-to-the-earth vision, but it’s the same fight for their fundamental rights. They don’t want a bland corporate infrastructure to dictate what happens to their mortal remains and what represents their life.” Given that the idea of rethinking death connects with millions of people who are tired of the rampant commercialism and homogeneity of modern life, it was only a matter of time before commercial interests caught on. Just as the Danish concept of hygge was sold – in the form of scented candles and hand-knitted woollen socks – to consumers looking for comfort in troubled times, there is gold, too, in our obsession with a good death. * * * Publishers, in particular, have latched on to the trend. Books about death are nothing new, of course, but the pace at which they’re arriving seems to have accelerated. Last year saw the arrival of a stack of literary memoirs about death by authors such as Edwidge Danticat and Robert McCrum. In his memoir, My Father’s Wake, the writer Kevin Toolis explains why the Irish get death right, while Caitlin Doughty’s new book, From Here to Eternity: Travelling the World to Find the Good Death, explores the way cultures across the world, from Indonesia to Bolivia to Japan, approach death. But perhaps it is not the Irish or the Bolivians who have perfected the art of dying well, but the Swedish. In recent months, thanks to a publisher-led media campaign, you may have come across the concept of döstädning, the Swedish practice of “death cleaning”. Death cleaning applies a simple formula to the process of dealing with our possessions before we die. In Marie Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying, a bestselling guide to tidying up your home, and thus your life, the essential question is whether a given object “sparks joy”. In death cleaning, it is “Will anyone I know be happier if I save this?” It is easy to see the appeal. Death cleaning addresses many of the aspects of contemporary life that make us most anxious. For those who feel that they have accumulated too much stuff and that all this stuff is getting in the way of their spiritual development, it offers a practical guide to de-cluttering. For those who worry about their privacy or the prospect of relatives discovering their secrets, it offers sensible precautions. For those who fear a long, bewildered, incapacitated old age, it is a way of coping through clear-eyed preparation and understanding. While Silicon Valley billionaires search for cures for death, the rest of us are just seeking ways of accepting death, ordering a long and messy old age and making peace with our relatives, who are already horrified at the idea of looking after us in our incontinent, incoherent dotage. The fact of living longer doesn’t just give us time to think about death, but also plunges us into chaos, sickness and confusion, and death cleaning seems a valiant attempt to counter this. Death cleaning is a concept that has had passing mentions in Sweden, but it is not a well-known part of the national culture. In truth, it seems to be more talked about by foreigners who like to imagine Scandinavia as a place where people have life sorted out than it is by Swedes themselves. But even if Swedes rarely talk about döstädning, there is something authentic about the underlying philosophy. The Swedish ambassador to the US, Karin Olofsdotter, recently told the Washington Post that death cleaning is “almost like a biological thing to do”, the natural product of a society that prizes living independently, responsibly and thoughtfully, and whose homes reflect that ideal. A friend of mine who works as a radio producer in Stockholm said: “My mother is döstädning incarnated. She has been in the mode of frenetic cleaning for couple of years now – she is 65 – [and thinks] throwing stuff out will make it easier for us children when she is no longer with us. She doesn’t want us to be left with difficult decisions about what to do with it and she doesn’t want personal stuff to get in the wrong hands. And ever since I was a teen she has forced me to get rid of stuff – my earliest paintings, old clothes, books I read as a child, memorabilia. Keeps telling me that it’s the best for everyone. I don’t know if it’s typically Swedish, but it is very, very rational and unsentimental.” The well-funded Swedish welfare state enables elderly Swedes to live independently. “Perhaps this also adds to the sense that they feel they must get their things in order before they die, so that no one else should be responsible for it,” says Michael Booth, author of The Almost Nearly Perfect People, a cultural tour of Scandinavian countries. “Swedes are deeply, deeply responsible people. It is very important for a Swede to do things properly, not to be a burden on others, to take responsibility in this way. Swedes are very ‘proper’.” According to Booth, the decluttering element of death cleaning “chimes with the general parsimony and minimalism of Lutheranism, which you find traces of throughout many aspects of Scandinavian culture. In Sweden especially, they value the ‘modern’ and ‘new’, and so, if you visit a council dump or recycling centre, you see some fairly eye-popping items discarded – stuff Brits would never throw away.” Others are more sceptical about the notion that death cleaning is the product of a distinctly Swedish sensibility. “It sounds like a mind-body-spirit thing that could have come from anywhere,” says Robert Ferguson, author of Scandinavians: In Search of the Soul of the North, another book that tries to figure out the roots of our fascination with Scandinavia. “Actually I’m still waiting for the world to discover the joys of kalsarikänni, a Finnish word that means ‘drinking beer on your own at home in your underpants with no intention of going out’.” * * * The book responsible for spreading the death-cleaning gospel is by Margareta Magnusson, a Swedish artist who describes herself as between “80 and 100”. The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning: How to Free Yourself and Your Family from a Lifetime of Clutter came out in English a few months ago. It is part practical guide to getting your affairs in order, part discourse on accepting the reality of death. Over the course of 38 very short chapters with titles such as If It Was Your Secret, Then Keep It That Way (or How to Death Clean Hidden, Dangerous and Secret Things), Magnusson sets out her pragmatic and upbeat approach to mortality. “Life will become more pleasant and comfortable if we get rid of some of the abundance,” she writes. “The message was: we just have to accept that one day we will die,” said her literary agent, Susanna Lea. “Either our loved ones will begrudge us, or they will hold on to this wonderful memory and love us for sorting everything out. Which one do you want?” As soon as Lea sent the book proposal out, publishers eagerly snapped it up. A German editor made an offer after just four hours. A couple of days later, it was sold to a publisher in Sweden, and then Lea took it to the 2016 Frankfurt book fair, the marketplace for international sales, and sold it to the UK, US and Australia. It is now being translated into 23 languages. “Interestingly enough, the eastern Europeans have been the slowest to buy it,” said Lea. “They said: ‘We just don’t talk about death.’ I thought the Latin countries might not talk about death, but they completely got it.” The title has been a challenge. Some countries balk at having death in the title of a book that is slim and small, and packaged like a gift book sold at check-out counters. Others struggle with translating the phrase itself. The Swedish just call their edition Döstädning (the subtitle translates as “not a sad story”). However, nettoyage de la mort does not work in French – they are going to call it instead La Vie en Ordre. The Germans get around it by giving it a title that translates as “Frau Magnusson’s Art of Putting Her Life in Order”. As the book proposal appeared in the year that hygge and the decluttering guru Marie Kondo conquered the world, it’s not surprising that a book that could be pitched as “Marie Kondo does hygge” was a big hit with publishers. But Jamie Byng, head of Magnusson’s UK publisher, Canongate, strenuously rejects the comparison. “We were not looking for another Marie Kondo, fuck no,” he told me. “I was taken by the idea that this elderly Swedish lady had written a book about leaving this world gracefully and with as little mess as possible. There’s something of Swedish zen about it.” Magnusson lives in an apartment in a large development in the Södermalm neighbourhood of Stockholm, not far from the upmarket raincoat brand Stutterheim (whose motto is “Swedish melancholy at its driest”), and shops that sell elegant, spare Scandinavian furniture. She’s tall and slender, wearing a striped French sailor-style shirt, faded jeans and trainers, with a grey bob and a long, oval-shaped face. Her most striking feature is her large, round, wet blue eyes. She looks healthy and spry and fashionable without trying hard, which fits the image of her as a mellow, slightly kooky but wise Scandinavian grandma who writes things such as: “Maybe Grandfather had ladies’ underwear in his drawer and maybe Grandma had a dildo in hers. But what does that matter now? They are no longer among us; if we liked them it really should be nothing for us to worry about.” The first thing to note about Magnusson’s home is that it is not in any way minimalist. In her living room there are shelves of hundreds of books, and gentle abstract paintings by Magnusson herself on the walls. There are a surprising number of stuffed toys and masks from Asia (her late husband was Swedish but born in Japan, and the family lived in Singapore and Hong Kong as he moved frequently for work), presumably all of which have passed the making-people-happy test. The flat is packed with objects of sentimental value that have accrued around an elderly person who once lived in a larger home. It’s all cheerful and very, very neat. Magnusson noted that Sweden used to be a country of big, quality companies that made things you might want to pass on to your children, or at least that lasted a very long time. “Swedish safety matches and Volvo – the safest car. Now, Sweden is just H&amp;M and Ikea, stuff that doesn’t last more than five years if you’re lucky. It must have changed the culture in the country in a way, I think.” She has a large collage of family photos hanging in her bedroom: a sister and brother, who are both dead, and her husband, who died in his mid-70s. Her book suggests that sorting through photographs is not the place to begin your death-cleaning process – too many memories to get swept up in, and too much sentiment. Better to start with the kitchen. But when it’s time to declutter your photos, she advises, be ruthless. One of her points is that if you don’t know the names of the people in a photo, feed them to a shredder. Magnusson has a way, when talking about her life, to assume the mode of a literary narrator. Everything she says sounds like a first line to a self-consciously ruminative memoir. “I grew up in Gothenburg on Sweden’s west coast, and was born on New Year’s Eve,” she told me. “I think I was born in a happy way. It was happy, I don’t know. It started happy.” Her pragmatic nature is such that she seemed almost frustrated explaining simple ideas about death and decluttering to a non-Swede such as me. She plans to be cremated when she dies, which is common in Sweden, and for there to be a memorial plaque her family can visit. “I don’t believe in life after death. When I’m dead, I will be dead,” she said. “To think that you cannot handle yourself, that you think you don’t know what’s going to happen – that must be terrible. I don’t have that fear. I almost died some years ago.” She had woken up in the middle of the night with some kind of heart trouble. “On the way to the hospital, I was just gone,” she said. “Then I really realised that I didn’t see any light in tunnels. I was so happy when I woke up, but I realised that nothing will happen.” There’s a tipping point in your life, she said, when you start attending more funerals than weddings. “Maybe in the 50s or 60s it starts to happen: my parents, my mother-in-law, my husband and friends,” she said. By that point, Magnusson’s daughter Jane, who lives just across the road, had come over. “We had a funeral on Friday. It was actually very pleasant,” said Jane. “Yes, it was very nice. You meet a lot of friends that you had together,” said Magnusson. “You get to have a good cry,” Jane said. “Yeah, you have a good cry,” said Magnusson. “But you have also a good laugh.” * * * Swedish death cleaning has found a kind of American counterpart in the rise of a pair of young men from Ohio who call themselves the Minimalists. When one of the duo, Joshua Fields Millburn, lost his mother in 2009, he was left wondering what to do with everything she had amassed in her small apartment. In the end, he decided to donate it all to charity. It was something of an epiphany for Millburn, who began throwing out one thing he owned every day for a month. What would go on to become the foundational principle of his brand of minimalism dawned on him: “Our memories are not inside of things; they’re inside of us.” From that moment almost a decade ago, Millburn and his friend Ryan Nicodemus have built a Minimalist empire – books, podcasts, documentaries, speaking tours – based on the idea that accumulating stuff is simply what we do to distract ourselves from our real problems: lack of satisfaction with work, love, life and, ultimately a way to deny the inevitability of death. Isn’t all decluttering about death? I asked Doughty, the mortician. “It is a little death to give away a keepsake or an item,” she agreed. “For most people to admit that they should be keeping track of stuff and getting rid of things is extremely threatening to their sense of self and idea as mortal.” For many of us, the main way we try to look at death is by not looking at it. My own parents constantly talk about how they want their dead bodies to be dealt with – my mother has gone from wanting her cremains to be flushed down the toilet to wanting her corpse fed to dogs – and yet the elaborate plans for death are a way around dealing with it. My father won’t even write a will, instead preferring to phone me at odd hours from California to get me to make solemn promises that, after he is gone, I will do or will not do certain things (such as keeping his house in the family, or making sure to invite specific people to his funeral). This highly developed awareness of their own mortality and careful consideration of how to dispose of their remains, combined with a total lack of planning for what happens in the weeks, months and years after the funeral, sometimes feels like my parents’ way of ensuring that their large personalities will gently haunt me from the afterlife. Or, to put it more politely, it seems like a way to guarantee their presence in my life as long as possible. But I also sympathise with them. Both of my parents are 66, and will hopefully be around for some time. Dealing with one’s own legacy is a stark business. It involves accepting that you are the one who cares most – or perhaps the only person who cares at all – about your own legacy. At the same time, it means confronting hard questions about the people you will leave behind. Will your last gift to your loved ones be to leave them a few valuable possessions, or a photo album full of memories, or simply the great favour of not burdening them with having to sort through all the stuff you accumulated over your lifetime? Doughty says that any parent who is “unwilling to have a basic conversation about death with your desperate kids – that’s a profound unkindness”. At 33, she has a will and a plan for what will happen to her business and the small cabin she owns when she dies. That has brought her comfort, she says. At 40, I don’t have any plans in place for my own death, unless you count drunkenly asking various friends to promise they would take my dog in the event that she becomes an orphan. Perhaps I am more like my parents than I would like to think. Planning for death is hard, because it means that one must accept that you are the one who cares most, or at all, about your own legacy. To plan for death is to accept both ideas simultaneously. “There might be no one at your bedside. You might not be found for two days and eaten by cats. That’s all in the realm of possibility,” Doughty said. “But even surrounded by loved ones, you check out alone. This is your personal journey to go on.” The idea of death as a solo journey is redolent of the language of wellness: the way people talk about getting into their fitness or diet or mindfulness routines. This new view of death borrows heavily from another trendy concept: self-care, the idea that looking after oneself is a political act, shoring yourself up to be able to keep fighting and facing the world. Self-care, too, has been co-opted to be about treating yourself to bath products, massages, face masks and yoga retreats – granting yourself an excuse to make it OK to buy stuff. The commercialisation of death is the inevitable sequel to the monetisation of every other part of life. Death cleaning is possibly more potent than other wellbeing trends in that it taps into deep emotions: fear, guilt, regret. The death industry exploits people’s fears of inadequacy. You can’t just die – at the very least, you’ll need to invest in a house-tidying consultant, a death doula, an environmentally sound bespoke shroud, and a home funeral, to prove just how well you lived.

Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said there had been no bailout of the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise but admitted it may not run as far as 2020, and he did not rule out allowing Stagecoach-Virgin to continue operating the service. Earlier on Wednesday Grayling was accused of passing the buck over severe rail disruption on Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern trains as he blamed staff shortages on “militant unions” despite a critical National Audit Office report. In heated exchanges in the Commons, Labour demanded answers on an apparent £2bn shortfall in expected payments on the East Coast franchise. Stagecoach’s £3.3bn contract to run trains until 2023 will be replaced in 2020 with a new partnership model on fresh terms. Grayling said he had “no viable legal mechanism” to make the firm pay the full amount. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said franchising had failed and there had been a “scandalous” succession of direct awards – contracts allocated without competition. He said the chances of a competitive tender to run the East Coast line in 2020 were slim: “I also predict that Virgin-Stagecoach will get a direct award.” Grayling said Virgin-Stagecoach had “got their figures wrong” and lost more than £100m. “Despite that I am holding them to their full financial obligations, taking every last penny of the £165m guarantee. “This is not a bailout. There is no viable legal mechanism through which I can extract any more money from them. My department is preparing contingency plans as we do not believe the franchise is financially viable through till 2020.” Asked by McDonald whether the £2bn premiums due from 2020 to 2023 would be paid, he said: “Currently we are not convinced the franchise will make it as far as 2020.” The NAO report on the government’s management of the UK’s largest rail franchise, held by Govia Thameslink, found that Department for Transport policy and targets had negatively affected millions of passenger and led to strikes by trade union members. However, Grayling said blame for the disruption should primarily be shouldered by the unions. He said: “It was the unnecessary action of militant trade unions that caused the vast majority of disruption for passengers, which was awful, I know. It’s not passing the buck.” McDonald said Grayling was “in complete denial”. Strikes by RMT train crew across four rail franchises will take place again on Friday, following action on Monday and Wednesday, in an ongoing row over the role of guards. Services on Northern trains have been worst affected, with around half of all services running. South Western and Merseyrail services will be reduced, while Greater Anglia expects to run a normal service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/11/shame-songs-of-praise-review-seething-sarky-passion-and-anthemic-pop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T22:15:12Z","webTitle":"Shame: Songs of Praise review – seething sarky passion and anthemic pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/11/shame-songs-of-praise-review-seething-sarky-passion-and-anthemic-pop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/11/shame-songs-of-praise-review-seething-sarky-passion-and-anthemic-pop","fields":{"headline":"Shame: Songs of Praise review – seething sarky passion and anthemic pop","bodyText":"Emerging from the same snot-encrusted, verruca-sock culture of south-east London that bred Fat White Family, this group of articulate, sarcastic but impassioned young men are the ones most likely to cross over into traditional indie circles: there’s a Stone Roses-style naive melody on Friction, and Angie is the kind of epic that closed Britpop albums.

At a meeting in Brussels attended by the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, the three EU signatories to the deal, insisted that Iran was respecting the agreement signed in 2015. The display of resolve came before a decision by the US president, expected on Friday, on whether to continue to sign a waiver to prevent the reimposition of economic sanctions against Iran. Tehran has warned that any failure to sign the waiver would lead to the deal’s collapse, and the speedy restart of uranium enrichment. The EU’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said the deal, denounced by Trump as the worst ever made, had in reality “made the world safer and prevented a potential nuclear arms race in the region”. She also said any doubts the EU harboured over Iran’s development of ballistic missiles, or its overall policy of interference across the Middle East, were separate from the nuclear deal – also known as the JCPOA. Both France and Britain, in part to remain in alliance with the US, have said Iran needs to sign fresh agreements over both issues. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken of supplementing the nuclear deal. Zarif did not join the post-meeting press conference but tweeted: “Strong consensus in Brussels today: 1) Iran is complying with #JCPOA, 2) Iranian people have every right to all its dividends, 3) Any move that undermines JCPOA is unacceptable. E3 and EU fully aware that Iran’s continued compliance conditioned on full compliance by the US.” The German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said: “We want to protect the JCPOA against every possible undermining decision whatever that may come. It would send a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world if the only agreement that prevents the proliferation of nuclear weapons was negatively affected.” The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: “There is no indication today that could call into doubt Iranian respect of the agreement.” Boris Johnson, Britain’s foreign secretary, said: “I don’t think anybody has so far produced a better alternative” to the agreement. He said it was “incumbent on those who oppose the JCPOA to come up with that better solution because we have not seen it so far. We greatly value the JCPOA, the nuclear deal with Iran. We think it is a considerable diplomatic accomplishment. It’s a way of stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and Iran is in compliance with this agreement, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.” On a bilateral basis Johnson raised with Zarif the issue of the British dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been held in a Tehran jail for two years after being found guilty of espionage. Johnson raised her plight on a visit to Tehran before Christmas, but no further progress was reported, and it is likely that the recent Iran-wide street protects – which hardliners blame on foreign including UK interference – may not have helped her chances of early release. Washington has been more forthright than Europe in supporting the protests and implying that regime change is a realistic possibility. The EU has focused on ensuring that the right to protest is defended. Discussing Iran’s wider behaviour, Le Drian reiterated that European governments were open to pressing Iran on its missile programme and regional activities but that this must happen separately from the nuclear accord. French officials have said they will consider sanctions if Iran pushes ahead with its missile programme. However, EU sanctions must be agreed unanimously by all member states and, unlike in the US, no preparation for such sanctions has been made. The former UK foreign secretary Jack Straw has suggested the EU consider legislation to protect EU companies from US sanctions if Washington reimposes sanctions over the deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/12/jim-crace-books-that-made-me","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"Jim Crace: ‘I’ve never had much luck with Proust, Tolkien or Trollope’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/jim-crace-books-that-made-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/12/jim-crace-books-that-made-me","fields":{"headline":"Jim Crace: ‘I’ve never had much luck with Proust, Tolkien or Trollope’","bodyText":"The book I am currently reading I’m a Rathbones Folio prize judge at the moment and so am shouldering my way through 80 volumes, mostly with great pleasure but sometimes just out of puritanical duty.

Nick Timothy, who left his job after the Conservatives lost their majority in last year’s election, attacked Greening’s approach to the education portfolio in a column for the Telegraph. He denied he had got her sacked but said he agreed with May’s decision to remove her from the role. However, Greening received support from a number of former colleagues, including Jo Johnson, who was universities minister until he moved to a new role in the reshuffle. “So wrong, this stuff re Justine Greening – she supported me in every single reform we undertook of our universities, was a terrific colleague and faultlessly loyal,” he tweeted. Anna Soubry, the outspoken former business minister, tweeted: “Disappointed and surprised the man who helped lose us our majority &amp; was sacked from No 10 is still in charge.” In the column, Timothy claimed Greening blocked proposals to reduce interest rates on student loan repayments and allow institutions to charge different fees. He said the ideas could be revived by the government after this week’s reshuffle, in which Greening resigned after refusing to move to a different department. Timothy denied any involvement in Greening’s departure but said she had “put the brakes on policies that work”. He wrote: “Young people must be given better choices at 18. Right now, the incentives tell them to go to university. Many emerge with good degrees, but others come out with a costly qualification that makes little difference. On average, they will graduate with debts of £50,000, the highest in the world. Those who do not go to university – still more than half of young people – are neglected by a system guilty of institutionalised snobbery.” Timothy urged the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, to support the prime minister’s universities policy review. “Greening blocked proposals to reduce tuition fees and refused to hold a proper review of tertiary education.

In what has been hailed as a major step forward for equal rights, Melchior Wathelet, a Belgian advocate general in the Luxembourg court, said gay spouses had standing in countries even where governments were implacably opposed to same-sex marriage. Opinions given by ECJ advocate generals are non-binding on the court’s judges but are normally followed by the full court. A final decision will be delivered in the coming months. Wathelet’s opinion was given in the case of a Romanian national, Adrian Coman, who wanted to be able to build a life in Romania with his American husband, Claibourn Robert Hamilton, with whom he had been living for four years in the US before marrying in Brussels in 2010. Romania prohibits marriage between people of the same sex. It is one of six EU member states, along with Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Latvia, that offer no legal recognition for same-sex relationships. The Romanian authorities refused to grant a right of residence on the grounds that Hamilton could not be classified in Romania as the spouse of an EU citizen. The men appealed to Romania’s constitutional court, which referred it to Luxembourg. Giving his opinion, Wathelet said governments may not impede the freedom of residence of an EU citizen by refusing to grant his or her spouse, who is a national of a non-EU country, a right of permanent residence in their territory. He explained that EU law was neutral on the gender of a spouse. A directive on the EU’s freedom of movement principle in 2004 grants rights to an EU citizen’s spouse, without specifying how spouse is defined. The ECJ’s judgment when it comes could have wider repercussions for the range of benefits and rights that may be claimed by those in same-sex marriages by ensuring that the term spouse is gender neutral in law. Wathelet told the court that the EU gave spouses of EU nationals the right to live and work in the bloc. It only defined spouse with reference to a relationship based on marriage and was neutral both as to the sex of the persons concerned and the place where that marriage was contracted. It was his opinion that “in view of the general evolution of the societies of the member states of the EU in the last decade in the area of authorisation of same-sex marriage” it was no longer appropriate to follow the case law definition of marriage as “a union between two persons of the opposite sex”. The Dutch MEP Sophie in ‘t Veld said: “This is fantastic news and a landmark opinion for rainbow families. Freedom of movement is a right of all EU citizens; it cannot be restricted because of whom they love. The European Union protects our rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/11/eu-to-hold-britain-to-fishing-quotas-during-brexit-transition","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T15:59:56Z","webTitle":"EU to hold Britain to fishing quotas during Brexit transition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/11/eu-to-hold-britain-to-fishing-quotas-during-brexit-transition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/11/eu-to-hold-britain-to-fishing-quotas-during-brexit-transition","fields":{"headline":"EU to hold Britain to fishing quotas during Brexit transition","bodyText":"The EU will resist any renegotiation of fishing quotas in the seas around the UK for the proposed two-year transition period after Brexit, the Guardian has learned. Brussels diplomats are agreed that Britain should effectively remain governed by the EU’s common fisheries policy during the transition but should not have a role in deciding the size of catches elsewhere in Europe. Michael Gove claimed last year that the UK would “take back control” of its waters after Brexit by exiting the common fisheries policy (CFP), which gives member states fishing rights between 12 and 200 nautical miles off the UK’s coastline. The environment secretary reportedly told the cabinet in October that the quotas on every type of fish, from herring to crabs, lobsters and cold-water prawns, should be renegotiated with Norway and the EU before Brexit. “We notice Gove hasn’t repeated that recently. Perhaps he has been reined in, because it isn’t going to happen,” said one EU diplomat. Gerard van Balsfoort, the chair of the European Fisheries Alliance, the group lobbying on behalf of EU fishermen in the Brexit negotiations, said he was confident the UK would not be successful in persuading the 27 member states to change their position over the coming months. The fishing quotas for each member state, described by the UK’s farming minister, George Eustice, last year as “unfair”, were fixed in 1983 on the basis of the recorded catches of the various national fleets between 1973 and 1978. Member states negotiate annually between themselves the total amount of fish to be taken from the seas, species by species, but each country’s allocation within the total allowable catch does not change. The EU 27 want to strike a bilateral deal before Brexit, potentially spanning the entirety of the transition period, on the total size of the catch taken out of UK seas. But EU diplomats are agreed there should be no meddling with the predetermined quotas that have caused such anger in British fishing communities. The UK would also have no role in deciding the total catches in EU seas after Brexit. The EU’s plan means Britain would essentially be leaving the CFP in name only, senior EU diplomats concede. The issue was discussed at a meeting of diplomats in Brussels on Wednesday and will be discussed again next week. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishing Federation, said it would be “absolutely unacceptable” for the UK to be kept in the CFP framework over a two-year transition period. He said it was likely that fishing policy for 2019 would remain the same. Catch levels for the entire year will be decided in December this year while the UK is still in the bloc. However, Armstrong said the industry was adamant that it would be the landlord and would have a say over what “the tenants” do in British waters. “The world will change on 29 March. We will be out of CFP, the UK becomes a coastal state and will have complete sovereignty over who has access to our waters,” he said. “Assumption of control does not mean complete rejection of negotiation, and a nine-month bridge covering the remainder of 2018 would be in order. A two-year transition period where nothing changes is neither required nor acceptable.” The Scottish fishing community has been lobbying for a 21% increase in the UK’s share of the total North Sea cod quota. According to recent estimates, 33% of the catches of the rest of the European fishing fleet are caught in the UK’s exclusive economic zone. Fishing was a battleground issue during the EU referendum campaign, culminating in clash of rival flotillas on the Thames led by Nigel Farage and Bob Geldof. In July Gove announced that as part of its withdrawal from pan-European arrangements, the UK would leave the 1964 London fisheries convention, which allows vessels from Britain, Belgium, Ireland, France, Germany and the Netherlands to fish within 12 nautical miles of each other’s coastlines. A Defra spokesperson said: “We remain committed to leaving the Common Fisheries Policy and developing arrangements for fishing that can create a more profitable and self-sufficient seafood sector. “As we leave the EU, we are working to secure the best deal for the whole of the UK fishing industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/11/roger-federer-aljaz-bedene-australian-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T09:14:44Z","webTitle":"Roger Federer begins Australian Open title defence against Aljaz Bedene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/11/roger-federer-aljaz-bedene-australian-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/11/roger-federer-aljaz-bedene-australian-open","fields":{"headline":"Roger Federer begins Australian Open title defence against Aljaz Bedene","bodyText":"Poor Aljaz Bedene. No sooner has he returned to the bosom of Slovenia after failing to qualify for Great Britain in the Davis Cup than he draws Roger Federer in the first round of the Australian Open, which starts here on Monday. The Swiss, while suitably cautious and humble, will, in the absence of several key players including Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori, regard this as a pretty soft start to the defence of his title as he reaches for a 20th major at 36. The favourite by default as much as form, given the shredded draw, Federer will likely make short work of an opponent he has never met and who lies 49 places below him in the rankings at No51. Kyle Edmund, meanwhile, remains stoutly British – and 49th in the world after a decent run lately – but has only a slightly less daunting opener against the 2017 US Open finalist, Kevin Anderson. The South African with the serve that frightens slow ballkids at the back of the court, will relish a surface that all the players believe to be as fast as it ever has been.” Anderson, who had his best season last year after a long spell away tending a hip problem (the injury du jour on the circuit), beat Edmund in their only previous match, in the third round of the 2017 French Open. “It was a very close match, five long sets,” Anderson recalled. “He’s a terrific player and has improved a lot. His forehand is very dangerous.” There must be minor concern about Edmund’s right ankle, which he rolled during his three-set defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals in Brisbane last week, and he took the precaution of withdrawing from the Auckland warm-up tournament on Tuesday. Dimitrov remains one of the favoured contenders and, seeded third, has the luxury of facing yet-to-be-determined qualifiers in the first two rounds. Rafael Nadal, whose struggle with a recurrence of his knee problems has put his prospects of reaching the final for the second straight year in doubt, was not at his best on Tuesday when losing to Richard Gasquet. He plays here as the first seed and opens against the seemingly ageless Dominican Víctor Estrella Burgos. Federer, who shocked himself and everyone else by reaching the 2017 final after seven months out injured – and defied all logic when he came from 3-1 down in the fifth set to beat Nadal – will start as the favourite but it is still asking a lot of him to go through seven best-of-five matches unbeaten. He nevertheless looked relaxed and quietly confident at the draw ceremony, as he reflected on his remarkable career. “The domination thing was fun but stressful,” he said. “The past eight years have been the best because I’m a big family man. My girls say to me Rafa’s No1, so he should beat you.” Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka, who are returning after six months out, fared reasonably well in the draw. The Serb plays the inconsistent American Donald Young first up, while Wawrinka – who made his slam breakthrough here in 2014 – sits just above Djokovic in that quarter, and has what should be a straightforward workout against the Lithuanian world No138, Ricardas Berankis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/11/football-transfer-rumours-theo-walcott-to-everton-and-malcom-to-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T09:13:58Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Theo Walcott to Everton and Malcom to Arsenal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/11/football-transfer-rumours-theo-walcott-to-everton-and-malcom-to-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/11/football-transfer-rumours-theo-walcott-to-everton-and-malcom-to-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Theo Walcott to Everton and Malcom to Arsenal?","bodyText":"Occasionally scampering Arsenal staple Theo Walcott has no shortage of admirers and Everton have joined Inter, a milkman, Roma, a vicar, Southampton and three over-worked nurses in the politically incorrect Benny Hill-style chase to capture his signature.

In less good news for Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, Fulham have announced they have no intention of selling 17-year-old tyro Ryan Sessegnon this month.

Stoke’s £15m-rated Joe Allen is also wanted by the Hammers, but could be tempted north by the lure of Celtic.

Arsenal, Celta Vigo and Inter have all been linked with the 24-year-old. Bean-counters from Manchester City and West Brom are continuing to shout numbers at each other as they negotiate the future of central defender Jonny Evans, with a fee of around £21m being mooted for the Northern Ireland international. Arsenal’s interest in Evans is also well-documented, but he doesn’t want to live in that there Big London and would quite like another Premier League winners’ medal to add to the three he won previously with Manchester United. And finally, reports from the Emerald Isle suggest Martin O’Neill has held talks with Stoke City, where he is likely to be joined by his glamorous assistant Roy Keane. The FAI says it has not been formally approached by Stoke, who don’t need permission to ask for O’Neill’s hand in managership as the new two-year deal he agreed with his employers some months ago remains resolutely unsigned.

The fourth charge states that between 7 January 2006 and 15 January 2007 Coombes dishonestly obtained for herself “a pecuniary advantage”, namely that she was “given the opportunity to earn remuneration or greater remuneration in an office or employment by deception, namely by falsely representing that [she was] a carer for Kenneth Coombes”.

So went the old saying. Carillion has just proved it wrong. Britain’s second biggest construction company and state contractor has gone into liquidation. Accountants must reallocate to other firms the billions of pounds in contracts for prisons, schools, hospitals, railways and military bases. It must somehow underpin these contracts, which will cost money. Fiasco or not, the nation’s business must go on. The fate of Carillion does not undermine privatisation. Gargantuan profits made at the taxpayers’ expense long pre-dated Thatcherism – witness the cost-plus rackets in defence procurement, NHS pharmaceuticals, road-building and public housing. During the last mass public-sector construction, 1970s’ hospitals, some of the costliest, ugliest and least efficient buildings in the land were built. What the Carillion saga demonstrates is the rampant indiscipline in the contracts themselves. The company’s demise is attributable to favouritism, cost escalation, excessive risk, obscene remuneration and reckless indebtedness. Carillion and its bankers clearly thought it too big to fail. Whitehall behaved accordingly. It was like a pre-2008 bank. There must now be a review of how privatisation is working. Its so-called parastatal companies are not true private entities. They depend on the state, and the state depends on them. Their lobbyists develop an unholy relationship with ministers and officials – witness the uncontrolled revolving door between Whitehall and the boardrooms. How to find the ideal mix of public sector loyalty and private sector incentive has bedevilled state procurement since the dawn of time. But there should be clear rules, as with monopoly regulation, such as limits on market dominance, debt and remuneration. The administrators will doubtless rescue the contracts, and the 20,000 workers, now floating on dud credit. But it must be wrong for the officials – and ministers – responsible for this fiasco to go free of accountability. Who agreed these contracts, and why? The Carillion affair must deliver at least some return to the public, that of a painful lesson learned.

The news helped push GKN’s shares up more than 4% to 437.4p, compared with the current value of the Melrose offer of about 424p a share – or more than £7bn. This suggests the City expects either a higher offer from Melrose, or perhaps a rival bidder. On Friday GKN’s shares surged 25% as it rejected the proposed offer from Melrose, saying it undervalued the company, and put forward its own plans to split into separate aerospace and automotive businesses. GKN has been vulnerable since November, when it issued a shock profit warning following problems at its US aerospace business. That led to the departure of the proposed chief executive Keith Cummings, who had run the underperforming unit, before he had taken up the post. Anne Stevens, who was announced as GKN’s new chief executive on Friday, is meeting investors to persuade them that the current management team is best placed to turn the business around. However, Melrose is telling GKN investors that the firm is undermanaged and lacks focus. The Melrose chief executive, Simon Peckham, said: “GKN shareholders can elect to sell in the market right now for a substantial premium to Friday’s opening price … Or they can choose to combine their business with ours and have the majority share in what we are confident will be a business capable of significant value enhancement.” The meetings are expected to continue over the next two weeks, with Melrose likely to unveil its formal offer after that. The analyst Andrew Gollan at Berenberg said a raised offer of 455p would be hard to reject: “We expect Melrose to return with a higher offer for GKN and for it to be accepted. There is an air of inevitability that GKN will end up being owned by Melrose. ” Rival bidders such as private equity firms may yet gatecrash the bid, with Carlyle mentioned as a possible candidate. The activist investor Elliott has taken a stake in GKN and a short position in Melrose. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/15/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-reveals-his-cancer-has-returned","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T10:38:23Z","webTitle":"BBC newsreader George Alagiah reveals his cancer has returned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/15/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-reveals-his-cancer-has-returned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/15/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-reveals-his-cancer-has-returned","fields":{"headline":"BBC newsreader George Alagiah reveals his cancer has returned","bodyText":"The newsreader George Alagiah, the BBC’s highest-paid star from a minority ethnic background, is to undergo further treatment for cancer after the disease returned. The 62-year-old presenter of the BBC News at Six was previously diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2014, which later spread to his liver and lymph nodes. He returned to work in November 2015 after being cleared of the disease following extensive treatment. But in a statement Alagiah’s agent, Mary Greenham, said the disease had recurred. She said Alagiah, a father of two, was in discussions with doctors about options for treatment. Alagiah spoke of his determination to fight the disease for a second time. “My brilliant doctors are determined to get me back to a disease-free state and I know they have the skill to do just that,” he said. “I learned last time around how important the support of family and friends is and I am blessed in that department. I genuinely feel positive as I prepare for this new challenge.” The Sri-Lanka-born presenter first informed his doctors of a problem in 2014. After a colonoscopy, a tumour was discovered on his bowel. MRI scans later detected eight tumours in his liver. He had several rounds of chemotherapy and three major operations, one of which included the removal of most of his liver. He has spoken frankly about the chances of the disease recurring. In 2016 he told the Telegraph: “I get anxious and then there is a huge relief when the doctor tells me it is clear again. But I am under no illusions. “The doctor warned me last year: ‘Your cancer knows the road, the pathway out of the gut.’ It can happen again.” Alagiah joined the BBC in 1989 and spent many years as one of the corporation’s leading foreign correspondents before moving to presenting the News at Six in 2007. Last year the publication of a list of the best-paid on-screen staff at the corporation revealed he was paid between £250,000 and £299,999, putting him 25th in the table and making him the highest earner from a black or minority ethnic background.

We were all in a dingy basement auditioning a drummer called Chris Millar, who had scabies at the time, when a rat ran across the floor. So Chris became Rat Scabies. Mick and Tony liked Rat’s drumming, but said he didn’t look right because he had a shabby overcoat and messy hair. So Rat and I went off to form a band with another guy, Ray Burns, who Rat knew through cleaning toilets at Fairfield Halls in Croydon. Ray had long hair and was into John McLaughlin, a jazz fusion guitarist, so I played him the Stooges and the Ramones – and he became our infamous madcap guitarist Captain Sensible. Rat suggested a singer called Dave Vanian, who was into vampire stuff. We got our name from two 1960s films: Luchino Visconti’s The Damned, about the Nazis, and the horror movie The Village of the Damned. It was perfect for us. Captain wore a nurse’s uniform on stage and, at the third gig, poured a pint of beer over his head. After that, it was just chaos every night. Audiences hated us. Motorcycle gangs chased us. It seemed like half the country wanted to beat the shit out of us. I had a bunch of riffs I’d written when I was in a band called Bastard. When I played New Rose to Rat, his drumming set it on fire. We signed to Stiff to do a single, and Nick Lowe produced us in a tiny eight-track studio. We spent more time in the pub round the corner than we spent recording, but Nick captured how wild we sounded. We thought we were a fast rock’n’roll band, but the journalist Caroline Coon coined the term “punk rock” so suddenly New Rose was “the first British punk single”. Everything happened very quickly after that. Contrary to belief, New Rose isn’t a love song. The words were just imagery to go with the riffs: “I got a new rose, I got it good / Guess I knew that I always would / I can’t stop to mess around / I got a brand new rose in town.” However, some lines did express my excitement about the early punk scene: “I got a feeling inside of me / It’s kinda strange like a stormy sea.” It was everything I’d ever dreamed of. And there I was in London with everyone going crazy for it. Dave Vanian, singer The band were auditioning for a singer, and I went early to check out the the guy before me, but he never turned up. Turned out it was Sid Vicious. Could he have become the singer in the Damned, rather than the bass-player in the Sex Pistols? We’ll never know. Brian shouted the lyrics in my ear while he played guitar, and I did the best I could. He’d seen me in the audience at some shows and told me: “You look like a singer.” Before it became all torn clothes and spiky hair, punk was about individuality. I wore winkle-pickers and was going for that 1920s Rudolph Valentino look. I’d seen a few Hammer horror films, too, and decided I wanted to live in Baron von Frankenstein’s castle. So I left my gravedigger job to join the Damned and everything started moving very fast. We’d rehearse, get in the van, tear up the country doing gigs, then get back in the studio. Sometimes the tape would stop and we’d hear some weird folk thing coming out of the speakers – to save money, it turned out, we were recording over someone else’s tape. New Rose was a raw, visceral, classic three-minute pop song. My famous spoken intro – “Is she really going out with him?” – is from the Shangri-La’s Leader of the Pack, which I adored. I’d just been clowning around, but everyone liked it so we kept it. We recorded a whole album – Damned Damned Damned – in two days flat. In those days, there was never much food around. We were fuelled by amphetamine sulphate and cider. Evil Spirits, the new album, is out on 13 April. The Stiff Singles box set is out now. Brian James’s eponymous debut is out now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/15/talking-horses-monday-15-january-best-bets-wolverhampton-plumpton-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T10:33:30Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Monday’s best bets at Wolverhampton and Plumpton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/15/talking-horses-monday-15-january-best-bets-wolverhampton-plumpton-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/15/talking-horses-monday-15-january-best-bets-wolverhampton-plumpton-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Monday’s best bets at Wolverhampton and Plumpton","bodyText":"Several of the biggest names in jump racing will be in the spotlight on Monday when Willie Mullins opens his doors to the media at an event to launch the new Dublin Racing Festival, incorporating both the Irish Champion Hurdle and its Gold Cup, on 3 and 4 February. The domestic action over the sticks, however, is understandably low-key, and the most attractive bets of the day are due to run at the twilight all-weather meeting on the Tapeta surface at Wolverhampton. A first prize of nearly £8,000 is on offer in the extended mile handicap, and Humbert (5.40) may have been let in on a lenient mark for his first start out of maiden company. Hugo Palmer’s four-year-old is very lightly raced, having made just two starts as a juvenile and then not appearing until December in his three-year-old season, but he showed promise in a valuable race at The Curragh in September 2016 and improved to win – after a 458-day break and a gelding operation – at Kempton last month. The second and third horses home there have both won since, and Humbert won with something to spare in a decent time. It will be disappointing if he cannot win from an opening mark of 83. Maratha (7.10) should also go well on the same card. Stuart Williams’s gelding has 11 runs behind him, but only three on either the all-weather surfaces of Polytrack or Tapeta and returned to winning form over this track and trip on 27 December. He seemed to appreciate the step back up to nine-and-a-half furlongs from a mile, and the form of his earlier third behind two subsequent winners suggests a 5lb rise may not be beyond him. Frank N Fair (3.05) should improve his already excellent record at Plumpton, while Conquer Gold (2.15) is the pick of the prices on the card at Ayr. Our latest trainer form table Nicky Henderson 41% (29) Brian Ellison 33% (15) Malcolm Jefferson 33% (9) Dr Richard Newland 29% (7) Philip Hobbs 28% (18) Emma Lavelle 27% (11) Alan King 25% (12) Sue Smith 21% (14) Nicky Richards 20% (10) Nigel Twiston-Davies 18% (40) Nick Williams 18% (11) Kim Bailey 17% (18) Lucinda Russell 16% (19) Donald McCain 15% (34) Tom George 15% (26) Gary Moore 14% (29) Harry Fry 14% (14) Neil Mulholland 13% (30) Dan Skelton 13% (30) Evan Williams 10% (29) Venetia Williams 9% (22) Oliver Sherwood 8% (12) Colin Tizzard 7% (28) Kerry Lee 7% (15) David Pipe 7% (14) Ian Williams 6% (18) Jonjo O’Neill 5% (21) Charlie Longsdon 5% (20) Paul Nicholls 0% (18) Fergal O’Brien 0% (15) Tim Vaughan 0% (14) Peter Bowen 0% (12) Warren Greatrex 0% (12) Ben Pauling 0% (6) Rebecca Curtis 0% (4) Chris Cook: This past fortnight has brought contrasting fortunes for the two biggest names in this table. Nicky Henderson tops it with a strike-rate better than 40% for the second week running, his 12 winners in the past fortnight including two important races on Saturday, Kempton’s Lanzarote and a Grade Two at Warwick. Meanwhile, Paul Nicholls is still waiting for his first winner of 2018, though he has had five seconds and Unioniste lost out by just a nose in a hunter chase. This is usually the quietest time of the core season for Nicholls, who gives his horses their midwinter flu vaccinations at the start of each year; even so, he’ll be hoping for improved results before January ends. A couple of Northern trainers have fared well from a handful of runners each, though I should note that Brian Ellison’s five winners included two on the Flat. His recent strike-rate in races over obstacles has been 22%. As I’ve said, I don’t have the time to filter out Flat runners from these numbers, but Ellison is clearly going well in any case. Two of Malcolm Jefferson’s three recent winners came in TV races on Saturday and he has a top-class animal in Waiting Patiently. Meanwhile, Philip Hobbs looks worth following now, while powerful yards having a tougher time include those run by Colin Tizzard, Fergal O’Brien and Ben Pauling. Each Monday through the core jumps season, we’re monitoring the relative success of 35 major jumps stables. The percentage figure is their win strike-rate for the last fortnight, while their total number of runners in that time is in brackets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/15/hugo-klynstra-son-of-dutch-prince-to-be-granted-royal-title-after-legal-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T16:38:06Z","webTitle":"Son of Dutch prince to be granted royal title after legal battle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/15/hugo-klynstra-son-of-dutch-prince-to-be-granted-royal-title-after-legal-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/15/hugo-klynstra-son-of-dutch-prince-to-be-granted-royal-title-after-legal-battle","fields":{"headline":"Son of Dutch prince to be granted royal title after legal battle","bodyText":"The Dutch royal family are expecting a new addition to their ranks imminently, but there will not be any glossy magazine spreads or appearances in front of the TV cameras. A 21-year-old called Hugo is set to be formally granted the title of Royal Highness Prince Carlos Hugo Roderik Sybren de Bourbon de Parme after a three-year legal battle with his father, Prince Carlos, a cousin to King Willem-Alexander and nephew to the king’s mother, Queen Beatrix, who abdicated from the throne in 2013. There is no doubt about the paternity of the young blue-blood, which was determined following a court order pursued by the young man’s mother in 1999. The delay in Hugo’s presence at the royal court has arisen because of Carlos’s insistence that he had an agreement with the mother, Brigitte Klynstra, a childhood friend, that it was a no-strings-attached relationship and there would be no family entanglement following conception. The prince’s legal papers claim it was “an independent decision by Brigitte Klynstra to want to become a mother”, although the former lovers were regularly seen together in Hugo’s early years. On his 18th birthday, in defiance of his father’s protests, Hugo sought to have his name changed to reflect his royal ancestry. He has also been seeking a listing in the register of the High Council of Nobility. Dutch law offers illegitimate children of nobility a right to a title. Carlos told the Dutch media in 2015: “I’ve heard that Hugo Klynstra has made such a request. That request is, at my initiative, now subject of a proceeding. It is a personal matter for me with a sad background.” In 2016 the security and justice ministry ruled in favour of Hugo’s claim. After Prince Carlos lodged an appeal, a court in The Hague concurred that the ministry’s decision was valid under Dutch law. On Monday the council of state, a constitutional advisory body and final court of appeal, was sitting behind closed doors to deal with Carlos’s final objections, but the title is widely expected to be formally conferred and made public within six to 12 weeks. Prince Carlos is head of the House of Bourbon-Parma as well as a member of the Dutch royal family. He has an uncontested claim to the defunct throne of the Duchy of Parma, and is pretender to Spanish throne, a title his father pursued. His parents were at the centre of arguably the Dutch royal family’s most serious constitutional crisis when Carlos’s mother, Princess Irene, the second daughter of Queen Juliana, converted to Catholicism in 1963 to marry Prince Carlos Hugo. There was revulsion at the the match, in part because of Spain’s support for the Nazis in the war and the decision by Carlos Hugo to meet Franco, the country’s dictator, before the couple’s proposed nuptials. The Queen and Prince Bernhard took a military aircraft to Spain to bring their daughter back home, only for the Dutch government to announce it would resign en masse if a queen of the Netherlands alighted on Spanish soil. The couple married a year later without any members of the Dutch family present."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/15/oscars-steven-spielberg-female-directors-greta-gerwig-lady-bird","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T13:57:38Z","webTitle":"Female trouble: how can the Oscars fix the scandal of all-male director lists?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/15/oscars-steven-spielberg-female-directors-greta-gerwig-lady-bird","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/15/oscars-steven-spielberg-female-directors-greta-gerwig-lady-bird","fields":{"headline":"Female trouble: how can the Oscars fix the scandal of all-male director lists?","bodyText":"Oprah may have raised the roof with a long and rousing speech at this year’s Golden Globes, but presenter Natalie Portman cut to the chase with just six words: “Here are the all-male nominees.” Presenting the award for best director, the actor raised an uncomfortable laugh, and an important point. Very few women are ever nominated for this category in major film awards ceremonies; fewer still win. But why is that? An argument made by many on social media was that there simply aren’t enough female directors to choose from. That’s part of the problem: studios are still hugely reluctant to hire a woman to helm a major movie with the kind of marketing and campaign budget that gets the attention of ceremonies such as the Globes and the Baftas, who also failed to nominate a single woman in its director category this year. Women accounted for just 11% of directors of the 250 top-grossing films of 2017, according to the latest report by San Diego State University’s Centre for the Study of Women in Television and Film. Those figures have barely improved since 1998. “The numbers haven’t changed significantly for the last two decades because at the highest levels of the business, people do not hire women to direct movies,” says Melissa Silverstein, founder/publisher of Women and Hollywood. “Studies have shown that when people in the industry think about a director, they picture a white male with greying hair – basically Steven Spielberg. That’s the default because that is what people have seen.” And it may be what voters are seeing, too. Greta Gerwig’s film Lady Bird picked up the Golden Globe for best motion picture (musical or comedy) as well as best actress (musical or comedy) for Saoirse Ronan. But who won the all-male best director category? Guillermo del Toro, for The Shape of Water. “A film like Lady Bird can have an almost perfect critical response, yet not get nominations,” laments Silverstein. While it’s true that the best picture and director winners aren’t always awarded for the same film, for Gerwig not to be even nominated for an acclaimed feature speaks volumes. Del Toro’s fellow nominees demonstrate Silverstein’s point clearly: Ridley Scott, Christopher Nolan, Martin McDonagh and yes, Steven Spielberg, for a film (The Post) that went home empty-handed, and wasn’t even nominated for a Bafta. Spielberg, diplomatically, has since made optimistic comments about the chances for a female director nominee when the Oscar contenders are announced on 23 January. “This is a pretty incredible year, and I think you’ll be seeing some nominations, I’m predicting at the Oscars this year for a woman director, if not several.” Silverstein says steps have been put in place that may help redress the imbalance. “Over the last two years, the Academy have completely remade the directing branch and have added many more women directors from all across the world. This will give women directors a fighting chance, one they really didn’t have previously when the branch was pretty much all men.” Other less high-profile awards ceremonies have also offered hope: Gerwig has already won best director at numerous critics’ awards, while Dee Rees, the director of the racially charged Mudbound, has also been honoured, though less resoundingly than pundits predicted. Other awards are finding different ways to honour female film-makers. The Los Angeles Online Film Critics Society recently decided to split the best director award into male and female categories, but segregation can’t really be the answer. While it may have been done with the best of intentions – to give credit to talented women – might it not seem a little patronising to put them in a different category, as if they can’t compete with the big boys? Surely the way to show the industry that great directors can be any gender is to nominate them alongside each other. What we need is an industry that welcomes all applicants for crew positions, whether they’re in sound, editing, cinematography or directing; and whatever their gender, race or sexuality. The Time’s Up campaign is raising awareness of the imbalance of power in every industry, and let’s hope film is making up for lost time by leading the way. Says Silverstein, “As a culture we need to shift away from our stories being about white men and by white men. That is how more women will receive the deserved honours.” Let’s hope the Academy takes note. Tell us which female directors deserve an Oscar"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/15/the-guardians-new-look-rivals-and-friends-respond","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T12:33:19Z","webTitle":"The Guardian's new look: readers and rivals respond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/15/the-guardians-new-look-rivals-and-friends-respond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/15/the-guardians-new-look-rivals-and-friends-respond","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian's new look: readers and rivals respond","bodyText":"Media organisations and social media users have been reacting to the launch of the Guardian’s new tabloid-sized paper. On Monday, the Daily Telegraph used the top of their masthead to proclaim that they were “Britain’s biggest and best quality newspaper”. With the Times having switched to tabloid format in 2003, the Telegraph and the Financial Times remain the last national daily newspapers printed in broadsheet format in the UK. The Sun offered a barbed welcome for the Guardian to the tabloid club. The front-page masthead reminded readers torn about which title to choose that their paper is £1.50 cheaper. The Sun’s editorial also declared: “From one tabloid to another, here is our suggestion for them to turn around their failing fortunes: actually report some exclusive, rip-roaring stories ... We know that is an alien concept to them, but it might help them flog a copy, or two.” The BBC’s media editor, Amol Rajan, formerly editor of The Independent newspaper, has provided a lengthy review of the new paper for the BBC News site, praising a compact paper that is “simply more convenient to read” in transit, and the way that the new Journal section feels “very connected to the paper”, but crucially, “allows the family to read different parts of the same edition.” He did, however, observe that “anybody who undertakes a redesign of a newspaper is mad, brave, desperate - or some combination of all three.” The Daily Mirror’s associate editor, Kevin Maguire, was concerned the Guardian may have already picked up some of what he considers to be the bad habits of tabloids. And the new format, if not the content, was praised by Ukip MEP and former political editor of the Daily Express, Patrick O’Flynn. The redesign was noted worldwide, with the New York Times’ Amie Tsang writing: “The Guardian, Britain’s Left-Wing News Power, Goes Tabloid.” In France Le Monde reported A la recherche d’un modèle économique, le « Guardian » se mue en tabloïd. Writing for Campaign magazine, Steve Goodman, managing director of print trading at media investment group Group M UK, described the new design as looking “sharper”. “Overall,” he says, “the paper just feels more modern.” The magazine design website Magculture, meanwhile, described the new tabloid as “a remarkably complete and finished item ... it feels familiar, while also feeling completely fresh.” With all the historical connotations of British tabloids, some of the jokes about the new format just about wrote themselves. And the new size is opening up new unexpected promotional opportunities for a paper not always seen as the natural choice of “white van man”. Speaking about the relaunch, editor-in-chief Katharine Viner assured readers that “Guardian journalism itself will remain what it has always been: thoughtful, progressive, fiercely independent and challenging; and also witty, stylish and fun.” But you certainly can’t please all of the people, all of the time. At least one reader, writing to the Guardian letters page, is disappointed with the change for slightly tangential reasons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jan/15/brexit-impact-analysis-nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-scottish-governments-brexit-impact-analysis-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T17:03:46Z","webTitle":"Sturgeon publishes Brexit impact report saying staying in single market best option - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/15/brexit-impact-analysis-nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-scottish-governments-brexit-impact-analysis-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/15/brexit-impact-analysis-nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-scottish-governments-brexit-impact-analysis-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Sturgeon publishes Brexit impact report saying staying in single market best option - Politics live","bodyText":"David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has told MPs that the government will not bail out Carillion, the public services firm that went into liquidation. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog. Suella Fernandes, who joined the government as a Brexit minister is last week’s reshuffle, claimed recently the UK’s plan to drop the EU charter of fundamental rights after Brexit would help avoid an “extra layer” of human rights, contradicting the government’s assurance that no protections would be lost. Business leaders have called on Amber Rudd to urgently publish an investigation into Britain’s reliance on EU workers, arguing that delays would be “catastrophic” for business. A Conservative city council has been criticised for “demonising” rough sleepers by suggesting they may not be homeless and discouraging people from giving them money. Henry Bolton faces the risk of being removed as Ukip leader by the party’s national executive committee, HuffPost’s Owen Bennett reports. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Heywood hearing has moved on from Brexit now, and returned to less-than-scintillating civil service process issues. Heywood says the government has a diplomatic academy training up civil servants for trade talks. Bernard Jenkin, the committee chair, goes next. Q: Shouldn’t the international trade department be integrated into the Brexit talks. Yes, says Heywood. He says Liam Fox is on the relevant committees. Q: Shouldn’t Crawford Falconer, the UK’s trade negotiator, attend the relevant cabinet committees? Heywood says Falconer is not negotiating Brexit. It is up to the prime minister to decide who attends the cabinet committee she chairs, he says. Marcus Fysh, a Conservative, goes next. Q: How much trade negotiating expertise does the civil service now have? An increasing amount, says Heywood. David Jones, the Conservative Brexiter, is asking the questions. Q: Do we have all the IT systems in place if we need a new customs system after a no deal Brexit? Heywood said a no deal Brexit would be a huge challenge. But much of the work would be for other countries. The French would need to put new controls in at Calais. He says, among those things in the government’s control, it has “a very good grip” on the issues. “We’re completely on it,” he says. Q: Isn’t there a strong possibility that we will have a no deal? Heywood says it is not either/or. The government is planning for a range of scenarios. And some outcomes overlap. Q: And you are comfortable you can get a good outcome? Heywood says the word “comfortable” is not appropriate. It is a difficult task. But he is on it, he says. At the public administration committee MPs have started asking Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, about Brexit. He says it is the most difficult challenge facing the civil service since the war. He says an extra 3,000 civil servants have been taken on, and more will have to be hired. How many more will depend on what type of Brexit the country gets. He says “we’re on top of it”. But “a large chunk of the challenge” is ahead. Samuel Lowe from the Centre for European Reform thinktank has posted an interesting thread on the single market on Twitter. It starts here. What makes it worth noting is that it has been endorsed by Sabine Weyand, deputy to Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. Commenting on it, she posted this. Last week the Times splashed on a story (paywall) about three options for defence cuts drawn up within government. It was by Deborah Haynes and here’s how it started. Military chiefs have drawn up a plan to cut the armed forces by more than 14,000 and combine elite units of paratroopers and Royal Marines to save money, The Times has learnt. The three sets of proposed cuts presented to Gavin Williamson when he took over as defence secretary from Sir Michael Fallon can be revealed today. The proposals — described by a Whitehall source as “ugly, ugly or ugly” — include cutting the army by 11,000 soldiers and losing 2,000 Royal Marines and sailors and 1,250 airmen. The total size of the regular armed forces is about 137,000. The army has a target size of 82,000 but at present it numbers fewer than 78,000. Reducing this to 71,000 or fewer would make it the smallest since before the Napoleonic wars more than 200 years ago. In the Commons Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, is answering an urgent question prompted by the Times report. But he is not giving much away beyond other than to say that the national security capability review is still underway. The Commons European scrutiny committee has challenged ministers to explain how they will ensure the UK maintains a secure supply of medical radioisotopes after Brexit. Radioisotopes are used to detect cancer. As it published a report on this issue, the committee said in a statement: The committee’s concern comes in the light of the serious shortage of radioisotopes [from 2008 to 2010] due to the prolonged shutdown of supply reactors in Canada and the Netherlands. The principal material, Molybdenum-99, is not produced in the UK and its decay product (Technetium-99m) is ultimately used for 90% of medical interventions involving radioisotopes. Molybdenum cannot be stockpiled as it has a half-life of only 66 hours. The security of supply of isotopes is currently fulfilled by the Euratom Supply Agency. Euratom provides the basis for the regulation of civilian nuclear activity, implements a system of safeguards to control the use of nuclear materials and controls the supply of fissile materials within EU member states. The UK’s future relationship with Euratom has emerged as a significant issue in the negotiations between the UK and the EU on EU withdrawal. The European Commission warns that the supply of medical radioisotopes is becoming more fragile and requires a more coordinated approach. The European Scrutiny Committee seeks assurance from the Government and an explanation of how the UK will develop its own policy. Philippa Whitford, an SNP member of the committee, said: I was working as a breast cancer surgeon during the Technetium shortage which lasted well over a year. During that time we were faced with having to ration bone scans to only the most urgent or worrying cases. In addition it held back the roll out of Sentinel Node Biopsy technique across the UK which has since allowed much less destructive surgery to be used when staging the spread of breast cancer. With all of these reactors nearing the end of their working lives, the Euratom Supply Agency plays an important role in avoiding such a shortage in the future. The committee is chaired by the Tory Brexiter Sir Bill Cash. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, has responded to the Scottish government’s Brexit impact analysis by accusing the SNP of ignoring the economic damage its independence plans would cause. ITV’s Peter MacMahon has tweeted these quotes. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, is about to start giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. You can watch the hearing here. Bernard Jenkin, the chair, has just told Heywood in his opening remarks that the committee will be holding an inquiry into Carillion. The hearing is supposed to be about civil service effectiveness, which sounds bland but will (with luck) take the MPs and Heywood into some newsy exchanges ... Leanne Wood, the leader of Plaid Cymru, gave a major speech earlier today setting out her “vision for a fairer Wales”. In it she argued that the Tories were offering neoliberalism and that Labour were offering state socialism and that neither were what Wales needed. She said: Decisions about Wales should be made in Wales. Self-determination means that we should choose which powers we want to share with other countries or with Europe. Yet neither an intensification of neoliberalism, nor the resurrection of British state socialism will provide the solutions that are needed to solve our economic challenges and turn Wales around. Both visions offered by the two largest Westminster parties marginalise our specific needs as a nation. We need to get out there and show people how the core weakness of Labour’s paternalistic, centralising socialism is its democratic deficit. It will neither enable people to own their own resources nor run them democratically. It won’t empower people because it doesn’t trust people. We should look at locating new institutions outside where they are concentrated already, as Plaid Cymru has advocated for the new transport authority, football museum, national development bank, and other bodies. It means ensuring that those parts of Cardiff as well as our former industrialised communities which are amongst the poorest areas of the country, can benefit from a sustainable regional approach to economic development. This is about levelling up, and treating geographic inequality as a problem to be tackled in the same way as other inequalities. She also proposed legal safeguards to ensure public sector investment is fairly shared across Wales and giving people a minimum set of social rights for all including life-long learning and a decent home Wood’s lecture is being published as a pamphlet and she intends to tour Wales holding public meetings discussing the ideas it contains. Jon Lansman, the Momentum founder, veteran Labour Bennite and close Corbyn ally, has tweeted this about his election to Labour’s NEC. And Yasmine Dar, who was also backed by Momentum, has tweeted this about her victory. But their victory has not gone down well at the Evening Standard, whose editor, the Conservative former chancellor George Osborne, has just tweeted this. Here is the full text of the statement that Neil Findlay, Scottish Labour’s Brexit spokesman, has issued on the Sturgeon speech. The Tories reckless and incompetent Brexit risks devastating our economy, jobs and public services. The Tories’ Brexit process has so far delivered nothing but uncertainty and attacks on hard-won workers rights and devolution. It’s the security of people’s jobs and the economy which should be at the heart of any deal to leave the EU and Labour will get on with fighting for the best possible deal for the whole of the UK while respecting the result of the EU referendum; unlike the SNP who seem never to accept the result of any referendum. It is telling that on the day Carillion goes into liquidation the first minister is back on her constitutional offensive whilst offering no reassurance to the Scottish workers impacted. The truth is that it’s only Labour, at a UK and Scottish level, that has a plan to invest in our public services, our industries and our people and communities - and it’s only Labour that will negotiate a new relationship with the single market that retains its benefits, or a new bespoke trade deal that protects our economy. As you’ll notice, it doesn’t address the argument Sturgeon was making about Labour’s stance on the single market. (See 12.30pm.) Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has sought to galvanise efforts to get MPs to insist on the UK staying in the single market after Brexit by publishing an analysis showing this would be the least damaging outcome. (See 12.30pm.) The construction firm Carillion, which is involved in a host of major government projects such as HS2 as well as vital public services including schools, hospitals, prisons and the army, has gone into compulsory liquidation, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Jeremy Corbyn’s support base on Labour’s key decision-making body has been strengthened with the election of three candidates backed by Momentum, the grassroots activist group behind his leadership. As Adam Boulton argued in his Sunday Times column yesterday (paywall), this means that for “the first time in Labour’s history ‘the left’ will dominate all three of the party’s centres of power: the trade unions, the shadow cabinet in parliament and the national executive.” Penny Mordaunt, the relatively new international development secretary, has said the UK will no longer pay for aid projects that developing countries could fund themselves. (See 10.43am.) A Sinn Féin MP who tweeted a video appearing to mock an IRA atrocity in which 10 Protestant civilians were murdered in Northern Ireland has resigned. A weekly cash allowance provided to asylum seekers should rise by 80p, a Home Office review has concluded. From next month the sum will increase from £36.95 to £37.75 per week, the Press Association reports. The government seeks to ensure asylum seekers are not left destitute while their application is determined. Support is usually provided in the form of furnished accommodation, as well as a financial allowance to cover essential living needs. The weekly cash sum is reviewed each year and a Home Office report detailing the latest findings was published today. Mariam Kemple-Hardy of Refugee Action said: We acknowledge that the government has responded to a consultation on the rate of asylum support by a small increase of 80p a week. But with soaring inflation and no increase to asylum support over the past three years, this should have gone much further - to at least 70% of mainstream benefits. More people seeking asylum are waiting longer for their claim to be processed. During this time, which in some cases can be years, people are left unable to work and struggling to survive on just over £5 a day. This takes a tremendous toll on the wellbeing of people who have fled conflict and persecution. Expecting people to survive on so little is incompatible with a compassionate asylum system. Henry Bolton is facing pressure to step down as Ukip leader, despite saying on Monday he had ended a relationship with a party activist following the emergence of racist messages she sent. Eddie Izzard, the Labour centrist who was runner up behind the three Momentum candidates in the NEC election (see 12.36pm), has said he will continue to campaign for an “open and welcoming Labour party” after his defeat. The Scottish Conservatives have dismissed the Scottish government’s Brexit impact report. This is from the BBC’s Nick Eardley, quoting Adam Tomkins, shadow communities secretary in the Scottish parliament. As expected, the three leftwing Momentum candidates have easily won the Labour national executive council election. Here are the results. And here is our story. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said she was publishing a Brexit impact report in the hope of boosting the prospects of getting the UK to stay in the single market. She described the document (pdf) as “more detailed and extensive than anything so far provided by the UK Government” and said that it showed clearly that, if the UK has to leave the EU, staying in the single market was “the least damaging option by far”. It was “absolutely, manifestly, beyond any doubt the option that will do the least damage to our economy”, she said. The report focuses on the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy, but it says explicitly (in paragraph 13) that it has implications for the debate in the UK generally. Sturgeon said: With the next phase of the talks to determine the future relationship between EU and the UK due to begin in the next few weeks, it is time now to make that case for continued membership of the single market even more loudly than before. Today we do exactly that backed by new evidence of the importance of single market membership to our economic and social prospects. She said she believed that there was a majority in favour of staying in the single market in the House of Commons. She was referring to where she think MPs stand on this as individuals. As she conceded, Labour’s official stance on the single market (see next paragraph) is preventing that majority she claims exists being mobilised. She implied that Jeremy Corbyn was trying to mislead people by claiming that the UK could not leave the EU and remain in the single market. She said this as she conceded that getting Corbyn to shift his stance on the single market was crucial. The bigger issue, in order to get to that majority, is to get Jeremy Corbyn off the ridiculous position he is in. Either Jeremy Corbyn is still misunderstanding the position of the single market, which given how often it has been pointed out to him can’t possibly be the case. Or he is now trying to deliberately mislead people with this line that you cannot be in the single market if you are not in the EU. Norway stands as the living proof that that is just not the case. The Scottish government report said Scotland’s GDP would be 8.5% lower by 2030 than it would be if it stayed in the EU if Brexit resulted in the UK trading with Europe on WTO terms. It would be 6.1% lower with a free trade agreement, but only 2.7% lower if the UK stayed in the single market, the report said. The report also translated these figures into GDP per capita terms - a tactic that George Osborne also tried when he published a Treasury report on the impact of Brexit before the referendum. Osborne’s tactic is generally seen to have been a failure, partly because the figures he used seemed too precise to be plausible for a long-term forecast and partly because implying that GDP per capita was the same as household income was seen as misleading. The report said real disposable income would be almost 10% lower by 2030 under the hardest form of Brexit than it would be if the UK stayed in the EU. Under a free trade agreement it would be 7.4% lower, the report said, and it would be just 1.4% lower if the UK stayed in the single market. This measure was not one included in the Treasury forecast in 2016. The report said staying in the single market was advantageous not just because barriers to trade would be lower but because the benefits of the single market have not yet been fully realised. It said: It is clear that the benefits we have derived from almost 45 years of membership of the single market are far from exhausted. Although substantial progress has been achieved in the years since the European single market programme was launched in 1992, it remains incomplete in key areas. Removing the remaining barriers to trade in goods and services will unlock further gains for commerce, consumers and workers across the EU. This is particularly true as the EU moves to complete an energy union, a capital markets union, a banking union and a digital single market. Furthermore, considerable potential remains untapped due to remaining barriers to cross-border trade in goods and services. Sturgeon said she had to campaign to keep free movement because restricting EU migration would be bad for the Scottish economy. The report said: Scotland’s economy benefits significantly from EU migration. EU citizens are helping to grow our economy, address skills shortages within key sectors and make an essential contribution to our population growth. Over the last decade population growth has been the primary driver of GDP growth and this has been driven chiefly by inward migration. The Scottish government recently undertook modelling of the economic contribution of EU citizens to the Scottish economy which confirms that workers from other EU countries bring real economic benefits to Scotland. And in her speech Sturgeon said: Over the next 25 years our own projected birthrate will not be sufficient to grow our population. In the period to 2041, all our projected population growth will come from inward migration. Without that our population could go into decline and with it our ability to grow our economy and fund our public services. That would be the stark reality for Scotland of a restriction in our ability to attract people to our country. That is why, as first minister, I have a duty to make the case for free movement, no matter how difficult that is sometimes perceived to be. The report said leaving the single market would lead to lower standards. It said: The damage will not only be economic, serious as this is, but will also compromise current safeguards in a range of vital policy areas currently driven at the EU level such as rights and protections in areas like the environment, workers’ rights and justice and home affairs co-operation where we derive considerable benefit. The UK government does not accept this. Ministers have repeatedly claimed that standards affecting things like workers’ rights and the environment will not be lowered after Brexit. Marco Biago, a former SNP MSP and local government minister in the Scottish government until 2016, thinks that that just telling people that GDP will be lower under a hard Brexit, as the Scottish government’s report says, is not a persuasive strategy. Here is an extract from Nicola Sturgeon’s speech. For the sake of jobs, the economy and the next generation, today we are calling on the UK government to drop its hard Brexit red-lines so that Scotland and the UK can stay inside the single market and customs union. Scotland is particularly well-placed to take advantage of the developing and deepening single market - the world’s biggest economy of 500m people, eight times the size of the UK. Our brilliant world-class universities, our unrivalled potential in renewable energy, our life sciences industry, our digital sector and other key areas of the Scottish economy are all in prime position to reap the rewards of these developments. That will mean more jobs and higher wages. It would be a tragedy for future generations if we let that opportunity pass us by. The fact that the prime minister wants to leave not only the political structures of the EU but come out of the European Economic Area shows just how extreme the UK government position is. With just weeks to go before the opening of talks on the future relationship that extreme stance must be dropped. Sturgeon has finished taking questions. I will post a summary shortly. Sturgeon says the fruit picking industry will be severely impacted by Brexit. Access to labour is a key consideration, she says. It is a sector with a high level of anxiety about Brexit, she says. Q: What is the UK gets a better deal than expected? Sturgeon says there is no option as good as staying in the EU. And, if the UK has to leave, no option - even a Canada plus plus plus” - is better than staying in the single market. She says she hopes the UK government does well in the negotiations. But she says the UK government’s red lines imply only a Canada-type deal will be acceptable. She refers to Michael Barnier’s graphic illustrating this, which is in the Scottish government’s report. Q: How many jobs would be lost by leaving the single market? Sturgeon says estimates vary a bit. But broadly economists agree on the dangers of leaving the single market, she says. Q: Are you holding any discussions with Jeremy Corbyn to get him to change his mind? Sturgeon says she thinks of it as a matter of getting Corbyn to be coherent and logical. She has not had talks with Corbyn, she says. But she says her colleagues at Westminster discuss this with Labour. She says people who cannot see that staying in the single market are the best option are blinded by ideology. Here is an extract from the Scottish government’s news release. A failure to remain in the single market or to secure a free trade agreement would see Scotland’s GDP around £12.7bn lower by 2030 than it would be under continued EU membership. This is would mean a loss equivalent to £2,300 per year for each person in Scotland. The analysis takes account of the impact on trade, productivity and migration of different future relationships. It shows that a so called ‘Canada-type’ deal with the EU would still leave Scotland’s GDP £9bn lower by 2030 – or £1,610 per head. Other key findings include: Remaining within the single market could see an additional benefit to Scotland’s economy if the EU makes progress on completing the single market in services, energy and the digital economy Continued migration from the EU in line with freedom of movement is required to support continued economic growth, with each additional EU citizen working in Scotland currently contributing an average of £10,400 in tax revenue Any relationship with the EU short of remaining in the single market could have a significant impact on social protections, environmental and consumer policies Sturgeon says the Scottish government is still backing the plan it put forward last year, for Scotland to say in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. But she thinks there is an appetite across the UK for staying in the single market. Q: The document shows that trade with England, Wales and Northern Ireland is bigger than it is with the EU. Shouldn’t you focus on that? Sturgeon says she does not want to compromise or give up trade with other countries in the UK. She says she will attend a round-table after lunch with people from the financial services sector. That is an example of how she is trying to strengthen trade with England. Sturgeon says she does not know if May will still be PM at the end of this process. She says Jeremy Corbyn’s position on the single market [that you cannot be in it if you leave the EU] is ridiculous. Either he does not understand the reality, or he is being disingenuous, she says. Q: What impact would a two-year transition have on your thinking about a second independence referendum? Sturgeon says she addressed this in her Andrew Marr interview yesterday. She does not want to add anything to that. Q: Are you appealing over the heads of the government to MPs directly? Sturgeon says she thinks the arguments she has made have had an influence. The direction of travel is in the direction of staying in the single market, she says. She says she wants voices outside politics to speak up. She encourages business to speak up. This paper sets out the implications of the three, broad post-Brexit options are. It shows beyond any doubt that the least damaging option is staying in the single market, she says. Sturgeon has finished her speech. She is now taking questions. She says the paper is intended to influence the debate now. She says she thinks there is a majority in favour of single market membership in the Commons, whatever Jeremy Corbyn thinks. She says she has put this evidence into the public demain “to seek to harness that majority”. Here is a clearer version of the key chart from the document. This chart shows the estimated impact of three versions of Brexit on Scotland by 2020 (the dark blue lines), by 2025 (the mid-blue ones) and by 2030 (the light blue ones). On the left the bars show the impact of staying in the European economic area (ie, staying in the single market.) The set of bars in the middle show the impact of trading with Europe under a free trade agreement. And the three bars of the left show the impact of trading with the EU on WTO terms. http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0053/00530160.pdf Here are some of the key charts from the document. Here is the 58-page Brexit impact analysis in full (pdf). Here is the news release summarising the Brexit analysis paper the Scottish government has just published. Nicola Sturgeon has just started her Brexit speech. There is a live feed at the top of this page. Penny Mordaunt, the relatively new international development secretary, was on the Today programme this morning explaining her new approach to aid policy. She told the programme: For me, the bar we need to set on aid spending is not just ‘are we spending this money well’ but ‘could we spend it better in the national interest’ and I think we do need to address that issue head on. Mordaunt was expanding on ideas she set out in an article in today’s Daily Telegraph (paywall). In it, she set out out what she describes as five aid pledges. Here is my summary of them. (Her article put them in a different order.) 1 - Mordaunt said the UK would no longer pay for aid projects developing countries could fund themselves. I will not invest when others should be putting their hands in their pockets. It will no longer be enough for a project simply to be achieving good things. We must be able to demonstrate why it absolutely needs to be Britain that pays for them – rather than other donors, the private sector or, where it can, the government of the country itself. I want the governments of developing countries to take responsibility for investing in healthcare or education. If it chooses not to, that will inform our decisions. 2 - She said spending by other departments would contribute to the aid target. As more government departments make investments in overseas development, I will find new ways to help other departments make their spend more effective. This provides further means for us to invest and does not increase the UK’s deficit. And it also counts towards our 0.7 per cent of GDP aid spending target. 3 - She said she would focus aid spending more on “issues that matter most to the British people”. I will ensure that our aid spend directly contributes to tackling the issues that matter most to the British people. We are already doing this in some areas. For example, DFID’s research on global health has already helped protect our nation from the risk of global pandemics, and developed new diagnostic tests that are also being used by the NHS. But we will go much further. You will soon see the fruits of work between DFID and Defra to tackle plastics polluting the oceans and to prevent the illegal wildlife trade, both issues the British public care about passionately. (This does sound a bit like a proposal to start spending money on saving dolphins instead of the world’s poor, but doubtless Mordaunt would object to that characterisation.) 4 - She said she would use aid to assist Brexit. I will develop alongside the Department for International Trade a bold new Brexit-ready proposition to boost trade and investment with developing countries and promote sustainable economic development and job creation. Development policy will not exist in a vacuum. It will be part of a joined-up response to the challenges and opportunities we face as a country. 5 - She said she would cut funding to organisations that do not deliver on the targets they are set. The Sinn Fein MP Barry McElduff has resigned - which means we’re getting the first byelection of 2018. McElduff has been in trouble ever since he posted for a video last year apparently pocking fun at the victims of the IRA Kingsmill massacre. Last week Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, clearly referred to McElduff when she said Sinn Fein’s enthusiasm for eulogising terrorists was a major obstacle to the restoration of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. The byelection is unlikely to to make any difference to the party balance at Westminster. Sinn Fein has held West Tyrone since 2001 and at the last election McElduff had a majority of 10.342. On the subject of Brexit, the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn has a good story about how Boris Johnson has been telling people in private that he fears Brexit could be reversed and that he thinks staying in the EU would be better than a soft Brexit. Here’s an extract. Boris Johnson has warned allies that Brexit is far from certain and they still face a big fight to deliver it. The Foreign Secretary and leading Leaver privately shares ex-UKIP boss Nigel Farage’s worries that the referendum result could yet be reversed ... He has also confided with friends over his concerns that Theresa May will be worn down and eventually forced to accept a bad deal by mandarins and Remain-leaning Cabinet ministers during trade negotiations that start in March. Boris has told confidantes that still having to accept dictats from Brussels would leave the UK as “just another Norway” and the nationwide vote’s landmark result would have proved “a total waste of time”. In that soft Brexit scenario, the mop-haired Tory boss has even claimed to pals: “I’d rather us stay in than leave like that”. In his London Playbook email, Politico Europe’s Jack Blanchard says he has heard much the same thing. Playbook has heard similar noises from allies of the foreign secretary. Boris reportedly told one that Brexit is “a long way from over,” describing the Remainers’ plan to stay aligned with EU rules and regs after Brexit as “mad” and warning: “You’d be better off staying in.” Obviously, you would never expect Newton Dunn or Blanchard to reveal their sources for their stories. It is probably just pure coincidence that Johnson himself hosted a drinks party for selected journalists (not me) on Thursday night ... Good morning. And welcome to the new-look Politics Live. The Guardian print edition relaunches today as a tabloid and the website has been redesigned too. There have been two breaking news stories on the go this morning. The construction firm Carillion, which is involved in a host of major government projects such as HS2 as well as vital public services including school dinners, has gone into compulsory liquidation, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk. My colleague Graeme Wearden has all the latest on his business live blog. Henry Bolton has insisted he will not resign as Ukip leader after ending a relationship with a party activist following the emergence of racist messages she sent, saying he is being unfairly targeted by critics. Bolton has been doing a round of interviews this morning, and on the Today programme found himself answering a series of very un-Today questions about quite when he shacked up with the racist text messages model and when his estranged wife first found out about it. Not what you normally expect for John Humphrys. We’ll be getting a rather different Brexit story this morning when Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, gives a speech to mark the publication of the Scottish government’s Brexit impact assessment. Yesterday she said it was “shameful” that the UK government had not published its own analysis. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Nicola Sturgeon gives a speech on Brexit as her government publishes its Brexit impact analysis. 12pm: Labour announces the results of elections for vacancies on its national executive committee. Three Corbyn-supporting leftwingers are expected to win quite easily. 2.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3pm: Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration committee about the civil service. 3.30pm: A minister is expected to make a Commons statement about Carillion. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.

She and Milansbar had their rivals in trouble a long way from home with an attacking approach to the Classic Chase, coming home 11 lengths clear despite odds of 12-1. It was Frost’s first ride on the horse and she evidently made the right impression on the winning owner, 80-year-old Robert Bothway, enjoying his biggest moment in the sport after more than half a century of owning racehorses. He described her work here as “brilliant, absolutely first-class, couldn’t have wished for anything better”, adding that he would be delighted if Frost were able to take the mount again at Aintree in April. Milansbar was quietly fancied for the Welsh Grand National last weekend but turned in a most unpromising display, being pushed along from an early stage before unseating Trevor Whelan at the 12th. Connections felt he had sulked after being crowded in the mad dash to the first bend that day but the result was that his trainer, Neil King, went for a day’s shooting rather than coming here to see the sequel. He was immediately on the phone to Bothway with the rallying cry: “Aintree, here we come!” Indeed, Milansbar may not run again before the big day if King thinks he can keep him fresh enough with a couple of days’ hunting. He does not wish to wear out the effect of the blinkers which worked so well when fitted for the first time here. A 40-1 shot for the National on Saturday night, Milansbar has obviously not convinced everybody he is the right type for that test but last year’s National hero, One For Arthur, also won this race en route. If Frost takes the ride, Milansbar will surely be a warm order with the betting public and those charged with promoting the sport may require oxygen at the prospect of her getting a first ride in the race on a horse with half a chance. “He’s turned into Pegasus!” Frost told reporters, once more showing the unforced enthusiasm and volubility which, along with her riding skills, got her voted “jockey of the month” for both November and December. Explaining how she was able to save a bit of her horse’s energy, so that he was not a spent force on the run-in, she said: “He’s pulled up, still thinking he’s God. He’ll be going home, having lovely dreams about winging over those fences.” Even in victory, many jockeys are cautious in conversation with reporters. Frost may be the first in the game’s 300 years to greet the press pack with the words: “Hey guys! How are we all doing?” Asked about her recent successes, she said: “Life’s good. The crowd are awesome.” Perhaps her agent or her main employer, Paul Nicholls, are safeguarding the 5lb claim she can take off the backs of her horses until she rides her 40th winner. Still, it is a surprise to see that this was just her fourth ride of the year and her only one on the card. She makes no such complaint herself, saying of this first booking for King: “It fills you with confidence because people are obviously seeing the way that you ride and saying: ‘You know what, I think she’d get on with my horse, I’m going to put her up and see what happens.’” More trainers should be thinking that way. A good day was also had by Nicky Henderson, who was getting married in Scotland while four of his horses won races, including William Henry in Kempton’s Lanzarote. North Yorkshire’s Malcolm Jefferson had a double, including a most impressive success by Waiting Patiently, who will surely have a big chance in a Grade One at the Cheltenham Festival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/13/tacky-statue-of-diana-and-dodi-fayed-to-be-removed-from-harrods","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T16:24:01Z","webTitle":"'Tacky' statue of Diana and Dodi Fayed to be removed from Harrods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/tacky-statue-of-diana-and-dodi-fayed-to-be-removed-from-harrods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/tacky-statue-of-diana-and-dodi-fayed-to-be-removed-from-harrods","fields":{"headline":"'Tacky' statue of Diana and Dodi Fayed to be removed from Harrods","bodyText":"A statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed that has been widely described as “tacky” will be removed from Harrods. The bronze sculpture of the couple, who died in a car crash in Paris two decades ago, has been on display at the west London department store since 2005. It was commissioned by Mohamed Al Fayed, who owned Harrods at the time but sold it to the Qatar Investment Authority in 2010 for about £1.5bn. The store’s boss, Michael Ward, said it was now time to return the statue given that princes William and Harry had commissioned their own tribute to their mother at Kensington Palace. “We feel that the time is right to return this memorial to Mr Al Fayed and for the public to be invited to pay their respects at the palace,” Ward said. It was not clear when it would be removed from the basement of Harrods, or whether Fayed would seek to keep the statue on public display. A Fayed family spokesman told the Times they were “grateful” to the Qatari fund for preserving the memorial of the couple, adding: “It is now time to bring them home.” When the statue was unveiled, Fayed said it was a more “fitting tribute” to Diana than the official memorial fountain in Hyde Park that he described as a “sewer”. The Harrods statue shows Diana in a low-cut dress with a slit up to the thigh and Dodi in an open shirt. The couple are shown dancing in Mediterranean waves beneath the wings of an albatross, which supposedly symbolised freedom and eternity. “I have named the sculpture Innocent Victims, because for eight years I have fought to prove that my son and Princess Diana were murdered,” Fayed said in 2005. “This is a statue to stay here for ever. Until now nothing has been done to preserve her memory and legacy. She was an amazing woman who brought joy to the whole world.” The statue was designed by Harrods artistic design adviser Bill Mitchell, who had worked for the Fayed family for more than 40 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:03:12Z","webTitle":"After the #MeToo backlash, an insider’s guide to French feminism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"After the #MeToo backlash, an insider’s guide to French feminism","bodyText":"French women made headlines all over the world last week. And not because they never get fat or their children never throw food, as a series of American bestsellers put it, but because 100 of them signed an open letter published in Le Monde offering an alternative view of the #MeToo campaign and drawing attention to what they regard as rampant censorship in feminist ranks. In signing the letter, the French film star Catherine Deneuve set the feminist world ablaze. They spoke their mind in a Gallic manner: straightforwardly, to the point of appearing blunt. The letter was also strikingly badly edited, with clumsy chunks unworthy of their authors. But, in short, they think the campaign by the #MeToo movement to tackle sexual harassment represents a “puritanical … wave of purification”; that “rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or cackhandedly, is not, nor is being gentlemanly a macho attack”. They went on to proclaim that “what began as freeing women up to speak has today turned into the opposite – we intimidate people into speaking ‘correctly’, shout down those who don’t fall into line, and those women who refused to bend [to the new realities] are regarded as complicit and traitors”. In other words, these 100 French women, representing many more in France, argue that this new puritanism reeks of Stalinism and its “thought police”, not of true democracy. What they refuse to countenance is an image of women “as poor little things, this Victorian idea that women are mere children who have to be protected”, the same one extolled by religious fundamentalists and reactionaries. “As women, we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality.” This is an example of what has always distinguished French feminism from the American and British versions: the attitude towards sex and towards men. Partly lost in translation, the letter was vilified on social networks, its authors accused by some of being “lobotomised” by their “internalised misogyny” (according to Asia Argento), and more generally for being “rape apologists”, “too old and decrepit to understand women’s issues today”, for being “over-privileged”, for being “stuck in the 1960s and 1970s”. Deneuve and Catherine Millet, the art critic famous for The Sexual Life of Catherine M, suddenly became the faces of what was seen by many younger feminists in France and abroad as a retrograde bunch of over-privileged celebrities and intellectuals both totally unconcerned by the plight of all those anonymous victims of rape and sexual harassment and too preoccupied by their sexual freedom and defending the French way of gallivanting about. The letter’s authors did not do themselves any favours by writing of men’s “right to pester” women. This clumsy and unacceptable line poured more oil on the fire and reinforced prejudices and cliches about French women. As Simone de Beauvoir wrote in 1947: “American women have only contempt for French women always too happy to please their men and too accepting of their whims.” This is a real shame: the letter puts forward strong arguments. And it does so by being overtly French; in other words, by sounding authoritative – and rude. Heated debate is a passion, considered healthy in France. As the highly regarded 89-year-old French historian and feminist Michelle Perrot, partly critical of the Deneuve letter, wrote: “They are triumphant free women who show a certain lack of solidarity with the #MeToo victims … But they say what they think, and many people share their point of view. The debate is real and must be recognised.” In France today, different feminist groups coexist: the main one is a feminism following the steps of De Beauvoir, one that is not at war with men but rather with machismo culture, gender inequality and the inherent misogyny of religions. And there is a rather recent American import of feminism, one that often comes across as opportunistic and “man-hating”, one that turns a blind eye to religious misogyny, for instance defending the wearing of the hijab. They present themselves as the new vanguard of French feminism, the new blood, except they can sound to some like Stalinist commissars, or Robespierre in culottes, passing edicts about what is acceptable conduct. We would be wrong, however, to think that the current debate shows a generational fight. Many millennials have signed the Deneuve letter. The divide is political, ideological even. According to Perrot, “the authors of the letter fear that the #MeToo movement dents creative, artistic and sexual freedom, that a moralist backlash comes and destroys what libertarian thinking has fought hard to obtain, that women’s bodies and sex become again this forbidden territory and that a new moral order introduces a new censorship against the free movement of desire”, and concludes: “There is indeed reason to share their fear.” This is probably the most interesting and sharpest argument made in the Deneuve letter. As Sarah Chiche, a 41- year-old psychoanalyst and author who signed the Deneuve letter, explained: “The #MeToo victims’ personal stories have proved a powerful magnet and very popular with the public. It has almost become a new norm in public discourse. Unfortunately, this is becoming insidious: now books need to be rewritten, films reshot.” Last week an opera director in Florence decided to change the end of Bizet’s Carmen so that Carmen now kills her murderer. Ridley Scott edited out Kevin Spacey from his latest film and reshot his scenes with Christopher Plummer in All the Money in the World. Art critics questioned on the BBC whether to boycott the Gauguin exhibition in London because the painter slept with under-age Tahitians. Others want to rewrite Sleeping Beauty so that the final kiss is a consented one. Since Deneuve signed the letter, Luis Buñuel’s Belle de Jour has suddenly been described as a rape apologist film, to be banned from cinemas. “This new feminism is now serving the interests of cultural revisionism and doesn’t know when or where to stop,” says Chiche. It is a French tradition to disturb, to question, to critique, to set ablaze the conflict between two freedoms, that which protects and that which disturbs. Sexuality has become the new battlefield. “Today, in 2018, Oshima’s In the Realm of the Senses and Nabokov’s Lolita would never see daylight because of both reactionaries and self-proclaimed progressives who invoke the fate of real victims to shut us all up,” says Chiche. For all the talk about Deneuve, little has been said of the initiator of this public letter. Her name is Abnousse Shalmani. She is a 41-year-old French-Iranian, born in Tehran. She grew up under Ayatollah Khomeini until her parents fled to Paris in 1985. In a book she published in 2014, Khomeini, Sade et Moi, she revealed that she was the victim of a rape, but also said French authors such as Colette, Victor Hugo and Marquis de Sade taught her how to be free, as a woman and a sexual being, far from the Islamic veil she was forced to wear as a girl in Tehran. Perhaps we should listen to her when, amid the furore, she tried to make herself heard on French radio: “We do not dismiss the many women who had the courage to speak up against [Harvey] Weinstein. We do not dismiss either the legitimacy of their fight. We do, however, add our voice, a different voice, to the debate.” One should always listen to the French difference.

Who could have predicted that Jelena Ostapenko or Sloane Stephens would win their first grand slam titles last year? Still, if form is anything to go by then Svitolina will regard this as a fine opportunity to break her duck. The improving world No4 impressed on her way to winning the Brisbane International last week and the Ukrainian’s first real challenge could be Stephens, fitness permitting, in the fourth round. Johanna Konta With Andy Murray recuperating from hip surgery, the pressure on Konta – now coached by Michael Joyce – to keep British hopes alive in Melbourne is likely to be immense. The world No9 was a semi-finalist in 2016 and she also reached the last eight last year, losing to Serena Williams, the eventual champion, while a run to the last four at Wimbledon suggested that Konta could follow in Virginia Wade’s footsteps one day. The Sydney-born 26-year-old can be inconsistent, though, and was forced to withdraw from her Brisbane quarter-final with a hip problem. Venus Williams The flux in the women’s game is best encapsulated by Simona Halep rising to the top of the rankings despite never having won a slam. Garbiñe Muguruza, meanwhile, has a patchy record on hard courts. Keeping that in mind, then, experience could be key. Venus Williams might not have her little sister for company but the 37-year-old was a finalist in Melbourne last year and should not be overlooked because of her age although she has a very tough opener against the returning Belinda Bencic. Maria Sharapova The Russian is sure to split opinion wherever she goes, though one thing that is not in doubt is her ferocious competitiveness. The 30-year-old has been climbing the rankings since her return from a doping ban and she will be a threat simply because of her willingness to scrap. Sharapova reached the fourth round at the US Open but, while her slam pedigree is matched by few of her peers, she has a tough draw and will likely have to get past the 2016 victor, Angelique Kerber, just to reach the last 16 here. Caroline Garcia Ostapenko and Stephens’s triumphs in Paris and New York should infuse every young hopeful with belief in Melbourne. Caroline Garcia should certainly fancy her chances after an encouraging end to 2017 which saw the Frenchwoman reach the semis in the season-ending tour finals. The 24-year-old is, however, in a tough quarter of the draw leaving her likely to face the losing US Open finalist, Madison Keys, in the fourth round and one of Muguruza, Sharapova, Kerber or Agniezska Radwanska in the last eight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/14/north-carolina-gerrymandering-ruling-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T12:00:26Z","webTitle":"North Carolina's 'partisan gerrymander' could prompt supreme court action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/14/north-carolina-gerrymandering-ruling-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/14/north-carolina-gerrymandering-ruling-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"North Carolina's 'partisan gerrymander' could prompt supreme court action","bodyText":"The last time North Carolina Republicans redrew the state’s 13 congressional districts, they made absolutely no secret of their ambition to rig the system and lock in a 10-3 balance in their favour – regardless of whether they or the Democrats won a majority of the votes in future elections. “I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,” bragged the chair of the redistricting committee in the state general assembly, David Lewis. “So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.” Drastic improvements in mapping technologies and voter information databases meant specialist mapmakers had unprecedented power to manipulate political outcomes, even in a swing state like North Carolina where one would ordinarily expect to see US House and state legislative seats split more or less evenly between the two parties. The instruction from Lewis and his colleagues, according to court documents, was “to create as many districts as possible in which GOP candidates would be able to successfully compete for office”. That was in 2016, when the prevailing wisdom across the US was that partisan gerrymandering was one of the legitimate spoils of American politics. Up to that point, the courts had punished gerrymandering along racial lines – one North Carolina map from the 1990s that packed black voters into the fewest possible districts was memorably likened to “political apartheid” – but raised little or no objection to state maps that favored one party over another. That may be about to change dramatically, in the wake of a bombshell ruling from a federal court in North Carolina last week that found the 2016 redistricting plan to be a violation of both the constitution’s equal protection clause and an infringement on the free speech of voters who cannot meaningfully cast a ballot if the outcome is all but predetermined. The court ordered the legislature to come up with new, fairer maps within two weeks and said if they did not, a court-appointed expert would redraw the maps for them. The ruling, most of it supported unanimously by two liberal justices and one conservative, was widely seen as breaking new legal ground and could – if it is not stayed or overturned – make it significantly easier for the Democrats to retake control of the House of Representatives in this November’s midterm elections. The ruling also picked up on a growing disquiet among justices on the US supreme court, who have questioned whether the political system is sustainable without the core principle that “voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around”. The supreme court is already considering two partisan gerrymandering cases – one from Wisconsin (run by Republicans) and one from Maryland (run by Democrats). It now seems likely that the North Carolina case will be included in the court’s deliberations and that a new overarching standard for drawing district boundaries will emerge before the court’s term ends in June. “This is the first time ever that a congressional districting plan has been struck down as partisan gerrymander,” one of the plaintiff’s attorneys, Ruth Greenwood of the Campaign Legal Center, told the Guardian. “If we are able to keep that precedent, it could be applied to half a dozen other states.” ‘Sociological gobbledegook’? Not everyone gerrymanders. In the complex patchwork of America’s political landscape, there are states that delegate redistricting to independent commissions and states where one party is so dominant there is no incentive to gerrymander. Some of the worst offenders, however, are also some of the most important states in presidential elections – among them Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida and Pennsylvania – which often hold the key to control of the House of Representatives too. Several times over the past 20 years, the Democrats have won more votes for House seats than the Republicans but ended up in the minority. The same has been true of state legislatures – most recently in Virginia, where the Democrats beat the GOP by 9% in races for the state House of Delegates in 2016 but won only 49 of 100 seats. While other factors have played a role – most notably, the clustering of Democrats in urban districts, leading to a more inefficient distribution of their votes – gerrymandering has effectively received a turbo boost because of digital mapping technologies and significantly altered both the political and the legal landscape. Justice Anthony Kennedy, expected to be the swing vote on the supreme court, has been open since at least 2004 to the idea that partisan gerrymandering could one day become so sophisticated as to be constitutionally intolerable. And while some of his colleagues appear hostile to statistical analyses measuring the precise extent of partisan interference in district mapping – chief justice John Roberts called such analyses “sociological gobbledegook” when the Wisconsin case came up for oral argument in October – the North Carolina case presents a welter of new evidence and legal arguments to consider. “North Carolina may present a set of facts that give the supreme court the hook they are looking for,” another of the plaintiff’s lawyers, Kathay Feng of Common Cause, told the Guardian. It is also helpful that Maryland is in the mix, because it means there are plaintiffs from both major parties and the supreme court is at least partly insulated from the charge that they are responding to complaints from partisan sore losers. “Justice Kennedy cares a lot about the court’s role in upholding a standard of laws that is not seen as tipping the scales in favor of one party or another,” Feng said. Many questions remain about timing. The North Carolina state legislature was widely expected to appeal last week’s ruling but did not do so immediately. It is also unclear, even if the supreme court issues new standards, if these would impact the 2018 midterms or would be held over for enforcement until 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/my-friend-david-davis-once-championed-liberty-now-became-its-enemy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:01:12Z","webTitle":"My friend David Davis once defended liberty.

Now he has become its enemy","bodyText":"Politicians and journalists rarely make good friends, but David Davis and I got on pretty well in the period we campaigned on civil liberties together during the last Labour government. We lunched, he came to my home for dinner, I introduced him to friends in New York and we often shared the same platform, notably in the Guardian debate at the Hay festival, when he and I took on Charles Clarke and the legal expert Conor Gearty on the motion: “Does the left still care about liberty?” I came to like him a lot and to admire his bounce and pugnacity. Among all the politicians I knew – with the possible exception of Dominic Grieve – David possessed the deepest instinct for liberty. He seemed to me to be the archetypal English democrat who possessed a great reverence for the rule of law as well as an equal suspicion of the accumulating powers of the state. He spoke brilliantly at events I was involved in staging, often preparing a long and complicated address with a few notes, just moments before he went on stage. He was bright, energetic and, for that period, liberty’s hero. Today, with David now at the heart of government as the secretary of state for exiting the EU, this all seems a very long time ago. We are now on opposite sides and I recognise almost nothing in the politics of the man who stood at the Convention on Modern Liberty in 2009 and asked: “What is the point of Britain if it does not adhere to the freedoms that made it? What is the point of parliament if it does not uphold its most sacred trust as a guardian of our liberty? What is the point of government if its principles aim to maximise fear and minimise our freedoms?” During those “liberty years”, he always insisted that parliament was the bulwark against authoritarian government and the ultimate protection of the British people. Yet, within just a few months of accepting the job of Brexit secretary from Theresa May, he insisted that the executive must deprive MPs of the right to debate the triggering of article 50, a move that in the words of Lord Pannick, who led Gina Miller’s challenge against the government on this issue, undermined parliament and “deprived people of their statutory rights”. This jettisoning of his principles didn’t surprise me a great deal. Just after becoming Brexit secretary, he removed his name from the legal challenge to the data retention and investigatory powers bill, which forces internet companies to keep records of people’s searches and allows authorities to hack devices secretly. These are powers that he would not have contemplated in his former life, but he acceded to them without demur. As we know, the issue of Brexit is so viscerally potent that it can damage personalities and relationships forever. It is obvious that for David nothing matters as much as leaving the EU. In the first six months of his tenure, he dumped, apparently without qualm, two key parts of his political character – his respect for parliamentary sovereignty and his love of individual liberty. I won’t rehash the arguments about state power here, but if you hold a belief that indiscriminate retention of data by the state is unjustifiable, that view cannot be easily changed without casting doubt on the authenticity of your original conviction. Perhaps he never really believed it in the first place. Maybe this strikingly extrovert political character simply used the stage of liberty to occupy his energies during the voluntary wilderness of the Cameron years. We have all been changed by the referendum and, on the whole, I opt for an interpretation that sees Brexit as a psychologically transformative event that has skewed the values and beliefs of hundreds of thousands of people. David may be just one of many. But this is a sympathetic reading and it is not supported by his attitude to parliament over the last 18 months, especially his promotion of Henry VIII powers – rule by ministerial decree without debate in the the House of Commons – which he condemned so frequently in my hearing. For a man who so often championed parliament’s power to hold ministers to account, he has, since becoming a minister, been by turns truculent, casual and almost contemptuous when questioned by MPs about the negotiations with the EU. The key moment was on 6 December when he finally admitted to Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, that the 50-60 impact assessments he promised had been carried out did not exist. This is what he said in June: “In my job, I don’t think out loud and I don’t make guesses. I try and make decisions. You make those based on the data. That data is being gathered. We’ve got 50, nearly 60, sectoral analyses already done.” In fact, no data had been gathered on Britain’s economic future outside the EU, apart from documents hurriedly cobbled together and then shrouded in risible secrecy to cover up the lie. In his former life, David would have seized on this ministerial dereliction and wept tears of anger at the incompetence and hypocrisy of it all, particularly as more thorough impact statements, carried out by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, convincingly paint a picture of lost jobs, growth and investment, post Brexit. A few days later, he told Nick Ferrari of LBC he didn’t have to be very clever or knowledgeable to do his job – just calm. He is wrong. In the second round of negotiations, he has to be very clever and he must master an untold number of briefs on different aspects of trade. On the evidence of the leaked letter that he sent to the prime minister in which he complained the EU was already penalising British interests in the case of a no-deal Brexit, it might seem that he’s not really up for the challenges of the next few months. It was all right for him and the prime minister to talk tough, but the moment the EU reciprocated he reacted with a whiney tone that did not seem like David and does not bode well for the negotiations or the inevitable problems that will come with the unravelling of the “agreement” on the Irish border. Watching my former debating partner over the last year and half, I find I have lost no affection for him. I see his energy, the fighting spirit and his good-humoured resilience, yet I am struck by a couple of things. While I would be happy to be in the jungle or stuck in a lift with him, I would draw the line at being stranded in a planning room with him. The second thought is about Brexit’s destructive power on relationships and principles. Whatever happens in the next round of negotiations or, indeed, with the final deal, this damage to our faith in each other is going to take a very long time to repair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-tory-environment-and-obesity-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the government’s environment and obesity plans | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-tory-environment-and-obesity-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-tory-environment-and-obesity-plans","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the government’s environment and obesity plans","bodyText":"Last week, Marks &amp; Spencer withdrew the “cauliflower steak” from its shelves. Essentially a thick slice of cauliflower that came with a sachet of lemon and herb drizzle, the product was widely criticised for its excessive plastic packaging and sizable markup, retailing at a “special offer” price of £2. That a retailer thought it saw an opportunity in marketing a slice of raw vegetable in this way reveals much, not just about our penchant for faddish food trends, but our attitudes towards waste. As a society, we produce far too much of the stuff: every year in the UK, 1bn plastic food trays are sent to landfill. We collectively throw away £13bn of food each year. Recycling rates in England lag far behind those of countries such as Germany. The consequences for the planet – global warming, blighted landscapes, oceans choked with plastic – are devastating. On the latter, it is estimated that by 2050 the weight of plastic in the oceans will exceed the weight of fish. The BBC’s Blue Planet II, the most-watched British television programme of 2017, vividly highlighted the calamitous consequences for marine life. Perhaps with the public concern provoked by Blue Planet II in mind – and no doubt keenly aware of recent polling highlighting the salience of green issues to younger voters – the prime minister made reducing waste the cornerstone of the government’s new 25-year environment plan, which she personally launched last week. It is framed by lofty ambition: it opens with the government’s aspiration to leave the planet in a better place than it found it and sets out an aim for the UK to produce zero avoidable waste by 2050. These are worthy goals that few could take issue with. And, regardless of Theresa May’s motivations, the prime ministerial sponsorship of an issue that has long lacked government drive and energy should be welcomed. But the plan’s lack of teeth means its stated ambitions will likely be blighted. Vague aspirations and good intentions are not what drive change. Indeed, the coalition agreement of 2010 contained a commitment to work towards a zero-waste economy. Not only did it fail to accelerate progress, but recycling rates in England stalled. Even as ministers were talking the talk on waste, the government dropped recycling targets for local authorities and stepped back from recycling quality standards. Instead, its 2011 waste review focused on voluntarism: encouraging retailers and producers to be more responsible on waste. This is in stark contrast to what happened in Wales, where the Welsh assembly increased recycling targets to 70% of municipal waste by 2025 and introduced tougher quality standards. Wales now has the second-highest recycling rate in the world after Germany, a testament to what government can achieve with the right focus. The government has learned none of these lessons; its plan contains no concrete measures to boost England’s laggard recycling rates, such as the bottle-deposit schemes that have proved so successful internationally. While recycling is important, prevention is far better than cure. Here, by far the most successful initiative of recent years has been the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags. It resulted in the number of single-use plastic carrier bags in circulation plummeting by more than 85% in just six months. This should have paved the way for the introduction of similar levies – or even bans – on non-recyclable plastic such as takeaway containers, plastic cutlery and drinks straws. But apart from extending the carrier bag charge to smaller retailers, a loophole that should have never existed, the plan is silent on this. Instead, the government has opted for more voluntarism: encouraging supermarkets to develop plastic-free aisles. But retailers and producers have too little incentive to shift their approach and consumer preferences are shaped by what’s available. Plastic is ubiquitous and it remains difficult and expensive for consumers to choose a plastic-free or even plastic-light shopping basket. There are echoes of the same toothless voluntarism the government has adopted in its obesity strategy. Consumer palates have been conditioned over time by food producers to want cheap – and addictive – fat, sugar and salt. This undermines the argument that healthy eating should be a matter of consumer choice. Because there is a strong first-mover taste disadvantage to reducing levels of fat, sugar and salt, the only answer lies in the compulsory product reformulation that has proved so effective in improving population nutrition around the world. Yet the government insists on leaving it up to food producers, a recipe for inaction. Theresa May has tried to make taking on vested interests one of the defining themes of her premiership. But when it comes down to it – from obesity, to waste, to the internet – her government has balked at taking real action, thwarted by a misplaced ideological queasiness about regulation and a reluctance to ruffle feathers in the private sector. Unless she shifts track, her inevitable legacy will be a capitalism that becomes increasingly irresponsible and unsustainable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/13/football-league-roundup-derby-ease-past-birmingham-as-wolves-are-held","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T18:07:38Z","webTitle":"Football League: Doncaster's Ferguson rages at 'disgusting' refereeing standards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/13/football-league-roundup-derby-ease-past-birmingham-as-wolves-are-held","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/13/football-league-roundup-derby-ease-past-birmingham-as-wolves-are-held","fields":{"headline":"Football League: Doncaster's Ferguson rages at 'disgusting' refereeing standards","bodyText":"Championship • A sixth win in eight matches for Gary Rowett’s Derby County ensured they remain second in the table. As integral to their hopes of promotion as Rowett is striker Matej Vydra, who bagged his 15th goal this term – three times as many as he mustered last season – in a 3-0 win over lowly Birmingham. As for Wolves, they were forced to settle for a draw at Oakwell. Diego Jota struck the bar for the visitors while Barnsley introduced £750,000 recruit Kieffer Moore off the bench, but they played out a stalemate. • Things went from bad to worse for Thomas Christiansen and Leeds United. With Samu Sáiz serving the first game of a six-match ban for spitting at Newport’s Robbie Willmott, midfielder Eunan O’Kane was sent off at Ipswich, where they slumped to a third defeat in four matches, Manchester City loanee Bersant Celina scoring the only goal. Their local rivals Norwich won 1-0 at high-flying Bristol City. With Alex Pritchard having moved on to pastures new with Huddersfield Town, James Maddison seized centre stage with the only goal of the game at Ashton Gate. • It was Middlesbrough supporters who were left to suffer arguably the most. Five minutes into stoppage-time at the Riverside, Grant Leadbitter felled Fulham’s Oliver Norwood inside the box, and the Brighton loanee dusted himself down to score the winner and hoist Slavisa Jokanovic’s side up to eighth. Aston Villa are up to fourth after a 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest, spoiling Aitor Karanka’s first game in charge at the City Ground.

To not see that is a disgrace.” Ferguson also argued that Plymouth’s equaliser should have been ruled out for a foul. “We’re just getting poor officials. The goal is a clear foul, and the linesman is laughing about it,” he added. “They’re part-time, the standard’s appalling, the fitness levels at this level are a disgrace. What would I like the FA to do? Shoot them.” • Blackburn Rovers closed the gap to second-place Shrewsbury Town to just two points after a 3-1 win at Ewood Park. Charlie Mulgrew, the Rovers defender and captain scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season, the first a majestic free-kick, either side of Danny Graham’s strike to earn Tony Mowbray’s side a first win in four games. A duel between table-topping Wigan Athletic and Peterborough had the makings of a classic but, instead, they played out a goalless draw. • Portsmouth thought they were going to make up some ground themselves when Jamal Lowe opened the scoring at home to Scunthorpe – but Kevin van Veen bagged his fourth goal in six matches to take a point. Elsewhere in the play-off picture, Bradford City slipped up at home to Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s Northampton, while Charlton won 1-0 at rock-bottom Bury to go sixth. New Fleetwood Town signing Toumani Diagouraga kickstarted a 2-1 win at Southend, while Walsall edged out Oxford United 2-1 with Erhun Oztumer again on the scoresheet. Results: Blackburn 3-1 Shrewsbury, Blackpool 0-0 Bristol Rovers, Bradford 1-2 Northampton, Bury 0-1 Charlton, Doncaster 1-1 Plymouth, Gillingham 2-1 Rochdale, MK Dons 0-0 AFC Wimbledon, Oldham 1-1 Rotherham, Portsmouth 1-1 Scunthorpe, Southend 1-2 Fleetwood, Walsall 2-1 Oxford, Wigan 0-0 Peterborough League Two • Is anybody doing a better job than Mike Flynn at Newport County? After staying afloat by two points last season, that margin now separates his team from the play-off places. Fresh from knocking Leeds out of the FA Cup, a 2-1 win over Grimsby Town means the good times keep on rolling for Newport. The fourth tier saw the biggest upset of the weekend, with struggling Chesterfield humbling leaders Luton Town, who have lost consecutive league matches on the road. • Accrington Stanley made it three wins in a row to go third after victory at Cheltenham. In the play-off pack, there were wins for Wycombe and Exeter City, with the latter getting the better of Coventry City thanks to Ryan Harley’s seventh-minute heaven, a result that sees Mark Robins’s side tumble out of the top seven on goal difference. Elsewhere, high-fliers Lincoln and Notts County played out a 2-2 draw, while Swindon Town took home bragging rights from their clash with rivals Forest Green Rovers, thanks to Luke Norris’s winner.

Since 1863, and as founder members of the Football League, Stoke have won one major trophy, the League Cup in 1972. They’ve also managed the Football League Trophy in 1992 and 2000. “Stoke were second-tier champions in 1933 and 1963. They were third-tier champions in 1927 and 1993 and have one other promotion from that level. They were FA Cup runners-up in 2011 and got to the semi-finals in 1899, 1971 and 1972. “Port Vale have been around since the late 1870s (1876 or 1879 depending on who you ask) but in that time they have won the grand total of two Football League Trophies, in 1993 and 2001.” The greatest of escapes “What was, statistically, the greatest great escape of them all?” asks Nick Jones. “Either in terms of the highest ‘points adrift’ to ‘points remaining’ ratio (perhaps not final-day escapes) or simply the largest ‘points adrift’ which was overcome. Without governing body interference, of course.” Branislav Mihic reminds us of some surprising Danish survival. “Randers FC escaped relegation in the 2009-10 Danish Superliga, despite having only eight points after 18 games in the autumn half of the season,” he explains. “With the bottom two sides being relegated, they were 13 points off safety. However, in the spring half of the season (15 games), they were the best side in the league, collecting 32 points, and staying up at the expense of AGF, who were 19 points ahead at the winter break.” Manager-player “Gary Elphick started the season as Worthing manager, yet on Boxing Day he found himself taking them on as a Burgess Hill Town player,” tweets Matt Prior. “I wondered if this is a first in any way.” Darrien Bold knows a thing or two about the topic. “Bury manager Andy Preece’s four-year spell in charge ended on 16 December 2003,” he points out. “He joined Carlisle United as a player three days later. On Boxing Day he returned to Gigg Lane and inspired Carlisle to a 3-1 win, setting up the second and third goals before going off to a standing ovation from both sets of supporters.” Craig Kennedy remembers one of these very instances. “In 1988 the Dundee centre-half Jim Duffy had his career cruelly cut short at the age of 27, after suffering a knee injury in a match against Rangers. Duffy received a testimonial as a farewell to his playing career,” he remembers. “In September 1988 Duffy entered the Guiness Book of Records as Britain’s youngest manager, taking over at the (then) Division One team Falkirk. Fans were keen for Duffy to pull on the jersey and play for them, but he was insistent: his playing days were over, his knee was knackered. “Duffy led Falkirk to the runner-up position in Division One, before leaving in October 1989. Duffy claimed that his departure was because of his disillusionment with footballers, after several of his Falkirk players were involved in a fracas outside a nightclub in Saltcoats. On leaving, Duffy was quoted as saying: “I love football and want to get back into it.” “Falkirk fans were surprised to see Duffy appear in 1990 in a Dundee jersey, making eight appearances for his old club before transferring to Partick Thistle, where he appeared 72 times before moving back to Dundee in 1992 to play a further 108 times, quite often against Falkirk.” Clubs’ strange sideline businesses (an update) Justin Hughes has some fine knowledge to share. “A follow up answer to clubs that have a sideline business to stay afloat is Excelsior Rotterdam, presently in the Eredivisie,” he says. “In the 1960s and 1970s the club had an old paper-collection van which would drive around Rotterdam picking up used newspapers and other used paper to sell for recycling. As a result, Excelsior became known as ‘oud papier club’.” Knowledge archive “In 1999 while living in England I watched a TV programme about a fictional team which wins the FA Cup in the 1970s. Throughout the show they used footage of Sunderland’s FA Cup run in 1973. Does anyone remember the name of this show?” asked Peter Greaves. “Bostock’s Cup!” screams Kevin Watts. “It was shown on ITV the night before the 1999 Champions League final and was absolutely hilarious, with parodies of Alan Shearer, Bob Paisley, Phil Neal, John Toshack, Malcolm Allison and many others. Shamefully overlooked and miles superior to the Mike Bassett film that turned up a couple of years later. There’s a few clips on YouTube, but it never got released on DVD. Personal favourite clip is the cup tie on the sloping pitch. Superb.” It was indeed shown the night before the 1999 final, in a prime-time 9pm slot on ITV.

She was raised on a small Mississippi farm by her grandmother, whose highest hope for her granddaughter was that when she became someone’s domestic worker, she would be treated kindly by her employers. “I just hope you get some good white folks when you grow up, treat you right, treat you nice,” Winfrey said her grandmother told her. This week, there has been fevered speculation that Winfrey might run for president of the US. And that she might win – one poll found 48% of US voters would choose Winfrey, with 38% voting for Trump. “Oprah Winfrey can achieve anything she wants to achieve,” says her friend Richard Sher, the man she shared a sofa with on her first talkshow in 1976. He says he spoke to her after the Golden Globes, where she received the Cecil B DeMille achievement award and delivered a speech that had #Oprah2020 trending on Twitter. Did she give any indication she was thinking of running for president? “She gave me the indication that she’s not thinking about [running]. I don’t think this is going to be something she wants to do.” The suggestion has been made to Winfrey over the years, and she has repeatedly said she’d never do it, though her stance has softened, particularly since the election of another politically inexperienced TV star. “I never considered the question even a possibility,” she said in an interview in December 2016. “I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience, I don’t know enough.’ And now I’m thinking, ‘Oh’.” If Winfrey did become president, it would be the incredible climax to a story that already seems impossible. “Oprah’s narrative – this triumphant narrative of coming from a hardscrabble, traumatic, abusive [background] – and becoming one of the wealthiest women, the wealthiest black women, and creating her own empire is the quintessential American story as we envision it,” says Leah Wright Rigueur, assistant professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and author of The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power. Winfrey was born in 1954 in Mississippi, to a teenage mother, but raised by her grandmother. At six she was sent to live with her mother, who worked long hours as a cleaner. When she was nine, Winfrey was raped by a cousin, and over the next few years she was sexually abused by other men. She went to live with her father in Nashville at 14, hiding the fact she was pregnant and gave birth to a son two months early. He died soon afterwards. Living with her father and stepmother provided stability and high expectations – her father expected good grades at school. When she was 17, Winfrey won a beauty pageant sponsored by a local radio station. Someone at the station, perhaps noticing her smooth, warm voice, asked her to read a news report on tape and she did it so well, she was offered a part-time job. She moved to Baltimore to work for WJZ-TV as a news reporter and co-anchor of the six o’clock news. It wasn’t a success. “People resented the fact that Jerry [Turner, veteran anchor] had been given a co-anchor, and it was a young, African-American woman,” remembers Sher. Winfrey was moved to a morning slot, but she and Sher were eventually paired for a talkshow, People Are Talking. “It became a sensation,” says Sher. Winfrey was, he says, “terrific. The word I would use to describe her is: compassionate. One of the reasons she gave up news and went into talk was whenever she did a story of children killed in a fire, or children murdered and abused, she would cry and cry. She would try to remain objective but she wore her heart on her sleeve, and people really loved that about her. She could relate, and still does, to the person who doesn’t have a penny to their name and a person who has billions.” Looking for her next move, she sent an audition tape to WLS-TV in Chicago. They gave her the AM Chicago morning talkshow, which became so successful it became The Oprah Winfrey show and was syndicated nationally. Around the same time she had been spotted by Quincy Jones, who recommended her to Steven Spielberg for a role in his adaptation of The Color Purple. By the time she ended her talkshow in 2011, leaving to set up her own cable channel, she had become a billionaire, and one of the most powerful women in the world. She has been credited with everything from liberalising US culture to reinvigorating America’s publishing industry with her book club, to influencing Barack Obama’s victory, following her endorsement. Her talkshow pioneered the public therapeutic confessional – guests and their empathetic host talked about everything from divorce to body image to childhood abuse to addiction – and later morphed into a vehicle for self-development and triumph over adversity. “In my career, what I’ve always tried my best to do, whether on television or through film,” said Winfrey in her speech, “is to say … how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage, how we fail, how we retreat, persevere, and how we overcome.” America’s relationship with Winfrey is complex, says Christina Greer, associate professor of political science at Fordham University, and author of Black Ethnics: Race, Immigration, and the Pursuit of the American Dream. “She is the first black billionaire, so in the black community she holds a special place because she has shown the promise of going from abject poverty to unimaginable success.” As a woman “she’s shown that it is possible to become a millionaire, and then a billionaire, without having a husband who does it for you.” Winfrey has been with her partner Stedman Graham since 1986, but they never married. “Then she moves into a self-help realm, which is a little more complicated, because America has a long history of single black women serving as the moral compass and emotional backbone for white women. That has been a critique of Oprah for many years, that [her brand of] self-help and empowerment is at risk of falling into old tropes that a lot of black women find dangerous and antiquated, this emotional pillar for white women.” This “therapeutic” way of understanding women’s experience in the 80s and 90s, says Janice Peck, professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, and author of The Age of Oprah: Cultural Icon for the Neoliberal Era, was “moving away from a political feminist approach, and putting it in terms of ‘you just need to work on yourself’”. Winfrey appealed “on a basis of this personal relationship and therapeutic orientation, and making sure she was never threatening to a white audience. The phrase used about her is that she ‘transcends race’ because in the US, to ‘transcend race’ means that you’re accepted and embraced by whites”. She has not been political, says Greer. “As much as we know Oprah, we don’t know her. She’s been with us for at least 35 years in our living rooms but do I really know how she feels about the welfare state? No. I know she owns multiple houses but I don’t know her stand on housing policy. I know she’s a lot more inclusive than our current president, and for many people that’s enough. I just think that one great speech should not catapult someone to a presumptive nominee when we already have a lot of qualified women.” Winfrey’s message, says Wright Rigueur, has always been that positive thinking and hard work “will get you rewards and if you don’t get those rewards, it’s because you haven’t worked hard enough or you weren’t deserving. Look at Oprah’s endorsement of The Secret [the pseudo-science “law of attraction” book] – if you believe it, it will come true. It doesn’t work for a poor working-class mom from Appalachia or the Bronx, they can wish all they want but if the systems around them don’t allow for mobility or opportunity or access, they’re not going to do anything”. In her Golden Globes speech, she talked about abuse suffered by generations of women and touched on what kept them down, particularly poor women and women of colour. “What was big about that moment was she said this is about structure,” says Wright Rigueur. “I think Oprah does understand the idea of inequalities that are built into the system.” You can see that, she says, through her work in providing girls with access to education in South Africa, and “through her sponsorship, particularly women of colour – her mentorship of [Selma director] Ava DuVernay comes to mind”. Winfrey has always symbolised possibility and we’ve become excitable at the prospect of President Oprah because it seems like the inevitable, desirable conclusion to her story. But though her delivery was presidential, her words said something else. “She is essentially saying we need to offer people on the ground platforms in order to fix inequality and broken systems,” says Wright Rigueur, rather than look to this one woman. “I think we have to be very wary of putting our projections of what we need and what we want at this moment onto Oprah.” Potted profile Born: January 1954, Kosciusko, Mississippi Career: Winfrey was a TV news reporter in Baltimore, before moving to Chicago where she started hosting the talkshow that would become The Oprah Winfrey Show. It ran from 1986-2011. Her film career includes parts in The Color Purple, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, and in Beloved, which she produced, The Butler, and Selma. Winfrey created her own cable channel OWN in 2011 and is a special correspondent for the current affairs show 60 Minutes. High point: becoming the US’s number one talkshow. Being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. Low point: Despite promising reviews, her adaption of Toni Morrison’s novel Beloved flopped at the box office. They say: “There is a quality Oprah has. She is centred, she knows who she is. She is honest, open and what’s underneath is so beautiful and she just lets it out. She deals on a universal level and can go anywhere she wants to go,” said Quincy Jones. She says: “Seeking the fullest expression of self. That’s the story of my life in six words.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/12/lobster-review-theatre-503","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T16:02:00Z","webTitle":"Lobster review – young love needs more time in a heartfelt two-hander","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/12/lobster-review-theatre-503","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/12/lobster-review-theatre-503","fields":{"headline":"Lobster review – young love needs more time in a heartfelt two-hander","bodyText":"Two women, known only as K and J, are introduced to each other at a party. But they already have history. As the pair stare at each other, frozen in time, is it the moment that will rekindle their broken relationship? Or is it the one that finally buries it? We never find out in Lucy Foster’s two-hander, which uses the party moment to spool through the young women’s relationship from their first date onwards. It offers two very different perspectives: the troubled K sees the two of them as a glass-like structure – fragile, glistening and imperfect – while J views them like a wall of bricks. It is good to see a gay female relationship presented on stage with such matter of fact understatement and without comment. Although the issue of gay marriage arises (a privilege, says J; a long overdue right, declares K) the focus here is not on LGBTQ issues but simply on the love story. The ordinariness of the situation and the characters is appealing, even if Foster never quite meets the challenge of making ordinariness seem compelling. The piece relies too much on the personality contrast of the two. J is a goofy, home-loving, church-going, settled soul; an optimist of Pollyannaish proportions. K is prickly and smart with a history of depression dating back to sixth-form. Their outlooks are in opposition, but can love glue them together? Director Kayla Feldman tries to bind them with a distracting background soundtrack of hit love songs that sometimes underscore the action. The problem is that, although there are some moments of sparky writing, and two winning performances from Louise Beresford as K and Alexandra Reynolds as J, the characters are not sufficiently interesting to hold the attention. And the play throws in a couple of curveballs to do with mental health issues, without really setting them up properly. This feels like a promising first draft, still very much in need of dramaturgical support to sharpen and provide focus. But despite the flaws it is a heartfelt and truthful play, that uses comedy of recognition – particularly around dating rituals – to canny effect. •At Theatre 503, London, until 20 January.

It's time things changed","bodyText":"Fifty years ago, Kathrine Switzer ran the Boston marathon, having entered using her initials in order to get around the ban on female competitors. Five years later, women were officially allowed to compete in the race. In 1984, the women’s marathon was added to the Olympic Games. In other words, we have been striding towards parity for the sexes in running for quite some time. But cross country seems to be stuck in a time-warp. On 27 January, hundreds of runners will descend on Stanmer Park in Brighton to race at the South of England Athletic Association’s Cross Country Championship. The senior men will run 15km, the senior women 8km – just over half the longer distance. It’s the equivalent of women running 14 miles instead of a marathon, or 53 metres instead of a 100-metre race. A month later, at the English National Championships the difference is not quite so big – 12km and 8km – but still means that the men are running 50% further. The senior women will run the same distance as the teenage boys. It is extraordinary that we are still having a “debate surrounding gender equality”, in the words of the English Cross Country Association. Here are some of the arguments given by “traditionalists” for maintaining the status quo – and their rebuttals. ‘There is not enough time in a one-day event that includes junior races to accommodate a longer women’s race’ So, they have time for the men, but not for the women? The timetable for the SEAA championships allows 45 minutes for the women’s race and 90 minutes for the men’s – are men twice as important? There are two solutions available here. Either equalise the distance (the IAAF World Championships and the Scottish National Championships are now 10K for men and women) or open up long and short distances to men and women. ‘Women are not as fast; their race should be shorter so it takes the same amount of time’ True, on average, but women are only about 10% slower, so this can’t be used to justify such big discrepancies. This argument is weakened by the fact that all other races in championships major and minor are the same for both genders, regardless of finishing times. ‘This is how it has been traditionally and we see no reason to change it’ Like paying women less for doing the same job or excluding them from golf clubs? ‘Many women prefer the shorter distance and would be put off if it were longer’ Women and girls are conditioned from an early age to underestimate their abilities, to be princesses rather than superheroes. Differences in race distances – which start in the junior age groups – are part of this insidious, ingrained sexism. Athletics should empower girls and women, not keep them in their place. Just as importantly, it shouldn’t give boys the idea that their event is more challenging or more important. On the flip side, there are plenty of male club runners who would prefer a shorter race – discrimination cuts both ways. Encouragingly, at the Scottish nationals, where distances were equalised last year, there has been no drop in entries. Besides, even if there were a temporary fall, it would be worth it in the long run. Finally: these events are all optional. No one is forced to enter or run a distance they aren’t comfortable with, whatever their reasons. In previous years, I have been simply pissed off and whinged to my friends and club-mates, but entered races anyway. This time, with some members of my club – female and male – I have decided to do my bit to change the system. Between us, we have written to the various governing bodies. None appear particularly inclined to show leadership on this issue, in spite of the examples set by the IAAF and Scottish Athletics. They say they will discuss it at meetings and consult with their member clubs. I hope they will debate how to achieve gender equality, not whether it is desirable in the first place. In the meantime, we have started a petition, as a way of letting the authorities know that this is not a matter of a few “crazy feminists” who are always moaning about something. We are delighted with the support we have received from runners of all levels and genders, as well as from news organisations and running magazines and blogs. But there are some people within the running community – men and women – who would rather keep things as they are. Along with a number of other runners, I have decided that I’m no longer comfortable taking part in events where women are not treated equally – so I won’t be running at the southerns or the nationals. Luckily, my club, East London Runners, competes in two leagues where women and men run together over the same distance, so I don’t have to give up my mud fix. Who knows, maybe by next winter we will be competing on a level, if hilly, playing field. #runequal"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/17/north-korea-cheerleaders-winter-olympics-pyeonchang","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T11:23:42Z","webTitle":"North Korea's 'army of beauties' will be under close scrutiny at Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/17/north-korea-cheerleaders-winter-olympics-pyeonchang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/17/north-korea-cheerleaders-winter-olympics-pyeonchang","fields":{"headline":"North Korea's 'army of beauties' will be under close scrutiny at Winter Olympics","bodyText":"Though none of the North Korean athletes competing at next month’s Winter Olympics in South Korea are expected to win a medal, they will at least be assured of a thunderous reception. When North Korea recently agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, which open in Pyeongchang on 9 February, there was speculation over which athletes might take advantage of the 11th-hour wildcard entries offered by the International Olympic Committee. But far more excitement greeted Wednesday’s news that the athletes will be accompanied by 230 members of the “army of beauties”, North Korea’s all-female cheerleading troupe who – international politics permitting – will be dispatched to portray a gentler image of one of the world’s most brutal dictatorships. The women, all in their late teens or early 20s, are handpicked from elite universities and undergo strict background checks to ensure they are not related to defectors or Japanese sympathisers, according to Chinese media. “They must be over 163cm (5ft 4ins) tall and come from good families,” said An Chan-il, a defector who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies. “Those who play an instrument are from a band and others are mostly students at the prestigious Kim Il-sung University,” he told AFP. As the daughters of well-connected families in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, they are highly unlikely to defect, according to Jiro Ishimaru, a Japanese documentary-maker who runs a network of secret citizen journalists in the North. Cheerleading aside, their role is to challenge the common perception of North Korea as an economically backward state whose people are malnourished. “As well as being young, tall and beautiful, they train extremely hard so that they don’t put a foot wrong,” Ishimaru said. “They’re out to impress people, particularly South Koreans.” Chosen for their loyalty to the Kim dynasty as much as their appearance, their routines are as tightly choreographed as any military parade in Pyongyang. Whether dressed in traditional hanbok or polo shirts and baseball caps, their chanting, singing and dancing often overshadow their compatriots’ exertions in the sporting arena. In their first of three visits to South Korea, to attend the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, a party of 300 cheerleaders stepped off a ferry waving unification flags – a pale blue silhouette of the Korean peninsula – to the delight of many locals. A planned visit to the Asian Games in 2014 in Incheon was cancelled after Pyongyang and Seoul argued over details, including the size of the cheerleading party and their flag, and which country would foot their expenses. Its most famous alumni is Ri Sol-ju, better known these days as the wife of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who was 16 when she was part of the group that attended the 2005 Asian Athletic Championships, also in Incheon. It remains to be seen if the goodwill that greeted the troupe’s previous trips to South Korea has survived a dramatic deterioration in cross-border ties after a year of missile launches, a nuclear test and threats to the US and the South. Whatever reception they receive, Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Tours and a frequent visitor to North Korea, expects the cheerleaders to eclipse the country’s athletes. “The world’s media will focus on them, as they have done before, simply because North Korea is a source of mystery, fear, and exoticism – and because the women are pretty,” he said. “And because getting substantive interviews from North Korean athletes is notoriously difficult.” With less than a month before the Games open, officials from both countries face a race against time to decide how the North Korean delegation will travel across the border, where they will stay and who will pay their expenses. Some reports said they would be accommodated on a cruise ship moored in Sokcho, about an hour’s drive from Pyeongchang. While the Games’ organisers anticipate a late surge in ticket sales, sports fans from other countries expecting to swap stories and mementoes with the North Korean cheerleaders will be disappointed. None of the women will want to risk the fate that awaited 21 of their predecessors who were reportedly sent to a labour camp for talking about what they had seen during their 2005 visit to South Korea. Ishimaru said the group would be practically impregnable for as long as they were in “enemy territory”. “They won’t be given the freedom to do things we take for granted, like go out for a stroll,” he said. “They will leave their accommodation together and return together at the end of each day.

It came out of left field, plonked itself at the start of episode three with no foreshadowing and was as grim as you would expect. Elsewhere, Laure’s crew make progress on the Mercier case in their own error-strewn way, although Mercier himself remains largely a mystery. Joséphine We open early morning on a groggy Joséphine slumped by the Port de l’Arsenal. Initially, she wants Laure to investigate the assault off the books, but eventually she agrees to press charges. She believes Edelman is her attacker. However, in a show where rushes to judgment are common and errors are frequent, she will want to keep her powder dry before doing anything drastic. Joséphine after all, is the type to take matters into her own hands. No one is more cynical about the justice system than she. It’s part of what makes her such a good trial lawyer, something we see when the Weber case twists once again. After Rudy throws Thomas under the bus in court, Joséphine has her client take the stand to recount his father’s ritual humiliation of him. It’s powerful, but will it be enough? The poor little rich kid narrative is a tough sell. The Mercier case It’s a truly chaotic showing from CID this week; they seem more determined than ever to Clouseau their way to victory. Tintin and Gilou scuffle in the surveillance van outside the boxing match, allowing Bakary Camara to slip out without being tailed. It’s all Laure can do to bash their heads together, reset and begin again. Honestly, who would be a mother? When Brémont reveals that the Camaras were under investigation for a gold bullion robbery, pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place. A visit to the brothers’ defunct Helping Hands Homework Club uncovers their counterfeit cigarettes side-hustle. It’s not the ammo they need to take them down, but following that trail leads them to Brémont’s informer Depuis and the 3kg of gold he stole from the Camaras. At last! Progress. But CID haven’t met a break they can’t squander yet and they surpass themselves with this one. Laure and Gilou send Depuis over to Casa Camara with the stolen gold and an excuse they trust him to make up himself. When his battered corpse shows up that very night, it’s the least surprising development since Tintin’s wife left him. “The Camaras will kill me,” was one of the last things Depuis said to Gilou – but who could have predicted that sending a gold-thieving informant back to his murderous bosses would have ended badly? It’s a busy week all round for Gilou who, in addition to battering his co-worker and getting an informant killed, manages to score a makeout with Laure. The tenderness and love between these two is real and I can think of worse final acts than them ending up together. The revelation that Cindy has been scrounging cash for her long-dead mother can only expedite that outcome. Roban Roban takes an ugly tumble down the courthouse steps, but he still has more than enough about him to get Machard’s prints off his teacup. Thus he proves that Machard is the mystery emergency services caller and Nicolas Bodin’s final client. The autopsy shows that a fatal combination of Viagra and poppers did for Bodin and Roban forgoes mentioning Machard’s involvement in his report. Considering what a reptile Machard has been over the years, it’s a very compassionate move. He may flood the room every time he pours a Perrier, but Monsieur le Juge remains a class act. Thoughts and observations It’s nice to see Marianne again helping Roban identify Machard’s voice on the tape. I miss the silent trust between them, though, now apparently gone for ever. Herville’s sit down with Fabienne Mangin, the mayor of Cléry-sous-Bois, reveals a fascinating tension between his style of policing and her style of governing. Madame Mayor seems way too closely involved with the Camaras. She regards them as role models, although what they regard her as is anyone’s guess. We now know that the Camaras confronted Mercier about his surveillance and roughhoused him out of the flat in which he was stationed. So, they are lying about not knowing him – but what did he have on them for which it was worth killing him? It’s not bring-your-son-to-work day, but that doesn’t stop Tintin doing some cackhanded bonding with Ruben while doing surveillance. I’m not sure if it’s ethical policing, but it’s definitely suboptimal parenting. Do better, Frédéric. “I didn’t have any toys when I was a boy. Books. Just books.” Oh, Roban.

The four judges, the most senior members of the bench after the chief justice, abruptly left their courtrooms on Friday morning and called the first press conference by members of the usually solemn institution. Led by judge Jasti Chelameswar, they delivered an unprecedented message to the journalists gathered in Delhi: that the conduct of India’s highest court was “not in order” and that “unless this institution is preserved, democracy can’t be protected in this country”. The revolt against the chief justice, Dipak Misra, has been months in the making. It broke into the open in November, when he was accused of mishandling a matter relating to a former judge alleged to have offered to bribe members of the supreme court in a case Misra himself was presiding over. Misra has not been accused of taking bribes but was fiercely criticised, including by senior lawyers, for repeatedly intervening to ensure only judges of his choice could hear the matter. One case cited by the four justices on Friday was a request for an independent investigation into the death of judge BH Loya, who was overseeing a case involving murder allegations against Amit Shah, a leading figure in the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Media reports in recent months have raised suspicions over Loya’s death. Though politically charged cases have traditionally been overseen by the supreme court’s most senior judges, the request for an independent investigation into Loya’s death was assigned by Misra to a relatively junior member of the bench. In a letter to Misra, which was released to the media on Friday, the four judges said: “There have been instances where cases having far-reaching consequences for the nation and the institution had been assigned by the chief justice of this court selectively to the benches ‘of their preference’ without any rationale for this assignment. This must be guarded against at all costs.” Asked by journalists if the chief justice should be impeached, Chelameswar said: “Let the nation decide that.” The judges were at pains not to accuse Misra of any specific wrongdoing nor criticise any specific judgments. Rather, their charge is that by breaking from the traditional procedures for allocating cases – which heavily emphasise seniority – he is allowing what they called “questions on the integrity of the institution” to fester. Echoing criticism levelled at the court in past months, the Indian Express published an article on Friday morning by a senior lawyer, Dushyant Dave, highlighting instances where Misra had failed to allocate the most senior judges available for sensitive cases. “It is important for this institution to ensure that an impression is not given to the public that the constitution of benches and allocation of matters is being done in a manner more palatable to the executive,” Dave wrote. Chelameswar closed the dramatic press conference by saying: “We don’t want wise men saying 20 years from now that justice Chelameswar, [Ranjan] Gogoi, [Madan B] Lokur and Kurian Joseph sold their souls and didn’t do the right thing by our constitution.” Alok Kumar, a senior resident fellow at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, said chief justices had earned the rancour of their colleagues in the past but Friday’s events were “beyond the pale”. Misra, who was appointed chief justice by the Narendra Modi government in August, did not made any public remarks on Friday but is reportedly meeting with the Indian attorney general, who is also yet to comment. The Indian supreme court is larger than its UK or US counterparts, accommodating up to 31 members whose ranks frequently change as judges choose to leave or reach the mandatory retirement age of 65."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2018/jan/13/weekend-reading-stoke-sloths-and-speeches","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Stoke, sloths and speeches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2018/jan/13/weekend-reading-stoke-sloths-and-speeches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2018/jan/13/weekend-reading-stoke-sloths-and-speeches","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Stoke, sloths and speeches","bodyText":"Potteries people strike back It’s been dubbed Britain’s Brexit capital.

While few people believe that Trump’s decision to stay away has nothing to do with the prospect of having to face some of the UK’s biggest street protests, many have also debunked other claims in his tweet. The Obama administration sold the embassy Not quite. On the embassy’s UK website, a press release dated October 2008 – one month before Barack Obama was elected president and three months before his inauguration – details plans to move the embassy south of the river Thames, from Mayfair to Nine Elms, in Wandsworth. The decision to relocate the building was made by the Bush administration. However, the final sale – to the Qatari royal family’s property company – was agreed and signed off by the US state department in 2009 when Obama was president. The embassy was sold for peanuts The Chancery building’s sale price was never disclosed, although in July 2000 it was estimated at £500m. The new embassy has been built in an ‘off location’ While the new location may lack the opulence of Mayfair, Trump might find much to his taste in Nine Elms. The 230-hectare district has been transformed from a once bleak landscape of depots and sorting offices to house some of London’s most expensive apartments and developments – about 30 of them. Among the residential developments is neighbouring Embassy gardens, where a three-bedroom flat will set you back £1.7m ($2.3m). Within the regeneration area, architects including Norman Foster, Frank Gehry and Richard Rogers are chipping in to the aesthetic; and the interiors of one block of flats were designed by Donatella Versace. Perhaps the greatest symbol of extravagance within the district is the “sky pool”, a glass bottom bathing area suspended between two buildings. Throw in a food market, a new tube stationand an enviable riverside view, and it could be concluded that the location is quite “on”. The new embassy cost $1.2bn Not quite. The building was widely reported as costing $1bn, which is £750m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/12/moodys-warns-of-negative-impact-on-universities-after-22bn-funding-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Moody’s warns of ‘negative impact’ on universities after $2.2bn funding cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/moodys-warns-of-negative-impact-on-universities-after-22bn-funding-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/moodys-warns-of-negative-impact-on-universities-after-22bn-funding-cut","fields":{"headline":"Moody’s warns of ‘negative impact’ on universities after $2.2bn funding cut","bodyText":"Ratings agency Moody’s says the federal government’s $2.2bn cut to higher education will force universities to review growth plans and could have a “negative impact” on the sector’s credit profile. In a report to investors, Moody’s said the government’s decision to effectively end the demand-driven university funding system by freezing the commonwealth grant scheme in its mid-year budget update would lead to increased “execution risk” for university budgets. “Whilst manageable within existing cash flow operating margins, less established universities and those currently experiencing higher growth rates will be most affected by the changes,” the report stated. That’s because small universities have “limited access to diversify revenue sources and have limited capacity to raise additional funds through donations” and less capacity to recruit international students. But the report also pointed to increased “revenue volatility” for established universities because of the likelihood of increased reliance on income from international students. “Managing international student load growth will fundamentally change the underlying credit profiles across Australia’s higher education sector,” it said. “Whilst a structural shift toward higher international student loads will boost operating margins, experience has shown that international student enrolments introduces more volatility.” The government announced in December that it would freeze the grant scheme at 2017 levels for the next two years before introducing a performance-based funding mechanism, part of an attempt to address attrition rates and improve graduate outcomes. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, has also argued that the funding increase to universities since the introduction of demand-driven funding means the sector has enjoyed “huge growth in university revenues and finances”. Universities Australia – which has lobbied against the government’s decision – seized on the report. Acting chief executive Catriona Jackson said the ratings agency was “simply stating the facts”. “Moody’s makes it crystal clear. The funding freeze imposed by the government is risking the financial health and sustainability of Australian universities and that hits students and the national economy,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/16/golf-three-tvs-big-macs-bed-my-week-living-as-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Golf, three TVs and Big Macs in bed: my week in the life of Donald Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/golf-three-tvs-big-macs-bed-my-week-living-as-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/golf-three-tvs-big-macs-bed-my-week-living-as-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Golf, three TVs and Big Macs in bed: my week in the life of Donald Trump","bodyText":"Donald Trump is usually in bed by 6.30pm, watching three television screens and eating cheeseburgers. He has a separate bedroom from his wife, Melania, and is obsessed with cleanliness. The president prefers to eat at McDonald’s and similar fast food restaurants because he has a fear of being poisoned. He spends his evenings phoning friends to chat, going to sleep late. We know this, and more, thanks to Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury. Some of the book’s most intriguing revelations are those relating to Trump’s personal life – how the president of the United States actually spends his time, and who he spends it with. Fire and Fury reveals a lonely, bizarre existence. But there must be some attraction to this way of life. I decided to find out. I would live as Trump. For a bit. Day one Mimicking the life of a 71-year-old man who spends a large portion of his time in bed eating junk food is a daunting task. I spend Sunday getting my apartment Trump-ready. According to Fire and Fury, when Trump moved into the White House he asked for two extra televisions to be installed in his bedroom, so he could have three channels playing at once. I cobble together three screens. There is a TV playing Fox News – Trump’s favourite. The president professes to hate CNN and MSNBC, but he professes it with a level of knowledge that suggests he watches both channels, so they are playing on a desktop computer and my laptop. At 6.30pm, I get into bed. Trump is usually in bed by that time, Wolff wrote, “with a cheeseburger, watching his three screens and making phone calls” to friends. I don’t usually talk to my friends on the phone. But after an hour in bed, with only a rightwing news channel for company, I am quite bored. I call my best friend, Ruth. She doesn’t answer. I call her again. She still doesn’t answer. I leave her a message saying I’m calling to “catch up”. Ruth texts me an hour later. It says: “What do you want you little bitch?” I don’t phone her again. I have more joy with my friend Jono. He answers on the second call. That’s good because I’ve been working on channelling Trump’s style of conversation. It’s no secret that Trump likes to brag about himself. And repeat himself. Fire and Fury says that this extends to private conversation. There is a minor problem. I haven’t really got that much to brag about. Trump might have inherited his fortune from his father, but he is undeniably a very wealthy man. And he was a TV show host. And he is president. I am none of those things. But then I’ve yet to bankrupt a single company, let alone four. And while the nation is yet to be polled on how they think I’m performing, I’m pretty sure my approval ratings wouldn’t be as bad as Trump’s. “You know I’ve never been declared bankrupt?” I ask Jono. He asks what I want. “I’d say my approval ratings are fairly positive, right?” Jono disagrees. We talk for a bit about a mutual friend who recently got married. I try to segue back to my financial stability. He threatens to hang up. I ask Jono if he thinks the American public has faith in me. He does hang up. Day two As a single person, it’s easy to replicate Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania. Apparently, they don’t have one. They sleep in separate bedrooms and Wolff reckons they can go days without seeing each other. Within the domestic sphere, Trump is said to be extremely particular. In his early days in the White House, he tried to fit a lock on his bedroom door, but the Secret Service wouldn’t allow it. No one is allowed to touch his belongings. Especially his toothbrush. If he throws a shirt on the floor, the White House cleaning staff are not allowed to pick it up. Trump also doesn’t like people removing his bed sheets. When the time comes for a bedding change, he strips the bed himself and throws the sheets on the floor. I follow his lead and take the sheets off my bed, dumping them on the floor. I only have one set of sheets. I put them back on the bed. The day starts with a nice little lift. Axios has reported that Trump doesn’t do very much work. It seems he spends 8am to 11am engaged in “executive time”, which means spending time in the residential part of the White House “watching TV, making phone calls and tweeting”. I send my boss a message on Gchat. I shall be in late today because I am engaged in executive time, I tell him. He wants to know what executive time is. I tell him I’m going to be watching TV and phoning my friends. It doesn’t go over well. At 11am, executive time is over. I go to work for a bit. I don’t do very much. Pretending to be president is easy. On the way home, I stop in at McDonald’s. It was already public knowledge that it is Trump’s favourite. Thanks to Fire and Fury, we know that is because he has a “longtime fear of being poisoned”. I used to work at McDonald’s. I have no problem with eating at McDonald’s. I do have a problem with what Trump eats at McDonald’s. According to his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s regular order is two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish and a chocolate milkshake. I order it all and, back home, I take it to bed. The first Big Mac goes down easily. Next I take a bite out of the Filet-O-Fish. I must have made hundreds of Filet-O-Fish, but I’ve never tried one. It’s disgusting. It puts me right off my second Big Mac. I give the rest of the food to my neighbour. I drink the milkshake. I will later wake up with severe heartburn. Dinner complete, I lie back and idly watch Fox News. Sean Hannity is upset about something. He really does have an angry face. I’m running out of people to call. I’ve recently been texting a woman I met on a dating app. I call her. I tell her I’m in bed watching Fox News, having just eaten a load of McDonald’s burgers. She says she’s vegan. I don’t bring up my financial solvency. Day three Trump finished work at 4.14pm today, according to the White House’s pool reporter. I finish early too. I head home. My apartment smells like beef and tartar sauce. It’s only 5pm when I get back, and I don’t feel ready for bed and burgers. Thankfully, the Trump presidency isn’t only about those things. Wolff writes that Trump has a bizarre hair construction routine – which isn’t necessarily news – but also reveals that he dyes his hair. Apparently, it is Trump’s impatience that leads to his hair’s unique orange hue. He won’t sit still long enough for the Just for Men dye to take effect. Pleased to have something to do, I head out and buy two different types of Just for Men: one blond, one brown. Back home, I decide against the blond. I’m committed to strong, independent journalism, but I don’t want to walk around with orange hair for the next two months. The brown dye goes on easily. Some of it gets on my face and won’t come off for another three days, but my hair does look darker. Although, given I’m alone in my apartment, it’s hard to get an accurate read on my appearance. I take my new hair to McDonald’s and decide to eat in. It gives me a chance to look up the amount of calories in Trump’s order. It’s 2,430. I still can’t get used to the Filet-O-Fish. I give one to someone outside. Back home, I notice that the diet is beginning to take its toll. I hope the White House has adequate plumbing. I usually play soccer on Tuesdays. But instead, it’s a third night in bed. Earlier, Trump held a meeting with Republicans and Democrats, inviting in TV cameras, and it is dominating my three screens. During the meeting, Trump suggested that Dreamers – young, undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children – should unconditionally be allowed to stay in the country. Later, he changed his mind and said they could stay, but only if a wall was erected along the Mexico border. CNN is pointing out the discrepancy. The president’s conflicting messages seem particularly pertinent, the CNN host says, because of questions Fire and Fury raised about Trump’s mental health. On Fox News, host Tucker Carlson thinks the meeting was a masterstroke by the president. I’m too full of meat and cheese to pay much attention. I fall asleep. Day four After executive time, I go out and buy a big red tie. Today I will be dressing like the president. I tie it really long and it dangles awkwardly around my crotch. I decide to play golf. It will be the first physical activity I’ve engaged in since assuming the Trump lifestyle. Despite criticising Barack Obama for playing golf while president, Trump has reportedly played golf on 21% of his days in office. Over the holidays, Trump played at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, but usually he likes to play at his club in New Jersey. I ring the club. I tell them I fancy a couple of holes. Can I come and play this afternoon? “No. We’re closed for winter,” says the woman on the end of the phone. She adds that, in any case, Bedminster is a “membership course”. I ask how much it costs to join. The woman puts me through to the membership department. No one answers. Later, I look it up online. Membership is $300,000 (£218,000). I decide not to join. By now, I really want to play golf. I don’t usually play, but the opportunity to do some exercise, however mild, is too good to miss. There is a driving range outside Manhattan that is open. I head there. When I arrive, I realise that in my haste to hit some balls, I’ve not packed any sports clothes. I’m wearing my suit and big tie. I decide to play anyway. But I soon realise it is quite difficult to play golf in a suit. Especially a slim-fitting suit. I make a mental note. Maybe that’s why Trump goes for the big-shouldered 1990s look. The tie is a problem, too. It dangles over my hands. Still, it’s better than being in bed. On the way home, I stop at McDonald’s. A man behind the counter recognises me and comments on the big tie. I don’t bring up Trump. He isn’t very popular in New York City. I cut my order to two Big Macs and a Diet Coke – another of the president’s favourite beverages. Earlier, I bought two boxes of Oreos. Trump likes Oreos. I take the food to bed. It’s like groundhog day. I’ve gone right off Big Macs, but develop quite a taste for Oreos. My friend from the dating app tells me Oreos are vegan. I eat a lot of Oreos. Day five Executive time ran long this morning. Maybe it’s the burgers, maybe it’s the increasing amount of time I’m spending in bed, but I’m exhausted. I get up at 11.30am. My apartment looks like the aftermath of a child’s birthday party. McDonald’s bags and boxes are strewn about the floor. The remaining Oreos are at the bottom of the bed, and there is a half-drunk chocolate milkshake in the sink. It was a rough night. I wonder if this is why Trump doesn’t like anyone going in his room. I get a Diet Coke from the fridge and think about what I’ve discovered over the past few days. I’ve learned that I don’t like Filet-O-Fish, obviously. And that no one wants to talk to me on the phone. And that Oreos don’t contain dairy. But I’ve also had a glimpse into just how lonely Trump’s life must be. I almost feel sorry for him. According to Fire and Fury, Trump never wanted to be president. As the results came in on election night, he apparently “looked as if he had seen a ghost”. I wonder if much has changed since that night. Trump’s routine doesn’t seem like that of someone who is enjoying life. It seems as if this structured, monotonous way of life is a way of feeling in control at a time when Trump’s presidency is running away from him. But, ultimately, Trump is responsible for what his life has become. He is the one who ran for president. He is the one who has managed to turn much of the American public against him. He is the one who seems to have alienated his family. Trump has made his bed – literally and figuratively – and now he has to lie in it. A lot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/12/south-sudanese-australian-man-blames-turnbull-and-dutton-for-racial-attack-on-family","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T05:22:00Z","webTitle":"South Sudanese-Australian man blames Turnbull and Dutton for 'racial attack' on family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/south-sudanese-australian-man-blames-turnbull-and-dutton-for-racial-attack-on-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/south-sudanese-australian-man-blames-turnbull-and-dutton-for-racial-attack-on-family","fields":{"headline":"South Sudanese-Australian man blames Turnbull and Dutton for 'racial attack' on family","bodyText":"Queensland police say they are investigating an incident in which a South Sudanese-Australian family say they were followed home, racially abused, and threatened on Thursday afternoon.

Anei blamed the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, for creating division and fear through their comments on African youth “gangs” in Victoria. “Congratulations Mr Prime Minister and your Minister Dutton, you’ve achieved to create division among the community,” Anei said. “But don’t worry I taught him a very good lesson that he will never come across my property again, I’m capable of protecting my home.” The video shows a man, standing inside Anei’s front yard, his face up against a screen door. Anei said the man had followed his wife and children home from childcare. The man hurls threats and racial abuse, threatening to tear the door off its hinges and rip “your fucking head off”. In a second clip, Anei opens his front door, and the man takes off his shirt and approaches him quickly and aggressively. “What you going to do? What the fuck you going to do?” the man says. The man makes a vague complaint about “your boys” who were carrying knives, but is unable to identify anyone in particular. The confrontation escalates until the man screams in Anei’s face. “I don’t give a fuck who you are, that’s what I’m saying,” he said. “I don’t give a fuck who your African boys are mate. Do you know who us Aussie cunts are, mate? Odin’s Warriors mate, Black fucken Uhlans mate, Finks, Rebels, Odin’s Warriors.” The groups referenced are all outlaw motorcycle gangs. Remaining calm, the homeowner replies: “Go and look for them, you tell them all of this stuff. I’m here, my family is sitting here. I don’t have any problem with you, you don’t have any problem with me. So please just leave.” The video suggests a scuffle then breaks out. Queensland police confirmed to Guardian Australia they were investigating the incident and have spoken to the victim. He did not currently wish to make a complaint, police said. It is understood police will speak with Sudanese community leaders and try to convince the man to lodge a formal complaint. When Guardian Australia contacted Anei, he said he did not wish to comment further. In his Facebook post, Anei described the incident as a “racial attack”. “I hold the Prime Minister Malcolm Trumbull and his Minister’s for Home Affairs Peter Dutton full responsibility for this racial attack on my family because they chose to be in the office to serve certain group of Australian communities NOT Australia as a whole country,” Anei said. “Their words was ‘tackle this #Africangang problem’ and ‘people are afraid to go out to restaurants at night’,” he wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/13/banking-royal-commission-australian-unions-to-collect-victims-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T21:00:39Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: Australian unions to collect victims' stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/13/banking-royal-commission-australian-unions-to-collect-victims-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/13/banking-royal-commission-australian-unions-to-collect-victims-stories","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: Australian unions to collect victims' stories","bodyText":"Australia’s unions are launching an online tool to collect the public’s stories of banking misconduct, fraud and criminal activity before the start of the banking royal commission. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, announced abruptly last November, does not yet allow for public submissions from victims of banking exploitation. In order to “make the banks accountable”, the ACTU will collect stories and complaints from victims via a webpage and present them en masse to the royal commission. “The commission seems to be dragging its feet on allowing submissions,” said the president of the ACTU, Ged Kearney. “Its deadline to report is only nine months away. We are eager to do anything we can to enable more voices to be heard.” The $75m royal commission is due to make its final report by 1 February 2019 and will be headed by former high court judge Kenneth Hayne. A draft report is due by 30 September. Malcolm Turnbull announced the commission at the end of November, just two days after he declared the government was against such a proposal. The move was “regrettable but necessary”, he said, after the big four banks told the treasurer, Scott Morrison, they wanted a royal commission to end uncertainty over the matter. “This will not be an open-ended commission, it will not put capitalism on trial, as some people in the parliament prefer,” Turnbull said at the time. The big banks apart, the scope of the commission also includes smaller banks, wealth managers, superannuation providers, mortgage brokers and insurance companies. In December, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, attacked the terms of reference for the commission, saying “if the Turnbull government does not get this right from the start, we will only see a continuation of the financial scandals”. “The terms of reference must enable the royal commission to investigate the rorts and rip-offs to the fullest extent possible,” he said. “It is also critical that consultation with banking victims’ groups occurs, to ensure that the victims are able to tell their stories. We also believe there should be strong protections put in place for whistle-blowers.” Bowen also asked the government to consider appointing additional commissioners to cope with the “heavy workload” of the inquiry. Kearney echoed Labor’s concerns, saying any restrictions on the public submissions would “only confirm the suspicions of the Australian people that the Turnbull government is more interested in protecting the banks than in ensuring that the system is fair”. The royal commission is expected to begin early this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/14/sniff-test-berejiklian-government-to-swab-drivers-for-cocaine-after-police-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T01:30:56Z","webTitle":"Sniff test: Berejiklian government to swab drivers for cocaine after police pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/14/sniff-test-berejiklian-government-to-swab-drivers-for-cocaine-after-police-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/14/sniff-test-berejiklian-government-to-swab-drivers-for-cocaine-after-police-pressure","fields":{"headline":"Sniff test: Berejiklian government to swab drivers for cocaine after police pressure","bodyText":"Drivers in New South Wales will be subject to roadside tests for cocaine, the latest addition to the state’s mobile drug testing regime. Guardian Australia understands it will come as part of a broader road safety policy announcement. News Corp reported that the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, would announce the new tests on Monday. In NSW police are currently able to conduct roadside tests for cannabis, amphetamines and methamphetamine or “ice”, and MDMA. The tests itself – a saliva swab – will not need to be changed to test for cocaine. The move comes after months of lobbying from NSW police. Earlier in January the state’s police commissioner said roadside cocaine testing would have a “positive outcome on the road toll and road safety”. But statistics suggest cocaine is not a major contributor to roadside deaths caused by drugs and alcohol. According to the NSW Centre for Road Safety, cocaine was associated with 11 road fatalities between 2012 and 2016, compared with almost 300 associated with cannabis, ecstasy and ice. There were 393 deaths on NSW roads in 2017, the worst result in seven years. The December period saw a number of crashes involving multiple fatalities, including 22 deaths across the country in the fortnight leading up to Christmas. Annabelle Falkholt, 21, died in a crash on the NSW south coast that also killed her parents and another driver on Boxing Day. Her sister, the actor Jessica Falkholt, remains in a critical condition after having her life support switched off last week. The high December death toll has focused attention on road safety laws, despite coming at the end of a year in which the road toll across the country reached near-record lows. The number of deaths per 100,000 people fell to 4.92 in the 12 months to the end of November, which is close to the all time low of 4.9 set in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/13/trump-michael-wolff-fire-and-fire-mentally-deranged","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T23:32:28Z","webTitle":"Trump calls Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff 'mentally deranged'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/13/trump-michael-wolff-fire-and-fire-mentally-deranged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/13/trump-michael-wolff-fire-and-fire-mentally-deranged","fields":{"headline":"Trump calls Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff 'mentally deranged'","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Saturday called Michael Wolff, the writer of a bestselling book about his White House, “a mentally deranged author” who “knowingly writes false information”. “So much Fake News is being reported,” the president wrote on Twitter. “They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!” Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, exploded into the public consciousness last week. The Guardian was first to publish excerpts, concerning former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s view of a Trump Tower meeting between aides and a group of Russians in the midst of the presidential campaign. Embarrassing details of White House life were published by other media outlets, leading to a renewed focus on Trump’s mental state and capacity for his job. Trump sought to prevent publisher Henry Holt &amp; Co from releasing the book, only for his legal threat to prompt publication to be brought forward. The book shot to the top of bestseller lists worldwide. Trump has attacked Wolff and his work before. On Saturday, the president did not immediately specify which information in Wolff’s book he claimed to be false. The White House has said the book is “fiction” and questioned Wolff’s bona fides and access to the president himself. Wolff has said he conducted more than 200 interviews and stands by all his sourcing and reporting. News outlets have pointed to inconsistencies in Fire and Fury and in past work. Bannon, a key source for Wolff, speculates in the book that Trump himself may have met the lawyer and other Russians who met key aides at Trump Tower in June 2016 after suggesting they had incriminating material on Hillary Clinton. Bannon issued a statement last weekend in which he said his comments about the meeting being “treasonous”, “unpatriotic” and “bad shit” had not been aimed at Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, but at then campaign manager Paul Manafort, one of four Trump aides to have been indicted under special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling. He did not mention Trump’s son in law, Jared Kushner, who also attended the meeting. Nor did Bannon retract his view of the character or advisibility of the gathering. Wolff’s book also contains details of the drafting of a misleading statement about the meeting, at the direction of Trump and onboard Air Force One. Bannon has been disowned by the president and key Republican donors. He lost his job at the far-right Breitbart News website. The president’s tweet on Saturday followed a relatively quiet day, in which the White House said he had been briefed in depth about issues relating to China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/13/nigel-farage-hard-brexit-leave-remain-no-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T09:32:50Z","webTitle":"Our historic Brexit vote could now be reversed, admits Nigel Farage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/13/nigel-farage-hard-brexit-leave-remain-no-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/13/nigel-farage-hard-brexit-leave-remain-no-deal","fields":{"headline":"Our historic Brexit vote could now be reversed, admits Nigel Farage","bodyText":"Nigel Farage today makes a dramatic admission that the vote for Brexit could be overturned because Remainers have seized control of the argument over Britain’s future relationship with the EU. The former Ukip leader told the Observer that he was becoming increasingly worried that the Leave camp had stopped fighting their corner, leaving a well-funded and organised Remain operation free to influence the political and public debate without challenge. “The Remain side are making all the running,” said Farage. “They have a majority in parliament, and unless we get ourselves organised we could lose the historic victory that was Brexit.” On Thursday Farage angered many Brexiters, and many in Ukip, when he said he was coming round to the view that the country might need to hold a second referendum in order to close down the EU argument for good. He said then that he believed such a vote would see the Brexit side win with a bigger majority than the one it achieved on 23 June 2016, when it triumphed by 52% to 48%. But, speaking on Friday, Farage appeared to change his tune, making clear that he was seriously worried that Brexit could be undone and reversed. The case for a complete break from the EU was no longer being made, even by pro-Brexit MPs in parliament, he said. Instead, the Remain camp was relentlessly putting out its message that a hard Brexit would be ruinous to the British economy and bad for the country, without people hearing the counter-argument that had secured Brexiters victory in the 2016 referendum campaign. His latest intervention comes ahead of another vital week for the Brexit process in the House of Commons and as peers in the overwhelmingly pro-Remain House of Lords prepare to argue for retaining the closest possible links with the EU – and in some cases for a second referendum – when legislation reaches peers at the end of this month. Farage said he now had a similar feeling to the one he had 20 years ago when Tony Blair appeared to be preparing the country for an eventual entry into the euro. “I think the Leave side is in danger of not even making the argument,” he said. “The Leave groups need to regather and regroup, because Remain is making all the arguments. After we won the referendum, we closed the doors and stopped making the argument.” Last Monday Farage held a meeting in Brussels with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, which, he said, left him convinced that the UK would not be offered the kind of deal that would be easy to sell as beneficial to the UK economy unless Leavers upped their game. “We no longer have a majority in parliament. I think we would lose the vote in parliament,” Farage said. Farage’s rallying call to Leavers reflects genuine alarm among hardline Brexit supporters that too many concessions have already been made to the Remain side of the Brexit argument by Theresa May’s government, and that more could follow. As negotiations continue in Brussels, and Brexit legislation passes through parliament, the government has already accepted the case for a two-year transition period in which the UK would effectively remain in the single market and customs union. Before Christmas, pro-EU Tory MPs sided with opposition MPs to defeat the government and ensure that MPs will have a “meaningful vote” on the eventual Brexit agreement struck with Brussels – meaning they have an effective veto. Labour will back an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill demanding that a very detailed independent economic analysis of the effects of the eventual deal should be conducted after it is struck but before it is put to a vote of MPs. While the Labour leadership is playing down the significance of the move, many MPs see it as a step towards their party backing permanent membership of the EU single market and customs union. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the pro-EU grouping Open Britain – one of those which Farage worries has become too influential – said: “The very least the Labour front bench should be supporting is a proper analysis of the dire economic consequences of leaving the single market and the customs union. The clock is ticking and the time for sitting on the fence is long gone. This should serve as a stepping stone to the party backing the position of staying in the single market and the customs union permanently.” Anti-hard-Brexit Tories says their numbers have increased since May’s widely criticised government reshuffle, in which Remainer Justine Greening left the cabinet to sit with pro-EU Tories at prime minister’s questions. Writing for the Observer, Ben Bradley, the 28-year-old Mansfield MP and newly appointed Tory vice-chair for youth, said the reshuffle marked a moment for the party to show it would become more responsive to the needs of young voters following its poor election result last June. “Last year’s general election saw a surge in young people turning out to vote, with 18-to-24-year-olds voting in greater numbers than at any other time,” he writes. “Politicians – of all political stripes – have to start listening. The fact that most of the youth vote went to Labour in 2017 means that Conservatives have to start listening even more carefully. “As a young person – brought up on the values of tolerance and respect – I want to ensure that people of my generation and younger are not scared to say that they are a Conservative.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/13/chelsea-manning-democrat-us-senate-maryland","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T18:29:35Z","webTitle":"Chelsea Manning announces run for US Senate with video on Twitter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/13/chelsea-manning-democrat-us-senate-maryland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/13/chelsea-manning-democrat-us-senate-maryland","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea Manning announces run for US Senate with video on Twitter","bodyText":"After seven years in military prison for carrying out one of the largest leaks in US history and coming out as a transgender woman, Chelsea Manning is embarking on the next stage in her epic journey: running for a seat in the US Senate. The former US army private, who was held in military lockup for far longer than any other official leaker in modern times, has declared in a federal filing her intention to run in this year’s Democratic primaries for a Maryland Senate seat. Now 30, she confirmed she was entering the race in a video posted on Twitter on Sunday under her now established internet trademark #WeGotThis. “We live in trying times. Times of fear, of suppression, of hate,” Manning said in the video dressed in black and holding a red rose. Over grainy shots of riot police assailing protesters and of Donald Trump in the Oval Office, she went on: “We don’t need more or better leaders, we need someone willing to fight.” Manning also tweeted a link for campaign donations. The audacious decision to stand for one of the most exalted political positions in the country less than eight months after she was released from Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas underlines how rapidly Manning has taken to civilian life. Though it has not all been plain sailing – she was turned back from the Canadian border in September, having been refused entry – she has embraced her new role as an LGBTQ and progressive celebrity. Having spent the best part of a decade with no direct access to the internet, she has become a Twitter star with some 319,000 followers. She fills her Twitter feed with rainbow emoji and upbeat refrains that should translate easily into campaign slogans, including “We can do better” and “We have more power than they do” – a reference to the Trump firmament. Despite these advantages, Manning’s challenge will be steep. In the Democratic primary she will face Ben Cardin, who has served two six-year terms in the Senate and has built a name for himself on the chamber’s foreign affairs committee as a dogged investigator of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Cardin’s work on the committee has brought him to focus on an organization which overlaps with Manning’s personal history: WikiLeaks. The open information website, run by Julian Assange out of his place of exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, released thousands of emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the presidential race. US intelligence agencies have asserted that the emails were hacked by the Russian government in a brazen attempt to distort the election in favour of Trump. Manning transferred a vast stash of about 700,000 embassy cables, war logs and videos to WikiLeaks in 2010. Though at the time the soldier and Assange appeared to have forged an internet friendship, Manning has since moved away from him and had nothing further to do with WikiLeaks after the initial transfer of leaked data. Whatever the outcome of the primaries, Manning’s decision to stand is likely to cement her reputation as one of the most arresting new voices to emerge in the so-called “resistance” to Trump. In that regard, there is no love lost. Trump has been consistently antagonistic towards the former soldier. In January 2017, after Barack Obama commuted Manning’s 35-year sentence and ordered her release, Trump tweeted: “Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/13/sam-allardyce-horror-show-everton-tottenham-future","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T22:40:37Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce feeling blue after horror show leaves Everton stuck in another rut | Sachin Nakrani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/13/sam-allardyce-horror-show-everton-tottenham-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/13/sam-allardyce-horror-show-everton-tottenham-future","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce feeling blue after horror show leaves Everton stuck in another rut","bodyText":"As Everton’s players headed towards their supporters shortly after the final whistle had blown, it was not immediately obvious who there were more of. The exodus in that corner of Wembley was stark and had started some time before the end of proceedings, with many of those who had travelled from Merseyside and elsewhere clearly keen to get away from the misery taking place in front of them. It was hard to blame them. There is, after all, only so much any fan can take. The despair has been long-standing but this season particularly so given the hope that sprung from a summer of heavy investment. A seventh-place finish was meant to be the minimum but quickly the blues kicked in for the Blues – a slide into relegation trouble, the less-than-universally-popular arrival of Sam Allardyce, an FA Cup defeat by Liverpool and now this, a 4-0 hammering that could – and should – have been worse. Tottenham were excellent, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min in particular and, before kick-off, most Everton fans were probably expecting their side to face a stern challenge from opponents who have rediscovered their verve in recent weeks. Defeat was always likely but not like this. “[The gulf] was massive,” conceded Allardyce after his side’s fourth successive loss. “I saw the good side of the players last week against Liverpool and some of the worst side of them today. It’s worrying how bad our performances have become in such a short space of time. I didn’t expect to see it and I have to address it as quickly as possible.” As part of that process Allardyce will sit down with his players at the club’s Finch Farm base next week and show them a video of this game. It will be a horror show. Basic defensive errors contributed to Tottenham’s first three goals and, while Kane may have been offside when he struck for the first time on 47 minutes, the way Everton reacted to that setback was alarming. Heads dropped, shoulders sagged, those in blue lost their shape and all but stopped running for the cause. Allardyce rightly described the visitors’ second-half display as a “capitulation”. This outcome will not aid Allardyce’s hopes of remaining as Everton’s manager beyond this season, with the sturdiness he brought to the side after replacing Ronald Koeman in November having all but vanished. Ten goals have been conceded in that run of four defeats with this the third game out of six that Everton have not mustered a shot on target, which somewhat makes a farce of Allardyce’s assertion that one reason his team lost here is because he set them up in far too an attacking shape. In his defence, this remains a woefully imbalanced squad. Very little pace, very little creativity and at the back, a toxic mix of defenders who are either on the wrong side of the hill or have barely begun the climb. In Cuco Martina’s case some are also not good enough – yet again the Curaçao international was terrible, no more so than when he backed away from Serge Aurier, allowing the Frenchman to easily deliver the cross from which Son opened the scoring on 26 minutes. Equally, Allardyce has not helped his cause with his generally negative tactics – such as deploying three defensive midfielders for last month’s trip to Bournemouth – and playing Gylfi Sigurdsson as a wide left attacker, as he did here. The Iceland international is simply too slow to be an attacking threat from there and lacks the necessary defensive responsibilities that come with the position. A player who cost Everton a club-record £45m should only be deployed as a No10, the position from which he scored at Anfield last week but which here was occupied by Wayne Rooney. The former England captain hustled and bustled in characteristic style but it was telling that the most notable aspect of his evening was avoiding a red card for a late tackle on Erik Lamela having already been booked by the referee, Craig Pawson. The one positive for the visitors was the debut display of Cenk Tosun. Deployed as a lone forward in a 4-2-3-1 formation, the £27m Turkey international showed a level of aggression, movement and canniness that has been lacking at Everton since Romelu Lukaku left last summer. “He will definitely be an improvement for us,” said Allardyce of the 26-year-old, who he withdrew just after an hour but will surely use again from the start when West Bromwich Albion visit Goodison Park on Saturday. It says something about the cramped shape of this season’s table that despite sitting ninth, Everton go into that contest stalked by relegation concerns. “It’s a massive game,” Allardyce conceded on an evening when the doom and gloom that Everton thought they had escaped well and truly took hold again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/14/spread-eagle-hackney-vegan-meat-free-food","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:04:12Z","webTitle":"Beer-battered ‘tofish’: welcome to London’s first all-vegan pub","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/14/spread-eagle-hackney-vegan-meat-free-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/14/spread-eagle-hackney-vegan-meat-free-food","fields":{"headline":"Beer-battered ‘tofish’: welcome to London’s first all-vegan pub","bodyText":"Four years ago, Meriel Armitage was so anxious about using the word vegan on her menu she considered dropping it altogether. On Friday night, shortly after dusk, the 34-year-old opened the doors of London’s first 100% vegan pub, its sales pitch very much based on an absolute boycott of animal products. Standing by the freshly polished bar, as the first customers arrived into the dimly lit room where all food, drinks, fixtures and fittings are purely plant-based, Armitage smiled: “Back then, we were genuinely worried about putting customers off; suddenly it’s the opposite.” The arrival of the Spread Eagle in east London’s Homerton, occupying a prime spot on a hipster artery stretching from central Hackney, coincides with unparalleled enthusiasm for veganism. This month’s Veganuary has enticed at least 100,000 to give up all animal produce for the month, a 40,000 rise on last year. Little more than 3,000 took part in its inaugural outing in 2014. Global brands have spotted the potential, Pret a Manger launching its vegan range a week ago. On Monday, Britain’s biggest supermarket, Tesco, unveiled its range of 100% plant-based meals to be sold in 600 stores. For Luke McLaughlin, co-founder with Armitage, the Spread Eagle’s arrival marks the start of the next phase of veganism’s move into the mainstream. “A year ago, we would have been nervous about opening, but not any more,” he said. His confidence was justified by the early flurry of customers. A group of London food bloggers, who knew each other through their admiration for all things vegan, were among the first to place an order with Armitage’s kitchen. Admiration greeted the arrival of tacos with vegan chorizo, vegan fried chicken scallops and beer-battered “tofish”. Kishani Widyaratna, 32, was among those wowed: “It’s exciting to be here, veganism is growing fast.” Her friend Hannah Siery, 35, nodded eagerly: “The Tesco range was such a big step, the buzz around veganism has never been like this.” McLaughlin, 38, from Rochdale, predicts the Spread Eagle will prompt a surge in similar vegan ventures around the capital, six years after Soho’s Coach and Horses gained kudos as London’s first vegetarian pub. Research suggests there are more than half a million Britons following a vegan diet. Another food blogger predicted that the rise of veganism will result in a Britain split between vegans and meat eaters. “There’ll be no middle ground any more, just a divided nation,” said Sareta Puri, 34. Hackney resident Erin Hackett, tucking into a plate of corn esquites, believes it will gradually become the norm to eat less meat. “Meat used to be more of a treat for our father’s generation and I can see a return to that,” said the 31-year-old. Helping drive demand, according to Armitage, are social media and the accumulation of readily available information shining a light on aspects of mass-food production. “It’s become harder to cut yourself off from the realities,” she said. Several of those in the Spread Eagle on Friday cited Simon Amstell’s Carnage, a dark comedy set in the future where older generations suffer the guilt of their carnivorous past, as another defining moment in the evolution of veganism. That London’s first vegan pub is in Hackney should come as no major surprise. The UK’s first vegan chicken shop, Temple Of Seitan, opened last year and has since drawn crowds of devotees. A vegan Christmas market in the borough drew four-hour food queues. The Spread Eagle has been popular with the area’s drinkers since 1752 and, on Thursday night, residents were invited to sample its cask ales, brewed without using any animal products. Nine of the pub’s stalwart drinkers turned up, taking their usual stools – their leather seats ripped up and assiduously replaced with synthetic covers – to sample their first plant-based pints. “They said that they’ve never been made to feel more at home and that delighted me. They’re part of this area, it’s rich heritage,” said McLaughlin. Others had travelled slightly further to sample its fare. Tali, 27, from Los Angeles, was adamant the Spread Eagle is certain to become a trendsetter. “Think of the environmental benefits, the health benefits – what’s not to like?” Across her at the table sat Damien Clarkson, 33, the co-founder of Vevolution – a media company devoted to promoting vegan culture. He hosted the recent Tesco launch, and predicted veganism’s takeover might become so rapid that it becomes the dominant positioning of restaurants and pubs. “In five years’ time, the place selling meat will be the odd one out,” he laughed. Beside him, Judy Nadel, 33, said: “Veganism is not exclusive, it’s for everyone, that’s really my hope for the future.” By 10pm, the pub was buzzing. Armitage scanning the bustling room, said: “At one point, you would’ve hidden that you were vegan; now it’s a case of being loud and proud. All of a sudden, you no longer feel meat eaters have the upper hand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-on-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Donald Trump | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-on-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/observer-view-on-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Donald Trump","bodyText":"It is almost one year since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th US president. Will he last another 12 months? Day after tumultuous day since 20 January 2017, Trump has provided fresh evidence of his unfitness for America’s highest office. It is not only that his politics and policies, from tax cuts and climate change to Palestine and nuclear weapons, are disastrously wrong-headed. It is not just that his idea of leadership is divisive, confrontational and irresponsible. Nor does the problem lie solely with his blatant racism, misogyny and chauvinism, though these are indeed massive problems. His latest foul-mouthed outrage – describing developing countries as “shitholes” – is appalling even by his crude standards. The fundamental failing underlying Trump’s presidency is his wilful ignorance. His frequently petulant, childish behaviour combines with a staggering lack of knowledge and contempt for facts to produce serial, chronic misjudgments. Trump, in power, cannot be trusted. He has been exposed as lacking in empathy, shamelessly mendacious, cynical and unversed or uninterested in the enduring human and constitutional values his office is sworn to uphold. Trump is the first and hopefully the last of his kind: an anti-American president. He is a disgrace and a danger to his country. The sooner he is sent packing, the better. How much longer will Americans tolerate his embarrassing presence in the White House? His tenancy runs until November 2020, when he could seek a second term. But the problem is getting worse, not better. A series of scenarios, fuelled by his endlessly damaging, unacceptable words and actions, is beginning to unfold that could bring about his early departure. The first and, democratically speaking, the most desirable scenario is that the electorate will simply reject Trump. This process is already well under way, if opinion polls are to be believed. Trump’s personal approval rating has averaged below 40% over the past year, a record for presidential unpopularity. More telling, perhaps, were the findings of a Pew Research Center poll last month that debunked the myth that Trump’s “base” – his core support – is impervious to his daily blundering. Trump’s backing among key groups that helped elect him – white men, Protestant evangelicals, the over-50s and the non-college educated – has fallen significantly across the board. At the same time, a Gallup survey found the number of voters redefining themselves as uncommitted “independents” rose to 42%. Trump’s fading electoral appeal was cruelly exposed in shock defeats in Virginia and Alabama. Anger and disappointment with Trump among white voters was said to be a decisive factor, assisted by record turnout among African Americans. Nationally, evidence that the Trump rump is shredding is on the rise. A Monmouth University poll last August found that 61% of Trump voters said they could not think of anything he might do that would turn them against him. A poll last month put that figure at 37%. It is plain that many ordinary voters who trusted Trump to make a positive difference have been repelled and disgusted. Pollsters and pundits are looking to November’s midterm congressional elections. Forecasts suggest a stunning repudiation of a “toxic” Trump, with the Alabama upset being replicated nationwide. The GOP could lose control of the House of Representatives, where large numbers of moderate Republicans are retiring, and its grip on the Senate may be loosened by an anti-Trump tsunami. No party since 1950 has hung on to the house in a midterm poll when the president’s approval was below 40%. A humiliating nationwide slap in the face from voters this year, coupled with the loss of Congress, could bring Trump’s presidency shuddering to a halt, leaving him wounded, deserted by most Republicans and doomed to one-term ignominy. Meanwhile, another scenario prospectively leading to his political demise is playing out simultaneously. Nobody knows, as yet, whether the federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russian agents in 2016 will ultimately irretrievably compromise the president himself. But claims that Trump conspired to obstruct justice by putting pressure on the FBI and firing its unbiddable director, James Comey, appear to have substance and are potentially fatal to his presidency. Robert Mueller, the special counsel, is proposing a formal interview under oath. It’s not over yet. Supporters of Trump point to what they see as a string of successes. They cite a stock market that has added $7tn in value, 2m new jobs and radical tax reform. They credit Trump with defeating Islamic State (a vain boast) and reducing illegal immigration. The number of Americans saying the US economy is in “excellent shape” has jumped from 2% in November 2016 to 18%. About 48% say the economy is “good”, up 11% in the same period. By these measures, his trademark vow to “make America great again” may be beginning to work – and this is likely to slow the pace of desertions from his electoral base. Elsewhere, conservatives will point to some significant triumphs that give the lie to the idea that Trump has been a hapless figure unable to bend America to his will. On many fronts, his administration is landing significant blows to the Obama-Clinton legacy. The environment secretary, Scott Pruitt, has effectively disembowelled the Environment Protection Agency, sacking scores of advisers and scientists. He is intent on scrapping many Obama-era regulations on water, climate, pollution and more. There has been a bonfire of environmental rules. New rules on chemicals previously declared toxic are being relaxed. The president is busy appointing predominantly young, white male, conservative judges to federal appeal and district courts. While the supreme court hears only a handful of cases a year, it is in these lower courts where America’s settlement on issues of gender, race, work, relationships and much more is decided. Meanwhile, the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, is shrinking America’s national monuments. Part of the Obama-designated Bears Ears in Utah (1.3m acres) and the Clinton-designated Grand Staircase-Escalante (1.9m acres) will likely be opened up for mining and other industrial pursuits. (Trump was lobbied by the uranium mining company Energy Fuels to open up Bears Ears for its uranium rich deposits.) Then there are the quiet revolutions under way by Betsy DeVos at the education department, while former presidential candidate Ben Carson, at the department of housing and urban development, is slashing government spending on affordable housing. And on and on. These are some of the wins that conservatives are happy to bank while tolerating the intolerable in the White House. The overwhelming impression of Trump’s first 12 months is not of steady progress but chaos. Tantrums, tears and irrational rage dominate the reality TV scene inside the White House, according to Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury. On the national stage, Trump has displayed open bigotry over migrant and race issues. His lowest point, among numerous low points, was his implied support for white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Internationally, Trump made nuclear war with North Korea more likely, dismayed the entire world by rejecting the Paris climate accord, insulted and threatened the UN over Jerusalem, did his best to wreck the landmark 2015 treaty with Iran and did next to nothing to halt the terrible conflicts in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan. Worse still, in a way, he has scorned US friends and allies in Europe and cosied up to authoritarian leaders in China, Russia and the Middle East. Britain has been treated with condescension and contempt, as in his abrupt (but welcome) cancellation of next month’s London visit. Is this dysfunction evidence of an unhinged personality, as many people suggest? Rather than invoking the 25th amendment and dumping Trump, it would be better if he was held responsible for his actions. For his wilful ignorance, his dangerous lies and his unAmerican bigotry, Trump must be held to account. Perhaps 2018 will be the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/university-first-more-common-than-lower-second-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:01:12Z","webTitle":"Now students pay thousands, firsts are on the rise.

Fancy that","bodyText":"Many proud academics must have spluttered over their morning coffee in the senior common room to learn that a first-class degree, once as rare as hen’s teeth, is now more akin to a hen’s egg: we can all have one for breakfast, it seems, if we can only be bothered to go out to collect it. A survey by the Press Association has revealed that far from denoting scholarly excellence and a top-notch mind, in Britain a first is today a more likely outcome of a university education than a lower second. Analysis of official figures for 2015-16 gathered by the Higher Education Statistics Agency shows the share of graduates with the highest possible result has risen by an astronomical 44% in just five years. This sharp increase in the number of firsts is particularly marked after 2012-13, the year in which – pure coincidence? – students were charged higher fees and in which 18% got a first. Perhaps this is cause for national jubilation? After all, many students will not now need to cope with the social impediment of acquiring what was once fondly known as “a Desmond” after the former Archbishop Tutu (2:2, geddit?). Although if we are now producing so many students of the highest cognitive calibre, how many of them have noticed the strong correlation between the amount they have to pay out these days and what they get handed back at the end? Several billion pounds surrendered in fees, it seems clear, can buy a quarter of all undergraduates a much better reason to break open the bubbly on results day. Or is the news that firsts are suddenly more attainable welcomed by students? No young person is pleased, are they, when the driving test is made more difficult? As long as they can drive away at the end, then they are ahead – even if the examiner had to be slipped an extra note or two under the dashboard. It used, surely, to be a point of self-respect among university dons that rigorous standards were maintained. Securing a coveted first was the gateway, was it not, into their own mysterious, ivory-panelled, wooden-towered world? So a very persuasive hint indeed must have gone round high table: “Go easy on the dears, especially if I have to justify the noughts on my salary here.” It appears the country needs to alter the way it views a first. No longer is it a nifty bit of shorthand for someone who has surpassed the common crowd in learning – I guess we still have the few cum laude and congratulatory-first starlets for that. And must employers quickly learn to distinguish the value of top qualifications from different establishments? One question remains: how do we compensate those who have just had their own hard-earned grades from days gone by downgraded? Will there be compensation for the retrospective belittling of their firsts? How much for robbing a former swot of their chance to hint at their yellowing academic honours?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/14/jewish-service-calls-for-removal-of-london-coroner-over-burial-delay","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Jewish society calls for removal of London coroner over burial delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/jewish-service-calls-for-removal-of-london-coroner-over-burial-delay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/14/jewish-service-calls-for-removal-of-london-coroner-over-burial-delay","fields":{"headline":"Jewish society calls for removal of London coroner over burial delay","bodyText":"A Jewish burial service has called for a senior London coroner to be removed after accusing her of causing “anguish and trauma” by bureaucratic delays in a dispute over religious rules for the dead. The service has made an official complaint against Mary Hassell, senior coroner for inner north London, saying “many of her imposed rules, bureaucracy, inflexibility and unnecessary delays offend traditional and/or religious practices”. The move came after Hassell said “no death will be prioritised in any way over any other because of the religion of the deceased or family”. She has also suggested members of her staff have been “bullied or intimidated” by Jewish community representatives. The Adath Yisrael Burial Society (AYBS) will demand a judicial review this month unless the coroner retracts her new protocol. Its lawyers said the policy “amounts to a blanket and disproportionate refusal” to respect religious beliefs that require speedy burial. Hassell deals with deaths across north-east London, including Hackney, the biggest concentration of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Europe, and Tower Hamlets, the UK’s biggest Muslim community. She took up the post in 2013, and was previously coroner for Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Under Jewish law, the dead should be buried as soon as possible, preferably on the day of death, and should be “guarded”, or prayed over, from death until burial. Bodies should be buried intact, without autopsy, wherever possible. Islamic law also says the dead should be buried as swiftly as possible, and views autopsies as desecration. The dispute arose over the death of a Jewish man, Aharon Barzevski, 43, on Saturday 21 October last year, details of which are contained in correspondence seen by the Guardian. Asserson Law Offices, which represents relatives of the deceased and the AYBS, wrote to Hassell three days after Barzevski died, raising concerns about when the body would be released by the coroner for burial. Asserson complained that no out-of-hours service had been available over the weekend, and two days after the death there were still delays in ordering a non-invasive CT scan to determine whether an autopsy was needed. Replying to Asserson a week later, Hassell referred to “insufficient resources” and staff shortages. She added that a member of her staff had “felt persecuted by the way you and the rabbis treated her. That is a strong word, but that is the word she used to me.” Hassell wrote: “I have received complaints in a similar vein from my other officers and from the mortuary manager … My team have a right not to be bullied or intimidated at work.” She announced a new protocol, the main point being that no death would be prioritised by the coroner’s office on religious grounds. She also revoked an arrangement to transfer bodies to a secure Jewish funeral home while awaiting release, rather than keeping them in a public mortuary, to allow “guarding” by family members and the community. Asher Gratt of the AYBS said Hassell had caused “immense anguish, stress and trauma” to bereaved members of the community. “We have full respect for others who want a quick burial. But most families in the UK prefer to take some time before the closure of a funeral. For Jews, mourning cannot start until after burial.” He denied that community members had bullied the coroner’s staff, but acknowledged that relatives had sometimes been “forced to make multiple phone calls at a time when they are desperate and so may become frustrated”. Other recent cases cited in the Jewish media include a woman who made 210 calls to the coroner’s office before being permitted to bury her father on 24 December, four days after he died, and another family who was told it would take two weeks to conduct an autopsy before a funeral could be held. Trevor Asserson of Asserson said: “Mary Hassell appears to show such total disregard for people of faith and such ignorance of the law that she seems entirely unsuited to her position.” The law firm cited Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to practise one’s religion or beliefs subject only to legal limitations to protect public safety and order, and the rights and freedoms of others. Hassell’s office said she was unable to comment. However, her most recent letter to Asserson said her new protocol was not unlawful, adding: “I believe the cab rank rule is the fairest way.” The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed it had “received complaints against Mary Hassell, the north London coroner. These will be considered in accordance with the Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2014.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/15/medical-university-south-carolina-musc-coretta-scott-king-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"South Carolina hospital accused of tarnishing legacy of Coretta Scott King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/medical-university-south-carolina-musc-coretta-scott-king-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/15/medical-university-south-carolina-musc-coretta-scott-king-strike","fields":{"headline":"South Carolina hospital accused of tarnishing legacy of Coretta Scott King","bodyText":"In the summer of 1969, Coretta Scott King, the recently widowed wife of the civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King Jr, led a strike of hundreds of black female nurses at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Under the banner “I Am Somebody”, they protested for the right to bargain collectively. Almost 50 years later, many black women working at MUSC argue little has changed and at least two workers are suing for redress, claiming they have been the victims of systemic racism. The hospital vehemently denies the claims. The strike that King led lasted 120 days. After unionized black dock workers threatened to strike in solidarity and federal officials threatened to pull funds, MUSC agreed to some reforms. The women did not win the right to bargain collectively but they did win pay raises, the right to independent panels to handle grievances and firings and, most importantly, they won respect. MUSC pledged to do more to do fix its racist culture. Since then, Charleston has evolved into a cosmopolitan beachside town. MUSC has become a symbol of such growth, educating more than 3,000 students in six colleges and employing more than 15,000 people. However, workers at the hospital still lack collective bargaining rights and some custodians at the university make as little $9 an hour. Lacking a union contract, workers say the overwhelmingly white management disproportionately fires black workers, a charge MUSC denies. In an email to the Guardian, MUSC stated: “It has been, and will continue to be, the policy of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to recruit, hire, train and promote into all job levels the most qualified persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation or gender identity.” While the majority of the workforce at the hospital is black, some MUSC employees argue that people of color are primarily consigned to less prestigious jobs such as custodians, hospital technicians and nurses, while more prestigious jobs in management, as doctors and in the more prestigious nursing positions in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are staffed primarily by white people. “If you walk through that unit right now and you see someone who looks like me please tell me,” said one former nurse at MUSC, who wished to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. While the hospital has hired staff to focus on making MUSC more diverse and inclusive, black workers claim their voices are not heard. Indeed, they say, the board of trustees of MUSC will not even let workers speak during public comment periods at regular public meetings. MUSC contends that state law does not require it to allow public comment periods. Many other public institutions in South Carolina do allow such comments. Workers and their advocates claim there is a longstanding problem with racist language and behavior involving managers. “There are a handful of white managers who are just notorious for being racists,” said Kerry Taylor, a labor historian at nearby Citadel Military College who has studied working conditions at the hospital and assisted workers in organizing. “There are these racist managers who when they are found to be in the wrong, they aren’t suspended or fired, they are just relocated to different parts of the hospital, they are just sorta shuffled around.” Even the right to have grievances heard by an independent state-appointed panel, won in that 1969 strike, has been rolled back, workers say. Now, grievances at the hospital are heard solely by a panel of hospital administrators, appointed by management. “When the nurses struck they were trying to make progress and take two steps forward, but now it seems we have taken two steps back,” said 32-year-old nurse Altanya Coaxum, who was fired from her job in November. “I don’t feel like Coretta Scott King’s vision is fulfilled.” Coaxum, who has filed a grievance procedure and said she intends to pursue legal action, said she was falsely accused of performing a procedure incorrectly. She presented witnesses, she said, who said she had performed the procedure correctly. She claimed her evidence was overruled by white management. “The fact that they were white made them appear that were credible,” she said. Coaxum intends to fight her firing with the help of Health Care Workers United, a group of workers who are fighting for change at the hospital. Working with lawyers and local labor and community allies, the group has helped win reinstatement of some workers who were fired and improvements in working conditions. But despite the outpouring of public support many black workers like Coaxum receive when they are fired, many say the deck is stacked against them when they attempt to take legal action. Some nurses interviewed by the Guardian claimed that when they attempted to sue for racial discrimination, MUSC management countered with claims that the fired worker engaged in practices that would allow the state to strip them of their nursing license, barring them from future employment in their field. “MUSC has been known to threaten, make up things, make false accusations,” said Coaxum. “They are just a monster, they really are. If workers speak up against the white management, they are pretty much eaten alive by MUSC and you can be blacklisted permanently from your profession.” In an email to the Guardian, MUSC denied it had problems involving racial discrimination and said it would not comment on individual cases. “We categorically deny these unattributed and unfounded allegations about how we treat our present or former care team members,” a statement said. Workers dispute MUSC’s record on race and say the dream of quality championed by workers in 1969 has not been fulfilled. “Coretta Scott King’s dream has not come to reality, we are not treated fairly, we are not treated equally and it’s all based on our skin,” said 50-year-old former MUSC nurse Chris Nelson, who was fired in 2014 and is suing MUSC for racial discrimination. “Everybody has a voice and their voice should be heard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/13/cardiff-city-sunderland-callum-paterson-joe-ralls-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T14:28:17Z","webTitle":"Cardiff run riot as they return to winning ways against 10-man Sunderland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/13/cardiff-city-sunderland-callum-paterson-joe-ralls-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/13/cardiff-city-sunderland-callum-paterson-joe-ralls-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Cardiff run riot as they return to winning ways against 10-man Sunderland","bodyText":"Cardiff City got their promotion push firmly back on track after clinching a first win in five matches by comfortably dispatching 10-man Sunderland on home turf, courtesy of a second-half double from Callum Paterson and a sweet Joe Ralls strike before Anthony Pilkington completed the rout in stoppage time. For Chris Coleman, it was a miserable return to Wales. Coleman enjoyed plenty of special moments at the Cardiff City Stadium during a six-year reign as Wales manager which ended when he took over Sunderland in November. Belgium, then ranked the second best team in the world, were beaten at Cardiff on Coleman’s watch. However, his battle to prevent Sunderland sliding towards relegation may prove an even bigger task. It is now three straight league defeats for his rock-bottom side, who had midfielder Didier Ndong sent off. “We have a soft mentality,” Coleman said. “Toughness is not about physicality, it’s not about nailing someone, it’s about mentality. If we don’t toughen up, we are going to stay where we are – it’s as simple as that.” The teams went in level at the break but the hosts opened the scoring inside 55 seconds of the restart when Paterson climbed highest to nod home a corner. Shortly after Ndong was given a straight red card by the referee, Andy Madley, for a tackle on Junior Hoilett four minutes after the interval. The Cardiff winger carried on but was replaced by Pilkington late on. There seemed no way back for Sunderland and so it proved as Cardiff then produced the best move of the match. Ralls rounded off a sweeping counterattack after good work by Kenneth Zohore – who bullied Jake Clarke-Salter, the Chelsea loanee making his debut –before laying the ball on a plate for his team-mate Ralls to slot home his eighth goal this term. Sunderland came close to a lifeline when Bruno Manga almost sliced into his own net but Cardiff were soon out of sight. Ten minutes from time, Paterson drove home an effort from an acute angle after reacting quickest after Zohore’s free-kick was blocked. Pilkington put the icing on the cake from inside the box after good work by Yanic Wildschut, who arrived on loan from Norwich City on Friday, condemning Coleman to his heaviest defeat in charge of the club. “We had 900 fans here today and they’ve been on the road since 3am,” Coleman added. “It’s tough on them, again.” Neil Warnock’s side had stuttered to a stalemate at home to fourth-tier Mansfield Town in the FA Cup last weekend and had lost their previous four Championship matches. However, this victory saw them briefly return to second in the table, before Derby’s win at Birmingham in the 3pm kick-offs pushed Cardiff down to third. Warnock had not lost five straight matches since 1995. “Anybody can get up from the top eight, it is such an even league, but we just have to keep looking after ourselves,” the Cardiff manager said. “We needed that. You could see the nervousness in the first half, we just said: ‘we have to get that first goal’ but we played some good stuff in the second [half]. We have been like that all week in training.” Next up for Cardiff is a third-round replay at Mansfield on Tuesday before a league trip to Sheffield Wednesday next weekend while Sunderland, who have won four games all season, have a huge clash with fellow strugglers Hull City."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/14/xanax-anxious-teenagers-buy-dark-web-tranquillisers","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"Anxious teenagers ‘buy Xanax on the dark web’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/14/xanax-anxious-teenagers-buy-dark-web-tranquillisers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/14/xanax-anxious-teenagers-buy-dark-web-tranquillisers","fields":{"headline":"Anxious teenagers ‘buy Xanax on the dark web’","bodyText":"A growing number of children are using the anti-anxiety drug Xanax to “self-medicate” against mental health problems, prompting calls from senior Labour MPs for an investigation into the escalating use of the tranquilliser, which is around 20 times stronger than Valium. Xanax has seen a sharp rise in popularity in the past year, with some experts saying it has become one of the top five drugs used by young people, alongside cannabis and alcohol. Known as alprazolam in its generic form, Xanax can easily be bought from street dealers, online pharmacies or the dark web for as little as £1 a pill. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth is joining Labour MP Bambos Charalambous to urge Public Health England to look into the apparent boom in usage after one of Charalambous’s constituents said her daughter had been groomed using Xanax. Ashworth said: “Some of the stories we are hearing about this are shocking. We need to raise awareness and have a proper understanding of the implications of this. I hope that the government … plans for greater research on the impact this is having on many adolescents’ lives.” Charalambous, who will address a debate on the drug in parliament on Monday night, said: “Some young people are using Xanax to self-medicate to cope with anxiety, while younger teenagers are being groomed and exploited by drug pushers taking advantage of the drug’s ‘zombie-like’ effects. The government needs to research its use and gather clear data, raise public awareness and put support in place for those who have developed a dependency.” The news comes after a spate of Xanax-related hospitalisations over Christmas, prompting Lewes police in East Sussex to warn people at New Year’s Eve events about the dangers of taking Xanax and other prescription drugs. Charity workers believe most teenagers taking Xanax are doing so for recreational use, but significant anecdotal evidence is suggesting that many are trying to manage anxiety and other mental health problems. Nick Hickmott at the charity Addaction said: “I think the self-medication taps into CAMHS [child and adolescent mental health services] waiting lists and young people not having access to good mental health care. “Young people don’t have the time to explore anxiety and paranoia, and pressure and stress. Young people are looking for answers and they’re not necessarily looking to GPs, carers or drug workers – they’re looking to each other.” Hickmott says he had learned of a teenager who bought 300 pills on the dark web and sold them at school. “So it’s not so much the big bad dealers coming down from London to snap up all these kids who don’t know what they’re doing,” he said. Addaction believes more needs to be done to educate young people about the harm involved in taking Xanax, including the addictive nature of the drug, and where they can go to seek help. In the last few months there have been several reports of people being hospitalised after taking Xanax in Sussex, Somerset, Kent and Cumbria. The drug has also achieved greater publicity through online and celebrity culture. In November last year, 21-year-old rapper Lil Peep died from an accidental overdose of Xanax and the painkiller Fentanyl in the US, where the former is widely prescribed. Charalambous’s constituent, Michaela, said her 14-year-old daughter had fallen in with “the wrong crowd” over the summer holidays and quickly spiralled downwards after using Xanax. She said: “It’s scarily easy to get hold of. When she was on Xanax she would act like she was really drunk, really dopey like a zombie, and then the next day she would be really aggressive and quite violent. “She’s looking for something to make her feel better. And these people introduced her to something that temporarily makes her feel better,” Michaela added. She warned that things can change quickly: “Her school reports were impeccable, and she’s gone from that, six months ago, to being expelled.” Professor Malcolm Lader, a clinical psychopharmacologist at King’s College London, said Xanax could be used as a date-rape or grooming drug due to its amnesia-inducing effects: “[Users] become zombie-like. They’re dazed. It’s an introductory drug to more serious abuse. If they’re taking it every day … they’re going to be staggering around.” Xanax is part of a wider class of drugs known as benzodiazepines, which are known to cause physical and psychological dependence. The drug interacts strongly with alcohol, greatly increasing the risk of overdose James first took Xanax aged 15, and said he “loved it”. He said: “Mixing Xanax with weed made me feel 10 times more drowsy than before. It gave me a confidence boost which was nice because before I suffered with anxiety. “Then, not realising the addictive side effects, I built up a tolerance and was taking around a bar [large pill] every couple of days. It was cheap [£5 a pill] and it was glamourised all over social media.” Some names have been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/13/glasgow-clydebank-cash-machine-blown-up-police-arrest-48-year-old-man","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T13:09:45Z","webTitle":"Police arrest man after Glasgow cash machine blown up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/glasgow-clydebank-cash-machine-blown-up-police-arrest-48-year-old-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/glasgow-clydebank-cash-machine-blown-up-police-arrest-48-year-old-man","fields":{"headline":"Police arrest man after Glasgow cash machine blown up","bodyText":"A man has been arrested after a cash machine was blown up in Glasgow. Police said on Saturday that a 48-year-old man was being held in custody in connection with the incident. It happened on Thursday night outside a row of shops on Glasgow Road in Clydebank. A 51-year-old man who was found at the scene remains in a critical condition at Queen Elizabeth University hospital. A spokesman for Police Scotland said a report would be submitted to the procurator fiscal. In October thieves blew up a cash machine in a kiosk outside a Matalan store in Darlington. The explosion shook homes more than two miles away and sent debris, including anti-ram raid bollards, flying across the car park. The thieves escaped with an unspecified amount of cash from the machine. Last April, a gang of seven men who caused explosions at cash machines around England and Scotland were jailed for a total of 92 years.

Donegan wrote an eloquent essay in New York magazine’s The Cut explaining why she created it. Donegan’s initiative was criticized, with many fixated on ethical questions and her method. Others argued that such a spreadsheet could be easily compromised. What the criticisms of Donegan’s list have not presented, however, is a convincing argument as to why women should be satisfied with the official channels of complaint available to them. In many workplaces, reasons such as a fear of social or professional retaliation prevent women from reporting sexual harassment. According to human resources expert Laurie Reuttimann, HR departments have little interest in looking out for the interests of women reporting sexual misconduct. “At its core, HR exists to protect the company against employee-related risks,” Reuttimann wrote at Vox. Without effective mechanisms to report sexual misconduct and other forms of gender discrimination, women in different industries have turned to anonymous reporting, spreadsheets and online portals. Here are four examples of how women have used online portals to support and inform each other: Men in academia: tracking sexual mistreatment Karen Kelsky, a former anthropology professor in Eugene, Oregon, created academia’s version of the media men spreadsheet. Since launching last November, it has grown to include more than 2,000 anonymous accounts of harassment with details about universities and occasionally academic departments. It does not include harassers’ names. Like Donegan’s spreadsheet, however, it includes a wide range of behavior from non-consensual touching to rape. Kelsky told the Wall Street Journal she wanted to give people a sense of the scope of sexual harassment in academia. “I think plausible deniability has been eviscerated,” she said. The list of men in academia demonstrates that there can be multiple uses and goals for keeping such records. It can, for instance, encourage women to unionize to tackle this issue. In this case, it has put a focus on the institutions that turn a blind eye to harassment or encourage women to stay silent after they come forward. An Associated Press investigation found that often, professors leave their universities quietly or rumors swirl for years before anything is done. The Weinstein accusers Women who were sexually harassed and assaulted by Harvey Weinstein created a Google doc to detail their experiences. This provided a powerful record of how long the abuse went on for and how many women he targeted. Some entries were anonymous. This Google doc also had the effect of letting women know they weren’t alone, Zoë Brock, a model and writer, and one of the women who co-authored the spreadsheet, told the Guardian. “There is strength in numbers.” Harassment at the California state capitol Adama Iwu, a lobbyist for Visa, started a campaign called We Said Enough to expose harassment in the capitol. She started the campaign in October a week after being touched inappropriately at a political event. Iwu also set up a website for women to submit anonymous accounts of sexual harassment. “It is not the job of the victim to come forward and be further victimized, because we know that happens,” Iwu told CNN. Here’s just one account from the website from a woman who said a male legislator routinely made inappropriate advances toward her: ‘One time at a reception he was visibly intoxicated, he approached me and commented on my “sexy” legs and offered me a job in his office if I was “nice.”’ Iwu co-wrote a letter signed by more than 140 women, some of whom were lawmakers, Capitol staffers, and lobbyists, called out the pervasive mistreatment of women at the state capitol and encouraged women to share stories on WeSaidEnough.com. Spreadsheet on Google pay gaps In 2015, Erica Baker, then a Google employee, started a shareable spreadsheet to track salaries and pay disparities after conversations about salaries with her coworkers. She circulated it on an internal social network account at Google. “It took off like wildfire,” Baker tweeted. “The world didn’t end. Everything didn’t go up in flames because salaries got shared. But shit got better for some people,” she also tweeted. When the New York Times obtained the spreadsheet, it found that at five of six job levels, women were paid less than their male counterparts. The gap widened for employees once they reached mid-career status. Google countered that the sample size was “extremely small” and doesn’t have information about location, tenure or performance. Google is facing a lawsuit from four women for its alleged pay disparities and it has long been under fire for its lack of gender and racial diversity. The Industry Ain’t Safe A Tumblr account, The Industry Ain’t Safe, publishes anonymous accounts of sexual harassment and assault against women in the music industry. “I believe women can reclaim power from this inarguably patriarchal industry and let their voices be heard – without jeopardizing their jobs or companies,” said the creator on her blog."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/12/sheffield-united-sheffield-wednesday-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T22:02:06Z","webTitle":"Sheffield United held to goalless draw by Wednesday in Steel City derby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/12/sheffield-united-sheffield-wednesday-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/12/sheffield-united-sheffield-wednesday-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Sheffield United held to goalless draw by Wednesday in Steel City derby","bodyText":"Jos Luhukay made a moderately successful start to his tenure at Sheffield Wednesday, with his struggling Owls side holding on for a 0-0 draw at their Steel City neighbours United, despite being reduced to 10 men midway through the second half. The former Stuttgart and Hertha Berlin manager was a surprise appointment as successor to Carlos Carvalhal and was handed the toughest possible start to his tenure – an away trip to Wednesday’s city rivals, who had left Hillsborough with a 4-2 win in September. Chris Wilder’s play-off chasing side, though, could not find a way past Joe Wildsmith in the Wednesday goal even after Glenn Loovens was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Both sides were indebted to their goalkeepers for superb saves to preserve the deadlock in the second half. After an even first half full of intensity but little incident United came close to taking the lead five minutes after the break. Clayton Donaldson’s looping header was arcing towards the top corner but Wildsmith somehow reached back to claw the effort over the bar. Loovens’ red card soon followed after a trip on Donaldson but Wednesday came closest to snatching victory in the closing stages. Ross Wallace’s deflected effort was superbly kept out by the Sheffield United goalkeeper, Simon Moore, and as 90 minutes approached Adam Reach’s dipping volley seemed set to give Luhukay a winning debut only for Moore, still groggy after running into a defender during the previous attack, to react to tip away once more. The point takes the Blades back into the play-off places, albeit temporarily, while Wednesday are now seven points clear of the relegation zone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/13/picnic-at-hanging-rock-remake-hypnotic-thriller-natalie-dormer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T22:01:09Z","webTitle":"Hypnotic thriller that haunted a nation inspires remakes for a new generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/picnic-at-hanging-rock-remake-hypnotic-thriller-natalie-dormer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/13/picnic-at-hanging-rock-remake-hypnotic-thriller-natalie-dormer","fields":{"headline":"Hypnotic thriller that haunted a nation inspires remakes for a new generation","bodyText":"In the searing heat of an Australian Valentine’s Day, a small party of schoolgirls set out for a local beauty spot, Hanging Rock. Some were never to return. The shocking incident, whether imagined or real, as some still believe, has haunted the national psyche ever since the publication of Joan Lindsay’s novel Picnic at Hanging Rock in 1967. Regarded as a key work of modern Australian literature, Lindsay’s hypnotic puzzle soon spawned a classic film version that was to beguile and disturb audiences around the world. Now the mystery at the heart of both the novel and Peter Weir’s award-winning film – the disappearance of three schoolgirls and a teacher from the fictional Appleyard College that hazy Valentine’s Day in 1900 – is to be looked at anew. An Australian television series starring British actress Natalie Dormer in the role of boarding school headmistress Hester Appleyard is re-telling the fable over six episodes and will be broadcast by the BBC later this year. And next month a hit stage version of the book from Melbourne opens at London’s Barbican theatre. Hailed by the Guardian’s critic as a show with “volcanic power” when it ran briefly in Edinburgh last year, director Matthew Lutton’s production updates the schoolgirls’ story and offers “a vision of psychological breakdown as a prettified illusion is ripped apart by the raw force of nature”. Lindsay’s story has attained the status of a modern myth, exploring the clash between Victorian gentility and the burgeoning sexuality of the schoolgirls. Writing the book in a fortnight at the age of 69, the author claimed to have been inspired by dreams, although a recent book by Janelle McCulloch found some grounds for supposing the young Lindsay might once have heard about a real case of girls going missing at the landmark in the southeastern state of Victoria. Seeds of the story are also thought to have been sown by a 1875 painting of visitors viewing Hanging Rock by William Ford. The BBC promises the new serialisation offers “a fresh take”, while its Australian producers describe their “re-imagining” as “modern, mysterious, completely gripping and visually spectacular”. Dormer’s role as the headmistress has been expanded for television: “In her novel, Joan Lindsay gives you hints there is a past and that Hester isn’t being completely honest about her background,” Dormer has said. “The delicious thing is that we have really fleshed out her morally ambiguous background in London.” The series has been directed for Foxtel by Walking Dead veteran Larysa Kondracki, whose Canadian nationality caused initial dismay in Australia. Actress Rachel Ward said the decision was “a bitter pill” for Australian directors. “It’s ultimately just sad that those of us who have committed so many years as Australian film-makers are thought so little of by some production teams and broadcasters here that we must import someone to do the job for us,” Ward said. When a 27-year-old Weir originally set out for Hanging Rock in February 1975 to shoot his film in six weeks, he wanted to recreate the “tremendous unease” he felt reading Lindsay’s novel.“I couldn’t wait to get to the rock to see if it was as good as it read,” he has said. The eerie end result, an effect achieved by placing layers of bridal veiling over the camera lens, was what the late Observer critic Philip French described as “the first true masterpiece of the Australian cinema”. In her book Beyond the Rock, McCulloch argues Picnic at Hanging Rock came at the right moment: “Australians were hungering for something that was quintessentially Australian. They wanted books and films that held up a mirror to the nation. It was perfect timing.” At the core of Lindsay’s tale is the riddle of the disappearance, a point underlined by a junior editor called Sandra Forbes, who read the book early on and suggested that a final chapter which provided a spiritual solution should be deleted. The author agreed, and the enduring appeal of her story may now lie in the unanswered question it poses. Only an old man in her novel finally attempts to account for what happened that day at the rock. “Nobody, can be held responsible for the pranks of destiny,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/13/nuclear-policy-review-war-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T15:36:25Z","webTitle":"Nuclear war became more likely this week | Robert Andersen and Martin J Sherwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/13/nuclear-policy-review-war-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/13/nuclear-policy-review-war-risk","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear war became more likely this week – here's why","bodyText":"Too bad the book flying off the shelves isn’t the other one about “fire and fury”, The Doomsday Machine, Daniel Ellsberg’s startling volume about his life as a nuclear war planner. It is as riveting as the Michael Wolff book and several orders of magnitude more terrifying. News that the Trump administration’s nuclear policy review loosens constraints on the use of nuclear weapons to improve US military capabilities is a case of déjà vu. It’s back to the hottest moments of the cold war and a reinforcement of the first principle of American nuclear policy – first-use – a policy of questionable value and certain immorality. As Gen James Cartwright, former vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Princeton University nuclear scholar Bruce Blair have pointed out, there is no situation where the US would benefit by initiating a nuclear war. “Our non-nuclear strength, including economic and diplomatic power, our alliances, our conventional and cyber weaponry and our technological advantages” are unmatched, they say, and more than sufficient to assure our security. In addition, two-thirds of the American public oppose first-use. So what is behind this Trump initiative? It is more likely than not the president’s troubled emotional need to maximize his “threat quotient”. The new nuclear policy review, the first in eight years, appears intended to do just that. Reports claim that it is designed to “send a clear deterrent message to Russians, the North Koreans and the Chinese”. This is one-size-fits-all nuclear thinking: “Fire and fury like the world has never seen.” It is another misguided and dangerous policy, as its critics have made clear. As Ellsberg, once a wunderkind denizen of the nether world (the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon) shows in detail, every president since Truman has promised to rain fire and fury on the adversary. He cites 25 instances when presidents furtively thought to issue nuclear ultimatums. Richard Nixon learned his nuclear “madman” statecraft from the master of brinksmanship, Dwight Eisenhower. Jimmy Carter very nearly brought us to a third world war thanks to the forward-deployed Pershings of PD (presidential directive) 59. Before his Reykjavik volte-face, Ronald Reagan threatened to lob one into the Kremlin. George W Bush was gung-ho to develop nuclear bunker busters for use against Iran. Even Barack Obama couldn’t come to relinquish that first-use “option”, notwithstanding his abhorrence of nuclear weapons. But nuclear deterrence is a fraud. It doesn’t prevent wars, it prevents nuclear wars (so far) that would not be possible if nuclear weapons were abolished. The deterrent arsenal’s real utility has been to provide our presidents with the opportunity to threaten nuclear war, and therefore it must always be promoted as plausible that the US uses nuclear weapons first. Even Obama’s pledge in 2009 to reduce the nuclear stockpile to zero was not matched by a pledge of no first-use. Moreover, the trillion dollar “modernization” of the strategic triad begun in earnest in 2010 gave ironic meaning to Obama saying in a major 2009 speech that while he would want to abolish nuclear weapons, it would likely not happen “in my lifetime”. Ellsberg shows how human extinction is integral to the nuclear design, and warns that the world has run out of time. A miracle got us through the 20th century alive, with the help of two Russians, heroes of humanity who didn’t push that nuclear button. Good luck in this century with the proliferation of desks with bigger buttons. Disarming and dismantling the Doomsday Machine has become a klaxon flashing red, but one look at this nuclear policy review tells us that the idea of fighting and winning a nuclear war is enjoying an encore in the Pentagon. The red lines this president has been crossing with impunity means the world is staring into the abyss. The Big Rocket Man is also seeking to increase his threat quotient and might even be wondering if he might use it. Thanks to this latest review, he has permission to move closer to that decision. “This is not a species to be trusted with nuclear weapons,” Ellsberg writes, presciently. Certainly, Donald Trump is not to be trusted with nuclear weapons. Neither is his doppelgänger in the Kremlin. Nor the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. Nor Little Rocket Man. Dr King’s “fierce urgency of now” never seemed more urgent than now. Thank Trump for letting the American people in on the dirty secret of nuclear weapons, for making that choice as graphic as it has ever been. The nuclear age has come full circle. But is anyone outside the Beltway paying attention?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/13/chinese-official-linked-to-cyanide-death-of-uk-businessman-is-in-jail-reports-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T03:51:21Z","webTitle":"Chinese official linked to cyanide death of UK businessman is in jail, reports say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/13/chinese-official-linked-to-cyanide-death-of-uk-businessman-is-in-jail-reports-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/13/chinese-official-linked-to-cyanide-death-of-uk-businessman-is-in-jail-reports-say","fields":{"headline":"Chinese official linked to cyanide death of UK businessman is in jail, reports say","bodyText":"The Communist party official who allegedly supplied the cyanide that killed British businessman Neil Heywood and helped unleash an epochal political earthquake in China is serving a 15-year sentence for corruption, a leading magazine has revealed. According to Caixin, Xia Zeliang, once a mid-ranking official in the south-western city of Chongqing, was tried and convicted on unrelated bribery charges in 2014 although his fate was not made public at the time. Xia, 56, is reportedly being held at a prison in the north-eastern province of Jilin and is due for release in 2027. Details of Xia’s jailing – for crimes that include taking 25 million yuan (£2.81m) in payoffs – are contained in recently released court documents unearthed by the magazine. More intriguingly, Caixin claimed the documents showed Xia had never been charged for his alleged role in the 2011 killing of 41-year-old Heywood, an internationally notorious crime that exposed the murky and murderous underbelly of contemporary Chinese politics. Heywood – a Beijing-based associate of one of China’s most powerful political dynasties, the family of party heavyweight Bo Xilai – was found dead in a Chongqing hotel room in November 2011. The following year, Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, was given a suspended death sentence for supposedly murdering him after he threatened to expose shady financial dealings. Authorities cremated Heywood’s body without a full autopsy in a bid to cover up the crime. Xia, who was close to the Bo family, immediately fell under suspicion. At Gu’s trial Caixin said he had admitted supplying her with the deadly chemical compound after she had asked him for it August 2011. “The cyanide was delivered hidden inside two red candles,” the magazine reported. Caixin said it was unclear whether Xia had known of Gu’s plan to poison Heywood. More than six years after Heywood’s murder, the scandal continues to shape politics in the world’s second largest economy. The disgrace of Bo Xilai and his family helped current leader Xi Jinping rid himself of one of his most formidable political rivals, just as he was preparing to take power in November 2012. Since then Xi has purged a string of powerful political foes, establishing himself as China’s most dominant ruler since its revolutionary founder, Mao Zedong. China’s state media now hails Xi as the country’s “unrivalled helmsman”.

It’s a miracle every morning when you wake up.” In MacGowan’s case, this oft-repeated spiritual mantra has a particular resonance. Having turned 60 on Christmas Day, he has defied the dire predictions of both doctors and concerned friends regarding his doggedly self-destructive lifestyle over the last four decades. In short, Shane MacGowan is alive and (relatively) well despite himself, despite the years of dissolution that began in his teens and continued apace through his years as a punk “face” in the late 1970s, the halcyon days of his London-Irish group, the Pogues, in the 1980s, and the long years since when his appetite for excess dulled both his songwriting skill and his ability to perform. What is also clear with each passing year, however, is that the great MacGowan songs endure, from the bruised romanticism of A Pair of Brown Eyes to the brutal realism of The Old Main Drag, his evocation of life among the teenage rent boys that once haunted Piccadilly Circus by night. Not only that, but they possess a visceral authenticity that belongs to a time before the onset of cultural gentrification, when rock music was peopled with outsiders and misfits. As one of them, MacGowan wrote with acuity about the lives of London’s human flotsam and jetsam. “His songs, even though they are hard-edged, always have empathy for the characters in them,” says Bobby Gillespie, lead singer of Primal Scream. “He has a brutal eye for detail and he can tell a story in a concise but almost cinematic way using these amazing images that just hit you in the heart with their tenderness and emotion.” On Monday evening, in celebration of MacGowan’s 60th birthday and, by extension, his miraculous powers of survival, a host of fellow performers including Gillespie, Nick Cave and Cerys Matthews will grace the stage of the National Concert Hall in Dublin to sing his songs backed by a band that will include a few ex-Pogues as well as the Hollywood actor Johnny Depp on guitar. Like Cave, Depp is a close friend of MacGowan’s who directed and appeared in the video for That Woman’s Got Me Drinking, and considers Shane “... a special being and one of the most important poets of the 20th century”. According to MacGowan’s longtime partner, Victoria Mary Clarke, other surprises are planned for the concert, but even had Bob Dylan been able to make it (he had a prior engagement), nothing will be more eagerly awaited than the sight of MacGowan himself appearing onstage to deliver his singular songs in his inimitable way. “Shane always seems to be channelling something when he sings,” says Cave. “Some kind of energy that exists beyond himself. I saw him at a soundcheck at a festival in France, and he walked up to the mike and stood with his hands in his pockets and sang A Pair Of Brown Eyes, and for the few of us that were there time stood still. There was so much emotional power coming out of him, without him doing a fucking thing, that you had to question your ideas of divinity.” Five hours later, though, MacGowan was unfit to perform. “That is the other side of him, of course,” says Cave. “But we love that too.” It has been a while since MacGowan played a live gig, having been wheelchair-bound, on and off, since a heavy fall badly damaged his back a few years ago. “I’m concentrating on my health at the minute,” he told O’Callaghan, and to this end he has given up spirits and now only drinks wine. This is progress of a sort, given his marathon aversion to what he considered the curse of sobriety. “Why should I hold back?” he retorted, when I expressed concern about the extent of his self-destructive lifestyle way back in 1989. “I mean, I’ve got one life to live. It’s my choice to die when I want to.” As the years went by, however, and several of his acquaintances did in fact die from alcohol and drugs, it seemed almost inevitable that MacGowan would follow suit, particularly when he began to attract the perhaps inevitable coterie of equally dissolute hangers-on that gravitate like ambulance chasers to the famously self-destructive. On YouTube you can view a few interviews with him in the 90s in which he seems barely able to speak, never mind answer questions. But like Keith Richards and Iggy Pop before him, MacGowan has proved himself to be one of the great rock’n’roll survivors – bruised, bloody but unbowed, as he enters his seventh decade. I first crossed paths with him when he was working in a record shop called Rocks Off in central London in 1976. If memory serves me well, he insisted I buy the debut single of a group I had never heard of: New Rose by the Damned. Unbeknown to me at the time, it was the first British punk record. As I later realised, MacGowan was one of the early faces on the London punk scene. As a wired 19-year-old, he was captured for posterity dancing furiously in a Union Jack jacket on the floor of the fabled Roxy Club in Covent Garden. “I was happy during punk, incredibly happy,” he told me wistfully a decade later. “I didn’t regard it as chaos; to me it was natural living.” In 1981 his post-punk band the Nips released a single called Gabrielle, its swagger and edgy romantic lyricism the earliest intimation of what was to follow. Then, sometime in 1984, I witnessed the Pogues, then still called Pogue Mahone (the Irish for “kiss my arse”) in a Brixton bar. Apart from the female bass player, Cait O’Riordan, who exuded icily cool punk attitude in spades, there was nothing remotely glamorous about them. I described them back then as “a motley bunch of Anglo-Irish swiggers with attitude, kitted out in secondhand suits their grandfathers might have worn, playing songs their Irish aunts and uncles sang at weddings, parties, anywhere”. Once I had gotten over the shock of hearing old-fashioned Irish ballads like The Auld Triangle and Poor Paddy being given a good kicking, I began to take in MacGowan’s originals – raw and rowdy punk-fuelled songs like Transmetropolitan and The Boys from the County Hell. To me, and thousands like me, they seemed both old and new, familiar and disorientating. They were immigrant songs: London-Irish rather than purely Irish, as dependent for their visceral insider reportage on the primal influence of the Sex Pistols as on the Dubliners. Back then, MacGowan often evoked a rural, pre-Celtic Tiger Ireland that was already disappearing, but his lyrics spoke to me even more directly of the life I lived back then – the crappy jobs, the dole queue, the casual racism, but also the more illicitly exciting London of semi-legal squats, cheap gigs, and all-night shebeens and dive bars. Like the plays of Martin McDonagh, who cites the Pogues as a formative influence, MacGowan’s songs arose out of his lived experience of both rural Ireland and inner-city London. Thus, unashamedly romantic descriptions of home often merge with images of urban alienation, oppression and violence. He was an outsider in England from the moment he arrived as a youngster plucked from rural Tipperary on a scholarship to Westminster School. Constantly bullied for his looks and accent, he spent long hours, he later told me, wandering alone in Soho, a curious teenager drawn to the seedy undertow of those pre-gentrified streets where the lure of peep shows and strip joints still held sway. All he experienced, saw and overheard somehow lodged in his brain, and came out again, transformed, in the songs he wrote on the scraps of paper that littered his flat in King’s Cross alongside the empty bottles and scattered records. One of those songs, of course, has since entered the public consciousness in the most surprising way. The epic and brutally romantic sway of Fairytale of New York has become the festive song for those of us who can’t abide festive songs, and no amount of annual over-exposure can dull the achingly regretful sway of the couplet he trades with the late Kirsty MacColl – “I could have been someone/ Well, so could anyone.” “I regard Shane as easily the best lyric writer of our generation,” says Nick Cave. “He has a very natural, unadorned, crystalline way with language. There is a compassion in his words that is always tender, often brutal, and completely his own.” Whatever the ragged contours of Shane MacGowan’s epically unruly life, it is his tender and brutal songs that will live on after he, and those of us who had the good fortune to experience him in full creative flow, are long gone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/12/bath-scarlets-european-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T21:57:12Z","webTitle":"Tadhg Beirne powers Scarlets to verge of last eight in masterclass at Bath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/12/bath-scarlets-european-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/12/bath-scarlets-european-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tadhg Beirne powers Scarlets to verge of last eight in masterclass at Bath","bodyText":"The Scarlets so exposed Bath they turned them crimson. As the England head coach, Eddie Jones, sat in the stand, he kept covering his head with his coat and bobble hat. If he were feeling the cold, the chill of one of his clubs being exposed by opponents who were far quicker in the head and foot numbed him. The Welsh region secured a bonus-point victory to replace Bath at the top of the group. They will make the quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years if they defeat Toulon in Llanelli next weekend. The French side will go first if they defeat Treviso on Sunday. The Scarlets’ final game will decide the group winners leaving Bath, who at one point trailed 29-3, playing for second place, although they will probably need the Scarlets to lose and not secure a bonus point while they indulge themselves in Treviso. Bath had been the one English team who looked like remaining in Europe but they were ripped apart by last season’s Pro 12 winners. Bath had been comfortable against the predictable might and aggression of Toulon in the previous round but the Scarlets’ constant off-loading and running from deep unnerved the home side because it exposed them to a style of rugby they had rarely encountered. They were hampered by the early loss of their match-winner in Llanelli last October, Rhys Priestland, with a hamstring strain, but this did not swing the game. Bath, the full-back Anthony Watson apart, craved structure rather than the potential of open spaces. Rhys Patchell played at full-back instead of the injured Leigh Halfpenny and gave his side an attacking dimension they may otherwise have lacked in the position. From the 11th minute, when Patchell took a Chris Cook box-kick on his 22 and set off on a run, the Scarlets so widened the point of attack that they neutralised Bath’s fringe defence and drew them into a high-tempo game that created and exploited space. The instinct of Patchell, an outside-half, was to run and, as he fell to ground after being half-tackled, he off-loaded to David Bulbring. The second-row did not seek contact but passed to Hadleigh Parkes outside him and the Scarlets were away, interpassing with abandon. When Aaron Shingler kept the move going with a one-handed pass, the lock Tadhg Beirne finished it off by sidestepping Watson. Bath eventually mounted a response when Matt Banahan ran through Dan Jones and John Barclay flopped offside at a ruck near his line to ensure a try was not scored, only a Freddie Burns penalty. It earned the Scarlets’ No8 a stint in the sin-bin but while he was there his side scored two tries that summed up the difference between the sides. Shingler was again involved as the Scarlets, who made 16 offloads in the first period to Bath’s three, two of which handed over possession, turned defence into attack for Paul Asquith to score on the right wing and it was Shingler’s line-out take and feed to Gareth Davies that set up the third for Hadleigh Parkes. Bath ball-watched as their opponents outmanoeuvred them to go into the interval 22-3 ahead with a Dan Jones penalty. Bath, who started the night as the lowest try-scorers in the Champions Cup with seven, needed a fast start on resumption but, when Scott Williams secured the visitors’ try bonus point by collecting Patchell’s deft chip, the match was over as a contest. Bath did score tries through Banahan and Zach Mercer but two more Jones penalties made even a losing bonus point elusive. “We knew what to expect and the performance was inexcusable,” said the Bath’s director of rugby, Todd Blackadder. “We played into their hands and, with qualification now a remote prospect, we have internal issues to address.” Bath Watson; Banahan, Joseph, Tapuai, Brew; Priestland (Burns, 3), Cook (Fotuali’l, 52); Obano (Noguera Paz, 59), Dunn, Thomas, Stooke (Grant, 67), Charteris (Phillips, 59), Garvey (capt), Underhill, Mercer.

The annual event in the windswept Dutch North Sea village is the Wimbledon of chess, the most illustrious annual contest on the calendar. The top first-round pairing is Carlsen v Fabiano Caruana – the world No1 against the world No2. Gawain Jones, the British champion, plays Russia’s Sergey Karjakin, the 2016 world title challenger. Carlsen’s current drought seemed unlikely back in 2016 when he won Wijk, Stavanger and Bilbao in the first seven months of the year. But in 2017, although he was supreme in speed chess, he failed to capture first prize at classical all-play-alls in Wijk, Stuttgart, Stavanger, St Louis or London. He was only ninth of 10 on home ground in Stavanger. At 27 the Norwegian should be at the height of his powers and he will be conscious that a poor 2017 has tarnished his historic legend in comparison with Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer. Victory at Wijk, where six of the global top 11 are competing, would be a boost. It will be interesting to see if Hou Yifan, the No1 woman, can continue her steady improvement in elite events. The 23-year-old from Beijing aims to reach a new playing peak this year before she starts her Rhodes scholarship education degree at Oxford in October. Jones, 30, is another for whom Wijk could be a make-or-break event. He has faced elite GMs before in the London Classic but 13 rounds where he is the lowest rated competitor is something else and Carlsen &amp; Co will regard their game against him as a must-win. Jones, for his part, has prepared in depth and sees Wijk as the opportunity of his life. When Carlsen defeated Hikaru Nakamura 18-9 in their chess.com speed final, the significant statistic was that the No1 won 7.5-2.5, including a run of five straight wins, at one-minute bullet, a niche where the American has been regarded as invincible. Carlsen did it in style, too, as this game shows: Magnus Carlsen v Hikaru Nakamura, chess.com bullet 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 Bb5+ Bd7 4 Bxd7+ Nxd7 5 O-O Ngf6 6 d3 e6 7 Ng5 Be7 8 f4 O-O 9 c4 Nb8 10 Nc3 Nc6 11 Be3 d5 12 Bf2 h6 13 Nf3 dxe4 14 dxe4 e5 15 f5 Re8 16 Re1 Nd4 17 Nxe5 Bd6 18 Nf3 Ng4 19 h3 Nxf2 20 Kxf2 Qb6 21 b3 Nxf3 22 Qxf3 Be5 23 Nd5 Qa5 24 Rad1 Qxa2+ 25 Re2 Qa5 26 f6 Re6 27 fxg7 Rae8 28 Kg1 Rg6 29 Rf1 Rxg7 30 Kh1 Qd8 31 Qe3 Qd6 32 Rf5 Qg6 33 Qf3 Re6 34 Rd2 Kh7 35 Rxe5! 1-0 3529 1 Qh6+ Kg8 2 Re4!

If you believe you can ban your way to victory by mounting heresy hunts against all who veer from the true faith, you will not only deserve to lose by some airy moral reckoning. You will lose whether you deserve to or not. As losing is no longer a trivial event in the age of Brexit and Trump, it is worth understanding the consequences of going beyond the old liberal principle that only demagogues who incite violence should be banned. The moral arguments against censorship are so old I can recite them in my sleep. The practical case against a “liberal” movement that reaches for the censor’s red pen like a drunk reaching for a bottle deserves more attention. People who call themselves progressives don’t worry enough about unintended consequences because they lack the broadness of mind to see themselves as others see them. They see no reason to treasure free debate. No argument will persuade Donald Trump or Nigel Farage to hold up their hands and admit they are wrong. Their dedicated supporters, meanwhile, are no more likely to change their minds than fanatical believers in any other political ideology or religious creed. These are good points that are beside the point, because they are based on a deep ignorance of how debates work. You don’t argue to convert your opponents. You argue to persuade the undecided audience watching on in silence, as it judges which side is worthy of support. I doubt that waverers nod their heads in approval when universities, of all places, do not allow speakers to appear on platforms, or when the state capitalists of Virgin Rail refuse to stock the Daily Mail. Look at them, and maybe look at yourself too. It’s not a compelling sight. For all their bombast, censors give every appearance of being dictatorial neurotics, who are so frightened of their opponents that they cannot find the strength to take them on in the open. I can’t imagine many saying, “I’ll side with the people who tell me what I can and can’t think.” I find it equally hard to picture readers turning away from the Mail because Sir Richard Branson and “alternative” comedians who haven’t had an alternative thought since Blair’s second term tell them to. “Liberals” still do not understand that when they censor they are falling into their enemy’s trap. The alt-right is as much a satirical as a political movement: more South Park than The West Wing. It is at its happiest trolling liberal culture rather than governing, which is why Brexit and the Trump administration are so shambolic. The alt-right wants to and needs to provoke liberals into showing they are repressive, so it cast itself in the role of transgressive rebel. Why play the part it has allotted you? We are in a contradictory culture. On the one hand, “liberals” rightly say that sexists, racists and homophobes are preposterous bigots. On the other, they run away from the chance to confront them. If you can’t beat a bigot in argument, you shouldn’t ban them but step aside and make way for people who can. It’s not as if they have impressive cases that stand up to scrutiny. As pertinently for those wondering how a pornographic thug like Trump or such transparent charlatans as Johnson and Farage can win, if you don’t debate them, you will never learn how to defeat them. You won’t feel the ripple in the audience as you make a good case or telling jibe. You won’t learn which shots hit home and which miss the mark. When the battle is finally joined, you will enter it unarmed, then look around in bewilderment when you are defeated. In the hours after Trump’s victory, the American author Walter Mosley said Democrats had put on “the blinders of superiority” when they assumed he must surely lose. There is no more effective way for the superior to blind themselves to the world around them than by refusing to argue with it. Again, I am not making a moral point – we can save John Milton and George Orwell for another day. As a matter of practical politics, you had better be very sure that you will win before pandering to inquisitorial desires. So much of what passes for “liberal” debate just assumes that liberals have already won and possess the power to decide what is read and said. They don’t fret that reactionaries in office will use the arguments in favour of censorship that liberals have nurtured to restrict their freedom to speak. Nor do they question whether their repression will work. Harvard’s Stephen Pinker recently listed true but “politically incorrect” assertions that have driven American students rightwards when they discovered US campuses rarely discuss them. His unpalatable propositions included: capitalism is preferable to communism – no one would prefer to live in North rather than South Korea, after all; most of the world’s suicide terrorists are Islamists; and different ethnic groups commit violent crime at different rates. Pinker said that if only universities had the courage to face awkward facts they could make perfectly good rejoinders against the apparent justifications for racism and anarcho-capitalism. The most successful capitalist societies have strong welfare states rather than unregulated markets, for instance. Most American terrorists are white supremacists. Ethnicity isn’t destiny and the propensity of a group to commit crimes changes over time. Inevitably, creepy American leftists cut his explanation out when they edited a video of his talk to present him as a fascist. They should have thought harder about the failure of US campuses to impose their taboos in a setting where liberals have power. It is a warning that authoritarian liberalism is an impossible project. Let’s try a thought experiment. Even if you were to suppress the rightwing press and rightwing social media, as so many “liberals” appear to want to do, you would not ban rightwing ideas, merely win them more converts by investing them with a dissident glamour. What’s next? Vet candidates for office to make sure they conform to your desires? Stop your opponents voting? The motivation behind much modern censorship is essentially religious: an affirmation of the urge to parade your righteousness. It is an egocentric and frivolous emotion to indulge at a time when the stakes could not be higher, and every opponent of the populist status quo ought to be concentrating on winning converts rather than driving them into the arms of their grateful opponents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/gay-peoples-sex-lives-none-of-tim-farron-business","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T00:04:12Z","webTitle":"Gay people’s sex lives are none of Farron’s business | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/gay-peoples-sex-lives-none-of-tim-farron-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/gay-peoples-sex-lives-none-of-tim-farron-business","fields":{"headline":"Gay people’s sex lives are none of Farron’s business","bodyText":"Tim Farron has said that he now regrets saying that gay sex wasn’t a sin, when he was Liberal Democrat leader during the last general election campaign. Speaking to Premier Christian Radio, Farron, an evangelical Christian, said that he’d felt pressured to make the statement. Vince Cable and other Liberal Democrats have since criticised Farron, while gay activists asked why he was allowed to return to the Lib Dem frontbench. Farron has become an embarrassment, not just to LGBT people, but to his party and modern-thinking Christians. It’s significant that, even now, Farron only wishes that he hadn’t said that gay sex wasn’t a sin. He’s not “coming out”, as it were, to say that he thinks that gay sex is a sin. Elsewhere, his view that he’s being persecuted for his Christian beliefs seems somewhat disingenuous. All political leaders end up being asked about LGBT issues. Farron also claims that he would never have been allowed to explain himself properly – when media outlets were falling over themselves to run an article from him and sections of the LGBT media repeatedly offered him a platform. In truth, Farron wasn’t being persecuted, scapegoated or muzzled. He was being treated like any other leader – his unease was because he knew that what he had to say would prove disastrous. This is all beyond disappointing for someone like myself, who joined the Liberal Democrats just before the last general election. I don’t regret it – I still appreciate the party remaining staunchly pro-Remain, unlike increasingly pathetic two-faced Labour. I’d also argue that Farron’s political clumsiness in handling the situation was a point in his favour – I know we live in increasingly cynical times, but it has to be better when a politician isn’t a really smooth liar. However, the situation with Farron has become as confusing as it is disgraceful, up to and including the fact that he has supported pro-LGBT legislation in the past. Does this make Farron a hypocrite (bad), someone who’s able to put civil rights ahead of his personal views (good) or just completely confused as to what “gay” means? Indeed, in a wider sense, this becomes not just about Farron, but about people such as Farron, evangelically Christian or otherwise, who believe that they have the right to hold such bizarre, dated, judgmental attitudes towards someone else’s sexuality. It raises the question: when are heterosexuals going to accept that what gay people get up to, sexually, is none of their business? You’d think that, in 2018, this wouldn’t even be up for discussion, but still some people seem to feel that they have the right to dictate what homosexuals are allowed to do. In truth, within the confines of the law, it’s no one’s business what LGBT people do and, therefore, no need for either prurient handwringing or agonised ethical contortions. This is where it starts looking a little weird that Farron voted for pro-LGBT legislation – it could be construed as a squeamish attempt to separate gay people from their sexual practices. Similarly, it’s no use saying that gay people are OK, but gay sex isn’t, because that says that the only good gay person is a celibate one. Some sections of society still can’t accept that gay people engage in sex, so they turn it into a sexless/civic/domestic deal, because that’s all they can handle. And when they can’t handle it, they call gay sex “disgusting” and “unnatural”… or they get into media tangles over whether or not gay sex is a sin. People such as Farron need to accept that “gay” usually means “gay sex” and get over it. The good news is that there’s nothing to worry about, because it’s none of their damn business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/13/private-public-sector-history-tangled-relationship","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T16:00:02Z","webTitle":"When private meets public sector: the history of a tangled relationship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/13/private-public-sector-history-tangled-relationship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/13/private-public-sector-history-tangled-relationship","fields":{"headline":"When private meets public sector: the history of a tangled relationship","bodyText":"Interaction between the private and public sectors can be a politically charged process in the UK, not least when the contracts that underpin such a partnership go wrong. Here are some recent examples of cooperation between public bodies and private companies that have caused controversy. Scottish schools A private finance contract to build a series of Edinburgh schools became a costly embarrassment after the new buildings were found to be faulty and one partly fell down. A report into the deal found that the contractors had used substandard concrete to build the schools, all of which were considered unsafe and in need of substantial repair. But a review by the council found that the financing behind the Edinburgh Schools Partnership (ESP) was not to blame. ESP is a private finance initiative (PFI), a popular form of funding for projects whereby a company pays the upfront construction cost and is then paid back over time by the government, which effectively pays the constructor to lease the property. However, the review did say there were aspects of the way in which the PFI methodology was implemented that “increased the risk of poor quality design and construction”. Virgin Health Private firms scooped almost 70% of the 386 contracts to run clinical health services put out to tender in England during 2016-17. They included the seven highest-value contracts, worth £2.43bn between them, and 13 of the 20 most lucrative tenders. Last year, Virgin Care, owned by Richard Branson sued six clinical trusts after it lost an £82m bid. It secured an out-of-court settlement. It also went on to win £1bn worth of contracts. London Underground PPI A series of public-private partnerships (PPPs) were signed by the last Labour government in 2002 and 2003 to upgrade and carry out maintenance on London’s tube network. Described at the time by then tube boss Bob Kiley as “fatally flawed”, by 2010 the process had unravelled. In exchange for carrying out complex work on an ailing network, the businesses behind the contracts would receive a monthly payment that would increase or decrease depending on whether they hit targets for measures such as train cleanliness and reliability of services. The process became mired in endless rows over costs; the biggest contractor, Metronet, eventually went bust and the other, Tube Lines, was bought out. East coast rail For the second time in a decade, the secretary of state for transport has been forced to bail out a private rail company running the vital east coast mainline. In 2009, the then Labour government took the line under public control after its private operator, National Express, couldn’t pay out the £1.4bn promised under the contract. The previous holder of the franchise, GNER, had already been stripped of the route after its US parent firm was struck by financial troubles. Last year, the government waived the majority of payments due under Stagecoach’s £3.3bn contract to run the London to Edinburgh route. Whenever the merits of rail privatisation are debated, the east coast line is a key argument for those in favour of nationalisation. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/james-haskell-wasps-england-life-on-a-plate","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"James Haskell: ‘When I came to Wasps, I was eating six meals a day.

I remember being taken for my fifth or maybe my fourth birthday to the Pizza Hut. I hated school food. I love fish now but I just hated it then. And strawberry custard, something you never see except in educational establishments. I was consuming the most food when I came to Wasps. I was eating six meals a day – 250-300g of protein, 300g of carbs, 250g of veg, six times every day. It was extensive, horrific. And tedious. We would cook while having breakfast – the chicken poached by my mum, me eating and cooking fish in the oven, my dad making potatoes. And it wasn’t creative cooking – poaching all that chicken was as dull as dishwater. I got bored of eating. Just chewing, thinking, “When is this portion going to end?” I wake up dead hungry. I have my five egg whites in the morning, a nut butter with my porridge, a probiotic drink and then a protein shake and coffee for the car journey into work. In a biology lesson, when I was 15, there was a pig’s heart to dissect and the teacher left the room and, being the classic idiot, I accepted bets on whether I’d bite out a piece of heart. I wrote down everybody’s name - he’ll give me £3, he’ll give me £5, etc. – and I ate the pig’s heart raw and obviously it was horrific but the cash kept me in Domino’s pizza for about three weeks. When I was playing in France, once, when we were warming up, one player turned up with a folding table and another with three or four shopping bags and set up beside the pitch, put a white tablecloth down on it and I thought, “The training’s about to start, they’ve put two bottles of red wine down on a white cloth and some foie gras and saucisson and are offering around wine and bread, what’s going on?” It was a petite dégustation. After a while, their boys put out their cigarettes and ran on and trained. This was a professional club so that was pretty amazing. The nutritional advice I got in France was “eat more fromage blanc”, their white yogurt. It was their key advice: “Manger plus de fromage blanc.” When I played in Japan, I ended up eating cod sperm. It tasted as you imagine – salty hell – so I won’t be ordering that again. But I’m a big foodie, so I don’t mind. My mother’s always taught me from a young age to try any food once. That if it looks shit it doesn’t mean it is. I can’t have cinema popcorn because it’s all full of sugar, unfortunately. Well, I do have it and I don’t have it. I love movie night and there’s lots of healthy brands of popcorn nowadays, so it’s good as a snack. I wouldn’t say who isn’t eating well on my team, but all you have to do is look at our line-up and see what their shapes are. There are a couple of blokes who have unbelievable genetics and there are those who eat fast food all the time and stay in incredible shape. And there’s a couple of lads the size of houses who don’t retain their weight doing the type of exercise I do. If you’re eating badly those exercises are a physical impossibility. On the away trip there’s always a guy who turns up with a big bag of sweets. He’s in good shape, but he’s an enabler. My favourite things Food Indian. Or sausage and mash.

Don’t ask Burberry. Fifteen years ago, it had the bright idea of selling affordable “gateway” pieces covered in its iconic check, only for the “wrong” sort of people to buy it, turning it mass, and supposedly alienating the label’s core customer base. Still fashion has mouths to feed. And it could do worse than look to Gucci, possibly the most referenced label in modern fashion, which has launched a restaurant, posing a newer, more urgent question: is Gucci’s tortellini the new furry loafer? This week saw the opening in Florence of the Gucci Osteria, an experiential restaurant overseen by three-Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura, and housed within its misnomered Gucci Garden, a new six-room concept store (not garden) a stone’s throw from the Uffizi Gallery. Here you can eat Gucci tortellini in parmesan sauce (€20), Gucci taka buns filled with pork belly and lacquered with balsamic and miso (€15), or Gucci tongue (€25). If you are homesick, try the Gucci scampi (€30). If you are skint, a side of sautéed Gucci spinach for sir (€10), or Gucci cappuccino with logo’d sugarcubes for the lady. While you can’t really take the food away, you can Instagram it, on pretty Gucci plates, which you can also buy afterwards, in the shop. No dish costs more than €30, which is pennies in Gucci currency. Commercially, this is brilliant, because it is comparatively affordable. Harvard Business School calls these potential customers brand tourists – someone who values the brand, dips their toe in once, but doesn’t pretend to be part of the club. And since brands such as Gucci have made a success by having their fingers in the millennial pie, rolling out something as social media friendly as food is smart. But is it gimmick or genius? Bottura is one of Italy’s most Italian chefs, a maverick, inspired by Thelonious Monk and a friend of Gucci CD, Alessandro Michele. Since you can only eat Gucci’s food in the Gucci Garden and only buy its plates in Florence, it is probably a bit of both. Because fashion people do, on occasion, eat.

His diabetic father died when Stan was 11, leaving the family dependent on “the parish” for financial support. Stan’s own health as a child was not good, and he spent almost a year in hospital at the age of 13. Despite everything, he passed his 11-plus exam and went to Robert Richardson grammar school in Ryhope, where he excelled, before gaining a scholarship to Imperial College London to study mathematics. He graduated there with a first-class degree in 1952 and went on to national service in Germany. In 1953, in the middle of his military duty, he married his childhood sweetheart, Olga (nee Penman), whom he had originally met at a Scout dance. She worked on collating data in the market research department at Proctor and Gamble in Newcastle, but once they got married they moved to Thornliebank in Glasgow, where in 1953 Stan took up his position as a statistician with J&amp;P Coats, a job that required the use of early computing systems. The firm (now Coats) was a multinational company with thread and dye works in many countries. Stan’s expertise in colour measurement and dye recipe prediction meant he was required to undertake extensive foreign travel. He wrote and co-authored research papers and was awarded the Worshipful Company of Dyers’ Research Medal in 1971. In addition, he became treasurer of the Scottish Royal Statistical Society. After retirement Stan pursued a broad range of interests, including supporting Sunderland football club and spending more time with his grandchildren. A Guardian reader all his life, he particularly enjoyed doing the prize crossword. Araucaria (John Graham) was his favourite setter and he commissioned him to compose a personalised crossword to celebrate Olga’s 80th birthday. It was suitably difficult.

Former actress Rose McGowan, whose harrowing stories about Harvey Weinstein did much to get the ball rolling, called attention to this on Tuesday when she criticized Time’s Up – a legal defense fund set up by 300 prominent Hollywood women to help workers across the country deal with sexual harassment – for holding a set of events at the offices of Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood’s largest talent agencies. “Who do you think is behind this ‘great’ pr?” she tweeted. “Why, it’s the company of pimps that sent so many into a the Monster’s Lair themselves. CAA. #TIMESUP fakes.” As Vanity Fair and others have documented, agencies like CAA, ICM and others failed for years to protect their clients from a man whose predatory behavior was an open secret in Hollywood. (The agencies deny any knowledge that this was going on; McGowan seems to think differently.) While their hearts are clearly in the right place, the people running Time’s Up might want to think twice before aligning themselves so closely with companies hoping to buy their way out of any lingering, Weinstein-derived PR problems. (The sufficiency of Time’s Up chosen tactics – charity and lawsuits – are also up for debate.) But even would-be corporate allies who have not played a role in protecting harassers can be problematic bedfellows for grassroots movements. As the Washington Post reports, a number of startups are seeking to cash in on the rising demand for a harassment-free workplace, by tackling the problem in a management-friendly way. Businesses like Tequitable, AllVoices, and Bravely help companies, as Neil Hooper of StopIt put it, “get ahead of these issues before they become claims”. A number of these apps seek to work around people’s completely justified fear of retaliation when signing their names to reports of harassment, bias or abuse. But while mitigating workplace harassment is a net plus (even if companies are only doing it to save money), this approach carries some downsides. One of the most exciting things about #MeToo has been the possibility that workers might channel all this bottled-up rage into collective struggle against not just a few bad apples but the patriarchy writ large – as well as its good friends white supremacy and capitalism. To cite just one example, writer and organizer Alex Press notes that sexual harassment was a major rallying point in her efforts to organize graduate students. Even the male students cared. By convincing workers to deal with harassment on an individual basis, these businesses suck the wind out of our sails, removing a compelling fulcrum point from efforts to agitate for our rights in a collective, comprehensive and effective way. Why address just one issue by yourself when you could address every issue with help from tons of other people? That’s just math. For 99% of women and gender non-binary people, sexual harassment is just one part of a whole Venn diagram of oppression that can involve race, gender, sexuality, and of course, the exploitative relationship between workers and employers upon which our very economic system is built. Let entrepreneurs do their watered-down thing, but let’s not forget that the real solution lies within all of us – but only if we work together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/11/number-of-britons-applying-for-french-citizenship-rises-tenfold-in-three-years","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Number of Britons applying for French citizenship rises tenfold in three years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/11/number-of-britons-applying-for-french-citizenship-rises-tenfold-in-three-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/11/number-of-britons-applying-for-french-citizenship-rises-tenfold-in-three-years","fields":{"headline":"Number of Britons applying for French citizenship rises tenfold in three years","bodyText":"The number of British nationals applying for French citizenship has increased nearly tenfold in three years, France’s interior ministry has said. The ministry said 386 Britons filed applications to become French in 2015, rising to 1,363 in 2016 – the year of the Brexit referendum – and to 3,173 in 2017. Over the same period, the number of UK nationals obtaining French citizenship increased from 320 to 1,518. Le Figaro newspaper said many applicants were motivated by considerations such as avoiding queues at airports, the Channel tunnel and Eurostar terminals or a desire to secure rights to healthcare and social benefits after the UK leaves the EU. But Fiona Mougenot, a British woman who runs an immigration consultancy in France, said she was handling more than 20 naturalisation applications filed in 2017, many prompted more by a wish to retain European citizenship than to minimise potential bureaucratic issues. “Practical matters are important for our clients, of course,” Mougenot told the paper. “But for most, the primary motivation is to stay European. Many could not vote in the referendum, are horrified by the prospect of Brexit and feel betrayed. France is vital to them because their lives are here, but beyond France it’s Europe they don’t want to abandon.” The Guardian reported in October that at least 17,000 Britons had sought the citizenship of another EU member state in the year following the Brexit vote, with responses to requests from 20 London-based EU embassies and interior ministries showing the most popular was Ireland, up 1025% to almost 9,000 applications. While almost all countries that provided figures recorded a significant increase, citizenship applications from British nationals increased nearly eightfold in Italy, fivefold in Germany, and doubled or trebled in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Austria."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/10/north-korea-trump-open-talks-maximum-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T22:00:13Z","webTitle":"North Korea: Trump promises 'peace through strength' and denies strike plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/north-korea-trump-open-talks-maximum-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/north-korea-trump-open-talks-maximum-pressure","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: Trump promises 'peace through strength' and denies strike plan","bodyText":"Donald Trump has promised “peace through strength” on the Korean peninsula, reportedly telling his South Korean counterpart that no US military action against Pyongyang is being contemplated while diplomacy is under way. In a phone call with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, on Wednesday, Trump expressed his openness to talks with North Korea “at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances” according to a short White House account of the meeting, which gave no further details. The Trump administration has previously sent mixed signals on its preconditions before beginning a dialogue with the regime. Speaking at the White House, Trump shrugged off reports in the press suggesting his administration was considering punitive air strikes against North Korea to show it is serious about curbing Pyongyang’s development of nuclear and missile capabilities. Stressing his commitment to military spending, Trump said: “We are going to have peace through strength.” He added: “I think we’re going to have a long period of peace. I hope we do. We have certainly problems with North Korea but a lot of good talks are going on right now – a lot of good energy. I like it very much .” According to a South Korean government spokesman, Trump promised Moon there would be no military action “of any kind” while the dialogue continued between the two Koreas. That dialogue restarted on Tuesday, after a break of two years, in talks in the border village of Panmunjoin, which resulted in North Korean regime agreeing to send a delegation to next month’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Moon briefed Trump on the Panmunjoin talks and went out of his way to thank Trump for his policy of imposing “maximum pressure” on North Korea. “I think President Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-Korean talks, and I want to show my gratitude,” he told reporters in Seoul. “It could be the result of US-led sanctions and pressure.” In his version of his conversation with Moon, Trump also emphasised his owned role in creating conditions for the talks to occur. “He’s very thankful for what we’ve done. It was so reported today that … without our attitude, that would have never happened,” Trump told reporters. “Who knows where it leads. Hopefully, it will lead to success for the world – not just for our country, but for the world. And we’ll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens.” In their telephone conversation on Wednesday, Trump also told Moon that vice-president Mike Pence would lead the US delegation to the Olympic Games, the White House said. En route to South Korea, Pence will also travel to Alaska to review ballistic missile defense facilities, the White House said. Moon’s praise for Trump is being seen as an attempt to ease US concerns that the recent thaw in cross-border ties could drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. On Tuesday, North Korea agreed to send a large delegation to the Games, which open in Pyeongchang on 9 February. The two sides also agreed to hold military talks in an attempt to prevent an accidental conflict on the peninsula. While Moon has been more open to the idea of engagement than either of his two conservative predecessors, he said Seoul and Washington shared a common aim: the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. “This initial round of talks is for the improvement of relations between North and South Korea,” he said. “Our task going forward is to draw North Korea to talks aimed at the denuclearisation of the North. That is our basic stance, and that will never be given up.” He added: “We cannot say talks are the sole answer. If North Korea engages in provocations again or does not show sincerity in resolving this issue, the international community will continue applying strong pressure and sanctions.” Moon said he was open to meeting his counterpart, Kim Jong-un, but he would not engage in “talks for the sake of talks”. “To hold a summit, the right conditions must be created and certain outcomes must be guaranteed,” he said. Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Moon had been right to praise Trump. “By doing that, he can help the US build logic for moving toward negotiations and turning around the state of affairs in the future, so when they were ready to talk to the North, they can say the North came out of isolation because the sanctions were effective,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/14/belize-bans-oil-activity-to-protect-reef-diving-tourism-belize-barrier-reef","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"Belize bans oil activity to protect its barrier reef","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/14/belize-bans-oil-activity-to-protect-reef-diving-tourism-belize-barrier-reef","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/14/belize-bans-oil-activity-to-protect-reef-diving-tourism-belize-barrier-reef","fields":{"headline":"Belize bans oil activity to protect its barrier reef","bodyText":"Some good news for the new year: in what has been called a huge step forward in protecting oceans and marine life, the Belize government has announced bold legislation to end oil activity in all of its waters. The move is designed to protect the fragile Belize Barrier Reef world heritage site, the second-largest in the world after Australia’s and home to 1,400 species, including endangered hawksbill turtles, manatees, rays and six threatened species of shark. Belizean prime minister Dean Barrow’s decision to impose an indefinite moratorium marks the first time a developing country has taken such a major step to protect its oceans from oil exploration and extraction – and will help safeguard Belize’s important dive tourism sector. “The decision is hugely significant,” said Chris Gee, of charity WWF-UK, which was part of an international campaign. “It indicates that Belize, a developing country, is prepared to put its people and environment first.” Oil-related damage, such as a spill, could have impacts as far afield as Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and affect the lucrative tourism industry. Unesco inscribed the Belize reef – a 190-mile-long section of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System – as a world heritage site in 1996. Tourism and fisheries support half of the country’s population – around 190,000 people – either directly or indirectly. “The reef is critical not only for the tourism industry, which employs one in every four Belizeans, but it also serves as a ‘barrier’ against storm surge and beach erosion, which will only increase with climate change,” said Dana Krauskopf, owner of Hamanasi Adventure and Dive Resort south of Belize City. Belize is one of the most exciting dive destinations in the world: three of the Caribbean’s four atolls are found in its waters, including Lighthouse Reef atoll, location of the famous Blue Hole (described by ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau as one of the 10 greatest dive sites in the world), as well Glover’s Reef, also a world heritage site. “Legislation to stop offshore oil drilling in Belize is an extremely wise decision,” said Ralph Capeling, co-owner of Splash Dive Center in nearby Placencia. “The economic potential of the reef clearly exceeds the value of any potential discoveries.” There’s hope that Belize’s decision will inspire other countries. “As an avid diver for over 35 years, I think it would be remarkable for other countries to follow Belize’s lead, and take positive steps like banning offshore oil exploration and drilling,” said John Searle, owner of Sea Sports Belize in the capital. “I was stunned to learn that President Trump recently decided to make moves to open up previously protected areas off the coast of the US to oil exploration and drilling. I guess he must have a very short memory.

Both sides need to be clear about what they want from a future relationship,” he said. “I know the repeated complaint from Brussels has been that the UK hasn’t made up its mind what type of relationship it wants, but in London, many feel that we have little, if any, signal of what future relationship the EU27 would like to have with a post-Brexit Britain.” The chancellor suggested there had been a “marked asymmetry” between the “enthusiasm” expressed by non-EU countries keen to strike future trade deals with the UK and what he called “the relative silence, in public at least, from Europe on what the EU wants our future relationship to look like”. International trade secretary Liam Fox has been on a series of missions to non-EU states, from New Zealand to Japan, seeking assurances that countries are ready to strike post-Brexit trade deals. Jenny Chapman, shadow Brexit minister, said: “If the government wanted to be anyone’s tango partner it would be more Ed Balls than Darcy Bussell. At every stage of the Brexit process, Theresa May has allowed the European Union to go first and set the terms of debate because of splits within her own party. Now talks have moved to the second phase ministers must stop waiting for the EU to lead.” Theresa May’s cabinet held its first formal discussion of the so-called “end state” for the Brexit talks before Christmas, with rival camps favouring a closer, Norway-style relationship and the looser “Canada plus” approach favoured by the Brexit secretary, David Davis. Hammond is widely seen as an advocate for the closest possible alignment with the EU27, but in his speech, he urged other countries to make the case publicly for the best possible deal, “putting behind us any narrative of ‘punishment’ for leaving and focusing on the mutually beneficial relationships we have now and can continue in the future”. “I am saying this to you tonight, because I fear that many EU opinion-formers see this as a question only for British politicians, for British voters to resolve, before they engage with the EU27,” he said. He argued that by “signalling a willingness to work together”, Britain’s EU partners could, “send a message to the British people which will resonate as they consider the options for their future”. Both Hammond and Davis hope that with the fractious first phase of talks complete, businesses on the continent will help to make the case for the benefits of a smooth trading relationship – with tariff-free access to the market in goods, for example. But the chancellor was accused of threatening Britain’s EU partners last year when he said Britain would “not take it lying down” if it was locked out of EU markets – widely read as a threat to slash taxes and compete against the EU. Hammond will hold a series of meetings with German business leaders on the sidelines of the conference, and Davis will fly to Germany tomorrow on his own charm offensive. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has repeatedly complained of a lack of clarity on Britain’s hopes for the outcome of the talks. He has also taken a robust line over issues such as financial services, insisting that the City’s powerful banks will lose their “passporting” rights to conduct business in EU states. Davis was ridiculed in Brussels earlier this week after a leaked letter revealed he had considered taking legal action against the EU after it began warning British businesses about the consequences of a “no deal” Brexit. The European Commission’s chief spokesman, Margaritas Schinas, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, “here in the European commission we are somehow surprised that the UK is surprised that we are preparing for a scenario announced by the UK government itself”. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have been keen for the government to keep the option of a “no deal” Brexit on the table – but contrary to reports over the weekend, the prime minister did not appoint a cabinet minister for “no deal” in this week’s reshuffle. Since May secured the EU’s acceptance in December that “sufficient progress” had been made to move onto the next phase of talks, on Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the other 27 member-states, negotiations have continued between officials. Top of the agenda is the nature of the “implementation period” of around two years that Britain wants to secure after Brexit, in March 2019. David Davis hopes a deal can be struck on this issue in the first quarter of this year, although the EU27 have not yet agreed their negotiating guidelines on it. May has conceded that the framework of EU rules will continue to apply during the implementation period, which will include some oversight by the European Court of Justice, despite the objections of pro-Brexit backbenchers including Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees Mogg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/10/letter-peter-preston-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T17:51:32Z","webTitle":"Letter: Peter Preston and foreign news coverage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/10/letter-peter-preston-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/10/letter-peter-preston-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Peter Preston and foreign news coverage","bodyText":"Foreign correspondents away from their home base often relish editorial plaudits for good stories.

But the foreign desk had the freedom to use its judgment where to send me and what to cover, and Peter was always ready to defend me against complaints of bias that were a regular response to the coverage from eastern Europe. He was also stalwart in supporting me on the frequent occasions when I was at the receiving end of demands by Israeli diplomats “to do something” about the Guardian’s alleged anti-Israel policy. Peter certainly was a very private person. However, I have good cause to know that he could involve himself in the personal problems of his staff and be of genuine help.

John Frost, managing director of the Gordon Frost Organisation (GFO), also “sincerely apologised” that the three women did not feel they could report their alleged harassment, despite two of the women having said they told or attempted to tell staff about McLachlan. Three cast members of the 2014 run of Rocky Horror – Browne, Erika Heynatz, and Angela Scundi – on Monday alleged McLachlan inappropriately touched them or exposed himself to them. Victoria police have confirmed an investigation is under way, and two other crew members have since come forward to make allegations. McLachlan – who stepped down from the role of Frank N Furter and was officially replaced by Adam Rennie on Wednesday – has denied all the allegations. In the joint ABC/Fairfax investigation Whelan Browne said she tried to report his behaviour, and that after she was unhappy with the response of a resident director, she complained to Frost personally telling him she was frightened of McLachlan. She said Frost responded “well we can’t have that”, and told her to call him if she needed anything. On Wednesday, Frost said: “I can honestly say while I remember seeing her briefly, I cannot remember any discussion around Craig.” “I can only explain this by pointing out that I speak to many people backstage across many productions and have little time to spend with each person. Christie has told the media that I responded with words to the effect that what she was feeling was not good and that I gave her my phone number and asked her to call me. She has confirmed that she did not take up that offer.” Frost said he had no reason to disbelieve anyone who said they spoke to managers in 2014, but claimed none of the managers were aware of any issues “that warranted further action at the time”. “Erika, Christie and Angela have publicly stated many times in the media that they chose not to make a complaint and that they waited some years to come forward. I am glad they finally did, so that their claims can be properly investigated.” Heynatz earlier told ABC it was “not true” that GFO had no details of the complaint prior to the media report, citing a letter from their lawyers to GFO. Whelan Browne told ABC and Fairfax: “There were two people in management that I spoke to directly and I can’t imagine they could look me in the face and say those conversations never happened.” In Wednesday’s statement Frost also defended GFO’s threat of defamation in response to that letter, which detailed allegations against McLachlan and requested GFO order an independent investigation. The response said the women may have made defamatory comments about GFO, members of its management and McLachlan, and the company was reserving its rights “in respect of that issue”. Frost said the anonymous nature of the letter “indicated other possible motives”. The letter had said the women would only agree to be identified if an investigation was begun. “While the letter we received contained some of the alleged allegations, it is impossible to conduct any sort of investigation when the names of those making the allegations are not given, nor specific details,” he said. Heynatz has previously said “it is this response that drove us to tell our story in the media”. Frost said GFO had strict policies and procedures in place for people who have complaints about harassment, and that they were in place in 2014. “We have never had an incident of this nature prior to this, and complaints of any type of bullying or harassment are very rare,” he said. The statement was released just before the announcement that Rennie, McLachlan’s understudy, was officially cast as Frank N Furter for the remaining shows."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/10/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-sues-buzzfeed-russia-dossier","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T13:00:55Z","webTitle":"Russia dossier: Trump lawyer sues BuzzFeed for publishing document","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-sues-buzzfeed-russia-dossier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-sues-buzzfeed-russia-dossier","fields":{"headline":"Russia dossier: Trump lawyer sues BuzzFeed for publishing document","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s personal lawyer is suing news website BuzzFeed almost exactly a year after it published an explosive dossier containing serious and salacious allegations about collusion with Russia. Michael Cohen posted on Twitter on Tuesday night: “Enough is enough of the #fake #RussianDossier. Just filed a defamation action against @BuzzFeedNews for publishing the lie filled document on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and me!” Cohen told Bloomberg News he had also filed a second defamation suit against political intelligence firm Fusion GPS, which compiled the dossier, in federal court. Cohen is one of Trump’s closest business advisers and most loyal confidantes and it seems improbable that he was acting without the president’s blessing. His move came hours after Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, unilaterally released a transcript of testimony from Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson. BuzzFeed vowed to fight the action in court. The publication of the 35-page dossier in January 2017 triggered a political storm and debate over media ethics. The raw research by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele suggested the Russian government had both compromised and colluded with Trump during the 2016 presidential election, and included lurid allegations. Steele also recorded claims that Cohen had held secret meetings with Russian officials in Prague in August 2016, where he allegedly discussed how to pay Kremlin-associated hackers for targeting Hillary Clinton. Cohen told Bloomberg that he was mentioned in the dossier 15 times. “It will be proven that I had no involvement in this Russian collusion conspiracy,” he said. “My name was included only because of my proximity to the president.” In an interview with ABC News, he added: “I want to be very clear. I have never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, and I have never engaged with, been paid by, paid for, or communicated with anyone representing the Russian Federation or anyone else to hack anyone or any organisation or disseminate false news reports or interfere in any way with this election.” The dossier came into the possession of several media organisations but BuzzFeed posted the unredacted documents just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration, with a warning that the contents contained errors and were “unverified and potentially unverifiable”. The decision was attacked by both Trump and some traditional media outlets, claiming it was irresponsible to publish unverified allegations. Cohen’s complaint against Buzzfeed names editor-in-chief Ben Smith, reporter Ken Bensinger and editors Miriam Elder and Mark Schoofs. BuzzFeed said it was ready to defend the case in court. Spokesman Matt Mittenthal said: “The dossier is, and continues to be, the subject of active investigations by Congress and intelligence agencies. It was presented to two successive presidents, and has been described in detail by news outlets around the world. Its interest to the public is obvious. We look forward to defending the free press and our First Amendment rights in court.” In an article in the New York Times on Tuesday, headlined I’m Proud We Published the Trump-Russia Dossier, Smith wrote: “A year of government inquiries and blockbuster journalism has made clear that the dossier is unquestionably real news. That’s a fact that has been tacitly acknowledged even by those who opposed our decision to publish.” Cohen said the suit against Fusion GPS and Simpson was filed in federal court in the southern district of New York. It reportedly claims that the firm “recklessly placed [the dossier] beyond their control and allowed it to fall into the hands of media devoted to breaking news on the hottest subject of the day: the Trump candidacy”.

An entry level salary of $44,500 has been mandated across these formats, while the agreement will last until the expiry of the current broadcast deal in 2020. Top-level salaries will still be disparate between men’s XVs and others, but the move is a significant improvement for the women’s game. Women will also have a new pregnancy policy built into the agreement, which lasts until the expiry of the 2020 broadcast deal. The deal follows Raelene Castle’s December appointment as chief executive of RA, where she acknowledged that the “female market is really hot” and that rugby union was in a “race ... to be a sport of choice” for women. Sevens co-captain Shannon Parry heralded the pregnancy policy as a significant breakthrough for women playing rugby union. “We’re in such a different sport to most female athletes in terms of the physicality of the game, but to make sure you’re not prevented from wanting to have children and a family is vital,” she said. “To have the security of being able to return to your contract gives our squad a sense that the door will always be open, and as we’ve seen with (gold medal winner and mother of two) Nicole Beck, there is absolutely no reason why you can’t come back and compete at the highest level after having children.” Additionally, the Wallaroos, the women’s XVs side, has been included in the deal for the first time, meaning they will also be paid for the first time. They will receive match payments for any Test they play. Previously, they have been considered amateur, and did not receive match payments. The new collective bargaining agreement will also affect Super Rugby, with squads enlarged to between 36 and 40 players, compared with the previous 35 maximum. Given the axing of the Western Force, overall Super Rugby spots will still be down 175 to 160. However, clubs will also receive a salary cap boost from $5m to $5.5m – with a 15 per cent reduction for veterans of the franchises effectively meaning a player salary increase of 10 per cent. Players will retain a 29 per cent revenue share. Super Rugby players will also benefit from extra annual leave, while the agreement guarantees an NRC presence in Western Australia until the end of the broadcast deal. The CBA comes after a difficult year for rugby union, with the controversial axing of the Western Force from the SANZAAR competition the biggest talking point. Many players have been left in limbo until today’s announcement. The Super Rugby competition also suffered from low crowds and a struggling Australian contingent, none of whom could beat a New Zealand team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/12/sold-out-grand-finals-sign-of-wnbls-strength-and-a-tantalising-match-up","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Sold-out grand finals sign of WNBL's strength – and a tantalising match-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/12/sold-out-grand-finals-sign-of-wnbls-strength-and-a-tantalising-match-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/12/sold-out-grand-finals-sign-of-wnbls-strength-and-a-tantalising-match-up","fields":{"headline":"Sold-out grand finals sign of WNBL's strength – and a tantalising match-up","bodyText":"And then there were two. After a three-month, 21-game, 13-round season it all comes down to this: Townsville Fire and the Melbourne Boomers battling it out in a three-game grand final series for the Women’s National Basketball League’s championship bragging honours. This decider has it all: rivalry, tantalising match-ups, contrasting tales and a little piece of history on the line. The Fire last weekend defeated reigning champions Sydney Uni Flames 2-0 to advance to their fifth Grand Final in six years. Townsville was runner-up to Bendigo, twice, before going back-to-back in 2014 then 2015. They fell to the Flames in the semi-final series last season before reloading in 2017. Meanwhile, the Boomers are back in play-off action for the first time since 2014. Bulleen evolved into Melbourne Boomers that season but in its former guise had made four Grand Finals in three decades for one win – the club’s sole championship in season 2010-11. Sport loves symmetry and there’s plenty of it in this Grand Final series. Star centre Liz Cambage and the classy Jenna O’Hea were part of that historic title. Next year O’Hea would move to cross-town rival Dandenong Rangers and beat Cambage’s Boomers. The pair reunited on court this season and have teamed up to lead the club back up the ladder. Cambage’s return to the league after a five-year absence has lived up to every expectation. She’s topped the major statistical tallies averaging 23.43 points per game and 10.57 rebounds. She sank 44 points against Adelaide Lightning, scored 32 points or more five times and registered 11 double-doubles. But the 203cm centre has often found herself in foul trouble, and was ejected twice and suspended once in a campaign that had the highest of highs and some controversial lows. But the Boomers are far from a one-woman team. With a legitimate big or post player for the first time in recent memory, the Boomers’ brigade of guards and shooters have risen to the occasion more often than not. Guard Bec Cole has to count on two hands how many knee surgeries she’s had, and is the only remaining player from that 2014 team to have reached the finals, but is fit, firing and scoring. Fellow guards Maddie Garrick and Britt Smart have won the club’s past two MVP awards respectively and continue to deliver. Then there’s Monique Conti. The young gun, in just her second season at the elite level, combined a full-time training schedule with Year 12 in 2017 and celebrated her 18th birthday last month during a road trip in Adelaide to play the Lightning. Following the Grand Final series, the pocket rocket will follow in the footsteps of former basketball great Erin Phillips by playing for the Western Bulldogs in the AFLW competition next month, drafted at pick No4. There’s also stories aplenty at the Fire. Coach Claudia Brassard played for the Fire then was assistant coach during their most recent titles. In her second season at the helm, Townsville has climbed the WNBL mountain. With a shortened season, more two-game weekends and the most travelled team in the league, Brassard recruited smartly. While much pre-season talk centred on the big-name returns and recruits across the competition, it was noted by experts that Townsville was compiling a roster with plenty of depth – and it has certainly held the Fire in good stead. Batkovic, who’s played in more Grand Finals than she can remember, has resumed her successful on-court partnership with fellow big Cayla George who came home to Townsville after a stint in Europe and with an Olympics under her belt. Having won five of the past six league MVP gongs, Batkovic has again fired averaging 20.12 points and 10.35 rebounds a game. At 37, she remains at the peak of her powers and laughs when she says she’s “like a fine wine.” Power forward Darcee Garbin has stamped her mark all over the back-end of the club’s campaign with consistent contributions, Mia Murray and Kelly Wilson are full of experience and imports Sydney Wiese and Laurin Mincy have found their groove. After a five-year break, Mikhaela Donnelly returned to the league this year as a first-time mum. Baby Adi has become a permanent and adored fixture and has travelled on all road trips from Perth to Bendigo and Canberra. Donnelly sets a fine example on and off the court and has given Brassard quality minutes off the bench. Townsville and Melbourne advanced after clean sweeping their higher-ranked opponents, Sydney and Perth last week, yet the Fire hold a 3-0 lead over the Boomers in 2017-18. The Fire have sold out game one and their parochial crowds are described as “our sixth man” according to Batkovic. Visiting teams may prefer the word hostile. In Melbourne, the Boomers, too, have sold out their home-fixture and will back themselves to level or clinch the series at the State Basketball Centre. Anything can happen in finals and that is likely to ring true in this showdown.

The present tense acknowledges that George Michael was alive at the time of filming his autobiographical portrait – even to the extent of being co-director with his former manager David Austin. But now, there is a brief preface in which Kate Moss, collaborator on key Michael pop videos, pirouettes moodily on a black leather swivel chair before recalling that “on Christmas Day, 2016, we heard, with shock and disbelief, that our friend, George Michael, had passed away. Only days before, he had been putting the finishing touches to the film you are about to see.” Eerily, though, in a piece that he planned to be around to watch, Michael exists only in the past. Threaded through the documentary are shots – captioned “George Michael’s house, Highgate 2016” – of a middle-aged man with cropped grey hair, typing at a table, while a voice that is clearly Michael’s. Although viewers are never told if it is or isn’t the singer, a tiny entry in the final credits reads: “Simon Rutter as George Michael.” And, although Michael appears to be narrating, these first-person contributions are usually revealed to be clips of him speaking to MTV, CNN or Channel 4 in old interviews. The closing credits acknowledge the use of Kirsty Young’s 2007 Desert Island Discs conversations. What Michael says is intelligent, powerful and revealing. On his initial reluctance to come out: “It’s very hard to be proud of your sexuality, if it hasn’t brought you any joy.” About a spell of songwriter’s block induced by grief and stress: “Losing music was like losing God for me.” It’s frustrating, though, not to know the provenance of the quotes, or whether any of the words were recorded specifically for this film. Given the circumstances, we might have assumed that these strategies were a solution to Michael’s tragic sudden unavailability. But Moss’s introduction suggests that the documentary was almost finished when Michael died, which makes it weirdly intriguing that he apparently chose to be so absent: visualised by an actor and vocalised through archive interviews. Advance media coverage has focused on the omission of Fadi Fawaz, Michael’s partner when he died, but, if this was a snub, then Fawaz is in good company. Viewers unaware that Michael was the project’s co-director might think that it had been made by someone unable to access the family and friends section of his contacts file. A surprising percentage of the analysis comes from Ricky Gervais and James Corden, whose direct involvement in Michael’s life amounted to his appearances in an episode of Extras and a version of Carpool Karaoke recorded for Comic Relief. Among the musical contributors, the best are Sir Elton, a survivor of rock celebrity madness who is always insightful on those who coped less well, and Stevie Wonder, an admirer and collaborator, who, in the sequence on Michael’s success as a soul singer, cracks the obvious but sporting joke: “You mean George is white? Oh my God!” Less usefully, Tony Bennett observes of his duet with the singer, oxymoronically: “He walked in very prepared – and was so spontaneous!” There’s also more than enough of Liam Gallagher, who observes, of Wham!, “they was fucking everywhere, wasn’t they?”, and gets in the inevitable Noel-goading: “Our kid had a bit of a Wham! moment, know what I mean?” However, Andrew Ridgeley, who had a rather bigger Wham! moment, never appears. Nor do any relatives or intimates; the only two even mentioned are Michael’s mother and his lover, Anselmo Feleppa, in sections dealing with the extent to which he was destabilised by their deaths. A sense of the opportunity missed is given by the most personally revealing sequence, which lifts the documentary to a different level. Slick editing of concert recordings, home videos, and interview clips tells the story of how Feleppa’s diagnosis with Aids informed Michael’s performance of “Someone to Love” at the Freddie Mercury memorial gig – “It was sung to my lover, who was dying” – and then how his death inspired the song Jesus to a Child.Another friction in the film comes from the company producing it. As the singer unsuccessfully sued Sony in 1992 – an attempt to free himself from a long-term contract that he regarded as artistic “slavery” – the opening credit “Sony Music Entertainment Presents” feels rather like seeing that a documentary on Brexit has been funded by the European Union. Logically, though, only Sony could have made this film because it owns so much of the material – rehearsal and recording studio footage is sharply used – and, surprisingly, the account of Michael’s attempts to escape from the grip of the film’s producers is one of the longest and strongest sections. A film that wasn’t co-directed by Michael and produced by Sony would have included much more about drugs, drink, arrests and death, but those biographical losses are more than offset by the material that would only have been available to a documentary that, not only in those Highgate sequences, gives a new meaning to the concept of an “in-house” project. If George Michael: Freedom could, for its moments of infuriating elusiveness, have been subtitled “The Man Who Wasn’t There”, then that, you feel, genuinely may have been what George Michael would have wanted. George Michael: Freedom is on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/the-new-curb-your-enthusiasm-is-appalling-slapstick-what-was-larry-david-thinking","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T10:39:57Z","webTitle":"The new Curb Your Enthusiasm is appalling slapstick – what was Larry thinking?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/the-new-curb-your-enthusiasm-is-appalling-slapstick-what-was-larry-david-thinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/the-new-curb-your-enthusiasm-is-appalling-slapstick-what-was-larry-david-thinking","fields":{"headline":"The new Curb Your Enthusiasm is appalling slapstick – what was Larry thinking?","bodyText":"Larry David doesn’t know when to stop. Obviously this is true of his fictionalised incarnation, but it’s also increasingly true of the real Larry David – the comedy genius who has, over the course of an amazing career, reinvented the sitcom not once but twice. Given its initial strangeness, Curb Your Enthusiasm has been remarkably influential. Because variations on the format are part of the language of television now, it’s easily forgotten how original the show seemed when it started. Subsequently, everyone from Jack Dee to Michael Barrymore and David Hasselhoff has tried something vaguely – or indeed embarrassingly – approximate. So now, it’s just another sitcom. In any field of creative enterprise, pioneers are doomed to fall back into the pack as everyone else catches up. Curb still deserves kudos for being there first. But Curb wasn’t just the original; it was the best. There’s an exquisite agony about the finest episodes that stem from the suspicion that everything happening to Larry could probably happen to you on a particularly bad day. For all the conspicuous prosperity of the setting and the cameos from famous faces, the situations remain remarkably universal. Clearly wealth and success don’t preclude regular moments of social catastrophe. But here’s the problem. Larry was usually if not right exactly, then at least wrong in a way that felt plausible if you were in possession of all the facts. The Larry David of Curb is an idiot, and a magnificently unlucky one too. He is hugged by a child seconds after he’s hidden a bottle of water down his trousers. He has a friend who won’t pay restaurant bills and a doctor who helps himself to drinks from his fridge. Larry is also an honest man, a man who’ll say what we’re all thinking. So when he told the son of a former kamikaze pilot that, by rights, he shouldn’t be alive, he hit the nail gloriously on the head. The essential rightness of Larry wasn’t just crucial in making him a relatable character. It also underpinned the stunningly precise construction of the best episodes, the inexorable internal logic to those half-hours in which every mishap gathers momentum and leads horrifyingly and perfectly to the next. They’re like a perfectly calibrated Swiss watch of hideous social awkwardness. And now, Curb’s imperial period brilliance shines more brightly than ever. Because everything has changed. In this eagerly awaited new season, Larry is just a dick. He will tell a lesbian who is planning her wedding that she’s too butch to be the bride, and will persist long past the point it becomes clear that he’s jeopardising her relationship. He’ll see a woman in a short skirt, assume she’s a sex worker and tell her so. He’ll behave pedantically, rudely and awkwardly, simply because that’s what his character does. This doesn’t just make Larry impossible to root for, it coarsens the comedy; wedges a spanner into the narrative works. Curb is now a slapstick-and-catchphrase sitcom. In the opening episode, there’s a moment where he simply throws his head back and bellows “prettay PRETTAY GOOD!” It’s a crass, foregrounded, overplayed moment that feels as if it’s escaped from a particularly lazy episode of Little Britain rather than one of the most innovative sitcoms of all time. Because Larry’s behaviour is now so consistently appalling, the gags are all obvious a mile off. The naturalistic, near-deadpan feel of early seasons has been replaced by a clunking, almost slapstick predictability – the emergence, in episode two, of a scantily clad prostitute just as Larry is Skyping a Muslim cleric felt more like Benny Hill than classic Curb. Maybe the world has changed without telling Larry David. Maybe Larry now simply feels too much like a rich, straight white man lumbering around shoving his demented, free-ranging privilege and entitlement in everyone’s face? But was it too much to ask that his last trick might be to leave us wanting more? Apparently so. Enthusiasm? Well and truly curbed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/13/why-its-good-to-runandtalk","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T10:55:03Z","webTitle":"Why it’s good to #runandtalk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/13/why-its-good-to-runandtalk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/13/why-its-good-to-runandtalk","fields":{"headline":"Why it’s good to #runandtalk","bodyText":"England Athletics #runandtalk campaign – supported by the charity Mind – has given an opportunity for their mental health ambassadors (MHAs) to offer local sessions where anyone can come and give running a try. Bring together the great outdoors, the enthusiasm and experience of the MHAs, plus the expertise of run leaders and coaches, and trying out exercise becomes less intimidating, more welcoming, even – dare I say it – fun. I’m living proof of the inextricable link between running and positive mental health. Amid the turmoil of a complicated divorce, I set up a morning run group. I wanted to offer support to single mums like me, who could only run when their children were at school. As I went in and out of the school playground, every day, for years, so many of them would share their life issues. We all needed an outlet. Looking after my three girls on my own, while going through divorce, left me with severe anxiety. I didn’t really want the responsibility of looking after any more people, but being at home only encouraged my pinching voice of self-doubt to get louder. I needed the group as much as they needed a coach. Even though there were evening sessions every day of the week at local clubs, they were useless to parents without childcare. I also signed up to be an MHA the day the scheme was launched. My group forced me to leave my house when I wanted to hide away. As I ran between each member, they would share their daily battles with me. While we ran, we supported each other. Any of the runners could have gone to a regular club speed session. I wanted our speed sessions to include mindfulness and gratitude. Soon it wasn’t just a small group of mums, but diverse in background, ability and talent. Men came, too! During my early running years, I had to work hard just to hold on to the back of a navy field gun crew from the local submarine base. Those men didn’t chat, moan, confide or confess when they ran. They were tough, and led by the toughest runner I have ever known: my dad. He could down a bottle of vodka on Saturday night, then run a sub-three-hour marathon Sunday morning; he epitomised the military protocol of work hard, play harder. My group would not be like his. Going along to any running session is hard enough. When your coach asks you to lie on the ground, hands against the earth, connect to the universal energy and positively focus on that moment only … it’s unconventional. Given time, though, runners relax, giggles subside and they realise how vital the mind is to be the best runner you can. Clearing your mind from daily stresses and worries can give as much benefit as any pyramid or hill session. All our runners come along and support #runandtalk, including Laura, the worker in the group. Not only does she do an amazing job raising her six children alone (including two sets of twins), she runs a thriving business. Forcing a run group into her hectic schedule is a lifesaver. “If I didn’t have this chance to burn off my stress and talk about my worries I would be a terrible mother,” she says. “This one hour, together with my daily practices of gratitude and mindfulness, gives me freedom and focus in a very busy life.” Sandra, who was at my very first session, is the matriarch of the group. At the tender age of 70, she is world champion in her age group at Olympic distance triathlon. She has been running for 50 years. “Any group can only thrive on give-and-take; sharing skills and experiences. Being a part of a group can be powerful. You get friendship, fun and challenge, whatever your ability.” Susan is our smiler. On her journey to fitness, during which she has lost more than 32kg , and her 5K personal best from 46 to 29mins, she remains eternally happy to have found a new family. “I never knew I was a runner!” she says. “But it’s my hour of sanctuary, away from work and looking after my three kids. The range of abilities may be vast, but there’s always encouragement when you’re finding it tough, or a cheer when something new is achieved.” Without the group, and our #runandtalk sessions, I wouldn’t have coped with a dark chapter of my life. Running, however hard it feels at the time, gives you strength and self-belief, a theme in my new book, which has six easy steps on how to introduce exercise, and running, into your life to help you cope with difficult emotions. Running helps you focus forwards. Ours is one tiny group in a nation of runners, but the support we give each other is more powerful than any antidepressant. Imagine how happy this small island would be if we could get the whole nation to #runandtalk? Tina Chantrey is a running coach and contributing editor of Women’s Running magazine.

She often calls me crying, saying that I’m the only one she can talk with, even though I have told her many times that I can’t stand all this hate towards my dad.

Желекжолдың басқа шетінде тағы бір Фостер арқылы жобаланып салынған күміс түсті, сырлы пирамида - Бейбітшілік пен келісім сарайы - әлем діндерінің кездесу орны ретінде ойластырылып, төбесі витраж әйнегіндегі көгершін суреттерімен әшекейленген ғимарат. Ғимарат - үстінен шөп өскен белес үстінде, құрметке тұрарлық бір мазар секілді, белағаш бағыты ұшып бара жатқан құс нысанына ұқсас көлге бағытталып тұр. Осы салттық және қарапайым көріністер арасында мемлекеттік механизмдері орналастырылып қойылған: Президенттік сарайы – Вашингтондағы Ақ Үйге ұқсас қылып жобаланған, бірақ одан сегіз есе үлкенірек болып келеді, үстінен үлкен көгілдір шатырмен жабылған; ұлттық банкі мен сақтандыру фонды орналасқан нысаны алтын түсті конус тәріздес егіз мұнара ғимараттары; ұлттық мұрағатының жылтыратылып қойылған, сұры түсті жұмыртқа тәрізді ғимараты. Осының барлығының ортасында шолу мұнарасы - аударылып қойылған бадминтон желбіршегіне тығылып қойылған Ферреро Роше шоколады сияқты, ақ түсті құрыш ағашы үстінен алтын түсті шары - орналасқан. Осы алып ұшқан архитектуралық қиял - Қазақстанның бірінші және жалғыз ғана президенті, 1989 жылдан бастап халықтың ғұмырлық елбасы және елорданың бас архитекторы болып келе жатқан, осы 20 жыл бойы шалғай дала ортасында өзіне бақандай қала мөлшерлі бір ескерткіш салып келген Нұрсұлтан Назарбаевтың ғана елестері. “Қалалардың да адамдар сияқты өз тағдыры болады,” деп Назарбаев “Еуразия жүрегінде”, өзінің архитектура және қала жобалау бойынша жазылған, оқығанда келешек жұмыстарды қамтамасыз ете алу үшін архитектор арқылы жазылған брошюрасы секілді кітабында жазып еді. “Олардың әрқайсысының өз аты, қайталанбайтын өмірбаяны, дүниеде ешбір жерге ұқсамайтын өзіндік айрықша мінезі мен белгілері бар.” Астананың көшелері бойымен жүргенде басқа жерлерден келген белгілі сарқыншақтарын сезе аласыз. Осы қалада Гольф елдеріндегідей петродолларлар жылтырағы мен Пхеньяндағыдай монументалдық белағаштық жобалауын байқауға болады, бірақ айна тәрізді әр әйнек қасбетерінен ежелгі өркениеттер мен қазақ ұлттық мотиветр түрінде өткен шақтарды елестететін өз тамырларын іздеу үшін барып келу ықыласы одан әрі анығырақ болып орындылығын іздеп тұрады. “Қазіргі замандағы басқа елбасыларының ешқайсысы ұлттық идентикалық сезімін дамыту үшін архитектураның дақпырт жасай алатын күшін Назарбаевтай қолданбаған,” дейді Франк Альбо, Қазақстанның жаңа елордасы бойынша жаңа кітабінің авторы. Архитектура, дақпырттар мен тағдыр. “Көріп отырғандарыңыз - постмодернизм, Орта Азия мәдениеті, исламдық әшекейлеу, орыс барокко, неоклациссизм, ориентализм бағыттарының араласуы, барлығы ұлттық стероидтер бойынша Лас Вегас пен Диснейленд бірге кездескендей бір нәрсеге бірлесіп тұтасып кеткен сияқты.” Совет дәуірінің бұғауын үзу талпынысында Президент тіпті дерлік барлық басқа салаларды осы бағытқа енгізіп келді. Архитекторлар бұл дүниенің мықталары үшін жұмыс істеуді жан-тәнімен ұнатады, мұнай ақшасын ағызып тұратын сорғысы және архитектураға деген зор қызығушылығы бар диктаторлар келгенде ірі архитекторлық бюроларының тек біразы ғана өз жолдарын Назарбаевтың есігіне дейін барудан тартына алды. Жапонияның басқа елдерде жұмыс істеген архитекторлары арасындағы ең мақтан етілетін Кисё Курокава Астана жобалану жұмыстарына тартылған ең алғашқы архитекторы болып, көбінде өзіне ешбір түрде назар тартып келмей жүрген қала үшін ғаламат зор бас жоспарын жобалап дайындады. Итальяндық архитектор Манфреди Николетти арқылы қаланың концерт залы - Президенттік сарайы жанында лажсыздан отырған бүгіліп қалған көктарғақ құсы секілді көгілдір түсті әйнек қанаттарынан тұратын пішінсіз бір массасы - салынған. “Calatrava Grace” жобалау бюросы президентпен негізгі желекжолын толық ұзындығынан үстінен әйнек шатырымен жабу жобасы бойынша президентпен келісім жүргізуде. Экспо көрмесінің ғимараттарын жобалау бойынша конкурсын жеңіп алған «Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill» архитекторлық бюросы – Дубай қаласының ең биік ғимаратының авторы болып келіп және өктемшілдік режимдерінің Заха Хадид, Моше Сафди, «UN Studio», «Snøhetta», «Mecanoo» және басқалар сияқты сүйікті архитекторларының қатарына жатады. Газеттер жабылып, сыншылар қамалып, наразылық білдірушілер жәбірленді, бірақ орталық жәй ғана сол алып параметрикалық тамшыға ұқсас ғимаратқа қарап отыр. Жаңа Хан Назарбаев ел астанасын көшіру бойынша шешімін 1990 жылдарының басында, президент лауазымына тағайындалғаннан кейін біраз уақыт өткен соң қабылдады. Оның келтірген дәлелдемелері сол уақыттан бастап, әсіресе осы қалаға көшіп баруға мәжбүр болған мемлекеттік қызметкерлер арасында, көптеген жорамалдар тақырыбы болып келді. 1830 жылдардан бастап Ақмола (“ақ мола”) қаласы орналасқан, осы ашық дала ортасында, температурасы қыста -40C°, жазда +40C° жететін жер елдің бұрынғы елордасы жұпар иісті Алматыдан мыңдаған километрлік қашықтықта жатқан жағымсыз бір таңдау болды. Кейбіреулер салмақ түсетін жерді Қытай шекарасынан алыстату үшін керек болды деп айтады, басқалары қазақтардың күшін көбінде этникалық орыс өкілдері арқылы мекендеген жерлерде күшейту үшін жасалған деп дәлел келтіреді. Қалай болғанда да, бұл ең алдымен қаланы түк жоқ, бос жерден салу үшін, жаңа елбасының, Дариус пен Персеполистің ізімен жүріп, өзінің жаңа әлемін таза парақтан жазып енгізу үшін бір мүмкіншілік болды. 1997 жылы Астана қаласында өткен инагурация церемониясында, өзінің беделі бойынша күдігі бар болғандай, Назарбаев - ежелгі монғол отпен тазалау “аластау” салтын өткізіп, салт соңында рәсімдік ақ түсті кілем үстінен, бұрынғы ұлы Хандар билікке келгенде ақ киізге отырғызып көтергеніндей, өтіп шықты. Қала тарихының егжей-тегжейлері Назарбаев орталығында - тастан жасалған алып тостаған тәрізді нысанымен, үстінен доғал әйнек линзасымен жабылып қойылған, Президенттік сарайына бәрін көріп тұратын көз секілді еңкейтіп қаратып қойылған және жоғары қауіпсіздік дуалының бүкіл периметрі бойынша солдаттар арқылы қорғалып тұратын бір ғимаратта - айтылып беріледі. Осы, Фостер архитектуралық бюросы арқылы тағы бір жобаланған ғимаратта президенттің жеке заттары, оның инагурация барысында киген костюмінен бастап, ұлттық әнұранының бірлесіп жазғанда қолданған алтын түсті автоқаламына дейін - экспонаттардың әрқайсысы өзінің бөлек әйнек қорабында шаммен бөлек жарықтандырылып тұрады. Құрмет көрсетіп, сүйсінген ұлттар сыйлаған сыйлар ғимараттың каскад секілді деңгейлерінде одан да көбірек сөрелерін толтырып тұр: Қытайдан мұнай құбырының күміс түсті моделі, Түркменістаннан – асыл тастармен әшекейленген пойыз вагоны – сонымен қатар, Назарбаевқа әлем басшылары арқылы марапат етіп берілген медальдарының 3D голографиялық презентациясы. Менің жас гидім назарымды әсіресе президенттің тағы бір кітабына, “Қазақстан жолы”, Маргарет Тэтчердің алғысөз жазып, қолы қойылған суретіне назар аударуды мақтан көрді, гидім маған елбасының 4 000 кітаптан тұратын және арнайы әйнек әулие сөресінде орналасқан жеке кітапхасын көрсеткісі келіп тұрды. “Ол шынымен осылардың барлығын оқып шыққан,” деп ынтамен қосып айтып тұрды. “Ол өте оқымысты адам.” Осы жасанды, каһарлы түрлі мавзолейдің коллекциясының орталық экспонаты - күміс, алтын және жартылай асыл тастармен әшекейленген, Назарбаевтың өзі қағаз майлықтарында салған жоба нобайларымен бірге көрсетілген, архитектуралық нысандары. Мұнда аударылып қойылған бадминтон желбіршегіне ұқсайтын - қазақ аңыздарындағы Самырұқ атты бақыт құсы алтын жұмыртқа салатын құдіретті ағашын көрсету үшін арналған Байтерек мұнарасының нобайы да бар. Мұнда Курокаваның, өзінің “метаболизм мен симбиоз” принциптеріне сай жобаланған алғашқы архитектуралық бас планы да қойылған. Курокава өзеннің оң жағасындағы советтік дәуірінен қалған қаланы сол жағадағы жаңа қаламен үйлестіру үшін қала дамуының жүйелі үлгісін, ал елорданың айналасына, қаланы мұздай суық желден қорғау үшін, ағаштарды отырғызып, қалың орман қорғау алқабын салуды ұсынған. Алайда ағаштар әлі де отырғызылмаған. Жаңа Астана қаласының желекжолдарында серуендеп қарап жүргенде Курокаваның жобасынан басынан бастап бас тартылғаны анық болады. Жаңа қала - архитектуралық формаларының адам мөлшеріне деген сезімінің мүлдем болмаған түрде жобаланған, пунктир сызықтарымен бөлінген алты жолақтық көшелері алып ғимараттарымен алмастырылып тұрып, осы жерден бездіріп тұрып, өзеннің басқа жағасындағы бұрынғы совет уақытынан қалған орталықты, екеуін салыстырғанда, жайлы және ыңғайлы ауыл секілді көрсетіп тұрады. Бұл - мөлшерлерге шырғаланып қалған жер; Назарбаев, Есіл өзені басқа елдердің астаналарындағы өзендер сияқты, мысалы, Темза, Дунай немесе Сена өзендері, заңғарлығына тең болдыруы үшін, Есіл өзенін тіпті кеңейтіп де жіберді. Қала картасына қарасаңыз, өзен ағымы Астана қаласының екі сыртқы жағынан тарылып, тек қана қала ортасында, өз тамағын сіңіртіп жатқан жылан секілді, дүңкиіп тұрады. Әділ Нұрмақов, саясаттанушы-ғылым және Алматы Қала Форумын құрған тұлғалардың бірі, өзінің әйелі жұмыс бабымен Астанаға жіберілгендіктен, өздерінің кенже баласымен Астанаға көшіп келіп, әлі де қатты толқыған қалыпта. “Шынымен айтсам, мен елордамыздың осылай болуынан ұяламын,” дейді ол. “Қаланы ең басынан сала отырып, оны адамдар үшін соншама қолайсыз және жайсыз болып келетінін түк ойламағандарын түсінбеймін.” Қала тым алып мөлшерлі бола отырып, тек қана көлік жүргізушілерін ескеріп, ауыр климат жағдайларына мүлдем назар аудармайды. Ғимараттар бір-бірінен сонша қашықтықта салынып, осының салдарынан адамдар көшелерде мүлдем жүре алмайды. Қыс айларында тек қана бір жерасты көлік паркингінен келесіге өтумен өтеді, ал жаз айларында осы толығымен ашық болып тұрған алып аумақтарда ешбір көлеңке таба алмайсың. Тамыз айының жылы кештерінде қала орталығында өмірдің біраз белгілері пайда болады. Қаланың ескі бөлшегінің өзен жағасында серуендеп жүрген жасөспірімдер көрініп, ал өзеннің басқа жағасында бірнеше отбасылар орталық Нұржол желекжолы арқылы серуендеп, бірнеше көше сатушылар арқылы жол бойы өтіп жатқан адамдарға ұсынылатын, батареямен істейтін ойыншықтары секілді жылт-жылт етіп тұратын жарықтандырылып қойылған ғимараттарды сүйсіне тамашалап жүреді. Бес қабат биіктігіне тән бейне экранынан Назарбаевтің беті, оның бейнесі қаланың оғаш ғимараттарының биіктіктен жасалған бейне суреттерінің қатар монтажымен, монументтер және олардың жасаушы адамы бірге қанттай тәтті бір бейнемонтажында ала-құла шаңқиған презентация фильмдері арқылы көрсетіліп тұрады. “Бүкіл қала Кафка мен Оруэллдың қиыстырып қойған жер секілді,” дейді Евгений Жовтис, Адам құқықтары мен заң билігі бойынша халықаралық бюросының Қазақстандағы Алматы қаласында орналаскан үкіметтік емес ұйымының бастығы. “Осы мансаптанған және өршіл жобаны жүзеге асыру үшін миллиардтаған доллар қаражаты жұмсалды, ал Астанадан бірнеше километрлік қашықтықта әлі де лайықты жолы жоқ, электр жүйесіне қосылмаған немесе негізгі әлеуметтік қызметтері жоқ қалалар мен ауылдар бар. Осы алып мөлшерлі ғимараттарды қыста жылытып отыру үшін және жазда салқындатып отыру үшін жұмсалатын ақшалы қаражатты елдің басқа аймақтарында лайықты қызметтер мен инфрақұрылымдарды салу үшін жіберуге болар еді.” Экспо көрмесіне 3 миллиард америкалық доллар жұмсалуы көпшіліктің қатты ашулануына апарды, себебі елдегі халықтың дерлік жартысы айына тек 70 доллармен өмір сүріп жатқанда бұл ысырапшылдықтың ащы символына айналды. Экспо жобасы басынан бастап жанжалға батылып, ұлттық зейнетқор қорынан қаражат алынды деп кінә тағылып, бюджеттік саласында жұмыс істейтін қызметкерлердің, көрмеге келетін адамдардың санын көбейті үшін Экспо көрмесіне билеттерді сатып алуға мәжбүрленуі тақырып болды. Экспо көрмесінің үш лауазымды тұлғасы қоғам қаражатын ұрлағаны үшін қамауға алынған. “Қазақстанның адамдары енді өте ашулы,” дейді Астанадан алты сағаттық қашықтықта жатқан Есіл қаласынан өз оқушыларын Экспо көрмесіне әкелген бастауыш сынып мұғалімі. “Біз Экспо көрмесінің осында өткізіліп жатқанын мақтаныш етеміз, бірақ біздің еліміздің үкімет басшылары, бүкіл әлем алдында абырой алу үшін осы көрме үшін бұдан да тым көп ақша жұмсап қойған.” Таңдалған “келешек энергиясы” деген тақырыбы да көбінесе мұнай компаниялары арқылы қаржыландырылған, бүкіл экспорт көлемінің 70% мұнай мен газ экспортынан тұратын елде, көрмеге мүлдем сай келмейді. Shell компаниясы павильонында павильон қызметкерлері мені қарсы алып, өзімнің кинетикалық қуатымды зорб ішінде айналып отырып өндіруге шақырды. Француз павильонында осы павильон қызметкерлері, Жер шарының ең төбесінде Total компаниясының логотип орналасып тұрғанда, ғаламдық жылыну әсерлері бойынша ойлануға шақырды. Экспо көрмесінің өткізілуі бойынша хабар түскеннен кейін, елдің жасыл технологияларына өтуін жария ете отырып, президент Назарбаевтың айтқаны: “Мен өз басым жел және күн сәулесі сияқты баламалы энергия көздеріне сенбеймін” деп отыра, “мұнай мен газ - біздің негізгі дағдылы бағыттарымыз, біз осы энергия көздері жанғыш қазбаларынан болуынан қорықпауымыз керек.” Ал енді байрақтар мен бойтұмарлар алынып қойылып, 174 гектар көлемді көрме аумағы жаңа Халықаралық қаржы орталығын айналдырып, шетелдік компанияларды Англияның құқықтық стандарттары, салық төлеуден босату мен тәуелсіз қаржы сотымен тартуға тырысуда. Бұл - әлем бойынша диктаторлар арқылы қолданып отыратын әдеттегідей “ашық зоналар” үлгісі болып, демократияның нәзік көпіршігін жасап отыратындай болады, ал өзіңіз осы қоршалған аумақтан шыққаныңызда осы көпіршік ғайып болып кетеді. PR есесі қайтарылады ма? Батысқа қарай жылы шырайлы қарау сағымы - Назарбаевтың, Орта Азиядағы бұрынғы совет елдерінің деспоттық басшылар арасында ең жақсысы ретіндегі позициясын бекіту үшін жылдар бойы бар ықыласымен жасауға тырысып жүрген ісі. Тэтчердің ізінен таймай келген Джонатан Аиткен 2009 жылы президенттік өмір баянын жазды - Тони Блэйр, көпшілік білгендей, Назарбаевқа Жаңаөзен мұнайшылар қаласындағы 2011 жылдағы ереуілдеген жұмысшаларды өлтіру сияқты істер мен оқиғалармен не істеу бойынша берген кеңестері үшін әр жылы алатын £ 5 миллион сомасымен рахатқа бөленіп отырған уақытта. (“Осы оқиғалар, қаншама қайғылы болғанына қарамастан,” 2012 Блэйр, Кембридж университетінде сөйлейтін сөзінде “Қазақстанның зор прогресс жасағанына көлеңке салмауы лазым.” деп кеңес берген.) PR үшін жұмсалған ақшаның кейбірінің есесін қайтара алады. 2016 және 2017 жылдары арасында Дүниежүзілік банкінің бизнес дамыту рейтингісінде Қазақстан 51-ші орыннан 35-ші орынға көтеріліп кетті. Алайда, әлемдегі баспасөз бостандығы тізімінде Қазақстан 180 елдің ішінде тек қана 157-ші орында, ал Сыбайлас жемқорлықты қабылдау индексі бойынша 131-ші орында батып тұрып қалған. Енді жасы 77 келген Назарбаев бұрынғыға қарағанда одан да қатал шаралар қабылдап, сыншылардың ауызын жауып және оппозицияны басып жоя отыра, өзінің есейген жасына қарамай, өзінің паранойя мен барлық нәрселерді тексеріп отырғысы келетінін одан да шиеленестіріп отыр. Адам құқықтарын қорғайтын “Human Rights Watch” ұйымының айтуы бойынша, Назарбаевтың 25 жыл бойы билік еткен уақытында тәуелсіз бақылаушылар арқылы ерікті және әділді өткен деп бағаланған бірде бір сайлаулар өткізілмеген. Президент өз-өзін заңдарды орындаудан босатып, президенттік мерзімдерін қысқартып, соңғы сайлауда дауыстардың 97.7% ие болды. Негізгі оппозициялық газеттердің барлығына 2013 жылы тыйым салынып, ал интернет қазіргі уақытта мұқият түрде тексеріліп отырады. Үкімет тарапынан ұсынылған жер реформасына қарсы 2016 жылы өткізілген бейбіт наразылық осы протесттерді ұйымдастырушылардың екеуі бес жылға түрмеге қамалған. Осы жылдың мамыр айында үкіметті сынаған белгілі сыншы мен журналистке, оның Астана қаласына еуропалық дипломаттарына түрмеге қамалған белсенді тұлғалар мен журналисттері бойынша ақпарат беру үшін бара жатқан жолында түнгі пойызбен жүріп келе жатқан уақытында екі белгісіз шабуылшы пышақпен шабуыл жасалған. “Елімізде демократияның жоқ болуы Астана көшелерінде сезіледі,” дейді Нұрмақов. “Президент әрі қарай да теледидар арқылы көрсетілетін жобалау жиналыстарында төрағалық етіп отыра берсе, әр жоба бойынша соңғы шешімді тек өзі ғана қабылдай берсе, қала үшін керек болған нәрселері мен ақшаның жұмсалу бағыттары бойынша ешбір дискуссия өткізіле алынбайтын болады.” Ал Назарбаев болса жобалаудың демократиялық түрде өткізілуіне талаптанбайды да. “Елордамыздың дизайн және жалпы көрініс сұрақтарына келсек,” өзінің “Еуразия жүрегінде” деп аталған кітабында жазғандай, “мен осындай сұрақтар бойынша шешімдер ең алдымен биліктің орталық органдары арқылы қабылдануы керек деп ойлаймын.” “Біз Қазақстанда ешқашан ешбір ұйым үшін тікелей жұмыс істеген емеспіз” “Foster and Partners” компаниясының Лондон қаласының батыс аумағындағы офистерінде Темза үстінен қарап тұратын үлкен домалақ жиналыс үстелі үстінде Астана қаласының бейбітшілік сарайының алып пирамидасы үлкен экран үстінде жыпылықтап жанып тұр. Apple кампусының үлгісі көршілес үстелде тұр, оның негізгі геометриялық нысаны мен алып көлемі осы ғимаратқа да Назарбаев тәсілдемесін беріп тұр. “2004 жылдың жазында бізге сол уақытта Кап Ферратта болған Норман телефон соқты,” деп бас серіктесі Найджел Данси есіне түсіріп отыр. “Ол бізге “Қазақстан президенті пирамиданың салынуын қалайды” деп айтты. Пирамида ғимараты 21 айдан кейін дайын болуы керек. Қиялдарыңды еркіне жіберіңдер.” Олар алғашқы жобасы, шамамен Ұлы Гиза пирамидасының мөлшеріндей, көлденеңінен 227 метр, бойынша презентациясын өткізу үшін Астанаға ұшып кетті, бірақ осы мөлшерлер тіпті Назарбаев үшін де тым үлкен болып шықты. Жоба асығыс түрде қонақ үй холлында өзгертіліп, мөлшері алғашқы жобаның дерлік ширегіне азайтылып, президенттің батасын алу үшін тапсырылды. Олардың Астана бойынша көлікпен бүкіл қаланы принтермен басып шығару жерін іздеп шыққандары туралы оқиғаларын естігеннен кейін мен олардың бюросы осындай саяси режимдер үшін жұмыс істеуді қалай ақтай алатындығы туралы сұрадым. “Біз Қазақстанда ешқашан ешбір ұйым үшін тікелей жұмыс істеген емеспіз,” Данси суық үнімен жауап берді. “Біздің клиентіміз әрқашан түрік мердігері, Sembol компаниясы, болып келіп, олар жұмысшыларына өте жақсы жалақы төлеген.” Компанияның дизайн бойынша бастығы Давид Нельсон өз пікірінде: “Бізге Қазақстаннан алғашқы рет қоңырау соққанда, бұл ел Amnesty International ұйымының тізімінде біршама жоғарыда болған еді” деп айтты. “Бұл ел басқа елдер арасында орта позициясында жақынырақ бола тұрып, біз және бірқатар басқа адамдар ол елде жақсы жұмыс істей алдық. Әрине, біз адамдарға зиян келтіретін немесе адамдарды ауыр жағдайларға қоя алатын заттарды ешбір түрде қолдауға ынталанбаймыз.” Мен олардың “басқа да жаман адамдар үшін де жұмыс істейміз, олардың кейбіреулері тіпті одан жаман” айтылған сөздері жәй ғана өз-өздерін ақтау үшін ғана емес, осы монументтер Назарбаев үшін салған монументтері, ешбір қоғамдық пайдасына арналмаған ғимараттар болып келіп, “Foster and Partners” компаниясы осы қазіргі саяси режимнің күшейтілуіне тартылып қатысқан деп тұспалдадым. “ Сіз әлем діндері арасындағы бейбітшілікті нығайту үшін сарай жобасын қағазда салғаныңызда,” Данси жалғастырды, “бұл өте ардақты міндет секілді естіледі. Сонымен, біз жақсы іс жасадық. Ал енді Хан-Шатырды алайық – миллиондаған адамдар ауыр климат жағдайларында бара алып, уақыттарын жақсы өткізе алатындай бір берік ғимаратты жобалай алсаңыз – бұл да жақсы бір іс.” Ал Назарбаев орталығының құндылығы туралы ол аса сөйлескісі келмеді. Оның тарихындағы болған қиын жағдай оның себебін көрсете алуы мүмкін. 2009 жылы Бьярке Ингельс арқылы басқарылған, талғамға сай даниялық “BIG” фирмасы Астана қаласындағы ұлттық кітапханасының, Мёбиустың гравитацияға бағынбайтын таспасы, білімнің “шексіз циклы” ретінде ойластырып жобаланған ғимараты бәсекесінде Фостер компаниясы мен Заха Хадидтің компаниясынан басып озып кеткен. Бірақ Ингельстің дүние сезінуі іс-әрекеттер Қазақстанда өткізілетін тәсілдеріне сай болмауы көрінеді. Өзінің Нью-Йоркта берген бір сұхбатында ол клиент асығыстықты талап етіп, шындыққа сай болатын келісім-шартына қол қоюды басқа уақытқа қалдыра отырып, кітапхананың ішкі дизайнына ешбір түрде қызығушылық көрсетпеген. Ол журналға берген сұхбатында Қазақстанда жұмыс істеген уақытта одан пара беру талап етілді деп айтқан. Жобадан шығып – Фостер арқылы ауыстырылу алдында олар тек қана ғимарат фундаменттері мен лифттер үшін арналған төрт шахталарын салып үлгерген. Ғимарат жобасы асығыспен өзгертіліп, төрт бұрышынан түйістірме шпангоуты салынып, үстін үлкен әйнектік шатыр орналастырылған. Осы тұрғыда ақпараттың көпшілікке қолжетімді болу бойынша президенттің көзқарасын еске келтіре отырып, жобаланған ұлттық кітапханасы Назарбаев орталығында қайта туып, кітап сөрелері алып тасталып, олардың орнына президенттік естеліктері үшін арналған әйнек қораптары қойылғаны еске түседі. Ал Ингельс болса Қазақстанда жұмыс істейтін архитекторлардың барлығына салмағы үш жүз фунт “және қолдары алып мөлшерлі” болған жоба басшысын таңдап атауын кеңес етеді. “Мақтанып, жақсы әсер қалдырғысы келетін бір жасөспірім секілді” Урбанистік космополиттік Алматы қаласының тұрғындары өздерінің солтүстіктегі әріптестеріне еріндерін шүйіріп қарайтын болса, Астана қаласына шалғай аудандарынан келіп, осында тұрып жатқан жастар үшін Астана келешекке деген ғажайып сезімін беріп отырады. “Осында алғашқы рет келгенімде қала біраз бездіретіндей болып көрініп еді,” дейді Қазақстанның шығысында жатқан Өскемен қаласынан келіп, қазір Назарбаев университетінде оқып жатып, Экспо жобасының бір бөлшегі ретінде жобаланып салынған Mega Silk Way сауда ойын-сауық орталығында жүрген Әйгерім Кагарманова. “Бірақ енді осы қала елдің басқа аймақтарына еліміз келешекте қандай бола алатындығын көрсете отырып, үміт бере отырады деп сезіне бастадым. Адамдар осы оғаш ғимараттарды ұнатады, себебі олар қалаға өз ерекшелік сәйкестігін береді. Осы ғимараттар болмағанда қыста желден басқа және жазда масалардан басқа ештеңе болмас еді.” Оның пікрінше, Астананың “бала аурулары” тек қана оның жаңа қала болудың симптомдары. “Бұл қала, өздерін әлемге одан да керемет қылып таныту үшін өздерінің қолдарынан келетінен шамадан артық әрекет етуге тырысатын жасөспірімдер немесе 20 жастағы жас адамдар сияқты.” Үміт белгілері бұрынғы Сауда және индустрия министрі болып, инновацияларды тартатын жолдарын білетін адам атағына ие болған, қазіргі қаланың біршама үдемелі прогрессивтік жаңа әкімі, Асет Исекешев арқылы көріне бастады. Өзінің лауазымындағы алғашқы қадамдары ретінде ол ішінде әлі де совет дәуірінің лебі сезінетін “Астанагенплан” қала жобалау ұйымына біраз жаңа жел беру үшін Урбанизм орталығын құрды. Бұл орталық прогрессивтік жобалау идеялары мен бағыттарын жақсы білетін және қаладағы дамудың жақсартылуына сенімді болған жас архитектор Асқар Садуов арқылы басқарылады. “Елорда әрқашан жоғарыдан төменге қарай жобаланып, және, Өзіңіз көре алғаныңыздай, осындай жобалау жолы лайықты түрде істемейді,” әлі салынатын сфералар, мұнаралар мен ескерткіштерінің алуан сандары әлі де өсіп бара жатқан белағаштарына қарай жайылып бара жатқанын көрсеткен үлкен қала үлгісі үстінен қарап тұрып, деді ол. “Біз қаланы жаяу жүрушілер үшін қолайлы және ыңғайлы қылып, негізгі назарымызды қоғамдық жерлері мен қала айналасында шеткі периферияларының болмауына аударғымыз келеді. Әкімнің пікірінше, “әлемнің танымал архитекторларын” тарту және биік ғимараттарды салу уақыты аяқталды; ол қымбат “жұлдыздар” орнына жас креативті архитекторларды тартуды жөн көреді. Садуов ақкөңіл және таза жүрегімен келешек туралы айтса да, оның шағын тобы әлі де жоғарыдан төменге қарай тым күшті қолмен басқарылып және бағытталып отырған қала жобалау жүйесіне қарсы көп жасай алады деп ойлай алмаймын. Әлемнің танымал жұлдыз архитекторлары мен олардың биік ғимараттары өз жылжуын ентелей жалғастыруда. Бағасы бір миллиард долларына тең болған Абу Даби Плаза қаланың дәл ортасында жерден өсе бастап, жақында 382 метрлік толық биіктігене жететін болады. Араб Эмираттары арқылы қаржыландырылатын ғимарат Орта Азияның ең биік ғимараты болып, мұнай өндіретін мемлекеттерінің қайсысы күштірек болғанын көрсетіп тұрғандай, Байтерек мұнарасын артта қалдырып кететін болады.

Мүмкін мәселе осы сұрақта шығар. Қаланың өз-өзімен дамуына жол берілмеді, себебі қаладағы барлығы Астананың тек қана бір және жалғыз архитекторы арқылы басқарылып отырады.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/britain-donald-trump-hatred-theresa-may-state-visit-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T12:43:22Z","webTitle":"Britain will greet Trump with our biggest ever carnival against hatred | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/britain-donald-trump-hatred-theresa-may-state-visit-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/britain-donald-trump-hatred-theresa-may-state-visit-protests","fields":{"headline":"Britain will greet Trump with our biggest ever carnival against hatred","bodyText":"Protest works. Cast your minds back to that distant political era otherwise known as January 2017. A racist misogynist megalomaniac had just celebrated his inauguration as the 45th president of the United States. Theresa May – overcome with hubris, but yet to be fatally wounded by her nemesis – gallivanted off to the White House and served us up a grotesque love-in with Donald Trump. Her offer of a state visit, an honour never even extended to some presidents, was a PR coup for an already deeply unpopular demagogue. Then came Trump’s Muslim ban, and – with 36 hours’ notice – ten of thousands of us poured on to Britain’s streets in protest. Our message was not just solidarity with those targeted by Trump’s hatred. It was a rejection of xenophobia and racism at home and abroad – and a passionate rejection of May’s government subordinating Britain to the level of Trump’s poodle. Ever since, it has been abundantly clear to the authorities that any visit by Trump to Britain will be met with a mass show of democratic force on the streets. With very little notice, Stop Trump and other campaigns will mobilise protests in every town and city in the country. Trump has the lowest approval ratings of any president since records began eight decades ago. He is loathed and ridiculed by tens of millions of his own people. For May to offer a full state visit to the lying, failing Trump – to use his own terminology – when her own authority has been shattered, would be political suicide. One recent poll suggested that 2 million Brits would protest a state visit. For Trump, too, it would prove an utter humiliation: the United States would see the citizens of their closest ally united with contempt and fury at their unfortunate ruler. Even though my cat has more political nous than the UK government, that’s the conclusion they themselves have come to, and Trump’s visit has been downgraded. If they believe that will prove sufficient, and the protests will be called off, disappointment beckons. Any official visit – even one without pomp and ceremony – will be met with mass protests. For a start, Trump will try to use a visit to what is nominally his closest ally as an attempt to shore up his appalling domestic position. It will be nothing less than a political stunt by an increasingly cornered hatemonger. Indeed, the downgrading of the state visit has left us scenting blood. It is clear that authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are rightly fearful about the response Trump will get. These mass demonstrations, of course, will go far beyond the personality of Trump. They will represent a passionate rejection of anti-Muslim hatred, immigrant-scapegoating and refugee-bashing, not just in the US, but here in Britain, too. They will offer a reminder that powerful vested interests – including plutocrats such as Trump – should be blamed for our social and economic woes, not those fleeing foreign violence and persecution. They will promote feminism and women’s rights in defiance of a self-confessed harasser of women. They will champion the cause of trans rights against the transphobe-in-chief, who has singled out this minority to be excluded from the US military. They will advance the cause of saving the planet from a climate change crisis exacerbated by Trumpism. They will challenge the warmongering of Trump’s administration, which threatens the lives of tens of millions of people. And they will seek to unite progressives from either side of the Atlantic in these common causes. The mirror image of Trumpism will be on the streets. May’s government is weak, shambolic and crisis-ridden. The last thing it wants or needs is mass protests on the streets. As soon as Trump touches down on British soil, this is what will happen. That is their choice. The biggest carnival against hatred this country has ever seen awaits. From LGBT rights to women’s rights, from workers’ rights to anti-racism, we already know that protest works. Both May and Trump deserve to learn this instructive lesson. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/12/liam-fox-only-official-member-new-uk-board-of-trade","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T14:26:23Z","webTitle":"Liam Fox ridiculed for being only member of new UK board of trade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/12/liam-fox-only-official-member-new-uk-board-of-trade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/12/liam-fox-only-official-member-new-uk-board-of-trade","fields":{"headline":"Liam Fox ridiculed for being only member of new UK board of trade","bodyText":"A new board of trade unveiled by the government has been met with derision after it was revealed that the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is the only official member. Announcing the board on Thursday, the Department for International Trade said it would “ensure the benefits of free trade are spread throughout the UK”, naming more than a dozen advisers to the body including former ministers and business leaders. However, the DIT announcement said Fox was the only official member of the board and would be its chair. “Membership of the board of trade is restricted to privy councillors,” the department said. “The only member is: (i) secretary of state for Department of International Trade and president of the board of trade (chair).” Advisers to the board include Collette Roche, the chief of staff at Manchester airport, the former Labour minister Patricia Hewitt, who was president of the board of trade under Tony Blair, and Ian Curle, the chief executive of the Edrington Group, a Scottish spirits company that produces the whisky brand The Famous Grouse. Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said the board was a “job-creation scheme” for Fox. “The secretary of state, no doubt embarrassed by his lack of a real role in government beyond accumulating millions of air miles, has had to invent a grandiose title for himself,” he said. “It will convince nobody. The signing of the first trade deals are years away, whereas the damage to our existing largest trade deal, with the EU, is happening now.” James McGrory, the executive director of the pro-Europe Open Britain campaign, said: “I hope that at the inaugural meeting of the new board of trade, Liam Fox managed to have positive and constructive discussions with Liam Fox, after hearing expert analysis by Dr Liam Fox on the impact of Brexit. “Britain’s trade policy is just the sound of one hand clapping. It would be funny in another context, but not when the government is justifying its decision to damage our trade by leaving the customs union on a mirage of future trade deals. A DIT spokesman said it was a “technicality” that Fox was the sole member of the board, because of a constitutional convention that full membership is only for privy counsellors. “That is why we are drawing on prominent figures from business and politics across the country and not just restricting to privy counsellors, as happened in the past,” he said. A departmental source said advisers would in effect be members and appointed for a year each, with the option to extend for a further two years. In a statement announcing the board at its first meeting at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, Fox said advisers would act as “the ‘eyes and ears’ of the modern business community”. The board will meet four times a year, which he said would guarantee that all parts of the UK have an opportunity to participate. The cabinet’s Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland secretaries are also listed as advisers to the board."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/15/gap-year-guide-see-world-not-debt-life-experience-pay-own-way","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Gap year guide: how to see the world and not end up in debt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/15/gap-year-guide-see-world-not-debt-life-experience-pay-own-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/15/gap-year-guide-see-world-not-debt-life-experience-pay-own-way","fields":{"headline":"Gap year guide: how to see the world and not end up in debt","bodyText":"Taking a gap year either side of university may be the adventure of a lifetime, but you don’t want it to plunge you into a lifetime of debt. With a bit of hard work and careful planning you gain a great experience that will shore up your CV while paying your own way – or at least part of it. The average gap year costs about £5,000, according to research from Charter Savings Bank, which also found that one in three “gappers” plan to raise the necessary funds by working while they are away. Europe is the top destination, attracting 48% of travellers under 25, with 17% going to Australia and New Zealand. So how can you do it? Work abroad … eventually Unless you can dip into the Bank of Mum and Dad, you will need a UK job to earn enough to fund the upfront elements of your trip, including flights, visas and any volunteering project fees. Andreas Kornevall, co-founder of WorkingAbroad, says this will give you practical experience in working and budgeting, but he adds that you don’t need to save heaps of money to begin with. “You might not need as much as you think. For example, you could live in Ecuador for three months on £1,500, plus return flights.” Britons are free to work across the EU – which could change after Brexit – but need working visas for most other countries. “You cannot turn up on a tourist visa and start searching for work, so look for a specific overseas programme,” Kornevall says. The best volunteering options You can apply for volunteering through schemes such as Voluntary Service Overseas or the British Council. Alternatively, try privately run volunteering and internship organisations such as WorkingAbroad, Bunac, GVI, Year Out Group, OysterWorldwide or Gap360, which have projects across Asia, Africa, Australasia and South America. Animal care, conservation, social and youth work, sports coaching, medicine, the arts and teaching are just some of your options. Kornevall says that in effect you work for free and pay for bed and board. “Make sure you learn relevant skills rather than simply picking grapes. If you are interested in becoming a marine biologist or working on a wildlife reserve, try volunteering first.” Stefan Wathan, chief executive of the Year Out Group, says structured experiences are cheaper the longer you go for. “You can pay between £500 and £700 for a week, between £2,000 and £3,000 for four to six weeks, while three to 12 months would cost from £3,000-£8,000.” The best paying overseas jobs For those who want to find paying work while away, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Thailand and China offer some of the best opportunities. David Stitt, managing director of Gap360, says Australian working holidays are popular. “You can get a working holiday visa for up to two years provided you work on a farm at some point for three months. New Zealand also offers working holiday visas though the money isn’t as good.” Canada issues a limited number of working holiday visas each year that tend to be massively oversubscribed. Stitt says getting paid work in the US is hard. “You need someone to sponsor your visa and it isn’t easy.” Roger Salwey, director of Oyster Worldwide, says teaching English in Thailand is popular, though you need to be a graduate. “You also need a minimum four-week Tefl course, but can earn a good wage by local standards.” You can earn from £1,500 a month teaching English in Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, but must be a graduate with Tefl training. You can apply for TEFL jobs in countries as diverse as Ecuador, Egypt, Mexico and Japan. Other paid options include working as a ski or snowboard guide in the Alps, a windsurfing instructor in the Mediterranean, working on cruise ships or even as a house or pet sitter. Check out jobsabroadbulletin.co.uk, seasonworkers.com and goabroad.com. Alternatively, you could take a year out working in the UK either before or after university and get paid for it. The Year in Industry gap year scheme run by the Engineering Development Trust helps students find a paid placement, typically for a year. Salwey says your gap year will teach you life skills and help you in job interviews. “Given the amount of debt students now graduate with, another £3,000 could be a good investment.” Experts warn against taking out a loan to fund your trip, while funding it on a credit card is also risky. A going-away checklist You have to plan ahead carefully to make sure your gap year dream does not end in a financial nightmare. • Only go on flights and packages with Atol or Abta protection. • Book your flight and other advance tickets with a credit card to benefit from protection under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. • Sort out proper gap year travel insurance. “Backpacker insurance for a year abroad may cost less than 50p a day and provide £5m of medical expenses cover plus personal liability and baggage and belongings,” says Matt Sanders at GoCompare. You should research gap year policies on comparison sites such as Travelsupermarket.com, Gocompare.com, and Money.co.uk, or try student insurer Endsleigh. • Annual multi-trip travel insurance is not suitable for a gap year. Most of these policies set a single trip maximum of just 30 days, says Sanders. “If you plan to work, or do adventurous activities such as scuba diving or whitewater rafting, make sure the policy covers you,” he says. Also check whether items such as smartphones and tablets are covered, as many policies set a maximum of £250 or less for single items or may not cover them. • Check all expiry dates before leaving, such as credit cards and passport. • Get the right card for spending abroad. Most conventional bank cards apply extra charges for overseas use, which can add up to 3% on everything you buy. The Creation Everyday, Santander Zero and Halifax Clarity cards have no foreign use charges anywhere in the world, including cash withdrawals. Always tell your bank you are travelling because if it suddenly spots transactions in exotic destinations it may block your card as a precaution against fraud. • Consider loading money on to a prepaid travel money card. You can check your balance online and family members can top it up if you are running low on cash. Taking a leap of faith Adam Wiltshire has shown it is possible to take a year out without plunging yourself into a world of debt. Adam, now 31, took a gap year in autumn 2005 before starting his degree in economics and politics at the University of Sheffield. “Knowing I had a degree lined up gave me the confidence to do it.” He earned enough from his bar job in a local golf club to fund three months’ travel through China, Tibet, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Bali, followed by Christmas in Australia and finally New Zealand. Crucially, Adam and his travel buddy Andy Gill had earned enough to pay for their flights back from New Zealand – essential to secure a working holiday visa. Adam found bar work in Auckland and also got a job for a base jumping operation, where his interview involved jumping 192 metres off the Sky Tower. “I ended up jumping 201 times off that tower to show customers what it was like.” Adam worked for about £4 an hour in his bar job, but it was fun and with few outgoings he and Andy raised enough to drive around New Zealand for a month, then spend two weeks in the Cook Islands. Adam, who now works in digital marketing, recommends having a positive attitude and going for long enough to get a job. “Get your paperwork in order and be charming and persistent. Work where there is better money and travel for longer in cheaper locations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2017/oct/13/the-scientists-persuading-terrorists-to-spill-their-secrets","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"The scientists persuading terrorists to spill their secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/13/the-scientists-persuading-terrorists-to-spill-their-secrets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/oct/13/the-scientists-persuading-terrorists-to-spill-their-secrets","fields":{"headline":"The scientists persuading terrorists to spill their secrets","bodyText":"In 2013, a British man was arrested for planning to kidnap and brutally murder a soldier. The suspect, who had a criminal history, had posted messages on social media in support of violent jihad. In a search of his residence, the police had found a bag containing a hammer, a kitchen knife and a map with the location of a nearby army barracks. Shortly after his arrest, the suspect was interviewed by a counter-terrorist police officer. The interviewer wanted him to provide an account of his plan, and to reveal with whom, if anyone, he has been conspiring. But the detainee – we will call him Diola – refused to divulge any information. Instead, he expounded grandiloquently on the evils of the British state for 42 minutes, with little interruption. When the interviewer attempted questions, Diola responded with scornful, finger-jabbing accusations of ignorance, naivety and moral weakness: “You don’t know how corrupt your own government is – and if you don’t care, then a curse upon you.” Watching a video of this encounter, it is just possible to discern Diola’s desire, beneath his ranting, to tell what he knows. In front of him, a copy of the Qur’an lies open. He says he was acting for the good of the British people, and that he is willing to talk to the police because, as a man of God, he wants to prevent future atrocities. But he will not answer questions until he is sure that his questioner cares about Britain as much as he does: “The purpose of the interview is not to go through your little checklist so you can get a pat on the head. If I find you are a jobsworth, we are done talking, so be sincere.” Even distanced by years from the events in question, it is impossible to watch the encounter without feeling tense. Periodically, Diola turns away from the interviewer and goes silent, or gets up and leaves the room, having taken offence at something said or not said. Each time he returns, Diola’s solicitor advises him not to speak. Diola ignores him, though in a sense he takes the advice: despite the verbiage, he tells his interviewer nothing. Diola: “Tell me why I should tell you. What is the reason behind you asking me this question?” Interviewer: “I am asking you these questions because I need to investigate what has happened and know what your role was in these events.” Diola: “No, that’s your job – not your reason. I’m asking you why it matters to you.” The interviewer, who has remained heroically calm in the face of Diola’s verbal barrage, is not able to move the encounter out of stalemate, and eventually his bosses replace him. When the new interviewer takes a seat, Diola repeats his promise to talk “openly and honestly” to the right person, and resumes his inquisitorial stance. “Why are you asking me these questions?” he says. “Think carefully about your reasons.” The new interviewer does not answer directly, but something about his opening speech triggers a change in Diola’s demeanour. “On the day we arrested you,” he began, “I believe that you had the intention of killing a British soldier or police officer. I don’t know the details of what happened, why you may have felt it needed to happen, or what you wanted to achieve by doing this. Only you know these things Diola. If you are willing, you’ll tell me, and if you’re not, you won’t. I can’t force you to tell me – I don’t want to force you. I’d like you to help me understand. Would you tell me about what happened?” The interviewer opens up his notebook, and shows Diola the empty pages. “You see? I don’t even have a list of questions.” “That is beautiful,” Diola says. “Because you have treated me with consideration and respect, yes I will tell you now. But only to help you understand what is really happening in this country.” * * * For years, any debate over what constitutes effective interrogation has been dominated by a pervasive folk belief in coercion. From NYPD Blue to 24 and Zero Dark Thirty, we are trained in the idea that interrogators get the job done by intimidating, demoralising and, when necessary, brutalising their subjects. Steven Kleinman, a former army colonel and one of the US military’s most prolific and experienced interrogators, told me it is not just the public that is influenced by popular narratives: “Politicians, policy-makers, senior military officers – people who have never conducted interrogations are somehow just convinced they know what works.” In 2003, Kleinman tried to stop his fellow soldiers from conducting abusive interrogations of Iraqi insurgents; he later became the first military officer to speak out against such practices. He did so not just because he thought they were wrong, but because he thought they were stupid. Kleinman believes that coercion is counterproductive, because it destroys the trust that underpins a successful interview. Most specialist practitioners agree, as do the scientists who study interrogation. But conventional wisdom in military and law enforcement circles has been very hard to shift. This is because it is difficult to prove what works. High-stakes interrogations take place in secret, and have rarely been available to objective researchers. In place of cool analysis, colourful but unreliable stories of vital secrets wrenched from fearful suspects have prevailed. In reality, well-run interrogations are rarely dramatic: drama thrives on conflict – something professional interrogators strive to avoid. A body of scientific literature supports Kleinman’s view, but most of it is based on laboratory experiments, in which students are asked to pretend they have just robbed a bank and interrogators are asked to believe them. The virtue of these experiments is that they allow for controlled trials of specific interrogation techniques; the drawback is that they are easily dismissed by practitioners as academic game-playing. Now, two British researchers are quietly revolutionising the study and practice of interrogation. Earlier this year, in a meeting room at the University of Liverpool, I watched a video of the Diola interview alongside Laurence Alison, the university’s chair of forensic psychology, and Emily Alison, a professional counsellor. My permission to view the tape was negotiated with the counter-terrorist police, who are understandably wary of allowing outsiders access to such material. Details of the interview have been changed to protect the identity of the officers involved, though the quotes are verbatim. The Alisons, husband and wife, have done something no scholars of interrogation have been able to do before. Working in close cooperation with the police, who allowed them access to more than 1,000 hours of tapes, they have observed and analysed hundreds of real-world interviews with terrorists suspected of serious crimes. No researcher in the world has ever laid hands on such a haul of data before. Based on this research, they have constructed the world’s first empirically grounded and comprehensive model of interrogation tactics. The Alisons’ findings are changing the way law enforcement and security agencies approach the delicate and vital task of gathering human intelligence. “I get very little, if any, pushback from practitioners when I present the Alisons’ work,” said Kleinman, who now teaches interrogation tactics to military and police officers. “Even those who don’t have a clue about the scientific method, it just resonates with them.” The Alisons have done more than strengthen the hand of advocates of non-coercive interviewing: they have provided an unprecedentedly authoritative account of what works and what does not, rooted in a profound understanding of human relations. That they have been able to do so is testament to a joint preoccupation with police interviews that stretches back more than 20 years. Pausing the Diola video, Emily Alison grimaced. “I call this one ‘the Hannibal Lecter interview’,” she said. “He wants a piece of the interviewer. When I watched this tape the first time I had to switch it off and walk away. I was so outraged, my heart was pounding in my chest. Of course, if you’re in the room, it’s 1,000 times worse.” Laurence Alison nodded. “As the interviewer, you’re bound to have an emotional response,” he said. “What you want to say is, ‘You’re the one in the fucking seat, not me. He’s trying to control you, so you try and control him. But then it escalates.” The moment that an interrogation turns into an argument, it fails. “You need to remember what your purpose in that room is,” said Emily. “You’re seeking information. You’re not there to speak on behalf of the victims or the police. You might feel better for getting angry, but down that road is retribution. You become the inquisitioner. That’s not why you’re there. If you find yourself having a go at someone, ask yourself: ‘What am I achieving by this?’ Because they will stop talking to you.” With us on the day we watched the video was an officer in Britain’s counter-terrorist police force with whom the Alisons have been working closely to train an elite cadre of interviewers. “A big thing we talk about is leaving your ego at the door,” he said. “But that’s tough, because cops are used to being in control.” * * * Emily met Laurence at the University of Liverpool in 1996, shortly after arriving in the UK from her home in Wisconsin. She had applied to join the Madison police force, which she saw as a stepping stone to the FBI, but opted at the last minute to take a masters in “investigative psychology” – the application of psychology to police work (Liverpool was then one of the few institutions in the world to offer it). “This wasn’t long after Silence of the Lambs,” said Emily. “I wanted to be the new Clarice Starling.” Laurence was a PhD student in the department of forensic psychology, and already a rising star after his contribution to a high-profile public inquiry. In 1993, Colin Stagg was wrongfully accused of the rape and murder of a young mother called Rachel Nickell, on Wimbledon Common. Despite an absence of forensic evidence linking Stagg to the murder, the police made Stagg their prime suspect after deciding that he matched an “offender profile” created by a psychologist. A covert operation was designed to entrap Stagg, involving an undercover female police officer feigning romantic interest. After the case was thrown out and the police had acknowledged their mistake, Laurence assisted the subsequent inquiry by exposing the pseudoscience on which the profile was based. (In 2008, a convicted killer called Robert Napper was found guilty of the crime.) As part of his research he watched a video of Stagg’s interview, conducted by the police at the time of Stagg’s first arrest, and he was appalled by what he saw. The interviewers, who had clearly made up their mind that Stagg was guilty, were aggressive, insulting, and asked questions that were not designed to find out what the suspect knew but to trip him up or intimidate him into confessing. After failing to do either, they released Stagg and decided to entrap him. In 1998, Emily and Laurence got married. Laurence continued his academic career. Emily, who had worked as a counsellor in Wisconsin prisons, joined the Cheshire probation service, and later started a consultancy, helping social workers counsel families afflicted by domestic abuse. Alongside their day jobs, the Alisons started collaborating on criminal cases. Historically, the British police have called on outside experts to help with investigations, but have sometimes ended up listening to quacks. After the Stagg inquiry, however, a list of accredited consultants was drawn up, and Laurence Alison was on it. Every couple of months or so he would get a call, and a question. “It might be, can you help us with this rape in Bath, or a murder in West Mercia,” Laurence said. The police often wanted to know the best way to interview a particular suspect or witness, usually after an initial attempt had gone badly. Laurence would ask for assistance from Emily, who knew a lot about interviewing difficult people, thanks to her background in counselling. The Alisons would read transcripts, watch video footage, and sometimes monitor interviews in real time, assessing the dynamics of the encounter, searching for a way to get the interviewee to open up. They gained a reputation for offering useful advice. Their first involvement with the counter-terrorist force came in 2004, when they helped police in Northern Ireland investigate the Northern Bank robbery, in which armed raiders, thought to be connected to the IRA, stole £26.5m from bank vaults in Belfast. In 2010, Laurence was contacted by a US government agency that was commissioning research into interrogation. The High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, or HIG, was set up in 2009 by President Obama, keen to signal a clean break from the Bush administration, which had sanctioned abusive interrogations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Housed within the FBI, the HIG’s purpose is to ground interrogation in science. “The last time the US government invested in studying interrogation was 1956,” Steven Kleinman, who works with the HIG, told me. “Great leaps forward in behaviour science have just passed us by,” he said. “Imagine using 1956 technology for signals intelligence!” One consequence has been the triumph of bad science. In Afghanistan, after the 9/11 attacks, military psychologists Dr James Mitchell and Dr John Jessen devised and ran a programme of brutal interrogation techniques for the CIA, based on their own poorly evidenced theories of what works. The HIG’s chief researchers were particularly interested in Britain, whose counter-terrorist police have earned a reputation for being sophisticated interviewers, partly because the opposite was once true. In 1992, after public enquiries into two miscarriages of justice involving IRA attacks had revealed abusive interrogation practices, parliament passed laws stipulating all interviews be recorded, and making it an automatic right to have a solicitor present. With the option of coercion effectively removed, the British police were forced to think harder about the best way to obtain information from prisoners resistant to giving it. In a minor but significant change they stopped using the word “interrogation”, with its confrontational overtone, and replaced it with “interview”. The HIG invited Laurence to apply to them for research funding. “I said, I don’t want to do research on students. I want to look at the real thing and extract, from observation, what works.” He set his sights on an audacious goal: persuading the national counter-terrorism unit to give him access to video of its interviews with terrorist suspects. Two years and over 100 phone calls later, in 2012, he secured an appointment with the officer in charge of interviewing. Laurence told him that by studying his team’s methods, he could establish definitively which tactics were effective and which were not. He also offered to use the resulting evidence base to design training that would hone the skills of even specialist interviewers. The officer listened, and following a negotiation over terms, granted access to 181 interviews, a total of 878 hours of tape (further interviews were shared with the Alisons later, including the one I was allowed to view). They included Irish paramilitaries, al-Qaida operatives, far-right extremists, incompetent bunglers caught up in something they didn’t understand, and highly dangerous operatives. The tapes were housed in a secure police facility in Yorkshire, and the Alisons were not permitted to move them. They took turns to visit, often accompanied by a research assistant, Stamatis Elntib. The police officer assigned to monitor them that day would meet them at the door, then sit with them in the small viewing room as they watched hours of video. After a full day of this, whichever Alison was on duty would check into the nearby Premier Inn, sleep, and return to the facility in the morning for another day’s work. Each interview had to be minutely analysed according to an intricate taxonomy of interrogation behaviours, developed by the Alisons. Every aspect of the interaction between interviewee and interviewer (or interviewers – sometimes there are two) was classified and scored. They included the counter-interrogation tactics employed by the suspects (complete silence? humming?), the manner in which the interviewer asked questions (confrontational? authoritative? passive?), the demeanour of the interviewee (dominating? disengaged?), and the amount and quality of information yielded. Data was gathered on 150 different variables in all. Watching and coding all the interviews took eight months. When the process was complete, Laurence passed on the data to Paul Christiansen, a colleague at Liverpool University, who performed a statistical analysis of the results. The most important relationship he measured was between “yield” – information elicited from the suspect – and “rapport” – the quality of the relationship between interviewer and interviewee. For the first time, a secure, empirical basis was established for what had, until then, been something between a hypothesis and an insider secret: rapport is the closest thing interrogators have to a truth serum. * * * In 1943, Major Sherwood Moran, of the US Marines, published a memorandum on the interrogation of enemy prisoners of war, and distributed it to troops throughout the Pacific theatre. Moran was a missionary who had raised a family in Tokyo before the war. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, he was 56, and living in Boston. Realising that his fluency in Japanese language and culture might be helpful to the American war effort, he joined the Marines. Moran soon became known as an unusually effective interrogator of Japanese soldiers, who were famously resistant interviewees. Like Islamist terrorists today, the Japanese were fanatically, suicidally committed to their cause, and deeply hostile to Americans. In his memo, Moran explained why he eschewed the bullying methods used by other interrogators. He believed that if the prisoner was forcibly reminded he was facing his conqueror, he would be placed “in a psychological position of being on the defensive”. Moran’s premise was that even the most implacable prisoner had a story that he wanted to tell; the interrogator’s job was to create an atmosphere in which he felt willing and able to tell it. The surest way to do that is to treat him as a fellow human being, rather than an enemy: “Make him and his troubles the centre of the stage, not you and your questions of war problems. If he is not wounded or tired out, you can ask him if he has been getting enough to eat. … If he is wounded you have a rare chance. Begin to talk about his wounds. Ask if the doctor has attended to him. Have him show you his wounds or burns.” Moran did not believe in making the prisoner feel scared or powerless. Stripping a prisoner of his dignity merely reinforced his determination not to speak. The aim should instead be to get into his mind and heart – to achieve “intellectual and spiritual rapport”. Today, most experienced interrogators agree. In 2012 the psychologist Melissa Russano asked 42 US interrogators what they believed made for successful interviews. The participants, who responded anonymously, had performed interrogations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with some of the most hardened and resistant interviewees in the world. These are some of their responses: “Being nice is far and away going to be more fruitful than being an asshole. I could scare the crap out of you in the next 10 seconds, if I really wanted to. But you know, what is that going to do?” “You have to present a very empathetic, supportive environment.” “Rapport is what we do. I was trying to think of why I’ve had success, or we as a team have had success with these guys, and I think, in some respect, that they are interested to tell their story – they’re interested to tell the ‘why’. So I think talking to them in a way that is non-judgmental [gets results].” For most of its history, interrogation has been entwined with accusation and retribution. In 16th-century Europe it was used to justify the trial and execution of women accused of witchcraft. Suspects would not avoid torture until they stopped lying and confessed the truth – that is, confessed to whatever wildly implausible crime with which their interrogators arraigned them. The accusations were contrived to resolve communal grievances or satisfy public hunger for justice, however rough. Interrogation was revenge, disguised as truth-seeking. Today, interrogations still get framed as accusatory moral dramas, and not just on TV. American police officers are trained in the Reid Technique, developed in the 1950s by John Reid, a former Chicago cop. In a pre-interrogation interview, the detective assesses a suspect’s credibility by observing his body language, such as fidgeting or eye movements. (There is no evidence these are reliable cues to deceit.) Once he decides that a suspect is lying, the interrogator moves into confrontational mode, in an effort to break the suspect’s resistance. The technique has been consistently associated with false confessions. It survives, at least in part, because it makes the interrogator feel in control, positioning him as a heroic protagonist. Accusatory models of interrogation lay great emphasis on body language, partly because the hostile interviewer has already cut off his richest source of information: words. Aggression kills dialogue, as other participants in the Russano study attest: “Screaming and yelling … puts up a wall.” “Playing the bad cop … doesn’t work. Being nasty, being confrontational, pounding the desk, throwing things. Calling the person names. Just anything that you would expect that would just turn somebody off from wanting to talk to you.” Despite its reputation among elite practitioners, “rapport” has been vaguely defined and poorly understood. It is often conflated with simply being nice – Laurence Alison refers to this, derisively, as the “cappuccinos and hugs” theory. In fact, he observes, interviewers can fail because they are too nice, acquiescing too quickly to the demands of a suspect, or neglecting to pursue a line of purposeful questioning at a vital moment. The best interviewers are versatile: they know when to be sympathetic, when to be direct and forthright. What they rarely do is impose their will on the interviewee, either overtly, through aggression, or covertly, through the use of “tricks” – techniques of unconscious manipulation, which make the interviewer feel smart but are often seen through by interviewees. Above all, rapport, in the sense used by the Alisons, describes an authentic human connection. “You’ve got to mean it,” is one of Laurence’s refrains. The Alisons named their research project Orbit (Observing Rapport-based Interpersonal Techniques). Part of its purpose is to provide an anatomy of rapport, the better to understand what creates and destroys it. At the heart of the Alisons’ model is an insight from a neighbouring field. During the years when she worked on police cases with Laurence, Emily Alison had come to see interrogation as a close relation of addiction counselling. Both involve getting someone who does not want to be in the same room as you to talk about something they do not want to talk about. Around two decades ago, the practice of addiction counselling was transformed by the application of a simple principle: patients should feel responsible for their choices. Emily wondered if it wasn’t time for interrogation to catch up. * * * In 1980, a 23-year-old South African called Stephen Rollnick started work as a nurse’s aid in a rehabilitation centre for alcoholics. The clinicians shared a confrontational approach to the job. They believed their clients were lying to themselves, and others, about the severity of their problem. Before setting the patient on the road to recovery, the clinician needed to challenge the patient on their dishonesty and strip away their illusions – to break their resistance. This clinic was hardly atypical. The post-war medical consensus on addiction treatment regarded patients as wayward children who needed to be taught how to behave. The counsellor’s job was to tell the addict the truth about their condition, and, if they denied it, to do so again more forcefully until they accepted it. To Rollnick, this seemed bound to poison the relationship. In the coffee room, he observed that the off-duty conversations of the counsellors were imbued with disdain for their patients. One of the clients under Rollnick’s care was an alcoholic called Anthony, who would leave group sessions having barely said a word. One day, he walked out for the last time. Rollnick discovered the next morning that Anthony had shot his wife and then himself in front of their young children. Shattered, Rollnick resigned from the centre, left South Africa, and settled in the UK, where he embarked on a course in clinical psychology at Cardiff University. A couple of years in, Rollnick came across a new paper written by a young American psychologist called William Miller, and was startled by how much he agreed with it. Miller argued that counsellors were having precisely the wrong kind of conversation with their clients. Addicts were caught between a desire to change and a desire to maintain their habit. As soon as they felt themselves being judged or instructed, they produced all the reasons they did not want to change. That isn’t a pathology, Miller argued, it’s human nature: the more we feel someone trying to persuade us to do something, the more we dwell on the reasons we should not. By insisting on change, the counsellor was making himself feel better, while reinforcing the addict’s determination to carry on. Miller argued that rather than instigating confrontation, counsellors should focus on building a relationship of trust and mutual understanding, enabling the patient to talk through his experiences without feeling the need to defend himself. Eventually, and with the counsellor gently shaping the dialogue, the part of the patient that wanted to get better would overcome the part that did not, and he would make the arguments for change himself. Having done so, he would be motivated to follow through on them. Miller called this approach “motivational interviewing” (MI). Rollnick used Miller’s method in his clinical practice, with encouraging results. On meeting Miller at a conference, he told him about his enthusiasm for MI. The two men wrote a book together, developing the ideas in Miller’s paper. Motivational Interviewing revolutionised the field of counselling and therapy, and its techniques became widely practised. Empirical studies found MI to be a far more effective treatment than traditional methods. Implicit in Miller and Rollnick’s critique of traditional counselling was the uncomfortable suggestion that counsellors should turn their professional gaze upon themselves and question their own instinct to dominate. Instead of thinking of himself as an expert sitting in judgment, the counsellor needed to adopt the more humble position of co-investigator. As Miller put it to me, “The premise is not ‘I have you what you need, let me give it to you.’ It’s ‘You have what you need and we’ll find it.’ The patient must feel “autonomous” – the author of their own actions. Emily Alison, who had trained in MI while working as a counsellor for the probation service in Wisconsin, noticed that interrogations failed or succeeded for similar reasons as therapeutic sessions. Interrogators who made an adversary out of their subject left the room empty-handed; those who made them a partner yielded information. The best ones suspended moral judgment and conveyed genuine curiosity. She concluded that the detainee, like the addict, wants to feel free, despite or rather because of their confinement, and that the interviewer should help them do so. The Alisons’ analysis of the terrorist tapes confirmed this. One of their most striking findings is that suspects are likelier to talk when the interviewer emphasises their right not to. “The more pressure you put on a person, the less likely they are to speak to you. You need to make them feel responsible for their choices,” said Laurence. “You can’t bullshit, you’ve got to mean it.” He slips into character. “Ian, you don’t have to speak to me today. Whether you do or not isn’t up to me. It isn’t up to your solicitor. It’s up to you. “These are powerful tools to get inside someone’s head,” said Laurence. “But they’re not tricks. You have to be genuinely curious. There’s a reason this person has ended up opposite you, and it’s not just because they’re evil. If you’re not interested in what that is, you’re not going to be a good interrogator.” * * * Within a two-week stretch early in the summer of this year, Manchester and London were struck by terrorist attacks. In the days that followed there was an urgent push to uncover any networks in which the perpetrators – now dead – were enmeshed. Anyone who had been in contact with them needed to be wrung for information. The burden of that task fell to a select group of specialist interviewers, drawn from counter-terrorist units across the country. Something they had in common is that they were all alumni of the Alcyone course, an intensive six-day workshop designed by the Alisons in partnership with the police. More than 150 officers have now taken the course, which a counter-terrorist officer told me was by far the best interrogation training the police have ever had. At the heart of the Alcyone course is a series of role-play exercises. Actors from a company called Characters, which specialises in professional role-playing, take the parts of interviewees. The roles might include a gang boss with ties to terrorists, or a young woman who has been sharing extremist propaganda on social media. The attendees are sent into the room with instructions to elicit specific information. They are told something about the “suspect”, but they don’t know what kind of character they are about to interview. It might be someone sullen and monosyllabic, fiercely belligerent, or charming but evasive. The simulations are intended to be as testing as possible. “We wanted to create something harder than the real world,” says Laurence. The actors, who have done the course many times, are now highly experienced interviewees, and expert at needling, provoking or eluding their inquisitors. As soon as an encounter begins, its fictional nature is almost completely forgotten; even veteran interviewers can be pushed to the edge of self-control. Course facilitators, observing from outside the room, intervene when necessary. “Sometimes we design a character that will press the buttons of that particular person,” says Laurence. “We want to see if they can emotionally self-regulate under pressure.” Simply put, can they stop themselves losing it? Studies of interrogation are often preoccupied with the question of how to detect deception, but even a lie is information; the hard problem for an interrogator is a suspect who says nothing. As one counter-terrorist officer who worked with the Alisons told Laurence, “I don’t care if they’re lying. I just want them to talk.” Terrorists can say nothing in a variety of ways. Irish paramilitaries were trained to focus their gaze on a spot on the wall and remain utterly silent. Some suspects give only monosyllabic answers, or stick to scripted responses, or simply turn their chair around, presenting the interviewer with the back of their head (Laurence demonstrated this to me – even in the context of make-believe, it was deeply unsettling). Islamic extremists, like Diola, are prone to long ideological rants. All such tactics have the potential to be doubly effective, because they get under the skin of the interviewer, throwing him off his plan by goading him into anger. On the opening day of the Alcyone course, Laurence introduces the research and gives a crash course in “interpersonal psychology”, which is concerned with communication and how it breaks down. An interviewee – who might be hostile, cooperative, terrified, or some combination of the above – exerts an emotional force on the interviewer that is hard to resist. Skilled interrogators are adept at managing their own automatic responses, like sailors able to ride the sudden swells of a choppy sea. The premise of interpersonal psychology is that in any conversation, the participants are asking for status – to feel respected and listened to – and communion – to feel liked and understood. “Power, love,” says Laurence. “The fundamental elements of all human behaviour.” Conversations only go well when both parties feel they are getting their fair share of each. A father who opens the door to his daughter when she comes home late might adopt a confrontational style, implicitly inviting a contrite response. But his daughter, feeling her agency being denied, pushes back, which provokes her father’s anger. A power struggle ensues, until the conversation terminates with one or both stomping off to their bedroom. If the father had emphasised his love for his daughter, a conversation about acceptable norms might have developed. But doing so isn’t easy, partly because children know exactly which buttons to press. “I tell (the police), if you can deal with teenagers you can deal with terrorists,” says Laurence. As we were talking, Laurence stepped into role, pointing at my notepad. “Can I have that?” Instinctively, I shook my head. “Why not? Give me a couple of sheets of paper.” I declined. Laurence raised his voice: “Oh come on, are you fucking joking?” I felt trapped, unable to think of a reason not to give him paper but unwilling to back down. Giving it to him felt like a small humiliation. “It’s a classic test of autonomy,” explained Lawrence. “People don’t like being controlled, and sometimes they put something in the room, like, ‘I want a notebook’, to disrupt the balance of power. If you don’t deal with it, it becomes a roadblock. So either give him the paper or explain why you won’t.” An interview fails when it becomes a struggle for dominance, in which the interviewee’s way of asserting himself is to tell his interviewer nothing. “In a tug of war, the harder you pull, the harder they pull,” says Laurence. “My suggestion is, let go of the rope.” I thought back to how Diola’s second interviewer had opened him up: Only you know these things Diola. If you are willing, you’ll tell me, and if you’re not, you won’t. I can’t force you to tell me – I don’t want to force you. I’d like you to help me understand. Would you tell me about what happened? • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/13/romania-anti-gay-marriage-campaign-kim-davis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:30:24Z","webTitle":"Anti-gay marriage clerk Kim Davis takes her fight from Kentucky to Romania","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/13/romania-anti-gay-marriage-campaign-kim-davis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/13/romania-anti-gay-marriage-campaign-kim-davis","fields":{"headline":"Anti-gay marriage clerk Kim Davis takes her fight from Kentucky to Romania","bodyText":"A referendum on banning same-sex marriage has drawn international anti-gay marriage campaigners to Romania including Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk briefly jailed for refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples. Davis is on a nine-day tour of Romania before a referendum to be held before the end of the year on a proposed amendment to the country’s constitution, which would rule out any possibility of legalising same-sex marriage. Liberty Counsel, an Orlando-based anti-LGBT Christian group that represented Davis in her 2015 court battle, said she and another group member were speaking in two major Romanian cities and had met Orthodox church archbishops. Romania’s civil code prohibits same-sex partnership and civil partnerships are not recognised, but the constitution – which defines marriage as “between spouses” – is gender neutral so could in theory allow gay unions at some future stage. After a campaign by the Coalition for the Family – many of whose 40 member groups have links to the Orthodox church or promote the “traditional family” – a petition calling for a referendum on constitutional change gathered 3m signatures in 2015 – six times the number required to put the demand before parliament. “We have the constitutional right and moral obligation to defend the family from trends in modern society that reduce its importance and accelerate its decline,” the organisation’s website says. It wants the constitution amended to define marriage as union between “a man and a woman”. The petition is being examined by Romania’s constitutional court but, with the support of all major political parties, is thought almost certain to win parliamentary backing, allowing the referendum to take place possibly as early as next month. The powerful leader of Romania’s ruling Social Democratic party (PSD), Liviu Dragnea, has said the government was committed to the change and plans to hold the referendum this autumn. “Even if some of my colleagues in Brussels are unhappy about it, we will make it happen,” he said last month. A turnout of more than 30% would ensure the constitutional change goes ahead, to the alarm of Romanian civil rights groups, who have argued the referendum’s only aim is to “incite public opinion against LGBT people” and have criticised it as an erosion of Romanian democracy. Respect, a civic platform of about 100 pro-rights groups formed this summer to fight the amendment, said the referendum must be opposed. “We are seeing a determined attempt to use religion or traditional themes to oppose human rights,” said the platform’s founder, Cristian Pârvulescu. “We know how this ends.” The move would also bring Bucharest into a potentially broader conflict with the European Union, already concerned by the increasingly illiberal, socially conservative and even authoritarian drift of some eastern European governments such as those in Hungary and Poland. At least two US-based conservative Christian groups, including Liberty Counsel and Alliance Defending Freedom, have reportedly provided advice to Romania’s Coalition for the Family, submitting legal opinions backing the referendum to the country’s constitutional court. Harry Mihet, Liberty Counsel’s vice-president of legal affairs, was accompanying Davis – who spent five days in prison for refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples in Rowan County, Kentucky – on her visit. “Their message is simple and based upon the recent lessons learned in the United States,” the group said in a statement. “Same-sex ‘marriage’ and freedom of conscience are mutually exclusive, because those who promote the former have zero tolerance for the latter.” Liberty Counsel is primarily a legal advocacy group. In the US, Liberty Counsel is active in defending the practice of reparative therapy, a discredited and potentially harmful form of counselling that attempts to “convert” a person’s sexual orientation from gay, lesbian or bisexual to straight. Reparative therapy is typically practiced on children. Its clients have included Scott Lively, who encouraged Uganda’s anti-gay movement shortly before it produced its infamous bill to outlaw homosexuality under penalty of death. It was listed as an anti-LGBT hate group in 2013 by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which accused it of “spreading false and defamatory information about LGBT people”. Heidi Beirich, director of SPLC’s Intelligence Project, said: “In 2016, Liberty Counsel filed an amicus brief with the constitutional court of Romania in support of the country’s proposed constitutional amendment to define marriage as one man and one woman. “The brief peddles junk science that pushes a false and harmful narrative, which includes statements such as ‘engaging in homosexual conduct is dangerous’ among other false claims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/12/minister-for-men-campaign-feminists-swayne-o-pie-society","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T15:15:39Z","webTitle":"Two bouncers, one protester: minister for men campaign kicks off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/minister-for-men-campaign-feminists-swayne-o-pie-society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/12/minister-for-men-campaign-feminists-swayne-o-pie-society","fields":{"headline":"Two bouncers, one protester: minister for men campaign kicks off","bodyText":"Bouncers are not normally required for gatherings in the Open House Centre at the Manvers Street Baptist church in Bath. But two door supervisors were deemed necessary on Wednesday evening to stop anyone entering the Pulteney Room who was not sympathetic to the views of the fledgling Society to Establish a Minister for Men. Founder and organiser Swayne O’Pie, who bills himself as a campaigner against inequalities experienced by men and boys, explained that he felt security was needed as there had been a minor local storm in the buildup to this inaugural meeting. Posters had been torn down and defaced. What was scheduled to be the first meeting up the M5 at a pub in Cheltenham earlier this week was cancelled after – according to O’Pie – the landlord was warned there would be repercussions. “We thought we had better be safe rather than sorry,” he told the Guardian. “We don’t want people to be frightened by feminist people shouting with banners. I’ve had that before, it’s ridiculous.” But he added: “I’m being totally paranoid because nobody has turned up.” The Pulteney Room and its environs were not packed. Around a dozen people, including one 18-year-old woman, attended the meeting. And there was just one protester outside. As the Bath Choral Society rehearsed in a nearby room, O’Pie set out the society’s objectives. The Guardian was not allowed in, but was provided with a handout in an envelope labelled: “Please read BEFORE you condemn.” The handout argues that “male-specific problems and issues” rarely appear in the media, are deliberately neglected in schools and universities and are not addressed anywhere in the political system. It states that male MPs do not represent men but female politicians do represent women, because they “think, bond and therefore act as a political gender group across party lines”. So, because there are 208 women MPs, the “feminist party” is the third-largest political grouping in British politics. “Its members have been elected on a hidden agenda. They and their party have no accountability,” the handout says. The consequences? “There has not been one specifically male-friendly piece of legislation passed in parliament in living memory,” meaning a minister of men is needed. After all, there is a minister for women and equalities: Justine Greening. While O’Pie (not his real name – he does not disclose his true identity) prepared for the meeting, freelance director and producer Liam Maddin led a one-person protest outside. “Men have the upper hand in so many more ways than other groups,” he said. “Specific problems can affect one gender over another, but that’s not a reason to create a whole cult and movement.” Maddin said it was important not to ignore such events, even if just a few people turned up. “This is how these things begin. It starts off with people saying: ‘I was born a man; I was born at a disadvantage. Then it escalates into an anti-women thing. Throughout history the straight, white male has had the advantage.” Retired accountant Tony Stott, who was on his way into the meeting, branded Maddin’s views “balderdash and twaddle”, adding: “It’s what you’ve been told but it’s rubbish.” Nobody had mentioned slavery, but Stott told Maddin that women and black people were slave owners. “Where is the white domination in that?” he asked. Another attendee, Jordan Holbrook, a blogger who keeps an online record of women convicted of crimes whom he believes have been wrongly spared jail, told Maddin it was wrong that women could not be convicted of raping men. Holbrook said that, though men are also victims of domestic violence, millions more public money is spent on helping women then men. Afterwards O’Pie, a father of three, said he was not disappointed at the turnout and vowed to press on. O’Pie is a veteran of the Fathers4Justice movement, which involved activists taking part in stunts and demonstrations dressed as superheroes. He has written a book called Why Britain Hates Men: Exposing Feminism, and earlier this year, he and Holbrook unsuccessfully took on the Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips by delivering leaflets asking constituents if they really want a “feminist as your MP”. “I hoped more people would be there and thought there would be more demonstrators,” he said. “But we had a good discussion.” More meetings are to be held in Bath and O’Pie hopes to expand to other cities in the south-west and south Wales. “I think this thing has legs,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/13/not-just-tourists-medical-supplies-voluntourism-project-bristol-branch","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T13:37:50Z","webTitle":"Not Just Tourists expands medical 'voluntourism' project with Bristol branch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/13/not-just-tourists-medical-supplies-voluntourism-project-bristol-branch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/13/not-just-tourists-medical-supplies-voluntourism-project-bristol-branch","fields":{"headline":"Not Just Tourists expands medical 'voluntourism' project with Bristol branch","bodyText":"Suncream, swimsuit, paperbacks … the packing list for a holiday usually follows a formula. However, one non-profit organisation hopes travellers will take the opportunity to fill their suitcases with something more altruistic, helping deliver vital medical supplies to developing countries. Launched in Canada in 1990, Not Just Tourists facilitates the collection and delivery of surplus medical supplies to some of the poorest and most remote clinics in the world. This week, the organisation launched a new branch in Bristol, meaning UK travellers can join a volunteer-run movement that has so far delivered more than 10,000 suitcases of supplies to 82 countries. The Bristol branch has been set up by Claudia Hon, a GP who volunteered with the organisation while living in Toronto. “I fell in love with the whole idea”, she said. “The recycling side of things, as well as the health care side. We take it for granted, having these basic supplies but for a small clinic that doesn’t have a lot of resources it makes a huge difference.“You hear a lot of stories from people dropping supplies off at clinics where they need to wash syringes, wash bandages just to reuse them.” Supplies are sourced from hospitals, medical suppliers and patients who have died. The supplies are then packed into suitcases and paired with people travelling to destinations where they are most needed. Not Just Tourists helps with the documentation required to transport the supplies, which include bandages, syringes, blood-taking kits, catheters, speculums, clean gloves, masks, gowns, as well as equipment including glucose or blood pressure meters and stethoscopes. Hon said: “The documentation is a couple of generic letters in various languages listing the basic stuff, what it’s for, the aim of the organisation and that it’s not for sale; that it’s a humanitarian gift/donation for people in need and that it’s not a religious or politically motivated thing.” “A lot of airlines are quite kind and have a humanitarian policy; they’ll allow an extra suitcase, or extend baggage allowance for no extra cost. We list some on the website that have a clear policy.” Avi D’Souza, who founded the Toronto branch in a garage four years ago and has since sent more than 1,000 suitcases (packed with more than 400,000 pounds of medical supplies and equipment to 63 countries) says the project is about “connecting people”. “Anyone can spend a week at a resort and forget the world around them,” he said. “It takes a special person to step outside of their comfort zone and connect with the local community. Every suitcase is a personal journey – a reason for the traveller to develop meaningful connections and friendships that will last a lifetime.” He added: “Our mission is not only to get medical supplies to remote clinics around the world but also to create extraordinary journeys for travellers.” The countries that received the biggest amount of supplies between June 2016 and June 2017 were Cameroon, Rwanda, Swaziland, Chad and El Salvador, but equipment was also delivered to Cuba, Ghana, Ecuador, India and Peru, among others. The Bristol branch is hoping to hear from people who might want to donate supplies as well as deliver them. “Anyone with any passing interest, who might want to help or can spread the word to travellers, I’d love to hear from,” said Hon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/banning-rose-mcgowan-shows-nothings-changed-twitter-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T15:49:17Z","webTitle":"The banning of Rose McGowan shows nothing's changed at Twitter | Hannah Jane Parkinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/banning-rose-mcgowan-shows-nothings-changed-twitter-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/banning-rose-mcgowan-shows-nothings-changed-twitter-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"The banning of Rose McGowan shows that nothing's changed at Twitter","bodyText":"Twitter has a great habit of introducing changes nobody wants (increasing the character limit to 280), and not acting on the things we’ve all been asking for for ages, such as an edit button, and maybe, just maybe … not allowing misogynistic, antisemitic and racist abuse to thrive? It was a great development when Twitter introduced inline gifs and videos, but not so great when Jewish women routinely receive messages such as “go back to the gas chambers” and it somehow doesn’t violate their terms of service. Some 2.6 million antisemitic tweets were sent last year. One woman was even suspended for reporting a tweet that told her: “Welcome to Trump’s America. Welcome to the camps!” Rose McGowan, however, the actor at the forefront of calling out Harvey Weinstein’s alleged decades of sexual harassment and abuse – just one of the women whose stories are only now coming out because of the aggressively patriarchal culture of fear that has rendered them silent – has been temporarily banned from the platform on which she had found her voice. Good one, Twitter. Well done, lads. Speculation was that her crime might have been calling out Ben Affleck, tweeting, “Ben Affleck fuck off” (although not at him; not including his Twitter handle) and accusing him of dishonesty over what he knew about Weinstein’s alleged behaviour. (Affleck later tweeted an apology after it was pointed out he had groped the actor Hilarie Burton, and footage of him surfaced commenting on a television presenter’s breasts.) I’d love to know how McGowan tweeting “Ben Affleck fuck off” is enough to get McGowan suspended for 12 hours almost immediately but, say, private messaging someone racist epithets or open neo-Nazi calls to war don’t contravene Twitter’s terms of service. Or – wait for it – threatening nuclear war. If McGowan suggesting that Affleck should fuck off sees her kicked off the platform, then why didn’t Donald Trump calling to obliterate an entire nation count as aggression? That is surely the actual apex of aggression. Ditto, if McGowan’s accusing Affleck of lying is an issue, then how come Trump continuously calling people liars (usually female journalists in every other tweet, Hillary Clinton often) is fine? Trump on more than one occasion tweeting antisemitic memes is OK. Trump tweeting misogynistic slurs at women is OK. But someone calling Trump “a moron” is suspended. It is mind-boggling. (Twitter did offer a brief explanation of Trump’s nuclear war tweet-storm not violating its terms of service, which is that it was newsworthy. And a woman at the heart of the biggest Hollywood scandal perhaps, ever, isn’t newsworthy?) It is possible that whichever specific tweet triggered the 12-hour suspension has been automatically removed (as is often the case) – and Twitter has since said it was down to the posting of a phone number – but it seems hugely over the top and counterproductive to take McGowan’s account offline at a critical time of debate. (It’s also possible that the initial decision to suspend was an algorithmic decision, but it’s hardly likely it will have passed Twitter by). I haven’t spoken much about this, but for nine months a couple of years ago, my life was made a living hell by a group who objected to a report I wrote about an enterprise of theirs that was scamming people after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks. I was hounded relentlessly in every conceivable way online. Some of the methods are more known about now, but back then they were not. Fake news sites – populated with otherwise real content and respectable-looking domain names – were set up with hoax stories about me being corrupt, being mentally unstable, and even being an ex-porn star. The SEO was gamed so that they appeared at the top of Google searches for my name. Mass emails were sent out to journalists across the industry, warning people against me. Social media accounts were combed for personal information about my family and friends to spook me. But perhaps the most consistently disruptive aspect was this one: this group flooded my Twitter account with bots, and also bot-retweeted every tweet I sent. This made it impossible to use a medium that I relied on as part of my job. As well as this, my friends and colleagues were soon also targeted. Now, Twitter didn’t do nothing about this. I was sent the link to a special form to speed up my harassment flags. However, I still believe that this was escalated only when a far higher-profile colleague who the group realised was an acquaintance of mine was targeted. The abuse only stopped after months of sleuthing when I unmasked the culprit – some loser in Miami along with subcontracted Russian bot farms. This is all stuff that we are becoming more aware of now, but in 2014, it was an intensely lonely experience. If making someone’s life a misery in this way does not violate Twitter’s terms of service then clearly there is something not working about Twitter’s terms of service. Even though merely banning the main account of the group that I knew was responsible wouldn’t have stopped the harassment, because the abuse was so complex, it would have been a deterrent. Twitter didn’t do this, because no rules had been broken. That proves that the rules themselves are broken. But actually, some of the rules as they are currently defined had been broken. Because this account also tweeted at a senior colleague: “fucking bitch”. Which I also reported. Nothing. She also reported the bot activity on her account (apparently an attempt to blame it on me and get me fired), and also: nothing. There are plenty of other examples. It took Twitter days to kick Azealia Banks off the platform after she called Zayn Malik a racial epithet. And here’s a funny thing about that: I emailed Twitter about how, how!, none of this had broken its terms of services. I had a piece lined up about it. And then … I actually asked my editor not to run it. Because I knew a piece about Twitter abuse would garner a lot of Twitter abuse, and I just couldn’t handle it. That’s how much Twitter needs to get it together. When months of abuse, when violent threats to female politicians, when the online version of hissing at Jewish people, or making monkey noises at people of colour, is apparently all acceptable but a victim of sexual abuse leading one of the most important and most open conversations on a horrific, systemic issue is silenced, even if only temporarily, then it almost makes me want to leave Twitter altogether. It’s no wonder prospective buyers such as Disney backed off bidding for the platform because of its reputation on abuse. Former CEO Dick Costolo once said Twitter “sucks” at dealing with abuse, and despite some steps in the right direction (quality filters and mute buttons, for instance ), McGowan’s suspension shows that nothing’s really changed.

You’re tired, you’re cold, you need to curl up with a cup of tea and something comforting to read. But wait! You also love animals. What better, then, than a copy of A Pug Like Percy, Fiona Harrison’s tale of a cute canine who has been dumped in an animal shelter, but who brings a “little miracle” to Gail and her unhappy family? Or Daisy Bell’s The Christmas Guest, a “heart-warming tale of a homeless puppy with a huge heart”? Or Jacqueline Sheehan’s A Dog Like Lloyd (“Roxanne Pellegrino’s … new life of solitude is interrupted when she meets Lloyd – a stray black labrador with an equally unhappy past”). You get the idea. The genre – let’s go ahead and call it “pet lit” – is booming. Melissa Daley’s Molly and the Cat Cafe has sold more than 20,000 copies, according to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan. A Pug Like Percy has shifted 10,000; Lynne Barrett-Lee’s Able Seacat Simon (“the fictional reimagining of Able Seacat Simon’s adventures and heroics in dangerous wartime seas”) almost as many. Sheila Jeffries’ Timba Comes Home (“two black kittens against the world is the pact they make when they are abandoned in a ditch”) is padding towards similar popularity, with 8,000 copies finding a home. All feature adorable images of puppies or kittens on their covers. Most are narrated by the animals themselves, as with Pug Like Percy: “Filled with despair, I slumped back on to my bed, flung my paws over my eyes and tried to understand why Javier had left me here to rot like so many other good dogs before me.” Or, in Sheila Norton’s Oliver, the Cat Who Saved Christmas: “The worst night of my entire nine lives started with some leftover fish.” Sophie Pembroke’s Claude’s Christmas Adventure delivers similarly gritty realism: “I snuffled around the base of the kitchen table, wiggling my rear against the tiled floor, my tiny tail moving with it.” Claude is a French bulldog. “There’s a lot of it about, and it’s hard sometimes to differentiate between them, although there are a few more dog books this year – people are perhaps trying to move on from the cat phenomenon,” said Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White. “The general idea is that a small animal comes into a family’s life, and transforms it for the better, and there’s a strong core market for it … They’re impulse buys, when you want a comforting, not too challenging read, and you see a nice picture of a cat. We do love our pets.” At HarperCollins, which publishes Harrison, Lisa Milton believes that “essentially, pet fiction is feelgood. Everyone loves kittens and puppies, cats and dogs. But mostly … we all need to escape every now and then. We had such success with Percy Pug in hardback last year that we’re publishing A Puppy called Hugo this year.” Harrison herself says: “I think the world is not much fun right now with Brexit, North Korea and good old Trump … As the old expression goes, the world’s going to hell in a handcart and if there’s a book out there to raise a smile and make you feel good, then I’ll grab it with both hands.” The books, she says, are “the best fun in the world” to write. “Seriously, who wouldn’t want to spend their days imagining stories from the perspective of a faithful pooch? I have a stack of ideas for more but, as ever, it comes down to the mood of the Great British Public. But I would love to get back to Percy’s world as quickly as possible. It’s much safer than the real world.” Daley was inspired by her own pet, writing a spoof celebrity memoir in the voice of her cat Nancy: Sex and the Kitty. “We got Nancy as a kitten and soon discovered she was too friendly for her own good. She used to follow people home, sneak into their cars, hang out at the local pubs … she used to go missing all the time, so I created a Facebook page for her to keep track of where she was,” says Daley. “It began to snowball and she picked up followers from all around the world, not just in Harpenden.” After an appearance on US TV show Must Love Cat, Daley “began to wonder whether there might be a market for a memoir, or ‘meowmoir’, written by a celebrity cat. It turned out there was.” Nancy still has a Facebook page, giving Daley a insight into who reads her books. “Obviously they’re all cat lovers, largely – but not exclusively – women, lots based in the US,” she says. “Some of my readers are people who love cats but for one reason or another can’t have one of their own, so I think reading allows them to experience the owner-cat relationship vicariously.” Like Harrison, she finds them very enjoyable to write. “I love trying to create feline characters that have enough ‘human’ characteristics and emotional depth to engage the reader, while at the same time still being convincingly cat-like. It’s really lovely to write about a cat’s relationship with its owner from the cat’s point of view,” she says. “I think anyone who has ever owned one has probably wondered what their cat gets up to when it disappears out through the cat flap at dusk.” White traces the genre’s popularity back to James Bowen’s A Street Cat Named Bob (Bowen’s total sales topped 1m), and Marley and Me, which sold more than 750,000 copies. There is also a more literary strand: Takashi Hiraide’s The Guest Cat, an award-winning novel about a cat that brings joy to a lonely couple, has sold nearly 100,000 copies, while his countryman Haruki Murakami is known for his talking cats. The forthcoming The Travelling Cat Chronicles by Hiro Arikawa, is set to be along the same lines. Like pet sales, the genre “has a particular bump” during the festive season, says White. Perhaps the pressure to celebrate boosts the appetite for comfort reads? But “cat fiction is for life, not just for Christmas,” he warns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2017/oct/26/gentrification-richard-florida-interview-creative-class-new-urban-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T06:15:00Z","webTitle":"‘Everything is gentrification now’: but Richard Florida isn't sorry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/26/gentrification-richard-florida-interview-creative-class-new-urban-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/oct/26/gentrification-richard-florida-interview-creative-class-new-urban-crisis","fields":{"headline":"‘Everything is gentrification now’: but Richard Florida isn't sorry","bodyText":"He’s the prophet of placemaking, the king of the downtown revival, the patron saint of avocado toast. More than any other figure in urban thinking, the US academic Richard Florida has been held up as the ultimate champion of gentrification, at once celebrated by mayors for reviving their struggling cities and vilified by critics for fuelling urban inequality. His 2002 bestseller The Rise of the Creative Class hit on what now seems blindingly obvious: that the “clustering force” of young creatives and tech workers in metropolitan areas was leading to greater economic prosperity. Don’t waste money on stadiums and concert halls, or luring big companies with tax breaks, he told the world’s mayors. Instead make your town a place where hipsters want to be, with a vibrant arts and music scene and a lively cafe culture. Embrace the “three T’s” of technology, talent and tolerance and the “creative class” will come flocking. Florida was essentially holding up a mirror to an urban revival that was already well under way. But he packaged his findings in a such a digestible, marketable form – complete with snappy rankings such as the “Bohemian Index”, encouraging cities to compete for a place on his lists – that the message was irresistible to policymakers across the globe. Soon, no town was without its own arts and creativity strategy, innovation hub or pop-up poetry corner. Fifteen years on, it hasn’t quite turned out as he planned. Florida’s formula has proven to benefit the already rich, mostly white middle class; fuel rampant property speculation; displace the bohemians he so fetishised; and see the problems that once plagued the inner cities simply move out to the suburbs. Does he now regret promoting any of the principles that he has championed for so long? “I’m not sorry,” he barks, sitting in a hotel lobby in Mayfair, wearing a leather jacket and black T-shirt. “I will not apologise. I do not regret anything.” His defensiveness comes in response to the reaction to his latest book, The New Urban Crisis, which has been widely interpreted as a mea culpa for opening up the great can of gentrifying worms. After years of proselytising loft-living and shabby-chic cafes, Florida’s eyes have been opened to the downsides of the back-to-the-city movement, sorely felt from London to San Francisco and beyond (although not much beyond, in his western-centric study). He says it was the election of populist rightwing mayor Rob Ford in 2010, in his adoptive hometown of Toronto, that finally triggered his awakening. If even this liberal creative capital could swing so violently to the right, the backlash had well and truly arrived. “It forced me to confront this divisiveness,” he says. “I realised that we need to develop a new narrative, which isn’t just about creative and innovative growth and clusters, but about inclusion being a part of prosperity. It was the service class – the class I had forgotten – that was taking it on the chin.” It was something of an epiphany. As he writes in the introduction to his new book: “I entered a period of rethinking and introspection, of personal and intellectual transformation … I found myself confronting the dark side of our urban revival that I had once championed and celebrated.” Florida’s Creative Class Group, a lucrative consultancy, had turned his book into an entire movement, giving him a celebrity status that saw his speaking fee balloon to $35,000. He became the rockstar of regeneration, extolling his message to packed-out venues with the rousing conviction of an evangelical preacher. His client list includes everyone from Austin, Texas, to Barcelona, Brisbane, Dublin, Pamplona and the United Nations. With fame and commercial success came a backlash. He was accused of being a salesman, an opportunist, peddling the same “creative city” toolkit to every no-hope rustbelt town going. He even spawned his own dedicated opposition group, the Creative Class Struggle, who were keen to highlight his (publicly funded) salary as director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, which now stands at over $360,000. His slick soundbites are parodied on Twitter in the form of @Dick_Florida (“Problem: Cops are the shock troops of structural power. Solution: What if they had a booth at this farmers market?”). Criticism has come from both ends of the political spectrum. “In the States, 99% of my critics were socially conservative, rightwing people, who said I had a gay agenda, or that cities couldn’t be built by yuppies, sophistos, trendoids and gays,” Florida has said. But, for a man who professes to be a social democrat, it was the attacks from the left that really stung. Some labelled his theories elitist, while others picked holes in his indexes correlating hipster culture with economic success. As the Harvard economist Edward Glaeser wrote: “There are many good reasons to be tolerant without spinning an unfounded story about how bohemianism helps urban development.” It was “skilled people” rather than creatives, Glaeser concluded, who “are the key to urban success”. “My leftwing critics created a straw man,” Florida tells me, with the air of someone bruised by attacks. “I’m certainly not the architect of gentrification. I wish I had that much power. The truth is, I underestimated the virulence and ferocity of the move back to the city. I missed it by an order of magnitude.” Following the Rob Ford shockwave, it was the surprise election of Donald Trump that really made him take notice of the divisions between the cities and the regions, and the great mass of people beyond his creative urban centres. “It’s the working class – and I’m sorry, but I’m a member of the working class, I come from the working class – that has voted for this nationalistic agenda,” he says. “If Marx came back to life, he would say, ‘This doesn’t surprise me. I told you the peasantry was a backward-looking class.’ They weren’t part of the forward-looking momentum of capitalism.” He is fond of quoting Karl Marx, and he describes his own theoretical position as “a fusion of Marx, [economist Joseph] Schumpeter and Jane Jacobs”, whose sentiments he regularly summons. “After the attack on the twin towers, I asked Jane what we should do. She said, ‘Richard, you’re a nice guy, but you’re asking the wrong question. It’s not what we should do; it’s about them, the people who live and work in those neighbourhoods.’ That’s what my work has tried to be about ever since.” The New Urban Crisis paints a gloomy picture of what Florida calls “winner-take-all urbanism”, charting the rise of “superstar cities” such as New York, London and Tokyo. Today, the 50 largest metropolitan areas are home to just 7% of the world’s population, yet generate 40% of its economic growth. Supported by an arsenal of statistics and rankings from his research team, he shows how the most creative cities are also the most unequal; how urban segregation exists in “patchwork” form, not just inner-city v periphery; how the next big crisis is the suburbs. There are winners and losers, good guys and bad guys, urban optimists and urban pessimists, superstar cities and everywhere else. The book reads as if assembled from different articles over the years. He notes that inequality is an obstacle to growth, while also stating that unequal places such as San Francisco and New York are booming. He rails against Nimbys (or “New Urban Luddites”, as he calls them) and argues that planning regulations “have a substantial negative effect on the economy” – yet says deregulation is not the answer. He says public transport is key, while he himself takes taxis from the airport to London, as the preface to the book reveals. When I suggest that perhaps his creative class v service class definition isn’t particularly helpful, given that many artists also wait tables, he pauses in his usually fluent spiel. “Maybe,” he says. “But the real issue is the immiseration of the service class. “Yes, there are many artists and musicians who struggle, but the creative workers have colonised the best spaces in cities, pushing the service workers out to the periphery.” At the mention of gentrification, he launches an impassioned tirade against the corrosive effects of what he sees as the guilt-laden left in urban academia, which in many ways rings true. “Everything is gentrification now!” he cries. “Kids come to my office in tears. They say: ‘I took this class in urban geography and I want to make my city better, but they say everything I want to do is gentrification. A better school is gentrification, empowering artists is gentrification, working to improve the condition of parks is gentrification. What can I do? Just let it go all to shit?’ I think this academic urbanism is so dangerous, because it disempowers people. It is so removed from the reality of everyday life.” Both in private and on stage, Florida speaks at such a fast pace and in a tone so declarative and self-assured that it’s sometimes hard to decode when he’s not saying much at all.He treated a packed auditorium at the London School of Economics to such a show two weeks ago, recounting his humble origins as the son of a factory worker from Newark, New Jersey, and charting his successive academic epiphanies. Mid-lecture, he stopped dramatically, and started reciting Jane Jacobs quotes like mantras. “Density in the absence of pedestrian scale can be a very dangerous thing … she was a genius.” He is frank about how he has changed his mind since Trump and the EU referendum: “If you read the galleys of my book, you’ll see I was proclaiming that President Hillary Clinton will establish a new council of cities, that we’ll finally see national investment in transport and housing. “But I’ve come to realise that the nation state is the problem,” he says. “We have to move power back to the local level. If I can live in my little hamlet, where they’re not going to impose Brexit on me or take away women’s reproductive rights, and it’s the kind of place I want to live, then that’s great. We vote with our feet and choose the places we want to live.” So what are his solutions? The book concludes with a series of principles (the “seven pillars”) for how we might build a new inclusive “urbanism for all”. He wants better jobs, more affordable housing, improved public transport and “a global effort to build stronger, more prosperous cities in rapidly urbanising parts of the emerging world”. It’s mostly inarguable, though there is scant detail on how these things might actually happen. When I ask him about the benefits of a land value tax, mentioned briefly in the book, he says: “It’s time for new thinking. Many of the solutions may not work, but we need to try things and talk about new solutions. We need incentives for greater development, not only of housing in general, but of affordable housing. “I don’t have all the answers,” he adds, in response to my confused frown. “I always say: ‘Here’s a menu of things that seem interesting, but you guys are gonna have to figure out what works best for you.’” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/12/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-pride","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T19:00:11Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend: share your songs about pride","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-pride","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/12/readers-recommend-share-your-songs-about-pride","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend: share your songs about pride","bodyText":"This week are looking for your nominations on the topic of pride and being proud.

Van Der Beek made the claims on Twitter in a series of posts that offered support to the women who had spoken out against Weinstein. “For anyone judging the women who stayed silent, read this for perspective. Also for anyone brushing off harassment as ‘boys being boys’,” he wrote, linking to an article from fashion website The Cut that detailed a writer’s hotel-room experience with a “powerful man”. The former Dawson’s Creek actor went on to recount his own personal experience of abuse, though he did not name names. “I’ve had my ass grabbed by older, powerful men, I’ve had them corner me in inappropriate sexual conversations when I was much younger,” he wrote. “I understand the unwarranted shame, powerlessness &amp; inability to blow the whistle. There’s a power dynamic that feels impossible to overcome”. Van Der Beek added that “what Weinstein is being accused of is criminal. What he’s admitted to is unacceptable – in any industry. I applaud everybody speaking out.” Weinstein has been accused of sexual abuse and harassment by a number of women since the publication of a New York Times investigation into his behaviour last week. A further investigation published by the New Yorker on Tuesday alleged that the Miramax founder had raped three women, while a number of others have separately alleged mistreatment, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne and Léa Seydoux. Weinstein has “unequivocally denied” the allegations. The allegations against Weinstein have prompted other figures in Hollywood to speak out about their experiences of abuse. On Tuesday former NFL player and actor Terry Crews alleged that he was groped by an executive while at an industry function in 2016, while One Tree Hill star Hilarie Burton claimed that she was groped by actor Ben Affleck during an episode of MTV’s TRL in 2003. Affleck has since apologised for acting “inappropriately” towards Burton."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/12/moped-and-scooter-crimes-share-your-experiences","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T11:25:56Z","webTitle":"Moped and scooter crimes: share your experiences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/12/moped-and-scooter-crimes-share-your-experiences","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/12/moped-and-scooter-crimes-share-your-experiences","fields":{"headline":"Moped and scooter crimes: share your experiences","bodyText":"A gang of moped-riding robbers who operated across London have been jailed after carrying out more than 100 crimes.

Film studio chief says Brexit threatens British cinema","bodyText":"The success of British cinema is being threatened by a loss of funding caused by Brexit, according to the chief executive of a major film company, who warned that hits such as Slumdog Millionaire and The King’s Speech may no longer be made in the future. Zygi Kamasa, the chief executive of Lionsgate UK and Europe, warned: “Between 2007 and 2013, over €100m [£90m] was invested in UK film. It is a big amount for indigenous British productions. The concern is that, with Brexit, we will lose that funding.” He argued the industry was already struggling to attract finance as more and more people opted to remain at home, watching box sets or movies on large-screen TVs. “Hollywood is moving towards a smaller number of films with massive budgets, like X-Men and Star Wars. So, when you go to the cinema, you are tempted to choose a big spectacle,” added Kamasa, who runs the British arm of the company behind the Hunger Games series and La La Land. “If you add to that the impact from Brexit, it adds to the downward pressure. Slumdog Millionaire got over €1m of EU media funding and so did The King’s Speech.” Kamasa said the sudden loss of funding for films already struggling was compounding the problem. “It means those films are not going to be made, which is a huge loss culturally and economically, and a huge loss for skills and creative talent.” He said the squeeze had already started. “We pledged to make 25 British films in four years and managed 19-20 over the first three years, but we are struggling in the final year. It is already [October] and we have only made one,” he said. “I am fearful that the great films of the past 20 years like [Slumdog Millionaire and the King’s Speech] will struggle to be made in the coming years unless something is done. We as an industry need to look at this closely.” Kamasa, who has been asked to chair a British Film Institute (BFI) commission on independent film in the UK, argued that huge British hits had acted as a “stepping stones to more films”. UK movies can receive funding from the EU through its Creative Europe programme, which contributed €1m to Pride and just under €1m to I, Daniel Blake. Amanda Nevill, the chief executive of the BFI, said she was confident that film would be of “valued importance” when Brexit negotiations got under way, but added the industry would like participation in Creative Europe to be maintained. “I remain optimistic that creativity will always find a way through, but funding and free movement of people is something that we will be arguing for and defending all the way,” she said. Asked if the UK could stay in Creative Europe after Brexit, a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: “The UK film industry is world-leading and one of our biggest success stories. As we leave the EU, we are committed to maintaining our support for the creative industries and making sure the UK remains an attractive destination for overseas investors.” Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, has previously said she was aware of the film industry’s concerns. “Clearly this is part of a negotiation, but we are looking carefully at the areas in which it is important that we continue membership,” she told the House of Commons in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/30/revealed-ukip-whistleblowers-raised-fears-about-breitbart-influence-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Ukip whistleblowers raised fears about Breitbart influence on Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/30/revealed-ukip-whistleblowers-raised-fears-about-breitbart-influence-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/30/revealed-ukip-whistleblowers-raised-fears-about-breitbart-influence-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Ukip whistleblowers raised fears about Breitbart influence on Brexit","bodyText":"Two internal Ukip whistleblowers filed complaints to the UK’s Electoral Commission over fears the party was making “unusual arrangements” with a pro-Trump website in the months before the 2016 EU referendum, the Guardian has learned. The concerns included allegations that individuals who were being paid by Breitbart, a rightwing American news organisation, were working as senior unpaid Ukip volunteers, raising questions in their minds about whether their work could be construed as an indirect political donation by a foreign donor, according to sources who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity. One whistleblower told the Guardian that concerns that the party was turning to “off-balance-sheet financing”, possibly in violation of UK rules, prompted the decision to turn to the electoral commission. The complaints were brought to the attention of the Metropolitan police by the Electoral Commission, but the police decided to take no further action. Separately, a Labour MP, Ben Bradshaw, called this month on the government to investigate the possible role “dark money” played in the EU referendum, including concerns of foreign interference in the 23 June vote. Steve Bannon, who has a close relationship with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, served as executive chair of Breitbart at the time. Bannon later became Donald Trump’s campaign adviser and served as White House strategist until August, when he left the White House and returned to Breitbart. The news website is a platform that is popular among the “alt-right” in the US, an increasingly vocal movement of extreme rightwing white nationalists. Bannon launched Breitbart London in 2014. Within a short period, the website was seen as being aligned with Ukip, a party that Bannon saw as a British version of the rightwing US Tea Party movement. Farage has often praised Breitbart for its support of Brexit, saying the 23 June referendum would not have gone in favour of the leave campaign without the news website’s “supportive voice”. But now revelations about internal concerns at the time raise questions about the extent of the influence of the American site. Multiple sources who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said that they were alarmed by what they viewed as a “deliberate strategy” by Breitbart to wield influence over Ukip in ways that emphasised views against migrants and other far-right positions. One former insider said: “I had concerns about Nigel and some people around them with Bannon and Breitbart.” The person added: “It wasn’t clear whether certain people were being paid for on the balance sheet of the party. It is important that people should be employed by the party and that funding for Ukip is officially and properly declared and registered at the Electoral Commission.” Sources pointed to Farage’s close relationship with Bannon and Breitbart, and work that was performed by a lawyer, Matthew Richardson, who served as party secretary for Ukip and was close to Bannon. In one case, according to people familiar with the matter, Richardson suggested in late 2014 that ahead of the general election Ukip could make use of the services of a US-based electoral data company, Voter Gravity, that would not have to be paid for by Ukip and would be provided as a donation-in-kind. The offer was declined, according to sources. Voter Gravity is a company that promises to “turn data into votes”, according to its website. It was founded by conservative US political operative Ned Ryun, who is also a regular contributor to Breitbart. Ryun, who has been described in media reports as being close to Bannon, told the Guardian that he worked with UKIP in late 2014 and early 2015 to “assist them in the general election” but that it did not work out due to “regulatory problems”. “We were prepared to work for nothing,” Ryun said, because the company allegedly was trying to gain a foothold into the UK. “I wanted to work on the referendum [too] but nothing materialised there either,” he said. In another case, Farage sought out an internal legal opinion about whether he could accept funds from a US donor to pay for a driver and security guard, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The legal opinion determined that such a donation was not permissible. “It means someone was willing to pay up,” one former Ukip insider told the Guardian. A spokesman for Farage did not respond to requests for comment. Richardson did not respond to requests for comment by email and phone. Raheem Kassam was also seen as a link between Ukip and Breitbart. Kassam, who now heads Breitbart London, also worked as a key adviser to Farage. According to a 2015 report in the Spectator, it was Bannon who saw Kassam as a rising star of the British right, and approached Kassam, who was active online, as an “ideal apprentice”. Asked about his financial ties to Breitbart and Ukip, Kassam told the Guardian: “You realise your line of questioning is actually much more applicable to the BBC than us, right?” There is no evidence that Ukip or Breitbart broke the law. Bannon did not respond to emails and calls from the Guardian. It is illegal for British campaigns to accept foreign donations or donations from anyone who is not UK registered. But one expert said that volunteering presented an “interesting grey area” in the law that could be difficult to define since most electoral campaigns are managed by volunteers. Damian Tambini, director of the media policy project at the LSE, added: “A donation in kind, giving goods and services, are subject to the same rules as a donation and also subject to spending limits.” Sources with close knowledge of the matter said the Electoral Commission made inquiries about the allegations but determined that it did not have enough information to launch a full investigation. The commission thought the complaint was serious enough, however, to warrant a review by the Metropolitan police. The police contacted at least one of the whistleblowers but decided not to take further action. The Met told the Guardian that it received allegations related to five cases of election expense returns for the 2015 general election and that two of the allegations did not meet the threshold for a criminal investigation. It said it was conducting two investigations into referrals from the Electoral Commission that were received in late 2016 and March 2017, but declined to comment further."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/12/andy-serkis-king-kong-was-the-epiphany-it-was-like-you-can-now-do-anything","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T14:11:32Z","webTitle":"Andy Serkis: ‘King Kong was the epiphany.

It was like: you can now do anything’","bodyText":"Breathe is not technically Andy Serkis’s first film as a director. He had already shot his adaptation of The Jungle Book using the performance-capture technology for which the man inside Gollum has become known. But while that was in post-production, Serkis found time to direct Breathe. There is a bit of CGI – Tom Hollander plays twins – but, otherwise, it’s an interestingly old-fashioned film from a man who likes to talk about digital characters and next-generation storytelling. It was the script that did it, he says. “I really did cry my eyes out, and that never happens to me.” It was one of the films on the slate of the Imaginarium, the performance-capture studio and production company Serkis had set up with the film producer Jonathan Cavendish. Serkis was lined up to do the more whizzy performance-capture films such as adaptations of Animal Farm and The Jungle Book – the latter an entirely separate reworking from the Disney adaptation released in 2016 (both films went into production at roughly the same time) – but he asked Cavendish if he could direct Breathe. Could anyone turn down Serkis? As soon as I meet him, I’m struck by how warm and bighearted he seems – blue eyes shining, wild badgery hair and an unassuming manner. Breathe was Cavendish’s story – or rather that of his parents. After they married, Diana and Robin Cavendish found themselves living a gilded upper-middle-class life in colonial Kenya, where Robin was a tea broker, in the late 50s. A “pampered nitwit” is what Diana (played by Claire Foy) later calls herself when their privileged world implodes after Robin (Andrew Garfield) contracts polio. Diana was pregnant with Jonathan by then, and Robin, paralysed from the neck down, is brought back to live in a hospital in Oxfordshire where he – and other people with polio – are kept alive with respirators. Robin can’t accept that his life has shrunk to the edges of his hospital bed. Serkis loved, he says, the “sense of these people pioneering a completely new approach”. “When Diana says to Robin, ‘How can I make life better for you?’ and he’s in hospital during his depression, he says, ‘Get me out of here.’ That moment for me was akin to, at that time [somebody saying], put me on the moon or help me climb Mount Everest.” Diana learned how to work the respirator (and use a manual one in case of power cuts) so he could be at home. They were told he wouldn’t live for more than two weeks. “It was extraordinary what they were trying to do. The fact that they were willing to take that risk so that he could embrace life was such a powerful idea.” The other thing he loved was the Cavendish’s rather old-fashioned English unsentimentality. “Bit of a bugger,” is how Robin describes his condition. “It was really buttoned down,” says Serkis. “I think that’s what makes you feel more for it. It was their understated, stoic, humorous approach to choosing to live two minutes away from death [if the respirator failed with no hospital backup], but with such vibrancy.” Throughout his life – he lived, against all expectations, into his 60s – Robin Cavendish became a pioneer in disabled living. His friend, the Oxford scientist and inventor Prof Teddy Hall, built a wheelchair with a battery-operated respirator, which meant he and Diana could resume, to some extent, their adventurous lives. Robin also became a campaigner and speaker, changing attitudes about people with disabilities. It is an area Serkis had an interest in long before he played someone else who had polio, Ian Dury in Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll. His mother taught children with special needs, so he grew up seeing the issues surrounding disability; his sister was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 20 years ago and uses a wheelchair. “I see how difficult it is for her to get around in 2017, and just think back to attitudes towards disability [in the 60s], which we go into in the film,” he says. It’s a little disappointing, though, that there are no disabled actors in the film. Serkis says he did approach theatre companies that work with disabled artists, but, for various reasons, it didn’t happen. Did he ever consider casting a disabled actor for the lead? “We couldn’t ever do it for the lead role because there is a huge part of Robin’s life where he is able-bodied,” he says. But surely he, perhaps more than anybody, could have found a way around that – if a man can play a giant gorilla, can’t a wheelchair-using actor be depicted as able-bodied? “Possibly,” he says. “If it was one shot, maybe it would have been achievable. But it would not have been practical [in this film]. We were all hugely aware of it, but we didn’t consider it for Robin because of the sheer time he had to be able-bodied.” Serkis has been working towards directing for many years. He made short films early in his career and did some performance-capture directing for video games before starting his production company with a view to making films. (Peter Jackson, the director of Lord of the Rings, asked him to direct the second unit on the three Hobbit films.) He will still act, he says, “but I also love seeing a story through, being responsible for how it looks aesthetically … how you choose point of view and how you lead an audience through a story. That really fascinates me.” He didn’t even originally want to be an actor. He wanted to be an artist, which horrified his parents – his mother was a teacher and his Iraqi-Armenian father was a doctor – and “they were doubly horrified when I wanted to be an actor”, he says with a laugh. Serkis’s father lived and worked in Baghdad for most of his childhood (Serkis and his four siblings were brought up in west London by their mother) where he founded a hospital with three other doctors. During school holidays the children would go to visit him. Serkis was always aware of his heritage. “I definitely don’t feel entirely British,” he says. “I had lots of cousins who I don’t see so much of now but grew up with. So I’ve always felt not entirely of one place.” At one point, Serkis’s father, thought to be a British spy, was arrested and imprisoned for several weeks. “A lot of his friends had vanished and I don’t think [my mother] expected him to reappear. But he did, and then his hospital was taken away by the Ba’ath party – and that was the beginning of him getting out.” By then, Serkis had been at Lancaster University, where he was studying visual arts, but had also discovered acting – by the end of his first year, he had been offered a lead role in the play Gotcha by Barrie Keeffe. He loved, he says, “the process of allowing your imagination to completely transform you into another human being. Then, actually, the first proper professional director I worked with, Jonathan Petherbridge, really made me understand why I wanted to become an actor, which was that acting is a force for change.” He taught Serkis, a former member of the Socialist Workers party, “that art does change society, and I still believe that. That’s what I think keeps me driving forward.” Does he find it strange, and a bit random, that he has become a performance-capture expert? He laughs. “I certainly didn’t intend to. When I started doing Lord of the Rings, I liked the gamble. Originally, I heard it was going to be like doing a voice for a digital character, and I wasn’t that interested, but then I met Peter Jackson and he said: ‘We want an actor to play the role, be on set and make decisions for that character.’” After the trilogy, Serkis thought he would return to a life of conventional acting, if in unconventional roles (he played Ian Brady in the Channel 4 film Longford, eccentric record producer Martin Hannett in 24 Hour Party People and the menacing Rigaud in the BBC’s Little Dorrit). Then he was offered the role of King Kong in Jackson’s 2005 film. “That was the epiphany because it was like: you can now play anything. Then, as the technology evolved and facial capture came into play, and [it became] total performance capture, not just motion, I realised how important it is as an actor’s tool in the 21st century.” The perception of the work – that it is not just doing a voice, but acting – has, he says, “radically changed” in the past few years. “You can see that by the number of great actors who want to take on performance-capture roles: Mark Rylance playing the BFG, and we’ve got a great cast for Jungle Book – Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christian Bale.” When will an actor using performance capture first win an Oscar for acting? “Who knows? I think there is a growing perception within the awarding bodies that it is acting, that it doesn’t matter whether you’re putting on a costume and makeup or having your performance manifested on screen as a sort of digital makeup.” As for whether it will only work on an emotional level with a human “inside” the character, Serkis laughs and says he doesn’t know. “That’s such a huge debate about any form of interaction with AI. Can we all be replaced?” What will he do when he’s out of a job? “Go back to climbing mountains,” he says instantly, smiling. “It’s the nearest thing I have to any sort of spirituality – you feel very connected to the world.” There was one moment, during a solo climb of the Matterhorn, when it went “a bit wrong, and you’re hanging off your ice axe waiting for the dawn to come, to see where you’ve gone off-route”. Mountaineering, he says, is “like being totally in the moment because the situation changes so drastically from minute to minute”. It’s a kind of throwaway remark that comes as our time is winding down and our tea is cold, but it suddenly seems to explain why Breathe is Serkis’s perfect debut film after all. What had appealed about Robin and Diana’s story, he had said earlier, was really about choosing to live in the moment. Breathe is released in the UK on 27 October"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/16/huawei-launches-mate-10-pro-with-built-in-ai-to-challenge-apple-samsung","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"Huawei launches Mate 10 Pro with built-in AI to challenge Apple and Samsung","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/16/huawei-launches-mate-10-pro-with-built-in-ai-to-challenge-apple-samsung","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/16/huawei-launches-mate-10-pro-with-built-in-ai-to-challenge-apple-samsung","fields":{"headline":"Huawei launches Mate 10 Pro with built-in AI to challenge Apple and Samsung","bodyText":"Huawei’s new Mate 10 Pro takes aim squarely at Samsung, Google and Apple with a large screen, competition-beating big battery and AI baked in. The Mate 10 Pro is the latest in third-largest smartphone manufacturer Huawei’s big-screen line, which has become popular for its battery life and multitasking prowess. The new top-end Huawei features a 6in, 18:9 elongated OLED screen, matching its Samsung rivals with tiny bezels at the side, top and bottom, which are only just big enough to fit the front-facing camera and sensors at the top and company logo at the bottom. The back of the phone is curved glass, with metal sides that feel significantly more premium than previous Mate smartphones, matching the level of build-quality and design of rivals. “The Mate 10 shows Huawei can now produce devices that can really compete with the quality of flagship devices like Apple,” said Francisco Jeronimo, research director for European mobile devices at research firm IDC. The Mate 10 will ship Huawei’s custom version of Android EMUI 8, which will be built on Android 8 Oreo. It will be one of the first smartphones to ship with Oreo, which was released on 21 August. The Mate 10 Pro also features Huawei’s latest Kirin 970 processor, which has a neural processor built in in similar fashion to Apple’s A11 Bionic processor in the iPhone 8, as well as a dual camera setup on the back with one colour 12-megapixel sensor joined to a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor. Huawei is using the neural processor to run on-device artificial intelligence for advanced scene detection, live translation through the camera and computational photography techniques combining images from the two image sensors for portrait mode and other camera tricks. But the company is also pushing built-in AI that is capable of learning a user’s habits, so that the phone can predict when you want to launch an app or perform an action, to speed it up, or when features and apps aren’t going to be used to save battery power. EMUI 8 is also capable of cleaning itself, which Huawei says will keep the Mate 10 Pro running like it’s fresh out of the box even after a year or so. Jeronimo said: “Huawei is at the front of a race that’s all about making smartphones smarter, leading it with Apple, Google and Samsung. “Huawei says that its AI chipset is more advanced than others, but it’ll be more about meaningful features and how well each company can integrate those into the phone - something that companies such as Huawei, Apple and Google have an advantage in, by making their own AI chips.” The advantage of having AI run on the device, as opposed to contacting a server to perform functions, is that all the data and processing is done locally. This increases speed but also preserves user privacy, which Jeronimo says is an important step for Chinese Huawei. The Mate 10 Pro will also support dual-Sim, for having two numbers on one device, and has quick charging technology that can charge the smartphone’s 4,000mAh battery to 58% in 30 minutes. Huawei is also allowing users to attach a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth and an external monitor via a USB-C cable to perform desktop-like computing without requiring a specific dock system like rival Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8. The Huawei Mate 10 Pro will be available for in November and is expected to cost in around £800.

In June, Photobucket deleted all the photos and said that I (and millions of other users) would have to pay $400 (£302) a year to “release” them. I’d happily pay a reasonable sum, but this is extortionate. One solution would be to download my photo library, but Photobucket has said a bug makes it impossible for users to do so (other than at the laborious rate of one picture at a time). I’m not out of pocket, but the blogs represent 10 years’ work. KM, London Photobucket, which claims to have 100 million users, allows photos uploaded on to its site to be embedded on multiple third-party websites. Until this summer its service used by thousands of Amazon and eBay sellers was free, funded only by advertising revenue. The US-based company says it informed users by email 30 days before the new charge kicked in, but you – along with other customers who have taken to social media – insist you received no such warning. In June, the company posted a brief note on its website advising users to read its updated terms and conditions, and only those who had read through the first 500 words of small print would have encountered a paragraph about fees. As a result of the change, photos across Amazon and other websites were replaced by graphics stating that the Photobucket account needed to be updated, and many bloggers like you complain that years of work have been held to ransom. Photobucket says that while none of your photos will appear on your websites until you pay up, you can still access your archives and take them elsewhere. Yet its customer services admitted to you in August that a known technical issue was obstructing downloads. Customers have understandably complained that the charge is steep and that it has affected photos embedded in good faith over 14 years instead of only future uploads. Photobucket is entitled to charge for its service if it wants to, but it has not handled this well. From now on, be wary of committing your life’s work to a free hosting service.

Now astronomers have detected about half of this missing content for the first time, in a discovery that could resolve a long-standing paradox. The conundrum first arose from measurements of radiation left over from the Big Bang, which allowed scientists to calculate how much matter there is in the universe and what form it takes. This showed that about 5% of the mass in the universe comes in the form of ordinary matter, with the rest being accounted for by dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter has never been directly observed and the nature of dark energy is almost completely mysterious, but even tracking down the 5% of ordinary stuff has proved more complicated than expected. When scientists have counted up all the observable objects in the sky – stars, planets, galaxies and so on – this only seems to account for between a 10th and a fifth of what ought to be out there. The deficit is known as the “missing baryon problem”, baryons being ordinary subatomic particles like protons and neutrons. Richard Ellis, a professor of astrophysics at the University College London, said: “People agree that there’s a lot missing, raising the question where is it?” The distribution of galaxies in the universe follows a web-like pattern and scientists have speculated that the missing baryons could be floating in diffuse gaseous filaments and sheets linking the galaxy clusters in the cosmic web. Theoretical calculations suggest these gaseous threads, known as the warm–hot intergalactic medium, or the Whim, ought to be around a million degrees celsius. A mist of gas at this temperature is too cold to emit X-rays that could be spotted by ordinary telescopes from the Earth – but not cold enough to absorb significant amounts of light passing through it. “The trouble is, it’s in this unusual temperature regime where we can’t see it,” said Ellis. Now two separate teams of scientists, one at the University of Edinburgh, the other at the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France, have produced compelling indirect evidence for the Whim. Both teams relied on the fact that when radiation travels through a hot gas, it is scattered, meaning that the Whim ought to appear as a dim outline in the cosmic microwave background. The scientists overlaid observations of the cosmic background radiation, made by the Planck space observatory, and the most detailed three dimensional map of the cosmic web, created by the Sloane Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They hypothesised that if there were gas threads linking galaxy clusters, these should show up in the Planck data. The Edinburgh team found the regions between galaxies appeared to be about six times as dense as the surrounding bits of space and when summed up, these gaseous threads could amount to about 30% of the ordinary matter in the universe. The French teams’ calculation came out at slightly less than this, but the numbers are consistent. Ellis, who was not involved in either project, describes the findings as “inspirational”. “These two papers have been very prominently discussed and people are excited,” he added. “The Whim is out there.” The initial measurements still do not account for all the ordinary matter, and some believe the remaining portion could be made up by exotic unobserved objects such as black holes or dark stars. Cosmologists are also still yet to discover the nature of dark matter, which makes up even more of the universe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
