Agreement was reached in principle between the two London clubs after a day of exhaustive talks, with Arsenal anxious to conclude their own club record £55.5m move for Aubameyang. Even so, Giroud had still been included in Arsène Wenger’s 19-man match-day squad for Tuesday’s Premier League game at Swansea, which the France international began on the bench. The 31-year-old’s priority has long been to enjoy greater playing opportunity before the World Cup, having started a solitary top-flight game this season following the £52.7m arrival of his compatriot Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon last summer. Giroud will back himself to make a mark at his new club in what promises to be a fight for minutes with Álvaro Morata as Chelsea are in effect scrapping their established policy of not signing players in their 30s on long-term deals. Giroud is understood to have verbally agreed personal terms on the switch and is set to undergo a medical on Wednesday. Arsenal, who have already taken Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Manchester United this month in exchange for Alexis Sánchez, had not been inclined to sell Giroud to a direct rival for a top-four Premier League finish. But their determination to set in train the deal for Aubameyang has forced them to compromise. They have also had to take a hit on the fee, having originally wanted closer to £30m. Talks had appeared to hit an impasse on Monday evening but resumed on Tuesday in an attempt to smooth the wheels of the various deals. The £17.5m fee for Giroud is inclusive of add-ons. Arsenal’s move for Aubameyang had gathered pace earlier in the day when Dortmund granted the forward permission to fly to England in order to undergo a medical and conclude the finer details of a club-record deal at London Colney. The transfer has been driven by Arsenal’s new head of recruitment, Sven Mislintat, who previously worked for Dortmund. He had been instrumental in taking Aubameyang to the Bundesliga from Saint-Étienne and, with the player having made clear he was keen on the move, discussions had progressed over the past fortnight. Yet they could be concluded successfully only once Dortmund had secured their own replacement and, having initially considered Giroud, they opted to pursue Batshuayi. Once Chelsea had opened talks over Giroud, Batshuayi was free to discuss the terms of a loan with Dortmund – the clubs had agreed a deal in principle – though he still trained with Antonio Conte’s squad on Tuesday and, with Morata currently injured, was expected to start Wednesday’s game against Bournemouth. “He trained well and I prepared the game with him,” said Conte, who had spoken to Batshuayi before training to explain the situation. “It’s not the best situation to face but we have to. I have Morata injured and I don’t have other options. It’s not been easy to prepare.” Chelsea on Tuesday night completed the signing of the Roma wing-back Emerson Palmieri for an initial £17m. Conte, who has made clear he has limited input into Chelsea’s transfer policy, had earlier suggested he had not personally recommended the player to the recruitment department. “I don’t remember Palmieri [from his time in Italy] because he came to Italy only last season [it was actually 2015], when he had an important season for Rome,” Conte said. “Then he had a bad injury. He broke his ligaments. Now he’s recovering. I don’t know if he’s ready to play.” The 23-year-old, who has been restricted to only two appearances for Roma this season because of that knee injury, has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal at Stamford Bridge and will provide cover at left-back for Marcos Alonso. “English football is something I have been watching since I was 15 years old,” he said. “It is a really beautiful game over here but it is going to be even more beautiful to play it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/2018/feb/02/civilization-a-new-dawn-brings-the-empire-building-video-game-to-your-dinner-table","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T07:00:46Z","webTitle":"Civilization: A New Dawn brings the empire-building video game to your dinner table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/02/civilization-a-new-dawn-brings-the-empire-building-video-game-to-your-dinner-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/feb/02/civilization-a-new-dawn-brings-the-empire-building-video-game-to-your-dinner-table","fields":{"headline":"Civilization: A New Dawn brings the empire-building video game to your dinner table","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Civilization: A New Dawn 2-4 players, 60-120 mins, ages 14+, £49.99 Designer: James Kniffen For more than 25 years, the Civilization video game series has offered players the chance to play armchair dictator, discovering new lands, shaping nascent cultures and engaging in subtle diplomacy. Or, if it’s more your cup of tea, engulfing your enemies in nuclear fire. Now, the revered empire-builder has had a board-game makeover, bringing its sweeping strategy to your living room table. Like its digital predecessors, Civilization: A New Dawn casts players as rulers attempting to turn their small, scattered tribes into globe-spanning empires. But it’s striking how boldly the game departs from almost everything long-time fans might expect. There’s no painstaking city management or early-game exploration of uncharted territory. There aren’t even any military units to manoeuvre around the map. Instead, there is an ingenious system of cards representing different actions such as expanding your borders, conducting scientific research and trading with foreign powers. Other elements will be more familiar to video-game veterans. There are natural resources to exploit and barbarian hordes to confront, as well as a selection of factions for players to lead, each with their own strengths, making for a subtly different experience every time you play. The game’s one weak point, though, is its linear view of history. You’ll be able to upgrade aspects of your civilisation over time, but not to make real, fundamental choices about the nature of your culture. The game assumes ideas such as militarism, nationalism and capitalism are inherently desirable – a criticism that has also been levelled at the original computer games. It leads to a feeling that while you might be steering your empire across the centuries, you’re not entirely in control of its direction. It’s not enough to sink the game, though, and this is a fresh and thoughtful take on the world-conquering genre. It’s intensely competitive, and its streamlined cardplay ensures that while your turns stay quick and simple, it’s never at the expense of strategic challenge. It may not feel much like the original video games, but there’s plenty about A New Dawn to appeal to your inner Napoleon. Majesty: For the Realm 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes, ages 7+, £39.99 Designer: Marc André If global domination is a bit of a tall order, this game of fantasy kingdom-building might be more your speed. It puts players in the shoes of nobles competing to recruit citizens for their growing realms. You add new characters to your population on every turn, with each affecting the game in different ways: earning you points, attacking your rivals or defending against invading armies. What’s interesting, though, are the knock-on effects your decisions can have on other players. Hire an innkeeper, for instance, and anyone with a brewer in their city gets a bonus due to the rising demand for beer. It means you’ll always have to consider the ways you could be inadvertently helping your opponents, and while Majesty never gets bogged down in complexity, it offers some tricky choices. With two players, it’s tight and analytical. With more, it becomes less predictable, forcing you to react to your rivals’ actions. And with beginner and advanced modes included, there’s the option of moving on to a new challenge once you have mastered the basics. Kerala: The Way of the Elephant 2-5 players, 30 minutes, ages 8+, £32.50 Designer: Kirsten Hiese The Indian state of Kerala is famous for its festivals featuring brightly decorated elephants, and this family-friendly tile laying game throws you and your opponents into the celebrations. You’ll compete to create eye-catching displays, scoring points for building connected areas of matching colours. It sounds simple enough, but you are only allowed to place tiles next to a pair of wooden elephants that wander around your board as you build. You have to think carefully about how you move them, finding the best ways to maximise your score while avoiding painting yourself into corners - something that gets steadily harder as the game goes on. It feels like the real-world equivalent of an addictive smartphone puzzle app: a slick design with brain-teasing gameplay that takes minutes to grasp. It’s also visually polished, with vibrant colours, swirling patterns and chunky elephant figures: perfect for a quick hit of light but cerebral fun. What have you been playing this month?

Ronna Romney McDaniel told Fox News she found the allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire “deeply troubling”. An investigation will be conducted, she said, and if Wynn is found guilty of wrongdoing “we will absolutely return 100% of that money”. “But we’re going to let due process take place,” McDaniel said. Republicans had previously called on Democrats to return contributions from figures including the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. In early October, McDaniel tweeted that if the Democratic National Committee “truly stands up for women like they say they do, then returning Weinstein’s dirty money should be a no-brainer”. Some Republicans in Congress have already announced they are donating contributions from Wynn to charity. The allegations against Wynn involve a number of women and were reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday. One case led to a $7.5m settlement with a manicurist, the paper reported. After being criticised for its initial silence on the issue, the RNC announced on Saturday that Wynn was stepping down from his position as finance chair. McDaniel said then she had discussed the allegations with Donald Trump, who himself faces allegations of sexual misconduct from several women. Wynn denied the allegations against him and said in a statement: “The unbelievable success we have achieved must continue. The work we are doing to make America a better place is too important to be impaired by this distraction.” A friend and ally of the president, Wynn led RNC fundraising efforts during Trump’s first year in the White House, helping rake in more than $130m. According to the Federal Election Commission, he contributed more than $600,000 himself. Wynn was among the organizers of a Trump fundraiser this month at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, to celebrate the anniversary of the inauguration. The president was unable to attend because of the government shutdown. Wynn also helped put on events in Dallas in October and New York City in December. Wynn has donated to a wide range of political figures, including Nevada senator Dean Heller and the Montana congressman Greg Gianforte. According to federal records, Wynn gave $2,700 to Gianforte the day after the politician assaulted a Guardian reporter, Ben Jacobs, last May. Wynn also donated to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/03/marvel-black-panther-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T07:00:13Z","webTitle":"Black Panther: does the Marvel epic solve Hollywood's Africa problem?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/03/marvel-black-panther-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/03/marvel-black-panther-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan","fields":{"headline":"Black Panther: does the Marvel epic solve Hollywood's Africa problem?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fans have been waiting a long time to visit Wakanda, the wondrous Afrofuturistic homeland of Black Panther, but this is not the first time Hollywood will have taken us to a fictional African kingdom. Before Wakanda, there was Zamunda, where giraffes and elephants roam the palace gardens, the king wears a dead lion around his shoulders, and handmaidens strew the royals’ paths with rose petals and attend the prince’s every need, including the washing of “the royal penis”. The movie is, of course, Eddie Murphy’s 1988 smash hit Coming to America, whose compendium of cliches showed just how large the gap could be between “African” and “American”, and how much work Black Panther has to do. As novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie put it: “If all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and Aids, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.” What could have given her that impression? Surely not movies such as Blood Diamond, The Constant Gardener, Hotel Rwanda, Beasts of No Nation, Tears of the Sun, Out of Africa, Born Free, Gorillas in the Mist, or a few dozen Tarzan movies? Not to mention a canon of pop songs sentimentally blessing the rains down in Africa and questioning whether they know it’s Christmas time at all? And that’s just white popular culture. As Coming to America suggests, African Americans are likely to have their own, more complicated set of assumptions about Africa, most likely received from Hollywood movies rather than direct experience. That was certainly the case with Murphy. Coming to America’s Africa is a place of feudal hierarchy, pre-feminist sexual politics and arranged marriage. “I want a woman that’s going to rouse my intellect as well as my loins,” says Akeem, in Murphy’s cod-African accent. As if the only way to find one of those is to look beyond the continent. Coming to America at least laughs at African Americans’ ignorance, too. “Wearing clothes must be a new experience for you,” one black American character tells Akeem, before asking if he played “chase the monkey” back in Africa. Murphy had already given viewers a stereotypical language-mangling, beef jerky-chewing “Cameroonian” in 1983’s Trading Places. Even worse was his 1987 standup film Raw, in which he jokes about going to Africa to find a wife: “Some crazy, naked zebra bitch … with a big bone in her nose and a big plate lip and a big fucked-up Afro.” But he worries that his “bush bitch” would become Americanised and demand half his money. Murphy was apparently saddened at criticisms that Coming to America stereotyped Africans, says Tejumola Olaniyan, professor of African diaspora cultural studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has written on how the movie “others” Africa. “It was actually meant to be a positive portrayal of Africa: they are rich Africans, not poor. They are noble, they are humble. He wanted to overturn Hollywood’s images. It was still a kind of romanticisation but the movie only happened at all because of Murphy’s power in Hollywood.” Olaniyan sees Coming to America as a turning point for portrayals of Africans in pop culture. Comedy Africans still popped up but they were generally benign, such as Dinka, the naive, portly, generally decent Nigerian in Ice Cube’s Barbershop series. Just as the locals in Coming to America’s barbershop called Akeem “Kunta Kinte” (a reference to the slave hero of Roots), so Dinka is called “Mandingo”, “Shaka Zulu” and “Super-size me Mandela”. “Where I come from, to have girth is a sign of opulence,” Dinka says. Rather than suggesting black Americans are just as racist as white ones, these attitudes could be seen as “a direct by-product of the colonialism that removed black people from Africa in the first place,” argues Tyree Boyd-Pates, a Los Angeles-based professor and writer on African-American culture. “Oftentimes, you use the same lens as the colonising group you have been underneath. African Americans in particular will often relegate the 54 countries of Africa to one country, and will often look at it through the prism of America, and end up perpetuating the same negative perceptions of Africa, even though they come from there.” Being black in America comes with its own long history of prejudice and stereotyping, much of it shared with Africans on the continent. But there is another aspect to the relationship: for black Americans, Africa is also the motherland, spiritually as well as ancestrally. In the modern era, a reconnection began in the civil rights era, which intersected with the growing pan-African movement. After four trips to Africa between 1959 and 1964, Malcolm X drew connections between racial oppression at home and colonial oppression in Africa. Less than a year before his death he founded the Organisation of Afro-American Unity. There was also Muhammad Ali, who visited Ghana, Nigeria and Egypt in 1964, and found it nothing like Hollywood. “They never told us about your beautiful flowers, magnificent hotels, beautiful houses, beaches, great hospitals, schools and universities,” he told reporters. Ali’s huge 1974 fight The Rumble in the Jungle was an unprecedented trans-continental event, bringing to President Mobutu’s Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), not only US TV cameras but also music stars, including James Brown, Bill Withers and BB King. “Africa’s my home – damn America and what America thinks!” says Ali in the documentary When We Were Kings. “Yeah, I live in America, but Africa’s the home of the black man, and I was a slave 400 years ago, and I’m going back home to fight among my brothers.” Maybe more than movies, it was music that opened the channels of American Afrocentrism, from jazz, soul and funk to early hip-hop. The latter might have looked very different had a Bronx kid not won a trip to Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau in an essay-writing competition in 1974, and re-christened himself Afrika Bambaataa. Between Bambaataa’s Zulu Nation and the Native Tongues movement of De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers and Queen Latifah, hip-hop headed down a peace-loving, socially conscious path in the late 1980s and early 90s, accessorised with Africa-shaped leather pendants, dashikis, kufis, headscarves and red, black and green graphics. That Afrocentric strand has continued through hip-hop but the chasm between the cultures still occasionally yawns open. In a press conference in 2012, for example, Nas explained why hip-hop artists don’t perform in Africa much. “People are scared. There’s horror stories about Africa that is out of this world … Some of those Africans need to make an effort to show us that it’s going to be all right,” he said. A few years earlier, he had eulogised “the black oasis, ancient Africa the sacred”, in his lyrics. Conversely, Boyd-Pates notes that African stereotypes of black Americans – moneyed, thuggish, hypersexualised, fond of using the N-word – are primarily gleaned from R&amp;B videos. But rap and R&amp;B are now reconnecting with Africa on a meaningful level, looking at artists such as Solange, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, and most of all Kendrick Lamar, whose 2014 visit to South Africa inspired his album To Pimp a Butterfly. Echoing Ali, Lamar said: “I felt like I belonged in Africa. I saw all the things that I wasn’t taught. Probably one of the hardest things to do is put [together] a concept on how beautiful a place can be … I wanted to put that experience in the music.” It is no coincidence that director Ryan Coogler selected Lamar to produce the Black Panther soundtrack. In contrast to – and possibly in atonement for – Coming to America, the makers of Black Panther seem determined to get things right, drawing on research trips to Africa, historical resources and specific cultural references. The cast combines African and African-American actors, and the national language of Wakanda is, in fact, Xhosa. We have come a long way since Coming to America, observes Olaniyan. “There’s been a kind of normalisation of Africa in popular culture in the US,” he says, “which is the reason why Donald Trump’s ‘shithole’ comments sounded so out of touch. Americans know more Africans, they see more Africans, they visit Africa more, and there are more qualitative interactions between them.” For many, Black Panther is more than just another blockbuster; it is a cultural moment. Wakanda could be a visualisation of that black utopia pan-Africanists have dreamed of. “Black Panther is the beautiful aesthetic climax of just that ideology,” says Boyd-Pates. “That paradigm of black people that exceeds the expectations of white civilisation, that places black people in a place similar in their minds to what they always felt they were robbed of, and connects them back to the motherland in a way no colonial effort could ever undermine.” After centuries of Africa coming to America and vice versa, perhaps we have finally reached the point where they can meet halfway.

These claims tend to go unchallenged and are allowed to shape the political debate – but this has to stop. In a House of Lords debate on air pollution on 15 January, the prominent scientist and Labour peer Lord Robert Winston questioned the government over journey times for motor traffic before and after cycle lane construction, saying idling or slow-moving engines pollute more at slow speeds. Winston asked: “Can the minister give us government figures on the evidence of pollution being greater before bike lanes are introduced than afterwards? This is an important issue in the future planning of our cities.” When asked by the Guardian whether he believed cycle lanes cause congestion or pollution, Winston said “the evidence for longer car journeys where these resulting land closures have taken place is not deniable.” When asked to provide this undeniable evidence, however, Winston merely replied “the traffic delays are not denied by transport users, nor by the government or the minister or even TfL [Transport for London].” The causes of pollution are notoriously tricky to separate, but London Air’s senior air quality analyst, Andrew Grieve described Winston’s claims as “a bit of a case of an anecdote being halfway round the internet before the data analysis has got its shoes on”. Winston’s anecdote, which appears to have started with taxi drivers on Twitter, before spreading, apparently unquestioned, to parts of the press, can be damaging to sustainable transport alternatives; if people believe bike lanes damage air quality, why would they support them? Like air pollution, congestion is not a straightforward issue, but efficiency-wise, cycle lanes are certainly a winner. A recent freedom of information (FoI) request sent to TfL revealed central London’s segregated cycle lanes are moving “five times more people per square metre than the main carriageway”. Within weeks of being built there was a 50% increase in cyclists on London’s cycle superhighway routes, which were moving 46% of people on the road using 30% of the road space. On the superhighway on Blackfriars Road, cyclists make up 70% of traffic. The routes have affected some motor traffic journeys, although not necessarily for the worse; the same FoI request showed that westbound journeys are now quicker than before the cycle route was built, although eastbound journeys are slower.TfL data shows that by summer 2017, a year after the east-west superhighway opened, traffic speeds actually increased by 0.7% on the previous year, reversing a longstanding downward trend from 20.2kph in 2007 to 17.9kph in 2015 – long before the protected cycle routes were built. A 74-page TfL report concludes that the biggest contributors to congestion are traffic volume (55%) and excess demand for road space (16%). TfL expects an extra 5 million trips on London’s roads by 2030. The way to tackle the issue, it says, is to prioritise other modes of travel than the private car or taxi. A 3.5m lane of mixed traffic can carry 2,000 people per hour, a bike lane 14,000, a pavement 19,000, and dedicated public transport, such as rail, up to 100,000 people per hour. The report concludes: “Limited evidence suggests that while these schemes may have short-term negative impacts on traffic speeds during the construction phase, longer term impacts may be negligible.” Perhaps this was not the evidence Lord Winston was hoping for. Meanwhile, parts of the media manage to misinterpret certain findings. An Inrix report last year showed that bike lanes, along with public transport investment, can ultimately help reduce congestion by 20%.Despite this, the Mail and Evening Standard concluded congestion was caused by cycle lanes. There is more than a little of this reverse thinking in some peers’ claims. The Earl of Caithness, a Conservative peer, claimed last July that bike lanes increase congestion but went further, claiming they can result in loss of life when ambulances can’t get to emergency calls on time. Caithness told the Guardian: “I believe some bicycle lanes have been beneficial but traffic is undoubtedly moving slower and is often stationary, pumping out noxious fumes where there are sacrosanct bicycle lanes which restrict the space of the road unnecessarily.” Caithness did not provide any evidence that the lanes had contributed to congestion. In fact, cycle lanes can also be useful for emergency vehicle drivers. Last year the driver of a police vehicle was filmed using a segregated lane on Vauxhall Bridge to circumvent traffic jams. The arguments put forward by some peers appear to be based on a notion that car journeys are inevitable, and that taking away road space naturally creates congestion, when 80 years of data tells us otherwise. The concept of induced demand states for every 1% increase in capacity, traffic will increase by 1% in the long term. Predictably, the inverse is also true: a phenomenon known as traffic evaporation. The fact of induced demand was acknowledged by the Department for Transport (DfT) in 1994, and yet is ignored in practical terms, even by them, to this day. In last month’s air quality debate a DfT junior transport secretary, Baroness Sugg, said: “Of course, cycle lanes are welcome in order to protect cyclists and encourage cycling. I understand that they have increased congestion, but we want to encourage people to cycle.” Neither Baroness Sugg nor the DfT provided any evidence for this assertion either during the debate or when contacted by the Guardian, although the DfT responded with a statement saying the government “wants to encourage cycling.” Ruth Cadbury MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary cycling group, says pro-cycling advocates within parliament are met with scorn when they bring up the benefits of cycling. She said: “That is a real issue in this place and I sometimes worry that myself, and [fellow committee members] Sarah [Wollaston], Meg [Hillier], we stand up and ask a question [on cycling] … and some people say ‘Oh god, she’s going on about that again.’” Cadbury added: “The pro-car narrative is back on the rise again, and that’s really worrying.” The Conservative peer Lord Cormack is among those who believe cabbies hold the answers. Addressing Baroness Sugg, he said: “My Lords, will my noble friend herself meet with some black cab drivers? If she does, will she listen very carefully to what they say has been the result of reducing the lanes on our major roads in London, caused very largely by the creation of cycle lanes?” Cormack also claimed there was “very little activity” on the route between 9am-5pm, saying “every taxi driver confirms this and I have seen it myself on many occasions”. Although Cormack did not provide any evidence for his comments, he stressed this was not simply him believing what black cab drivers say. “I do not know a single colleague in the House of Lords who takes a different view – it was noticeable that my remarks were greeted with approbation in all parts.” It’s worth noting that the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association trade body has protested vociferously against every major cycling scheme proposed in London, even after claiming to support them. Hardly the place to go for unbiased information. Decisions with real consequences are being made based on little more than ill-informed opinion and anecdote, perpetuated by cries from cabbies and parts of the pro-car media. With the future health of the city at stake, shouldn’t we be insisting on a more rigorous, evidence-based approach?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2018/feb/04/simone-lia-introducing-the-kitcoin","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T08:00:52Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia: introducing the kitcoin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/feb/04/simone-lia-introducing-the-kitcoin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/feb/04/simone-lia-introducing-the-kitcoin","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia: introducing the kitcoin","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/01/punk-rock-internet-diy-rebels-working-replace-tech-giants-snoopers-charter","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"The punk rock internet – how DIY ​​rebels ​are working to ​replace the tech giants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/punk-rock-internet-diy-rebels-working-replace-tech-giants-snoopers-charter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/01/punk-rock-internet-diy-rebels-working-replace-tech-giants-snoopers-charter","fields":{"headline":"The punk rock internet – how DIY ​​rebels ​are working to ​replace the tech giants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The office planner on the wall features two reminders: “Technosocialism” and “Indienet institute”. A huge husky named Oskar lies near the door, while the two people who live and work here – a plain apartment block on the west side of Malmö, Sweden – go about their daily business. Aral Balkan and Laura Kalbag moved here from Brighton in 2015. Balkan has Turkish and French citizenship, and says their decision was sparked by two things: increasing concerns about the possibility of Britain leaving the EU, and the Conservative government’s Investigatory Powers Act, otherwise known as the snoopers’ charter, some of which was declared unlawful this week by the court of appeal. The legislation cut straight to the heart of what now defines the couple’s public lives: the mesh of corporate and government surveillance surrounding the internet, and how to do something about it. Kalbag, 31, is from Surrey, has a web design background and says she’s “always been a very socially minded, troublemaking kind of person”. Balkan, 41, traces what he does now to his experiences as a small child, designing his own games for a personal computer. It was “the last time when we actually owned and controlled our computers – there wasn’t some corporation somewhere watching everything we were doing, storing it and monetising it.” Now, they style themselves as “a two-person-and-one-husky social enterprise striving for social justice in the digital age”. Balkan and Kalbag form one small part of a fragmented rebellion whose prime movers tend to be located a long way from Silicon Valley. These people often talk in withering terms about Big Tech titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and pay glowing tribute to Edward Snowden. Their politics vary, but they all have a deep dislike of large concentrations of power and a belief in the kind of egalitarian, pluralistic ideas they say the internet initially embodied. What they are doing could be seen as the online world’s equivalent of punk rock: a scattered revolt against an industry that many now think has grown greedy, intrusive and arrogant – as well as governments whose surveillance programmes have fuelled the same anxieties. As concerns grow about an online realm dominated by a few huge corporations, everyone involved shares one common goal: a comprehensively decentralised internet. Balkan energetically travels the world, delivering TED-esque talks with such titles as “Free is a Lie” and “Avoiding Digital Feudalism”. His appearances have proliferated on YouTube, although he himself uses an online video player that doesn’t harvest personal data. (“If there’s a free and open, decentralised and usable alternative, we try to use it,” he says – he favours, for example, the privacy-respecting search engine DuckDuckGo over Google.) At the same time, he and Kalbag are on a painstaking journey that involves ideas and prototypes aimed at creating a new kind of digital life. Back in 2014, they came up with a plan for the Indiephone, “a beautiful new mobile platform and a phone that empowers regular people to own their own data”. “One of my mistakes was, I told people about it,” says Balkan. “And then we realised there was no way we could finance it.” Assisted by around £100,000 in crowdfunding, they started work on a new kind of social network, called Heartbeat, whose users would hold on to their data, and communicate privately. Since then, they have launched an app for iPhone and Macs called Better Blocker, purchased by about 14,000 people, and with a simple function: in a much more thorough way than most adblocking software, it disables the endless tracking devices that now follow people as they move around the web. In the last few months, they have started working with people in the Belgian city of Ghent – or, in Flemish, Gent – where the authorities own their own internet domain, complete with .gent web addresses. Using the blueprint of Heartbeat, they want to create a new kind of internet they call the indienet – in which people control their data, are not tracked and each own an equal space online. This would be a radical alternative to what we have now: giant “supernodes” that have made a few men in northern California unimaginable amounts of money thanks to the ocean of lucrative personal information billions of people hand over in exchange for their services. “I got into the web because I liked the democracy of it,” says Kalbag, who has just published a book titled Accessibility for Everyone, about innovating in a way that includes those who technology too often ignores – not least people with disabilities. “I want to be able to be in a society where I have control over my information, and other people do as well. Being a woman in technology, you can see how hideously unequal things are and how people building these systems don’t care about anyone other than themselves. I think we have to have technology that serves everybody – not just rich, straight, white guys.” In the Scottish coastal town of Ayr, where a company called MaidSafe works out of a silver-grey office on an industrial estate tucked behind a branch of Topps Tiles, another version of this dream seems more advanced. MaidSafe’s first HQ, in nearby Troon, was an ocean-going boat. The company moved to an office above a bridal shop, and then to an unheated boatshed, where the staff sometimes spent the working day wearing woolly hats. It has been in its new home for three months: 10 people work here, with three in a newly opened office in Chennai, India, and others working remotely in Australia, Slovakia, Spain and China. MaidSafe was founded 12 years ago by the 52-year-old computing engineer and former lifeboat captain David Irvine. He has the air of someone with so many ideas he can barely get them all out. Despite spurning money from venture capitalists, his company has come from humble beginnings to the verge of its proper launch. In a pristine meeting room, Irvine explains a mistake carried over from old-fashioned corporate computer networks to the modern internet. “There’s a big server, and people connect to it. That used to be the way companies work; now, they’ve done the same thing to the internet. Which is remarkably stupid, because they are central points of failure. They’re points of attack. There are passwords on them: stuff gets stolen.” He goes on: “And as the internet was starting, it was clear to me straight away that it would centralise around several large companies and they would basically control the world.” His alternative is what he calls the Safe network: the acronym stands for “Safe Access for Everyone”. In this model, rather than being stored on distant servers, people’s data – files, documents, social-media interactions – will be broken into fragments, encrypted and scattered around other people’s computers and smartphones, meaning that hacking and data theft will become impossible. Thanks to a system of self-authentication in which a Safe user’s encrypted information would only be put back together and unlocked on their own devices, there will be no centrally held passwords. No one will leave data trails, so there will be nothing for big online companies to harvest. The financial lubricant, Irvine says, will be a cryptocurrency called Safecoin: users will pay to store data on the network, and also be rewarded for storing other people’s (encrypted) information on their devices. Software developers, meanwhile, will be rewarded with Safecoin according to the popularity of their apps. There is a community of around 7,000 interested people already working on services that will work on the Safe network, including alternatives to platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. One big question hangs over Irvine’s concept of a decentralised internet: given what we know about what some people use technology for, the encrypted information stored on people’s devices will include fragments of nasty, illegal stuff, won’t it? “It will. It will. It definitely will. It’s all society’s data. All information,” says Irvine I read him a quote from the company’s blog: “Even MaidSafe staff don’t know who is on the network, where they are based, what has been stored and where the data is located.” “No. We don’t know. That’s fine, though.” Is it? Even if it includes child abuse images, or so-called revenge porn or beheading videos? “Yeah. I think it’s fine. Because to me, the whole thing here is like … You’re building a road, and you think: ‘How can I be absolutely certain that a paedophile doesn’t drive on that bit of tarmac?’ You can’t. That’s the thing with the internet. When you’ve got these controlled things like Facebook, of course they could clamp down on some of that stuff. But also, it means they can manipulate the whole of society. And we can’t be in that position.” Irvine adds that MaidSafe’s encryption is no more developed than the kind already used by the net’s criminal elements. “We’re not enabling them. We’re enabling everybody else,” he says. He says he would encourage the police to go on to the network and use the same detection and entrapment methods they already use on the so-called dark web, where users can stay anonymous. Once MaidSafe is up and running, there will be very little any government or authority can do about it: “We can’t stop the network if we start it. If anyone turned round and said: ‘You need to stop that,’ we couldn’t. We’d have to go round to people’s houses and switch off their computers. That’s part of the whole thing. The network is like a cyber-brain; almost a lifeform in itself. And once you start it, that’s it.” Before my trip to Scotland, I tell him, I spent whole futile days signing up to some of the decentralised social networks that already exist – Steemit, Diaspora, Mastadon – and trying to approximate the kind of experience I can easily get on, say, Twitter or Facebook. They were largely so underpopulated that there’s been no incentive to go back. Won’t the same thing happen to MaidSafe? “It might,” he says. But is he optimistic or pessimistic? “Oh, this won’t fail. It won’t. If you ask me: ‘Will this be the future?’ … absolutely. Not necessarily my version, but a version of a completely decentralised network based on privacy, security, freedom – that will exist.” One big focus of the conversation about a different internet are cryptocurrencies and so-called blockchain technology, whose most spectacular story so far has been the rise of Bitcoin. All users of a cryptocurrency have their own “private key”, which unlocks the opportunity to buy and sell it. Instead of financial transactions having to be hosted by a bank – or, for that matter, an online service such as PayPal – a payment in a cryptocurrency is validated by a network of computers using a shared algorithim. A record of the transaction is added to an online ledger – the blockchain – in a way that is unalterable. And herein lie two potential breakthroughs. One, according to some cryptocurrency enthusiasts, is a means of securing and protecting people’s identities that doesn’t rely on remotely stored passwords. The other is a hope that we can leave behind intermediaries such as Uber and eBay, and allow buyers and sellers to deal directly with each other. Blockstack, a startup based in New York, aims to bring blockchain technology to the masses. Like MaidSafe, its creators aim to build a new internet, and a 13,000-strong crowd of developers are already working on apps that either run on the platform Blockstack has created, or use its features. OpenBazaar is an eBay-esque service, up and running since November last year, which promises “the world’s most private, secure, and liberating online marketplace”. Casa aims to be an decentralised alternative to Airbnb; Guild is a would-be blogging service that bigs up its libertarian ethos and boasts that its founders will have “no power to remove blogs they don’t approve of or agree with”. Muneeb Ali, 36, is originally from Islamabad in Pakistan and is one of Blockstack’s two founders. He is an admirer of Snowden, who, in March, will be the star attraction at a Blockstack event in Berlin. An initial version of Blockstack is already up and running. Even if data is stored on conventional drives, servers and clouds, thanks to its blockchain-based “private key” system each Blockstack user controls the kind of personal information we currently blithely hand over to Big Tech, and has the unique power to unlock it. “That’s something that’s extremely powerful – and not just because you know your data is more secure because you’re not giving it to a company,” he says. “A hacker would have to hack a million people if they wanted access to their data.” It’s significant that Blockstack isn’t based in northern California: Ali says: “The culture in Silicon Valley isn’t the right fit for us.” Even though the startup has attracted millions of dollars from its backers – who include venture capitalists – Ali insists they are in for the long haul. Back in Malmö, Balkan recalls that Zuckerberg put out a new year statement in which he tried to sound a note of sympathy with people who have grown sick of an online world controlled by a few big players. “In the 1990s and 2000s, most people believed technology would be a decentralising force,” Zuckerberg wrote. “But today, many people have lost faith in that promise. With the rise of a small number of big tech companies – and governments using technology to watch their citizens – many people now believe technology only centralises power rather than decentralises it.” He mentioned encryption and cryptocurrencies, and said he was “interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies and how best to use them in our services”. Balkan marvels. “How does that work with a huge entity like Facebook, that just sucks power up?” he asks. “It’s absolute spin.” He and Kalbag have much more modest ambitions, and that, he says, is the whole point: if we want a more diverse, open, decentralised internet, developers are going to have to wave goodbye to the idea of huge platforms that will supposedly make them rich. “We’ve kind of been brainwashed into this Silicon Valley idea of success,” he says. “You know: ‘Unless you’ve made a billion dollars and you’re on the cover of Forbes magazine as the next king, you’re not successful.’ With our projects, no one’s going to make a billion dollars if we’re successful – not me, not Laura, not anyone.” He drains the last of his coffee and checks his phone. “And if we do, you’ll know something’s gone wrong. We’ll have screwed up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/live/2018/feb/01/pearl-mackie-webchat-doctor-who-birthday-party","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T13:03:39Z","webTitle":"Pearl Mackie webchat – your questions answered on Cybermen, Pinter and soul classics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/live/2018/feb/01/pearl-mackie-webchat-doctor-who-birthday-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/live/2018/feb/01/pearl-mackie-webchat-doctor-who-birthday-party","fields":{"headline":"Pearl Mackie webchat – your questions answered on Cybermen, Pinter and soul classics","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Catherine32 asks: Which five soul records always get you up and dancing?

Her character, Bill Potts, who went from serving chips to saving the Earth, is now one of the show’s most loved sidekicks. She also made history by becoming the series’ first gay companion, falling in love with student Heather, who was heartbreakingly turned into a puddle. Born in Brixton, Mackie decided she wanted to be an actor while her mum was plaiting her hair. “I was watching Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis and I said, ‘I want to do that!’ She was like ‘OK’ and kept combing.” The problem was, Mackie has said, “I didn’t see many people who looked like me on TV.” She went on to study at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school, before appearing on the BBC soap Doctors and in the West End in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. She has also dabbled in music – singing in the nu-folk band Freddie and the Hoares. Now, she is performing in an all-star revival of Harold Pinter’s cryptic classic The Birthday Party at the Harold Pinter theatre, London.

How did we come to this?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two Sundays ago, Philadelphia police district captains were granted an unusual expansion to their powers: they were allowed to smear Crisco – vegetable shortening used for cooking – on streetlights. The idea was to prevent Philadelphia Eagles fans celebrating their team’s victory in the NFC Championship Game from climbing the poles – as Eagles fans traditionally tend to do – risking injury and damage to public property. But Crisco wasn’t enough to stop them. Some of the estimated 12,000 fans who filled the streets following the Eagles’ victory over the Minnesota Vikings scaled the greased poles anyway, achieving viral video fame in the process. There was even the suggestion that police had goaded them into trying. “The fact that we were greasing [the streetlights] doesn’t mean we were daring people to climb them,” Sgt Eric Gripp, police spokesman, told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “It’s the exact opposite ... Unfortunately it became a thing ahead of time so people thought we were daring them to topple the grease.” Police are being more circumspect about their contingency plans for an Eagles victory against the New England Patriots at the Super Bowl in Minneapolis this weekend. At a press conference on Tuesday, Philadelphia police commissioner Richard Ross said Crisco would not be employed again because it wasn’t slick enough, adding: “We will be doing some other things relative to keeping fans off certain objects.” But as the Inquirer’s Stephanie Farr observed, “in a city that’s famous for rebellion and has a well-established greased-pole climbing competition, protecting Philly fans from themselves is far from a piece of cake, even if you have all the Crisco in the world”. Philadelphia’s light pole challenge is a reminder that mayhem is as much a part of team sports as trophy presentations and parades, and one city officials dutifully prepare to manage. When the final seconds tick down at the Super Bowl, chaos from thousands of fans celebrating victory or lashing out over defeat will hit the streets not just of Minneapolis, but the homes of both teams. The Philadelphia Eagles have never won a Super Bowl in the 52-year history of the game – they haven’t even taken part since 2005. It has only fuelled the enthusiasm of a fanbase desperate to celebrate its first championship. If the Eagles win, city police expect the number of fans in the streets to dwarf the 12,000 of two weeks ago. They also say they’ll be ready for anything, implementing checkpoints to inspect fans for weapons and bottles. “We will be ready. We will be out there with a sizeable contingent of offices,” said commissioner Ross, refusing to give a specific number. “We will make every effort to show that we are about business, but we are also in the business of allowing people to celebrate – as long as it’s done peacefully.” Philadelphia’s preparations pale in comparison with those under way in Minneapolis. When the city was selected as the host of Super Bowl LII, all the way back in May 2014, officials began an exhaustive process of preparing for the crush of fans due to hit the area. Representatives from the Minneapolis police department were sent to Arizona for the Super Bowl in 2015, Santa Clara in 2016 and then to Houston last year to shadow and learn from the efforts there. Minneapolis plans to meld Santa Clara’s strategy of a highly visible police presence with the less intrusive methods adopted in Houston 12 months ago. The plan utilises a “joint powers agreement” facilitating the cooperation of 59 local law enforcement agencies, including public safety officials at state and federal levels. Dogs, cameras and even some police officers wearing Swat gear will be visible as other officers work the crowds undercover. Minneapolis police spokesperson Sgt Darcy Horn said there would be more emergency call responders rostered on and that they, “along with 10,000 volunteers, will be visible at the Super Bowl events throughout the metro area and around downtown Minneapolis”. Horn would not say whether there were intentions to grease streetlights in Minneapolis in preparation for the influx of Eagles supporters, saying only that police’s “contingency plans encompass a wide variety of factors, including zealous die-hard fans”. The reality of hosting large sporting events is that lives can be at stake. Following the Detroit Tigers’ World Series baseball victory in 1984, some fans looted buildings and burned police cars; the opposing team, the San Diego Padres, needed a police escort to escape the area unscathed. Six years later, after the Detroit Pistons’ NBA Finals win, seven people were killed during the resulting violence. More than 30 years later, Detroit is still cited as a cautionary tale of what can happen when cities aren’t prepared for fans’ celebratory chaos. Vancouver’s image took a similar hit due to the riot that followed ice hockey side the Canucks losing in the 2011 Stanley Cup final. Though there was no loss of life, rioters caused extensive damage throughout the city, with costs estimated to have exceeded $4m. Some 140 people, including several police officers, were injured; there were four stabbings, fires were started, and more than 300 people were eventually charged. These types of incidents are by no means confined to North America. Last November, celebrations in the Auckland suburb of Otahuhu got out of hand after Tonga beat the Kiwis in the Rugby League World Cup. Fireworks were set off near a gasoline station and objects were hurled at police, resulting in 53 arrests. In Colombia in 2013, 40 fan fatalities linked to football-related violence were recorded; 18 died the same year in Argentina, prompting Lionel Messi to release an anti-violence video. Even the gentleman’s game is not excepted: a controversial umpiring decision in a cricket match between New South Wales and an English team in the late 19th century prompted the Sydney riot of 1879, in which enraged fans stormed the pitch and attacked both the umpire and the English players. But in present day Boston, at least, they are quietly confident ahead of the Super Bowl LII – both in their preparations for Sunday’s crowds and of the Patriots’ chances for a record-tying sixth title. It will be the Patriots’ eighth Super Bowl appearance in the past 17 years, while Boston’s professional baseball, basketball and hockey teams have made several championship round appearances over the same period. Dealing with the influx of hundreds of thousands of people for championship parades is business as usual for the city, but officials take it no less seriously. Officer Rachel McGuire gave a clear nod to the city’s run of sporting successes in her emailed response to questions about police’s preparations for Super Bowl Sunday: “We do anticipate the plan being very similar to those of the past (SEVERAL) years.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/football-league-blog/2018/jan/31/josh-harrop-preston-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T13:36:00Z","webTitle":"Why Josh Harrop gambled on Preston being a better bet than Old Trafford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/jan/31/josh-harrop-preston-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/football-league-blog/2018/jan/31/josh-harrop-preston-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Why Josh Harrop gambled on Preston being a better bet than Old Trafford","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fifteen minutes into his Manchester United debut he raced on to a nonchalant outside-of-the-boot pass by Paul Pogba, bamboozling Martin Kelly, the Crystal Palace defender, before wrapping his right foot round the ball and lashing it beyond the powerless Wayne Hennessey. For Josh Harrop the rest is history. He left Old Trafford 33 days later, rejecting a new three-year contract in favour of a move to Preston North End. The midfielder turned 22 in December and to say it was a big decision is probably an understatement. A Stockport boy on United’s books since the age of seven, he left after impressing on his first start and scoring a goal that in some ways was more than 14 years in the making. He concedes how the euphoria surrounding that unforgettable May afternoon last year and the praise that followed it made the conundrum even trickier, recalling the goose bumps as he walked out of the tunnel and the cramps in his legs after wheeling away towards the corner flag to the left of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. “It was a massive decision and the Palace goal was a great thing for me and my family, especially coming on my debut, and it was not easy to leave after that,” he says. “It was the team I was at all of my life, so the few days after were a bit of blur, really.” The precursor to an unforgettable debut was an emphatic hat-trick for the reserves, at the same venue, against Tottenham Hotspur five days earlier, in front of José Mourinho and his assistants, Silvino Louro and Rui Faria. “Mourinho asked me if I was ready,” Harrop says, his reply a given. “He was a fine guy if I wanted to go to speak to him but I’m not really like that. I would rather just play my football.” He weighed up his future and the likelihood of first-team chances over conversations with Nicky Butt, the United academy manager whom he credits with “stepping up his game” and fitness levels, John Alexander, the club’s former secretary, plus team-mates and friends, including the reserves’ goalkeeper, Kieran O’Hara. The verdict was that few opportunities were likely to be granted. But most pertinently Harrop spoke with his parents, Andy and Nicola. “I take their words very wisely,” he says. “They have done a lot of miles and put a lot of work to get me where I am and obviously without their time and effort I wouldn’t be here. My dad thought it was the right thing to do. He thought I needed to get out and prove myself and do it where I’m going to be seen.” Harrop refers to the rapid ascent of Tammy Abraham, on loan at Bristol City last season, and John Swift, a former England Under-20 team-mate, who has made a splash at Reading since opting to walk out on Chelsea in 2016. This season Tom Lawrence, whom he regularly played alongside for the reserves at United, is making quite a dent at Derby County. “There are a few out there, who have made the step into the Championship and are doing well,” Harrop says, adding the second tier is “totally different” from the world of under-23s football. Some of Harrop’s friends and former team-mates, namely Scott McTominay and Axel Tuanzebe, have been afforded the odd opportunity by Mourinho this season, albeit predominantly in cup competitions. Tuanzebe dropped into the second tier last week after joining Aston Villa on loan until May. “It’s brilliant for the lads,” he says. “It could have been a route for me; I don’t know to be honest. It’s great for them and they’re doing really well but my decision to leave was based on coming to get experience. I feel it’s definitely been the right decision.” What would his message be to any peers reluctant to make a similar jump? “I feel like some players find it hard to move on from a club they have been at for years, which is understandable. Some find it hard, being young, to make that step. I feel if you’ve got a strong mentality and you are confident, that’s the main thing. If you believe in your ability, it doesn’t matter where you’re playing.” Leaving his boyhood club also meant moving out of the family home, a short drive from United’s Carrington training complex. After initially travelling in from Manchester, Harrop now lives in an apartment in Worsley, while he looks for a house, sharing lifts to training with the midfielder Ben Pearson, another former United academy graduate. But which home comforts does he miss most? “My mum cooking my teas – she does a good chicken stir fry. I’m getting used to it now,” he says, breaking into laughter. “But that was a big shock at first.” Harrop is one of three former United players in Alex Neil’s squad, Pearson and Marnick Vermijl being the others, and has quickly slotted into a an intriguing mixture of young players determined to make the grade, such as Alan Browne or Callum Robinson, and experienced campaigners, including the captain, Tom Clarke. A 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest on Tuesday night moved Preston to within touching distance of the top six, so what can they achieve under Neil? “We are looking to get into the play-offs and there is no reason we cannot get promotion,” Harrop says. “We want to improve and we feel like we have got a chance. Anything’s realistic; it’s football at the end of the day.” Talking points • The rigmarole of deadline day is not yet in full swing but there have been a couple of intriguing signings, none more so than Jack Harrison’s loan move to Middlesbrough. The 21-year-old joined Manchester City from City Football Group’s sister club New York City and immediately became Tony Pulis’s first signing as manager. Harrison left Manchester United’s academy seven years ago to study in the United States. He played with David Villa and Andrea Pirlo in New York and arrives on Teesside with a burgeoning reputation. • After a bumpy start Aston Villa seem to be heading in only one direction in the Championship. Five straight league wins have hoisted them to third, with home matches against Burton and then a much-improved Birmingham on the horizon. John Terry is back from injury and players such as Robert Snodgrass, who scored a last-minute winner at Bramall Lane on Tuesday, have hit form. “I must admit, there is a good feeling amongst the group,” said the assistant manager Colin Calderwood. • What is it about Paris Cowan-Hall and Gareth Ainsworth? The Wycombe manager re-signed the forward for a fourth time last February and it seems the 27-year-old, whose face has not always fit at previous clubs, is fully at home at Adams Park. Cowan-Hall has scored three goals in as many league games, lifting the club to second in League Two and is arguably playing the best football of his career. “You feel the buzz around the place when Paris is on the ball,” Ainsworth said – and Wycombe supporters would doubtless agree."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/31/brexit-good-friday-agreement-britain-eu-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T06:01:00Z","webTitle":"Brexit must not endanger the Good Friday agreement | Simon Coveney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/31/brexit-good-friday-agreement-britain-eu-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/31/brexit-good-friday-agreement-britain-eu-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Brexit must not endanger the Good Friday agreement","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To say Ireland and the UK are close friends and neighbours is more than just a platitude. For many generations, Britain was the first place where our people sought work when our economy faltered. And Britain was enriched by the arrival of Irish people too. These women and men provided a much-needed labour force that helped build the infrastructure in British cities and provided the teachers and nurses who taught and cared for communities. The legacy of that was a deeply integrated Irish community, which has contributed greatly to the development of this country. Our economies are closely intertwined across so many sectors. There are now more than 60,000 Irish-born directors on the boards of UK companies. We have a trading relationship worth over £55bn a year, sustaining more than 400,000 jobs across both islands. The flow of people across the Irish Sea every day has made the Dublin-London air corridor the second busiest in the world. Our relationship is deeper, richer and more enduring than the issue of Brexit – just as it was always more layered and complex than it appeared to be during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. However, we cannot be complacent. As in all good friendships, there must be honesty and trust. While we often – usually, in fact – agree, we should be able to disagree too. In fact I’d go further: the capacity to disagree, openly and honestly, and then to move on is the mark of genuine friendship. We disagreed on Brexit. We hoped the UK electorate wouldn’t vote for it. But it did, by a narrow margin. And now we are determined to ensure that, no matter what else, Ireland-UK relations do not suffer as a consequence. This involves protecting perhaps the greatest UK-Ireland achievement of recent times: the Good Friday agreement of 1998. The agreement removed barriers and borders – both physically, on the island of Ireland; and emotionally, between communities in Ireland and between our two islands. The genius of the agreement is that it provides a framework for all of the relationships on our two islands – between communities in Northern Ireland, between north and south on the island of Ireland, and across the Irish Sea. I am always struck by just how carefully woven together these relationships are, with each of the three interlocking relationships reinforcing the others. Strengthen one, and you strengthen all; damage one and you damage all. In looking to deepen our UK-Ireland cooperation in a European Union without Britain, we are fortunate that there are already a number of East-West institutions provided for in the Good Friday agreement that could be utilised to fuller effect. We also have the British-Irish parliamentary assembly, and regular meetings of all our permanent secretaries and secretaries general. These structures matter as much because of the personal interactions they help facilitate as any kind of formal agendas. As the UK leaves the EU, we don’t want to lose the kind of cooperation that can be fostered by a simple conversation on a corridor or a cup of coffee on the margins of a meeting. British and Irish politicians and officials need to keep working and meeting together to ensure that the understanding we have of each other does not diminish. It is probably fair to say that our journeys as EU member states have been quite different. As an Irish citizen born just one month after our EU accession referendum, I grew up in an Ireland demonstrably benefiting from EU membership. Our membership of the EU has quite simply been transformative. It has allowed us to develop and grow into a confident country, at ease with ourselves and our neighbours. But make no mistake either – Ireland needs and wants our neighbours to be prosperous too. We think the closest possible future UK relationship with the world’s most successful single market – a market British genius helped design – is the best way to ensure that this comes to pass.

It’s also something I ate regularly when I got home from school in Lincolnshire, while sitting in front of the telly and watching Neighbours, as well as something I wanted to eat almost every day when I was pregnant. It might be simple and cheap, but it’s also delicious and wholesome, and deserves to continue for many more generations. Gujarati potato and cabbage curry My mother uses waxy potatoes such as charlotte or anya in this, because they hold their shape when cooked; I prefer crumbly, fudgy spuds such as maris pipers, which merge into the sauce. Boost the table offering with a dal or spinach curry. Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Serves 4 800g maris piper potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm cubes Salt and black pepper 3 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 pinch fenugreek seeds ½ tsp black mustard seeds 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 200g tinned plum tomatoes with their juice (ie, half a tin) 500g white cabbage (ie, half a large one), cored and shredded 1 tsp ground coriander ⅓ tsp turmeric 1 ½ tsp ground red chilli powder 250ml lukewarm water To serve Chapatis Non-dairy yoghurt Fresh coriander Put the potatoes in a pan, cover with cold water, add a teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, then drain and leave to steam. While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil over a medium flame in a large frying pan for which you have a lid. Once it’s very hot, add the fenugreek, mustard and cumin seeds and, when they start to crackle, stir in the onion and fry for six minutes, until soft. Add the garlic, cook for two minutes, then add the tomatoes, tipping them in with one hand and crushing them with the other as they hit the pan. Cook until the tomatoes become concentrated and paste-like and the oil floats to the top – about eight to 10 minutes. Turn up the heat, add the cabbage and stir until well coated in the tomato mixture, then cover the pan and leave to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring infrequently (every couple of minutes, say), so the cabbage caramelises a little while it softens. When the cabbage is soft, fold in the potatoes, the ground spices and a teaspoon and a half of salt, and stir gently, so the potatoes don’t break up too much. Add the lukewarm water bit by bit, stirring after each addition, and leave to cook down for five minutes, until the liquid thickens into a sauce. Check and adjust the seasoning, then take off the heat. Serve generous helpings of the curry with warm chapatis (heat according to the packet instructions) , a large spoonful of non-dairy yoghurt and a couple of sprigs of fresh coriander.

Sally Hawkins, the mute heroine of The Shape of Water, steals the show making barely a sound. Looking back through movie and Oscars history, silence is often golden. There are three types of movie mute. The first is the homage to the silent era. This worked for The Artist and Jean Dujardin, and clowns, from Mr Bean to Silent Bob. The second is the genuinely mute character: Patty Duke won best supporting actress in 1963 for playing Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker; mostly silent Marlee Matlin won best actress for Children of a Lesser God in 1987; and the wordless Ukrainian drama The Tribe, set in a school for the deaf, took things to new extremes. But the third, and most interesting category is the silent victim. Hawkins’s muteness speaks of her general disempowerment. She is exploited, manipulated and ignored – especially by men. It could have been worse. In 1948’s Johnny Belinda, Jane Wyman’s mute, orphaned farmgirl becomes pregnant after being raped, then her rapist kills her stepfather and tries to take her baby from her, then she is put on trial for murder. It was based on a true story. Wyman won a best actress Oscar for it. It wasn’t quite so bad for Samantha Morton’s smiling, silent clown in Woody Allen’s 1999 Sweet and Lowdown. Sean Penn’s self-centred musician treats her like dirt, but she gets her revenge (and Morton got an Oscar nomination). Jane Campion moved things on somewhat with The Piano. Holly Hunter (another Oscar-winner) plays another voiceless, disempowered woman. But Hunter’s Victorian mail-order bride is no victim. We get to hear her inner voice, and her silence ultimately becomes a gesture of defiance, seeing off Sam Neill’s attempts to rape her and Harvey Keitel’s attempts to own her. It is not always women: let’s not forget Leonardo DiCaprio’s almost voiceless (and again, Oscar-winning) victim in The Revenant and Duncan Jones’s anticipated Netflix release Mute, with Alexander Skarsgård as a mute bartender. Nor is Sally Hawkins the only mute in The Shape of Water. There is the humanoid fish-monster, himself. Incarcerated and considered subhuman, he’s in the same boat as her and belongs to a further category of movie mute: the misunderstood monster, whose lineage extends back through King Kong, Frankenstein’s monster and possibly Edward Scissorhands, all of whom generate sympathy with their silence. As Norma Desmond once said, lamenting the demise of silent movies: “We didn’t need dialogue, we had faces.” That’s still true today. The Shape of Water is in cinemas from 14 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/31/breastfeeding-everywhere-people-great-support-strangers-anxious-mums","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"I’m breastfeeding everywhere – and guess what?

People are great about it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My breasts are becoming a more common sight on the train than ticket inspectors. To date I have breastfed in the library, in the window seat of at least three cafes, on a sofa outside the men’s toilet (comfiest place to sit available), in front of the postman, on the bus, in a pub, on a park bench in the frost, during therapy, standing up at an exhibition, on the tube, at a private members’ club and sitting on a log in the middle of Epping Forest. I’m not an exhibitionist and my breasts have never been much to write home about. But after years of stripping off in the cold light of day to swim outdoors, combined with a somewhat lackadaisical attitude to sterilising, not to mention, oh I don’t know, the fairly essential need to keep my child alive, I have precisely zero qualms about getting my pink and lightly-chewed nipples out wherever I need to these days. And here’s the bit you’re probably not expecting – people are great about it. When my baby was just four weeks old, a man on the bus with very few teeth and a somewhat deflated padded jacket smiled, helped put my baby’s hat on straight as I fed and then gave me a Korean red ginseng sweet that tasted like old soil, saying it would be good for my health. I mean, the sweet tasted of pure soil and I waited for him to eat one first just to check it wasn’t soil, but it was so kind and he was so easygoing that I nigh-on welled up. As I breastfed by the entrance to my local library a lovely woman with spectacles dancing on the end of a gold neck chain and frost-coloured highlights in her hair came over, gave me a conspiratorial wink and said: “I got told off for doing that in John Lewis once. Thank God things have changed.” When I walked into a cafe at the top of my road, a beetroot-faced and screaming baby on my shoulder, the woman behind the counter rushed over, put me in a seat, brought me over a pint of tap water and ordered me to feed my baby before worrying about the menu. I am lucky, I know, to live in London – a city of immigrants, blow-ins, the young and busy. These people bring to my breasts their own cultural associations, usually far more positive than the sort of pink-faced, leaf-blower-shouting you often hear from older British white men about how the sight of 4cm of naked maternal breast ruined a perfectly good pint of Speckled Dick down at The Dog and Todger. More often than not, people just ignore me. Carry on frantically WhatsApping their lover, talking to their mates, swiping cartoon sweets on tiny glowing screens or applying their makeup. It is 36 years since Harriet Harman breastfed her daughter in the House of Commons – an event that got passed down to me by my own mother like antibodies against the patriarchy. And yet there lingers, a very real fear among women, even new mothers, of taking up room. Of “imposing” the breathing, moving, eating, shitting reality of human life upon innocent bystanders; on “real” people. The feeling that we should leave any social space the moment our baby makes a noise is hard to shift, even for such a hardened nipple-airer as me. Unless you’re in one of the brilliant breastfeeding cafes run by a local council – that are now, of course, being destroyed by the government’s funding cuts and Jeremy Hunt’s mismanagement of health and social care – the pressure to go and stand out in the cold, on a hard pavement, trying to dodge the smokers and dogs, to bounce, rock or sing your baby back to silent passivity can be enormous. Don’t give in. Whether you’re breastfeeding, bottle-feeding or both; feed your baby. Feed them anywhere and everywhere. Do it for your baby, do it for yourself but also, if you don’t mind, do it for women like me, because the more of us there are, the easier it becomes. And if you’re not a mother, be supportive anyway. A friend in Liverpool told me that the other day, as she fed her baby in a cafe, another woman – a perfect stranger – walked over and gave her a card that said well done for breastfeeding in public. She told my friend to pass it on to the next breastfeeding woman she saw. If you see a woman feeding a baby in public make her feel welcome; give her a nod of encouragement, get her a glass of water, ask her if she needs anything and for God’s sake give her a seat. It doesn’t take much but it means a lot. Now I’ve got that off my chest, I’m off to get my chest out on the train again. • Nell Frizzell is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-australia-day-we-need-to-debate-our-history-not-deny-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T19:42:15Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Australia Day: we need to debate our history, not deny it  | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-australia-day-we-need-to-debate-our-history-not-deny-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-australia-day-we-need-to-debate-our-history-not-deny-it","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Australia Day: we need to debate our history, not deny it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said last week that “a free country debates its history, it does not deny it.” He was right. But he did not appear to be listening to himself. With his next breath he sought to dismiss the growing discussions about whether Australia Day should be moved, portraying advocates as sowers of discord. Yet to ask whether the anniversary of the first fleet’s arrival in Sydney Cove in 1788 is appropriate for the national celebration is precisely to address the most consequential questions about the country’s past. The meaning of 26 January has to be part of the big, honest discussion that just might lead to a lasting reconciliation. Mr Turnbull acknowledged that, for Indigenous Australians, European settlement has been “complex and tragic” – but insisted it was “divisive” to suggest that they might not want to celebrate the date of their colonisation, as if the conversation itself is the problem rather than the historical facts about massacre and dispossession. He appeared to imply that it is somehow unpatriotic to advocate for #changethedate, as if it were impossible to be both a proud Australian and also painfully aware that some kind of reconciliation with Indigenous Australia is the nation’s most chafing piece of unfinished business. He has even tried to deny that this debate was happening in any significant way at all. He claimed that it was the preoccupation of “a tiny handful of people”. The truth is that it is happening in spite of the major parties. The discussion is playing out across news sites and radio stations and at water coolers around the country. Despite predictable attempts to turn it into a tedious culture war by tabloid columnists and desperate attention-seeking provocateurs, this is not a new discussion, but one that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have long been seeking: “When it comes to the subject of 26 January, the overwhelming sentiment among First Nations people is an uneasy blend of melancholy approaching outright grief, of profound despair, of opposition and antipathy, and always of staunch defiance,” writes Jack Latimore, co-editor of the collaborative Twitter account IndigenousX. Protests about 26 January trace back to 1938. The national strategy that followed the 1990s’ decade-long process to achieve reconciliation also recommended the date be changed. Indigenous leaders and advisers mostly back a shift. They include the co-chair of the prime minister’s own Indigenous advisory council, Chris Sarra, as well as Reconciliation Australia and the Healing Foundation. There are those who support change but argue that it is not a priority. Some, like the academic and author Tony Birch, say it’s more important to have a deeper conversation, because changing the date won’t make the history of violence against Aboriginal people any less offensive, or forgotten. Others, like the Indigenous leader Noel Pearson, have suggested changing and broadening our understanding of exactly what we are celebrating on 26 January. Polls suggest that the movement to #changethedate is not yet backed by a majority of Australians, but every year the momentum builds – including among non-Indigenous Australians, from Mr Turnbull’s former cabinet colleague Ian Macfarlane to the former tennis champion Pat Cash to the TV host Eddie McGuire. Today, 26 January, is simply the wrong day for national festivities, and that means we need a respectful conversation – about changing the date and the meaning of the celebration – without cartoonish campaigns trying to whip it into a left/right fight or a chest-beating test of patriotism. The prime minister had it exactly right before he undermined his own argument. Australia needs to debate its history, not deny it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jan/25/davos-2018-may-trump-hammond-lagarde-climate-change-crypto-tax-avoidance-day-three-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T21:24:27Z","webTitle":"Davos 2018: Donald Trump, Theresa May and George Soros at WEF - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/25/davos-2018-may-trump-hammond-lagarde-climate-change-crypto-tax-avoidance-day-three-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jan/25/davos-2018-may-trump-hammond-lagarde-climate-change-crypto-tax-avoidance-day-three-live","fields":{"headline":"Davos 2018: Donald Trump, Theresa May and George Soros at WEF - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press’s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of “God and Donald Trump” by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here’s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That’s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here’s some colour from Donald Trump’s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump’s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West’s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestlé’s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump’s asides: “When he says he works for Siemens, he’s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that’s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.” Trump spoke about the thriving American economy – crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to ‘build their nest eggs abroad”. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used to pay wages It’s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa’s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It’s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don’t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn’t reply (I’m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn’t given up hope that Brexit won’t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of “deliberately engineering addiction”, which is “particularly harmful” for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they’ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they’re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It’s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality….and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He’s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. “In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can’t”, Soros continues, because America’s institutions, constitution and its “vibrant civil society” won’t allow it. If you’re just tuning in, here’s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump’s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe’s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)—Germany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)—Germany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)—Germany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)—Norway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)—Switzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)—Switzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)—UK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)—France Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)—Belgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)—Finland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)—UK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)—Sweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)—Germany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)—Germany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)—Switzerland • This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito’s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a “working visit”. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: “Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. “If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.” The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a “working visit” to London. That may mean that it won’t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here’s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran’s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the “special relationship” between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn’t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been “really good” and “very successful”, before calling it a “very great day”. Here’s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) “I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that’s the message. It’s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.” Here’s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: “America’s great” Q: Is everybody else great? “Everyone’s great,” Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday’s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to”the use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn’t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.” Mnuchin’s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain’s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but ‎I thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government’s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don’t know what details still need to be finalised, so it’s possible that officials can’t actually get Donald Trump’s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he’s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he’d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It’s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on ‘finalising the details’ of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.” There’s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier’s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company’s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on “finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year”, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here’s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There’s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there’s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn’t show respect. He said “they disrespected our great Vice President” (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn’t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): “The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump’s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was “excellent”. Here’s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump “Its a false rumor” that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. “We’re on the same wavelength in I think every respect” The two are “liking each other a lot” and “joined at the hip” when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it’s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase ‘many times’, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they’ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump’s meetings are taking place. I’ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn’t mean they’ve all been meeting the US president - there’s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn’t mean ECB communication but other people’s communication. We don’t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it’s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn’t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it’s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today’s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don’t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn’t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can’t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn’t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don’t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn’t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We’ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of ‘liking each other a lot”. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you’re doing, and we love your country. We think it’s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May’s meeting with Trump is over - she’s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel’s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He’s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it’s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here’s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump’s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump’s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. “Thank you very much. Great country.” Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren’t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies “Peace and prosperity”. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let’s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That’s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a “World leader in innovation-friendly regulation” she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must “step up to their responsibilities”, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It’s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn’t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can’t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain’s digital skills for the 21st century. We’re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we’re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn’t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people’s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren’t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May’s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May’s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it’s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she’s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain’s future after Brexit. “There’s a lot of uncertainty right now”. At the CBI’s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That’s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won’t work. Unusually for trade talks, we’re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that’s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you’d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current €30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels “for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.” Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi’s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank’s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That’s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It’s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider’s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There’s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You’d almost think the global elite didn’t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI’s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May’s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I’m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It’s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it’s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it’s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there’s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland’s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received €13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn’t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he’s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It’s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That’s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren’t best pleased by this intervention (unless we’ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won’t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn’s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott’s there, so we’ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai’s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It’s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she’s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn’t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we’ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London’s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and “the centre of our negotiating strategy”. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of £100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of £40bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump’s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he’s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: “In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.” Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn’t want less trade it wants “fair trade”. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: “Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can’t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn’t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can’t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there’s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That’s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain’s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa’s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there’s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May’s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year’s Davos “sitting in a hotel eating fondue” rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new £120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: ‘Elsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. ‘Does she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. ‘As we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.’ More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University’s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba’s Jack Ma last year. He’s still at Davos, so there’s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan’s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday’s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump’s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn’t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar ‘is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities’. He also pointed out that that he isn’t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at €1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank’s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank’s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday’s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria’s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today’s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can’t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn’t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn’t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May’s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd’s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. “It is the fastest growing part of our business”, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: “Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.” Lloyd’s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. “People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.” Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd’s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world’s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She’s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what’s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don’t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must “raise up their voice”, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn’t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he’s “very happy” with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America’s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President’s Trump’s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is “more interested” in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn’t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they’re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF’s security cordon and swanky parties: “Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. “But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn’t working for billions of people. “And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK’s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He’s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: “We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.” Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: “To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods”. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. “Let’s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.” Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. “The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?” Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It’s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon – and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She’ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.” Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We’ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There’s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change.

Here's how to end it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If there is a single economic policy that symbolises the dominant economic ideology of the decades from the 1970s to the global financial crisis, that policy is privatisation. The ideology, variously called neoliberalism, market liberalism and economic rationalism, involves rolling back the growth of the state, greatly expanding the role of the financial sector, and removing restrictions on international flows of capital. Privatisation, the conversion of public enterprises into private corporations through share floats or outright sale to a (normally foreign) buyer encapsulate all these aspects of neoliberalism. It is striking that, given the near-universal political consensus in favour of neoliberalism, and particularly privatisation, that the public has never embraced this idea. Indeed, far from becoming accustomed to privatisation, voters have become more resolutely hostile, as numerous Australian governments have found to their cost. Voters have had a couple of decades of experience by now in having all manner of things sold off: from the national airline to public transport systems, ports, railway lines, the Commonwealth Bank and even the national telephone network. We get it. But rather than allaying concerns, familiarity with privatisation has bred contempt in the electorate. Public views on privatisation are firmly negative and consistently so. Advocates of privatisation often ask, rhetorically, whether their opponents would support reversing past renationalisation. The opinion poll evidence suggests that, for most voters, the answer is yes. Until recently, however, it was an open question whether such responses to opinion polls would be translated into votes. Since no major party would advocate renationalisation, the question remained unanswered until Labour’s 2016 election campaign in the UK. Leading a deeply divided party, and without a coherent policy on the central issue of Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn went to the polls on a platform that included renationalisation of the water, electricity, gas and rail industries. The pundits were united in predicting disaster, but Corbyn achieved a huge swing and came within a few seats of winning office. The remaining trump card of those who oppose renationalisation is the claim that it is “unaffordable”. Renationalisation, it is suggested, would use capital that could otherwise be invested in schools and hospitals. Economists of all persuasions have always understood that this is nonsense. Investments in assets that do not return an income flow to the government, such as schools and hospitals, must ultimately be financed by taxation. By contrast, as long as the earnings of a government enterprise are sufficient to service the debt needed to acquire or create it (which will be true if public ownership is more efficient than the private sector alternative), there is no additional requirement for taxation. Voters have reached the same conclusion by a different route. For decades they have been sold privatisation on the basis that it would provide finance for desirable public investments. For just as long they have been told that, despite all the past privatisations, more austerity and belt-tightening is needed. As a result, according to a 2015 Essential survey, most reject the claim that: “Selling government assets frees up money to reallocate to other services and infrastructure.” Still, the widespread acceptance of spurious arguments, at least among the political class, means that it is important to consider the financial structure under which renationalisation should take place. British commentator Will Hutton recently proposed a way of renationalising enterprises without explicitly buying them back. The key idea would be to convert existing firms into a new category: the public benefit company (PBC) – which would write into its constitution that its purpose was the delivery of public benefit to which profit-making was subordinate. The idea is appealing, but the role of shareholders remains problematic. In Hutton’s model shareholders would notionally retain votes, but the non-executive directors would be appointed by the government and would be answerable to consumer challenge groups and other stakeholders. In this setting it is difficult to see how shareholders could exercise their voting power. Similarly, while shareholders would receive dividends paid of out of company profits, the whole idea of the proposed structure is to subordinate profit-making to public benefit. Australia has, or had, a better solution: the commercial statutory authority, of which Telecom Australia (before it became Telstra) and Australia Post (until it was corporatised in 1989) were prime examples. At the state level, statutory authorities supplied essential services like electricity and water. These authorities serviced their own debt and financed new investment out of sales revenue, as well as providing a modest return to the government. Crucially, the statutory authority model breaks with the idea that a corporate model, with directors responsible to shareholders is the best way to provide services to the public. In the statutory authority model, the public service objective is built into the governance of the organisation, rather than being imposed. Before corporatisation, Australia Post was run, not by boards and CEOs but by public commissions, including representatives of customers, workers and the community at large, and charged with meeting “the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian people for postal services”. Over the 15 years of operation as a statutory authority, the real cost of postal services was reduced by more than 30%, a reduction that compares favourably with the period since corporatisation. It’s true that the debt issued by statutory authorities counts as part of the gross debt of the public sector. It’s now fairly well understood, however, that gross public sector debt is a meaningless measure, since it fails to take account of income generating assets. The relevant measures are net worth (which takes account of the value of government businesses) and general government net debt, which focuses on the operations of government that must be financed by tax revenue. Public ownership of business enterprises increases net worth and has no effect on general government debt. A lot of things have changed since the late 20th century, and it may be that we need new models for public enterprises in an era of renationalisation. But the successes of the statutory authority model suggest that it is a good place to start.

At an awards ceremony on Thursday, Simmons was praised for world-leading research that could result in the first working quantum computer – a machine that performs calculations using subatomic particles rather than components of classic computing. In 2012, she and her team created the world’s first transistor made from a single atom, as well as the world’s thinnest conductive wire – which is 10,000 times thinner than a human hair but has the same current carrying ability of copper. Her work had the potential to revolutionise all industries, the Australia Day committee said. A quantum computer could solve, in minutes, a problem that would take a classic computer thousands of years. Drug design, weather forecasting, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence are among the areas that could benefit from such a discovery. Simmons said it was important to encourage girls to pursue a career in science and technology. “Seeing women in leadership roles and competing internationally is important [for girls to see],” she said. “It gives them the sense that anything is possible.” Also on Thursday, Matildas striker Sam Kerr, who last year became the all-time leading goal scorer in the National Women’s Soccer League and the Asian confederation’s player of the year, was named the Young Australian of the Year. The 24-year old star striker had also won the Julie Dolan medal playing in the W-League with Perth Glory and was the leading goal-scorer when Australia won the Tournament of Nations. The committee described her as “arguably the best women’s soccer player in the world” and an “engaging ambassador for all women’s sport”. The 2018 local hero was mathematics teacher Eddie Woo, whose online videos have become a worldwide hit with students for making the subject accessible and fun. Woo, the head mathematics teacher at Cherrybrook Technology high school in Sydney’s western suburbs, began posting his videos in 2012 and now has more than 100,000 subscribers and 8 million views worldwide. The senior Australian of the year is the biophysicist Dr Graham Farquhar, whose work in plant biology and agriculture has helped develop water-efficient wheat. Last year, Farquhar also became the first Australian to win the Kyoto prize – the highest international award for biology. His research aims to improve food security for the Earth’s growing population amidst the challenges of climate change. The chair of the Australia Day council, Danielle Roche, said the four winners were “making a real difference to the lives of others”. “They are breaking down barriers, forging new futures, looking at old problems in different ways and creating new pathways,” she said. In addition to Thursday’s award, Simmons has won the Pawsey medal for physics in 2005, awarded by the Australian Academy of Science, and the Unesco award for women in science in 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/26/jacinda-ardern-pregnant-new-zealand-baby-mania","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T09:42:00Z","webTitle":"'I’m pregnant, not incapacitated': PM Jacinda Ardern on baby mania","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/26/jacinda-ardern-pregnant-new-zealand-baby-mania","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/26/jacinda-ardern-pregnant-new-zealand-baby-mania","fields":{"headline":"'I’m pregnant, not incapacitated': PM Jacinda Ardern on baby mania","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is business as usual for Jacinda Ardern. Seven days after the announcement of her pregnancy, the New Zealand prime minister is out and about under grey skies on a chilly morning in Dunedin to perform that staple of politicians – unveiling a plaque on a historic building. Addressing the re-opening of the city’s 115-year-old courthouse, Ardern speaks confidently about the priorities of her government – the need for it to protect the country’s heritage, its environment and the future of its children. The prime minister affects a routine air. Nothing has changed, the government is getting on with the job. But for the country, it seems, a lot has has changed. New Zealand is in the grip of baby mania. Since Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, revealed they were expecting their first child, the announcement has dominated the news agenda, opinion pieces and talk radio. Some current affairs shows have even opened a bottle of bubbly to toast the news. First there was “Jacindamania” and “the Jacinda effect”; now there’s “Jacindababymania” .More than 800 newspapers and magazines around the world reported the pregnancy; in New Zealand the news has fascinated residents unlike any political story before, as many gossip and debate about what lies ahead. Affectionately nicknamed “the royal baby”, political pundits are predicting a second term for the Labour party on the back of the jubilation sparked by the apparent salve to the turbulent global political climate. Meanwhile, the PM has got on with the job: announcing an inquiry into mental health, a fleet of changes to employment laws aimed at improving conditions for workers, and discussing the resuscitation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Ardern appears slightly taken aback by the interest in her pending motherhood. “I’m just pregnant, not incapacitated,” she said. “Like everyone else who has found themselves pregnant before, I’m just keeping on going. “Certainly when I walk around and step outside my house … I get a few honks and hollers and everyone has been very warm. But again, I don’t take that to mean absolutely everyone in New Zealand is happy. I’ve got work to do to prove that I can fulfil the responsibilities I have, and I absolutely intend to do that and so does the government.” But she will have her work cut out if she hopes to dampen the national interest in her baby. Observers point out that voters who may have previously felt shut out of the sometimes elitist realm of political life and decision-making may feel they finally have something in common with their leader – especially as she is going to be using hand-me-down baby clothes. “In this day and age, parents are quite capable of working and having a family, I’m happy for her,” said Casey Bosscher, an apprentice builder who explained the court house renovation to Ardern. “My wife and I have worked the whole way through [having our family]. Anyone who is concerned about the prime minister’s pregnancy is old-fashioned – you just do the best you can..” In addition to being the country’s third female prime minister and the first to be sworn in while pregnant, Ardern’s government is implementing a swath of legislation to ease the burden for working families, such as increasing paid parental leave. “Politics can seem very distant from many people’s everyday lives, but Ardern’s pregnancy has reflected that politics is a real-life exercise and that enables people to feel a connection with the political world,” said Jennifer Curtin, a professor of politics, and the director of the public policy institute at Auckland University. “Ardern has been in politics for a long time. We know from research that there’s no perfect time to have a baby [in politics], and women are more likely than male colleagues to be childless, which suggests it hasn’t been a mother-friendly profession. So she is absolutely breaking norms and doing gender equality a huge public service, unwittingly or otherwise.” Though the news was largely greeted with warm congratulations (one person left a box of doughnuts outside Ardern’s Auckland home) a trickle of angst and criticism has appeared. Some writers have urged Ardern take six months off rather than six weeks, suggesting she will not be able to cope; others have said the “nationwide fertility festival” has provoked “pain and heartache” for those who struggle to conceive. Even film stars have weighed in, with the French actor Marion Cotillard urging New Zealanders to “keep” their prime minister.Ardern and Gayford celebrated their news with hamburgers, and flowers from the corner shop. Their relaxed approach to trampling gender norms and shaking up parliament is proving a winning formula for many New Zealanders who have navigated the same demands since women began entering the workforce in large numbers in the 1970s. “We’ve come a long way from the time when it was thought women should stay at home to be barefoot and pregnant,” said Gill Greer, the chief executive of the National Council of Women of New Zealand. “[The former prime minister] Helen Clark was criticised and it was said: ‘How can you decide what is good for families when you don’t have any children?’ Now we have another [female] prime minister and, of course, she can’t win either with a few people, though I would say they are in the minority. “There’s that old saying: if girls can see it, girls can do it. And Ardern is proving that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/nadhim-zahawi-facing-more-pressure-over-presidents-club-event","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T12:41:55Z","webTitle":"Minister faces pressure over men-only event as May voices disapproval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/nadhim-zahawi-facing-more-pressure-over-presidents-club-event","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/nadhim-zahawi-facing-more-pressure-over-presidents-club-event","fields":{"headline":"Minister faces pressure over men-only event as May voices disapproval","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government minister Nadhim Zahawi is facing more pressure over his attendance at an elite, men-only charity dinner, as Theresa May voiced her disapproval of the event in her first broadcast interview on the scandal. The Presidents Club charity was forced to close after widespread outrage at the way some guests were reported to have groped and sexually propositioned women employed at last week’s event at the Dorchester hotel in London. The joint chair of the club David Meller was forced to stand down as a board member of the Department for Education as a result of his involvement. Zahawi, the minister for children and families, was given a “dressing down” by the Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, on Wednesday night, after he admitted having attended the event. On Thursday the prime minister ducked questions about why Zahawi had attended the event. Interviewed by the BBC at the World Economic Forum at Davos, May said: “I understand that Nadhim Zahawi left early from that particular event. But when I read the report of that event that took place, frankly, I was appalled. I thought that sort of approach to women, that objectification of women was something that we were leaving behind.” Asked again whether it was right for a government minister to attend, she said: “I’m not happy with an event of that type taking place. What worries me is that it is not just about that event; it is what it says about this wider issue in society about attitudes to women.” May’s spokesman said she would look into the issue of whether women working at the events were wrongly asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, requiring them to not report details of what took place inside – and left open the possibility of a wider review of their use. The use of NDAs to prevent alleged victims from speaking has been a regular feature in sexual harassment stories that have emerged in recent months in the UK and US. Asked whether women should be told to not report harassment, the spokesman said: “Questions have been raised about the operation of non-disclosure agreements. The prime minister will look into the way these non-disclosure agreements are applied to see if changes are required.” Questioned about details of what might change, or which department might lead on this, he said: “I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome of this. Issues have been raised and the PM will look into this.” The spokesman also explained how a lunch with Boris Johnson came to be auctioned at the Presidents Club event, saying it was initially donated as a prize for another charity, set up by the former England cricketer Ian Botham, but that it was passed on without Johnson knowing. Liam Botham, Ian Botham’s son, was among those listed as being invited to last week’s event. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has written to the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, to demand further details of Zahawi’s attendance, including whether he used a ministerial car to travel to the event; and how he was surprised by its nature given that he had attended in previous years. Maria Miller, the Tory chair of the Commons select committee for women and equalities, put more pressure on Zahawi, saying he should have refused the invitation. Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, she said: “No government minister should be going to an event where women are only there as the entertainment. That’s not acceptable. There are questions about why Nadhim had accepted this invitation.” Zahawi has declined requests for interviews, but writing on Twitter he condemned the behaviour at the event and claimed he left at 9.35pm after feeling “uncomfortable”. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who raised an urgent question in the Commons on Wednesday about the event, said Zahawi should have expressed concerns at the time. Margot James, the minister for digital and creative industries, who criticised the dinner as an event for “slimeballs”, said she was satisfied with Zahawi’s explanation of what had happened. Speaking to BBC’s Newsnight programme, she said: “I’ve spoken to him. I wanted to get the facts. He went home very shortly after the hostesses were announced by the presenter and paraded around the room. That indicates to me that he was shocked by the events, didn’t like the culture, the atmosphere, and left.” A number of charities, including Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, that have benefited from the £20m raised by the Presidents Club over more than 30 years said they would refund previous donations in the wake of the allegations. The Charity Commission said it was looking into the allegations “as a matter of urgency”. The Dorchester hotel said it was not aware of any claims following the event and an investigation had been launched. A spokesman for the Artista agency, which recruited the hostesses, said: “I was not aware of any claims of sexual harassment, but the kind of behaviour alleged is completely unacceptable. I am checking with the staff and any complaints will be dealt with promptly and fairly.” The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, told Sky News that if he had been invited he would not have attended. Asked about Zahawi, he said: “I understand he went because it was a charity fundraiser and that he left early because he felt uncomfortable. I’m glad that the club has closed down, but it is part of a bigger change that we need to see to make sure we have genuine equal opportunities, and this sort of thing doesn’t happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/26/andrew-bolt-delays-return-after-finding-his-inner-tree-hugger","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T23:43:02Z","webTitle":"Andrew Bolt delays return after finding his inner 'tree hugger' | The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/26/andrew-bolt-delays-return-after-finding-his-inner-tree-hugger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/26/andrew-bolt-delays-return-after-finding-his-inner-tree-hugger","fields":{"headline":"Andrew Bolt delays return after finding his inner 'tree hugger'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fans of Andrew Bolt’s column may have to wait a little longer for the News Corp commentator to return from his Christmas break. The prolific Sky News presenter and Herald Sun star blogger was expected back on board after Australia Day but has had to delay his return to work as he “fell out of a tree”. According to an internal email to Murdoch editors, Bolt broke three ribs and injured a wrist after climbing the tree. Fellow Hun columnist Rita Panahi revealed her take on what befell Bolt during a chat on the 2GB evening show this week. “I’ve always accused him of being a tree hugger,” Panahi said. “He loves bird life and magpies.” Panahi went on to reveal that Bolt often popped out to buy minced meat for the magpies that visited his garden because he loved to feed them. The history boys Just when we thought we’d escaped Bolt’s views on Australia Day, he took to the airwaves on Thursday to tell 2GB’s Chris Smith about the so-called cultural elite who were trying to ruin Australia Day by disparaging our history. Bolt says that after years of teaching schoolchildren that Australia has a history of racism, it was inevitable that the campaign to change the date would gain momentum. Meanwhile an online story in the Herald Sun about the statue of James Cook and the Burke and Wills sculpture in the Melbourne central business district being defaced has had to be quickly amended. The original report said: “Captain Cook established the first colonial settlement in Australia at Sydney Cove on January 26 in 1788.” But the prize for most offensive Australia Day coverage was taken out earlier in the week by the West Australian cartoonist Dean Alston with his cartoon about the arrival of the white man in 1788. Laston reckons the Indigenous inhabitants welcomed the white man because he brought sausage rolls and they were so much better than bush tucker. Communication breakdown Mia Freedman couldn’t have imagined that an attempt to draw a line under her treatment of the US author Roxane Gay would backfire so spectacularly. This week in a podcast with the Australian’s media diarist, Stephen Brook, Freedman admitted that 2017 was a tough year for her. She said she was particularly bruised by the media firestorm that greeted her after she disclosed the content of emails about Gay’s visit to her Mamamia podcast studio in May. Freedman wrote in a story accompanying her podcast: “Will she fit into the office lift? How many steps will she have to take to get to the interview? Is there a comfortable chair that will accommodate her six-foot-three, ‘super-morbidly obese’ frame?” Gay said her treatment was “cruel and humiliating” and Freedman apologised. This week Freedman tried to portray her relationship with Gay as much improved. “I have been in contact with Roxane since when the dust settled,” Freedman told Brook. “Relations are fine. I have made the decision to not talk about it any more because I feel like it doesn’t serve anyone to bring it up again – but I will say that I was taken aback firstly by the intensity of it and secondly the volume and duration of it.” It was left to Gay to take to Twitter to throw cold water on any notion of a reconciliation with the words: “Oh. Good to know.” Catalyst for alarm Three years ago, two episodes of the TV science program Catalyst were removed from the ABC’s website after an internal review found the program had breached editorial standards on impartiality. The special on statins was produced and presented by Maryanne Demasi, who has a PhD in medical research and was a staff reporter on Catalyst. While she survived the 2013 breach, Demasi lost her job when the Catalyst magazine program was axed after a second report she did into the supposed health risks of wifi was also discredited. This week, on the other side of the world, Demasi was back in the headlines with the same message about statins. A report she has written for the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Statin wars: have we been misled about the evidence? A narrative review, made it to the front page of the UK’s Daily Express. “MILLIONS of healthy Britons are needlessly taking statins every day, a major review suggests, the Express reported. “Experts last night raised concerns that those using the cholesterol-busting drugs see next to no benefit. They claim the advantages of taking statins for already healthy people are ‘vanishingly small’ and insist diet and exercise deliver far more impressive results in maintaining a healthy heart.” The same newspaper said statins were safe in a 2014 front page story headlined “Doctors urgent warning to patients: Keep Taking Your Statins”. Rolling Stone’s final encore Some more bad news for the local magazines industry yesterday with Rolling Stone Australia folding. According to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, publishers Paper Riot Pty Ltd have gone into administration. In 2013 editor-in-chief Matthew Coyte bought the magazine from Bauer Media to save it from closure. The German publishing giant had already closed local titles and merged others since buying the business from ACP Magazines. Coyte, who was unavailable for comment, had edited it since 2008 and had big plans as an independent publisher. “While Bauer didn’t necessarily see it as a viable business for a small operation I thought it was a very viable business, and I look forward to doing some of the things that being a smaller business will allow me to pursue,” he told an industry publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/26/invasion-day-protests-human-rights-observers-to-monitor-melbourne-rally","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T22:10:26Z","webTitle":"Invasion Day protests: human rights observers to monitor Melbourne rally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/invasion-day-protests-human-rights-observers-to-monitor-melbourne-rally","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/invasion-day-protests-human-rights-observers-to-monitor-melbourne-rally","fields":{"headline":"Invasion Day protests: human rights observers to monitor Melbourne rally","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Human rights observers are to attend the Invasion Day rally in Melbourne on Friday to monitor the way police respond to the protesters, Amnesty International has said. The Melbourne rally is the largest of those held around the country on 26 January and is expected to attract more than 30,000 people. Interaction between police and protesters in previous years has been confined to holding the rally back from interrupting the official City of Melbourne Australia Day parade, which begins at 11am on Swanston Street. The Invasion Day march meets at the same time at the steps of Parliament House, three blocks from Swanston Street. “2018 marks 230 years of Indigenous resistance against colonisation,” organisers Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance said. “It marks 80 years of protest against the celebration of genocide by the rest of this country. We march to recognise the ongoing struggle of our people and call on this country to rectify the wrongs, teach the truths and finally make amends.” In a statement, Amnesty International said it would send a delegation of nine observers to monitor compliance with human rights standards for the policing of protests. Two protest marches are scheduled for Sydney, one recreating the 1988 Long March for Justice and ending in a rally in Hyde Park, and the other marching from the block in Redfern to the Yabun cultural festival in Victoria Park. Similar marches or rallies will be held in Brisbane, Hobart and Perth, as well as a number of regional towns, with events in Adelaide and Darwin. Victoria Police deputy commissioner Andrew Crisp said police were on high alert for any interaction between Invasion Day protesters and members of far-right groups, which are holding a gathering at St Kilda Beach. “I want to be very clear in relation to any activities planned by any groups where you intend to overstep the mark and engage in anti-social behaviour; it won’t be tolerated,” Crisp said. Police in Melbourne are already investigating the vandalism of two colonial monuments: a statue of Captain James Cook in St Kilda and a monument to explorers Robert O’Hara Burke and William John Wills in Royal Park. Federal citizenship minister Alan Tudge told Fairfax Radio that the act achieved nothing, saying: “You can’t rewrite our history… I want Australia Day to be a great unifying day for our country. It has been for many decades now.” National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) chairman John Singer criticised politicians for dismissing those who oppose the celebration of Australia Day as “politically correct, angry, banner waving far-left extremists”. He said 2017 had been a difficult year for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, with prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s rejection of the Uluru statement, and dismissal of the change the date campaign added to those concerns. “Turnbull will soon rise in the House of Representatives to parrot a few words of an Indigenous language and inform us of what a great job his department and agencies are doing for us in his Close the Gap report,” Singer said in a statement. “Remember, he did promise to work with us. The pain and suffering of our people is not so easily bought off with a few trinkets and baubles thrown to us.” Turnbull said last week that he was “disappointed” in those who sought to change the date of Australia Day and urged all Australians to celebrate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/25/unions-target-coalition-marginal-seats-in-multinational-tax-avoidance-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T02:05:54Z","webTitle":"Unions target Coalition marginal seats in multinational tax avoidance campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/unions-target-coalition-marginal-seats-in-multinational-tax-avoidance-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/unions-target-coalition-marginal-seats-in-multinational-tax-avoidance-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Unions target Coalition marginal seats in multinational tax avoidance campaign","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Unions will target the government and large multinationals including ExxonMobil in a campaign on tax avoidance in Coalition-held marginal seats. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is campaigning to close tax loopholes while arguing for reforms to industrial laws to increase collective bargaining, singling out ExxonMobil and Glencore for tax avoidance and because they are locked in bitter industrial disputes. The campaign will kick off with radio ads and robocalls in the Queensland seats of Flynn, Capricornia and Forde and Gilmore in New South Wales, leading up to a Senate tax-avoidance inquiry in March. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, told Guardian Australia there was an “overlap between companies avoiding tax and bending workplace laws” to reduce workers’ pay. According to Australian Tax Office figures, ExxonMobil Australia paid no tax on $6.7bn revenue in the last year while Glencore paid just $44m on $24bn of revenue. The Tax Justice Network has labelled ExxonMobil Australia’s “worst tax dodger” because it has paid no tax in three years on revenues of $24.7bn. Tax is paid on profits, not revenue, so while neither company has broken the law, the ACTU and the Tax Justice Network argue the use of transfer pricing, deductions and tax havens allows them to avoid tax that should be paid in Australia. McManus is travelling to Longford in Victoria to support unions locked in a 218-day industrial dispute with ExxonMobil and its contractor UGL CIMIC. “We think the issue of rich multinationals avoiding tax is a huge issue; it’s robbing us of tax revenue,” McManus said. “It’s a straight up issue of fairness: the people I’m going to visit [protesting outside their workplace] on the lawns at Longford pay more tax than ExxonMobil and ordinary people are sick of it.” Tax avoidance is part of a “broader inequality problem” that includes workers not having strong enough rights to get fair pay rises, she said. McManus said the common element between the two prongs of inequality is the “serious power imbalance” between companies on the one hand and workers and taxpayers on the other. “Big companies spend resources on lawyers to avoid tax and they’re doing exactly the same with our workplace rights,” she said. “Governments will only act when there is a counteracting force to the power of big business ... there needs to be a movement of people that demand they pay tax and give fair pay rises.” According to the Electrical Trades Union, UGL CIMIC set up a shell company, MTCT Services, which then struck an enterprise agreement with five casual workers and demanded 230 Victorian workers sign up to the same conditions. McManus said the maintenance workers were “pushed out of their jobs by Australia’s biggest tax dodger” and that ExxonMobil proposal amounts to a 30% wage cut for more than 200 families. The other company in the ACTU’s sites, Glencore, has locked workers out at its Oaky North site for six months, which Labor’s employment spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, has labelled a “disproportionate response” to workers’ industrial bans. Labor has already promised it will crack down on sham enterprise agreements by requiring workplace deals to be struck a representative sample of the workforce. This week O’Connor also indicated Labor would consider giving the Fair Work Commission power to arbitrate intractable disputes. McManus warned that tax avoidance “will be an issue for Malcolm Turnbull and his government” and the ACTU is prepared to escalate its campaign if it did not do more to close loopholes. “We will not rest until corporations like Exxon and Glencore are paying the tax they really owe,” McManus said. “It is the right of every Australian to a fair share of the profits generated from our natural resources and the labour of Australian workers.” A spokesman for ExxonMobil said the union protest “continues to provide misinformation” about the dispute. “Regarding Esso’s maintenance contract with UGL, the specific rates of pay and conditions of employment are a matter between UGL and its employees,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/26/australia-v-england-fourth-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T10:25:23Z","webTitle":"Australia v England: fourth one-day international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/26/australia-v-england-fourth-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/26/australia-v-england-fourth-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia v England: fourth one-day international – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s a timely win for Australia. The match was effectively decided in the first half-hour, when Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood bowled beautifully to reduce England to 8 for 5. England did well to turn a potential shambles into a respectable defeat, with Eoin Morgan captaining superbly, but they showed again that their batting can be damagingly naive when the ball moves around. It was a strange game, a kind of one-sided nail-biter. The series score is now Australia 1-3 England, with the final match at the new Perth Stadium on Sunday. This is my last OBO of the tour; thanks ever so much for your company and emails throughout a long winter. Goodnight! 37th over: Australia 197-7 (Paine 25, Tye 3) Paine hurries Australia to the brink of victory, smacking Wood for consecutive fours, and Andrew Tye finishes it off by driving his first ball for three. Australia are cutting this a bit fine. Cummins is run out after a hopeless mix-up with Paine, and England are into the tail with 13 runs still needed. 36th over: Australia 184-6 (Paine 16, Cummins 2) “I actually caught the morning crash of wickets and retired wondering what sort of awful records England might set for the lowest total ever in an ODI,” says Ian Copestake. “Quite impressed they got anywhere near 200.” That was the gist of Eoin Morgan’s teamtalk at 8 for 5. “We probably can’t win this, lads, but if Ian Copestake is quite impressed by the end of the match, we’ll have had a good day.” 35th over: Australia 182-6 (Paine 15, Cummins 1) When the book of great captaincy performances in ODI defeats is written - and it will be, if it’s the last thing I do - Eoin Morgan will be in it for his work in this match. He hasn’t allowed the game to sleep at any stage. Ach, that’s a shame. Travis Head misses out on a century, cuffing Wood straight to Morgan at mid-on. He swishes his bat in frustration as he walks off. When the regret settles he will reflect on a superb innings that has given fresh momentum to his ODI career. 34th over: Australia 180-5 (Head 96, Paine 14) There is the most stunning sunset over the Adelaide Oval. I say this from 10,029 miles away, but it sure looks beautiful on TV. Australia are cruising to victory now, with most eyes on whether Travis Head can get another Adelaide hundred on Australia Day. He is four away. 33rd over: Australia 177-5 (Head 94, Paine 13) Mark Wood is back for one last throw of the dice. I’m surprised Tom Curran has had only two overs, particularly as they were two good overs. Wood is worked sensibly for a single off each delivery - six from the over, which brings the target down to 20. 32nd over: Australia 171-5 (Head 91, Paine 10) Chris Woakes replaces Adil Rashid. In case you missed it, he continued his spectacular batting form earlier in the day with a belting 78. Head slaps another back cut for four to move into the nineties. Australia, like England, look spoilt for choice when it comes to ODI openers. I suppose Head could replace White at No3 when Finch is fit again. 31st over: Australia 165-5 (Head 86, Paine 9) A high full toss from Moeen is smacked for four by Head, who can only take a single off the resuling free hit. England, who have done really well to make a contest out of a farce, look for the first time like they have accepted defeat. “Not impressed with this England performance, but pleased to see Travis Head finally show how good he can be,” says Richard O’Hagan. “I’d be quite happy for him to get a hundred here, especially if it is accompanied by a clatter of wickets at the other end.” The strange thing is that England have played extremely well for 90 per cent of the match. But there’s no coming back from eight for five. 30th over: Australia 157-5 (Head 80, Paine 8) I think Buttler has just dropped Paine off the bowling of Rashid. England’s reaction suggested as much, though there was nothing on Snicko or Hotspot. We’ll never know. Rashid ends another excellent spell with figures of 10-0-49-3. 29th over: Australia 155-5 (Head 79, Paine 7) Moeen returns to the attack and is pumped over midwicket for four by the superb Head. It’s been a slightly sloppy batting performance from Australia, Head excepted, but they should be safe from embarrassment now. They need 42 from 21 overs. 28th over: Australia 146-5 (Head 74, Paine 3) Australia are taking no more risks against Rashid, who has been the main wicket-taking threat. His penultimate over is milked for three singles. 27th over: Australia 143-5 (Head 73, Paine 1) Wood continues, with England needing two wickets to get into the tail. Head flashes a short ball wide of the leaping Roy at backward point for four, a safe enough shot because of its sheer power. Australia need 54 from 23 overs. 26th over: Australia 137-5 (Head 68, Paine 0) This is not news but, jeez, Eoin Morgan is a wonderful captain. Lovely work from Eoin Morgan and Adil Rashid. Stoinis, who swept the previous two deliveries for four, couldn’t resist the big stroke that Morgan was encouraging with his field placing. He tried to smack Rashid into the crowd and sliced the ball high to Roy in the covers. England have a chance of a spectacular victory. 25th over: Australia 128-4 (Head 67, Stoinis 6) Wood beats Stoinis with consecutive deliveries, the first a beauty of immaculate line and length. 24th over: Australia 123-4 (Head 64, Stoinis 5) England are challenging Stoinis to hit Rashid over the top, with a ring of fielders from short cover to midwicket. He resists the temptation in that over, which yields four for Australia. They need 73 from 26 overs. 23rd over: Australia 120-4 (Head 61, Stoinis 4) Mark Wood returns to the attack, a typically aggressive move from Eoin Morgan. One more wicket here would rip this match from its slumber. But the likeliest scenario remains another Adelaide Australia Day hundred for Travis Head, who moves into the sixties with a smooth pull through midwicket for four. “With reference to comments on over 19: Such is the aggressive nature of the England batting line up that a performance like todays is always a possibility,” says Lee Smith. “If you are regularly scoring 300 or more then surely increase the probability of the occasional 170 all out?” Absolutely, and we can’t have it both ways. I just think they could be a bit smarter when the new ball is moving around as much as it did today. As Michael Vaughan said on BT Sport, if England had been 25 for one after 10 overs today they would probably have got 300. 22nd over: Australia 116-4 (Head 57, Stoinis 4) Stoinis charges his first ball and drags it loosely over midwicket for four. That could easily have gone to hand. Rashid is such a valuable wicket-taker in the middle overs. His ODI strike rate of a wicket every 33.8 balls is the third best in England’s history behind Liam Plunkett and Andrew Flintoff. Mitchell Marsh’s entertaining cameo of 32 from 30 balls comes to an end. He clunked a dipping full toss straight back at Rashid, who took a very smart catch. 21st over: Australia 106-3 (Head 55, Marsh 30) Joe Root’s first over goes for three. Both sides know this match is almost certainly over. 20th over: Australia 105-3 (Head 54, Marsh 28) Rashid, who has threatened to take a wicket in every over, almost skids a quicker delivery through the back-defensive stroke of Head. Australia need 92 from 180 balls. “With my Purely Pragmatic Hat on; The series has been won, do you think that England might learn more lessons from a loss, than if the bowlers scrape a win?” says Matt Dony. “I didn’t see the England innings, and I don’t want to make assumptions, but it seems complacent for such a talented batting attack to misfire so badly. If the bowlers dig them out of a hole, there’s the chance that fewer lessons will be learnt, rather than if Australia punish them for it. Just my I’ll-informed, uneducated tuppence worth...” I don’t think it was complacency, just brilliant bowling in helpful conditions and some naive batting. But yes, they should learn something from it, especially as it’s the second time this has happened. 19th over: Australia 101-3 (Head 50, Marsh 28) Moeen’s first ball after the drinks break is a piece of filth that Marsh pulls for four, and then Head clips a single to reach an excellent half-century from 55 balls. He clouted the new ball everywhere and is now happy to work singles in support of Marsh. “Nice stat that about Rash dismissing Smith,” says Ian Truman. “Doesn’t that alone make the fact that Rashid seemingly has zero chance of playing Tests again seem a bit, well, odd? I know it’s a different game, but if you can cause good batsmen trouble like that then aren’t you a bit too good for the scrapheap?” Yeah, I think they made a mistake by dropping him at the start of last summer. It’s probably too late now though, and I assume Root doesn’t rate him. 18th over: Australia 95-3 (Head 49, Marsh 23) Marsh, tired of not picking Rashid’s googly, gets down on one knee and carts a slog sweep into the crowd for six. 17th over: Australia 87-3 (Head 48, Marsh 16) Marsh creams Moeen through extra cover for four, a ferocious stroke that is followed by a lazy play-and-miss. His career in miniature, you might say, but there is a growing sense that he has gone to another level as a batsman in the last few months. He is certainly batting with greater authority. 16th over: Australia 81-3 (Head 48, Marsh 10) A poor ball from Rashid is cut easily for four by Marsh, who has started very assertively. But he doesn’t pick the googly, which almost slips through the gate as he lunges forward. 15th over: Australia 74-3 (Head 48, Marsh 3) Mitchell Marsh gets off the mark with a strong drive for two off Moeen. Another quick wicket might make Australia worry, especially as they have a longish tail. 14th over: Australia 70-3 (Head 47, Marsh 0) Nobody has dismissed Smith more often in ODIs than Rashid, who has done so five times. Well bowled Adil Rashid! He gave Smith a bit of a working over - slider, googly, another googly - before dismissing him with an orthodox delivery that took the edge and flew towards slip, where Joe Root took an outrageous reaction catch by his right hip. 13th over: Australia 69-2 (Head 45, Smith 4) Head made his only ODI century on this ground, against Pakistan a year ago today. I’d be loath to bet against a repeat because he’s playing beautifully and is under almost no pressure. 12th over: Australia 67-2 (Head 44, Smith 3) Mr Adil Rashid replaces Tom Curran and almost slips a googly through Smith, who inside-edges an expansive cover drive into the leg side. A nice start from Rashid. . 11th over: Australia 63-2 (Head 42, Smith 2) “It’ll be a real shame if this is the last we see of The Cameron White Experiment,” says Guy Hornsby.”I loved their breezy second album. Though it wasn’t a patch on the new one from Chris Woakes’ Boundary Explosion. So leftfield and fresh.” I haven’t seen such an exciting change of direction since Bono’s acid house album. 10th over: Australia 61-2 (Head 41, Smith 1) Tom Curran unveils a new variation, the grotesque accidental wide. He repeats it with the next delivery. Both were attempted slower balls that slipped out of the hand. Head scrunches the first legitimate delivery of the over down the ground for the eighth boundary of an eye-catching innings, and then batters another through extra cover. 9th over: Australia 51-2 (Head 33, Smith 1) Moeen Ali comes on for Chris Woakes, who can look vulnerable against spin. A quiet over; three from it. 8th over: Australia 48-2 (Head 31, Smith 0) The Cameron White experiment may not last much longer. His scores in this series are 15*, 17 and 3. Tom Curran replaces Mark Wood, who struggled for rhythm in a short spell of 3-0-23-0. He is much more suited to white-ball cricket at this stage of his career - and he has struck with his fourth ball! White’s bat was stuck behind the pad and he had nowhere to go when the ball jagged back off the seam to hit him in front of off stump. That was plumb. 7th over: Australia 48-1 (Head 31, White 3) I’m sure there’s a neat Head start pun here somewhere but I’ve been up since 4am so it’s not happening. He has certainly got Australia off to a flyer: he pulls Woakes disdainfully through mid-on for four and cracks another boundary through extra cover. This is exhilarating stuff. “What has happened to Warner?” says David Kalucy. “Is this a Michael Clarke mid-career crisis?” England have bowled pretty well to him. And he hasn’t been that bad - he averaged over 60 in the Ashes. 6th over: Australia 37-1 (Head 23, White 0) Head hits Wood for three consecutive boundaries - a flash over point, an edge at catchable height through the vacant second-slip and a rubber-wristed flick-pull wide of midwicket. 5th over: Australia 25-1 (Head 11, White 0) Cameron White is the new batsman. Warner has gone. That was a fine delivery from Woakes, just full of a good length and moving away a fraction to take the edge as Warner leaned into a push-drive. Jos Buttler did the rest. 4th over: Australia 21-0 (Warner 9, Head 11) Wood moves around the wicket to Head, who drags an attempted drive back onto the pads. The next ball is of a similar length and this time Head nails a pull through midwicket for four. That was a cracking shot. 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 6, Head 5) A half-volley from Woakes is blazed for four by Head. There’s nothing like the movement that Cummins and Hazlewood found at the start of the England innings, and nothing to suggest Australia won’t win this match at a canter. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 6, Head 1) England are hunting wickets, which is the right thing to do. Mark Wood’s first ball jags back sharply to hit Travis Head on the pad, though it would easily have cleared the stumps. A trampolining bouncer is given as a wide, and the extra delivery allows Head to get off the mark with a quick single. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 6, Head 0) England might as well try to bowl Australia out, because they can’t win the game any other way. Chris Woakes starts the innings with an eventful over to David Warner, who is beaten, slams four through the covers and then bottom-edges just short of Jos Buttler. “Australian sporting events have a tendency to start/continue late due to the requirements of the host broadcaster,” says Phil Withall. “Football matches regularly kick off 10 minutes late so some exceptional banter can reach its painfully unfunny conclusion. It really gets on my goat.” It’s nearly an hour since England’s innings finished. If this goes on much longer I’ll have no choice but to create a hashtag. Crikey, this is a long break between innings. Are they having an emergency screening of Das Boot or something? On this day, 16 years ago, Shane Bond crashed the Australia Day party. What I love most about this - apart from the fact it reminds me of my 26th birthday - is that Bond later admitted it was a fluke. He wasn’t trying to bowl a yorker at all. You have to admire somebody who is comfortable enough in their own skin to admit that. He was some bowler. “Hi Rob,” says Andrew Gladwin. “Obviously England have improved immeasurably at one-day cricket, but I can’t see them as favourites for the next World Cup. They are a lot like my team South Africa, who will win most of their matches and bilateral series, but will have a really bad match at precisely the wrong time.The favourites will surely still be Australia and India on World Cup history and being able to handle pressure, and Pakistan, who won the last World Cup with a similar format (and of course the Champions Trophy).” I know what you mean, though the format means they only need to win two knockout games to win a World Cup. I think they are the best team in the world at the moment but so much depends on the pitches for those knockout games. The pressure and expectation also worries me, especially after what happened in the Champions Trophy. Next time, there’ll be no next time. England Win Prediction: 0.0001 per cent If you exclude rain-affected games with reduced targets, and why wouldn’t you, Australia have failed to chase a target below 200 only once in the last 16 years. An email! And I didn’t have to make it up myself! “Love the new approach by England, but maybe, just maybe the top order could look to consolidate a bit when needed,” says AB Parker. “It’s like the team have gone to the other extreme, which is amazing to watch when they get it right. But when you lose three quick wickets, maybe you should look to make sure it’s not five quick wickets before you start attacking?” I take your point, and that’s twice it’s happened in recent times: they were 20 for six against South Africa at Lord’s last May. Then again, they belted Australia out of the Champions Trophy with a storming counter-attack after losing three early wickets. I suppose they could be smarter when they are asked to bat first in helpful bowling conditions. The one best equipped to consolidate, Root, probably played the poorest shot. I wouldn’t blame Buttler, the fifth man out; he got a beauty. As in Test cricket, England are very one-dimensional. But what a dimension! Cheers Will, hello there. Not much to say about that, so here’s the best song of 2017. (NB: contains a bit of the old language.) Australia’s opening bowlers, Hazlewood and Cummins, were quite superb up top after Steve Smith opted to bowl, and they gutted England’s top order. Four ducks as they fell to 8 for 5. There were some poor shots, particularly from Root and Bairstow, but the bowling was brilliant. Four blokes lower down carried England to a respectable – if not quite defendable – score. Morgan and Moeen got things going, then Woakes batted like a god for his 78 (which included five sixes) in conjunction with Tom Curran to get the tourists up to 196. Can Australia chase it? They’re in real strife if not. That’s me done for the day, thanks for your company. Rob Smyth is stepping in, a few overs earlier than anticipated. Enjoy! Six! Shot, Tom Curran! Tye digs it in, and he pulls, just over the fence. A couple of dots follow, before a beautiful cover-driven four! But he’s gone now! A slower ball is turned straight to midwicket. England are all out for 196. That doesn’t look great, but the last five wickets have put on 188, so... 44th over: England 186-9 (Curran 25, Wood 2) More Zampa. Curran gets one with a neat drive to long-off. Wood’s first ball takes the outside edge but there’s no slip and they run one. Curran defends, and then they exchange singles again. Then the wrong’un totally flummoxes Curran! He gets a leading edge which just evades the bowler! They run one, and the over has cost five. I mean, there’s a chance... 43rd over: England 181-9 (Curran 21, Wood 0) Two balls remain in Tye’s over. Curran, having crossed, on strike, and defends the first to midwicket. No run. He gets a single off the last, to third man. This looks fanciful again. AJ Tye, the death bowling specialist, is back. He has four more. He’s got Woakes! He’s tried to go down the ground, not got all of it and been caught by the sub Maxwell – who doesn’t missing many – diving forward at long-on. Woakes batted beautifully, and England have one wicket remaining. 42nd over: England 179-8 (Woakes 78, Curran 20) Woakes takes a single to long-off from Zampa’s first, then Curran reaches for a drive outside off, and gets one too. It’s looped outside off and that’s six more for Woakes! It’s slog-swept, and deep-midwicket has come off the fence - it’s gone straight over him for six. That’s 1,000 runs for Woakes in ODI cricket. It feels like he’s made that many this series. The over finishes with two dots. 41st over: England 171-8 (Woakes 71, Curran 19) Stoinis is staying in the attack. Woakes guides him to third man for one. Curran does the same. Woof! Woakes has just nailed another six! This might be the best of the lot! Not that short but picked up, and dunked into the stands in front of square. So much time. Woakes pinches the strike again with a mishit, which is well fielded at mid-off. 40th over: England 162-8 (Woakes 63, Curran 18) Zampa and his leggies are back. Curran and Woakes take a single each, before Zampa finds two dots. Curran drives to the cover sweeper for one, and the over ends with Woakes doing the same. John Ryan is not happy: Got up and England were 8 down, yet Australia look incapable of ever getting a wicket again. Is that the sleep in my eyes or is this why they’re 3-0 down in the series? Well Australia have bowled out their best bowlers. England were five down in the seventh over, so things have rather slowed down... 39th over: England 158-8 (Woakes 61, Curran 16) Stoinis, who is looking a bit uncomfortable, is having another. Curran turns him fine for one. Woakes turns two to fine leg then wallops his third six! It’s a slow ball, and it’s pulled beautifully. The over ends with two dots. Hi Paul! Enjoy Bali. That sounds nice. Guy is English. Will take quite something for them to be on the right end of this result! 38th over: England 149-8 (Woakes 53, Curran 15) Hazlewood to bowl his last. Woakes gets one off the first ball, which is guided to third man, then Curran drives to mid-off’s right for one. That’s fifty for Woakes! After a couple of dots, he pulls Hazlewood for four in front of square, beating the man in the deep. That’s his fourth four, and he’s faced 62 balls. Two sixes, too. He drives two through the covers to leave Hazlewood with final figures of three for 39. Woakes is the first ODI No8 to make successive fifties! He’s no ordinary ODI No8, to be fair. 37th over: England 141-8 (Woakes 46, Curran 14) Marcus Stoinis is on for the first time today! I like Stoinis, and I really like that his nickname is “Oil”. Curran gets one to third man, then Woakes does the same. They run three as Curran straight drives beautifully, then Woakes pinches the strike with a controlled pull. I reckon Guy is onto something with his prediction here. 36th over: England 135-8 (Woakes 44, Curran 10) So Hazlewood is back to bowl his final two. He has three for 24 and was superb up front. Woakes nudges him for one into the offside, and after a dot Curran takes one through cover too. Another single for Woakes, an attractive cut that point gets a hand on, follows. Curran is seeing them nicely now! Hazlewood drops short, and it sits up to be pulled. Curran obliges, and gets four for it. One to midwicket ends the over, a handy one for England. 35th over: England 127-8 (Woakes 42, Curran 4) Tye into his sixth, and one zips back at Curran, who misses it, but they run a bye because Paine can’t gather cleanly. Woakes has calmed down a bit and defends a couple, then gets a thick outside edge to third man to end the over. 34th over: England 125-8 (Woakes 41, Curran 4) Cummins to bowl his last. He has 4 for 23. These will definitely be his best ODI figures, but he’s yet to take a five bag. Curran defends a couple, then gets one with a big edged heave to third man. Woakes leaves two, then edges Cummins’ last ball just short of the lone slip. They are indeed Cummins’ best figures in ODIs: 4 for 24. 33rd over: England 124-8 (Woakes 41, Curran 3) Woakes nicks the first ball of Tye’s new over but it’s just out of Paine’s reach for the catch and they get one. Curran’s innings starts with an ugly bunt over cover for two, then a more convincing stroke for one. Woakes – who has a tricky role now – defends, then has a big yahoo at the last ball of the over, and misses. 32nd over: England 120-7 (Woakes 40) Interesting. Cummins is back, and he will have just one more after this one. And he has two slips for Rashid. Never mind. After leaving one, Rashid middles a cover drive for four. Gorgeous. The next one is less convincing, off the back foot for two through extra cover. One of those slips goes, and Rashid leaves. A short wide means another needs bowling, and Rashid leaves it again. He doesn’t leave the last ball of the over, though, and the little nibble is taken behind! 31st over: England 113-7 (Woakes 40, Rashid 1) That was a cracking catch from Head, and Moeen hit it so hard that they did not cross. Dilly Rashid is in now, and digs out his first ball. He turns his second to the vacant midwicket region for one, just as the commentators get in their obligatory mention of his 10 first-class centuries. Woakes tries to nurdle one to third man to pinch the strike, but misses. Woakes moves to 40 with a little touch to leg off Tye, but Moeen is gone now! Tye goes round the wicket, Moeen pulls hard, but it’s straight to Travis Head on the fence at deep midwicket! He is falling backwards, but is aware, and tosses the ball up so he can take it again as he comes back in. Great work, all legit. That’s Tye’s first ODI wicket. 30th over: England 111-6 (Moeen 33, Woakes 39) Mitch Marsh is back, as Smith keeps two overs from each of Hazlewood and Cummins up his sleeve. Woakes defends, three times, before BELTING a six over the man on the midwicket fence! What a shot that is. Short square boundaries in Adelaide, aren’t there, and that only travelled 66m. There’s a single to leg, then Moeen leathers a pull along the ground for four. 11 from the over, and that’s the 50 stand. 29th over: England 100-6 (Moeen 29, Woakes 32) The spin experiment is over, and Andrew Tye is back. Woakes is defending carefully to start with as Tye varies his pace. Then there’s an uppish drive for two through the covers; did Head cut this off legally? I reckon so, and the umpires agree. Two not four. A cover-driven single ends the over and brings up England’s 100. That didn’t look very likely a couple of hours ago, 28th over: England 97-6 (Moeen 29, Woakes 29) Woakes is in sublime touch. He nails Hazlewood through the covers for a beautiful four. One follows, to square leg. He has 28 off 27. Moeen has 28 too, but rather more sedately. He defends two dots, then pulls one to fine leg to get ol’ Sobers back on strike. He plays a false shot into the legside off a slower ball, but they still get one. Good news, Rob Smyth - who will succeed me when England finish batting - is up. He emails to say that at the start of that over, Chris Woakes was averaging 155 in his last 10 ODIs. It’ll be more now! 27th over: England 90-6 (Moeen 28, Woakes 23) That’s a class shot from Woakes. He lofts Zampa over extra cover for four. Very nice, between fielders. After a drive finds cover, there’s a horrible wide down the legside. Shot! That’s great again from Woakes. Zampa tosses it up, and he slog-sweeps for SIX! He takes two more through cover to make this England’s best over of the innings, and he ends it with a single to long-off. 14 from. 26th over: England 76-6 (Moeen 28, Woakes 10) Hazlewood returns with figures of three for 11. Cummins, who he is replacing, has bowled eight to Hazlewood’s six. Woakes defends twice. It’s almost worth just seeing off the six overs these two have left without taking risks. As I type, that Woakes absolutely nails four through extra cover with an uppish, risky drive. A soft-handed edge to third man brings one more, then Moeen defends. Five from it. Here’s a statsgasm from AAP: England were 8-5 after 6.2 overs Lowest ODI scores at loss of fifth wicket: Sri Lanka 6-5 v Bangaldesh, 2009; Canada 7-5 v Netherlands, 2013; England 8-5 v Australia, 2018 Three of England’s top-four batsmen made ducks. Smallest contributions, in runs, by top-four in an ODI innings: 1 run, Pakistan v West Indies, 2014-15; 2 runs, Ireland v Australia, 2006-07; 3 runs, Pakistan v West Indies, 1992-93; 3 runs England v Australia 2018 England were 6-4 and 8-5, their worst ODI starts at the loss of those wickets England’s top-two Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow made ducks - the fourth time in ODIs both England openers haven’t scored Yeah. No good. 25th over: England 71-6 (Moeen 28, Woakes 5) Zampa’s latest over begins with a single for each batsman, then Woakes defends. Eurgh, that’s rank. He miscues a pull to mid-off, but luckily it goes along the floor. He ends the over nicely, with a delicate cut for one. That’s halfway. 24th over: England 68-6 (Moeen 27, Woakes 3) More Cummins. Moeen turns to leg for one. Woakes dangles his bat outside off when he’d be advised not to, but misses. He flashes and gets a thick outside edge to third man, then Moeen bottom edges a pull with control to square-leg, and gets another single. Hazlewood is warming up. Ominous. He has four overs remaining. Woakes gets another single to third man, then Mo defends the last. 23rd over: England 64-6 (Moeen 25, Woakes 1) Zampa to bowl his second, and Moeen takes one down the ground to give Woakes his first look at the leggie. He defends twice, then drives nicely to the man at deep cover to get off the mark. Moeen finds cover, then flicks to deep midwicket for one. Three from it. 22nd over: England 61-6 (Moeen 23, Woakes 0) Pat Cummins is a magnificent human, isn’t he? Woakes is in. He defends his first, leaves his second and leaves his third. The 22nd over is a handy moment for a wicket-maiden, you’d say. Cummins to bowl his seventh. Morgan pulls out of his stance, just as Cummins lets go – some very annoying person was walking right behind the arm in a high vis jacket. Cummins, who played with Morgan at Sydney Thunder, takes it in reasonably good humour. When the ball is eventually bowled, Morgan defends it. But two balls later he’s gone! He’s been caught behind as Cummins digs one in, he goes to pull and gloves it through to Paine! Wasn’t a great ball from Cummins, but he has his third, and England are right up against it again... 21st over: England 61-5 (Morgan 33, Moeen 23) One spinner comes on for another. Adam Zampa replaces Travis Head. Both of them play their Shield cricket here. There’s a fact for you. Zampa’s hair at the moment makes him look like he’s a high school geek in a bashful movie starring Michael Cera. Moeen and Morgan start with a single each. That’s the fifty partnership! My word it was needed! Another single to Morgan to short third man, then one to Moeen to midwicket. There’s another for Morgan then a dot to end the over. Five from it. 20th over: England 56-5 (Morgan 30, Moeen 21) Here goes, Pat Cummins is back. He has two wickets. Moeen gets himself off strike, then Morgan defends to the bowler and point. There’s no run until the last ball of the over, which he pulls to mid-on’s left for one. Chris Bourne is feeling funky. To frame this disaster with a little bit of optimism, and end it with a massive dose of the other: the lowest ever first innings total to win an ODI was 87 for 9, by Pakistan against India in 1989. England’s lowest winning total was 121 for 6 against India in 1985. But in more recent times you’d have to be scoring around 130-140 to stand a chance, and most likely, playing against a minnow. India and South Africa have managed it against a top tier team though, in 2013 and 2000 respectively. Unfortunately, England was the loser in both cases. In fact, of the top 20 lowest winning scores, England was beaten in five of them: more than any other country. 19th over: England 54-5 (Morgan 29, Moeen 20) Head into his second over, and the local commentators are furious about it. They are right that England would rather face him than the quicks. Each batsman takes the one on offer to long-off to bring up England’s 50. Morgan misses out on the sweep before leathering a drive over cover for four! That’s his first. Shot. 18th over: England 48-5 (Morgan 24, Moeen 19) More Marsh. He brings the false shot from Morgan, but it lands safe! That’s a horrid top edge pull to midwicket. There probably should be a catcher there. They run one, as they do when Moeen far more comfortably turns to fine leg. That’s a better pull from Morgan, just forced to mid-on’s left well enough to run two. Oh my word, Morgan’s done it again. He’s inside-edged over his leg stump. They run three as it’s hauled in by fine-leg. Good over from Marsh, but it’s cost seven. 17th over: England 41-5 (Morgan 18, Moeen 18) Spin! Tye’s over of 10 has cost him his place in the attack. Travis Head on, and Morgan takes one from his second ball. Moeen, who has those infamous troubles against offies, trades another single with Morgan and there’s three from Head’s first. 16th over: England 38-5 (Morgan 16, Moeen 17) They’ve had a little drink I reckon because that was a long break between overs. Marsh resumes, and Morgan pulls one to fine leg. Moeen eases a lovely pull through midwicket for two, then three dots end the over. I’m considering eating a nice yoghurt I have in the fridge, now things have calmed down a touch. Almost 10 overs since the last wicket! 15th over: England 35-5 (Morgan 15, Moeen 15) More Tye. Moeen’s content defending a couple, then lashes one off the back foot through cover for four! Shot. So England’s first boundary arrives in the 15th over, and they are not words I expected to type this morning. He goes hard at the next too, but only gets one. Morgan takes a single to third man, then Moeen ends the over by giddily pulling another four! Goes without saying that with 10 from it, that was England’s most prolific over of the innings. 14th over: England 25-5 (Morgan 14, Moeen 6) Marsh continues, and Moeen begins by turning him to square-leg for one. There’s a sweeper on each side for Morgan, but who knows why. He mercifully gets off strike with a single into the covers. Moeen defends a couple, then has a huge drive outside off and misses. He makes contact with that drive next ball, but it goes straight to the man in the deep for one. Good point! 13th over: England 22-5 (Morgan 13, Moeen 4) Double change. AJ Tye on for Hazlewood, who worked his way through six quite superb overs. Moeen starts by turning him off his pad for one to fine leg. Morgan is into the thirties in terms of balls faced, and doesn’t look fluent. Patience, man. After he drives a bit uppishly towards mid-off, second slip comes and goes to short cover. So Tye bowls a yorker that is going miles down leg, but they appeal for anyway. Why not, eh. Morgan cannot get Tye away and there’s just one from the over. 12th over: England 21-5 (Morgan 13, Moeen 3) The Aussies are changing the bowling! Cummins is coming off after five overs. Mitchell Marsh is on, which is a bit of a surprise. Morgan defends his first ball but is less respectful first up, trotting down and driving to mid-off. Later in the over there’s a big old waft outside off. Still, it’s a maiden. Decent start from Marsh. A lot of the chat in the Australian corners of my twitter feed is about what movie Channel Nine will show when the ODI finishes early... 11th over: England 21-5 (Morgan 13, Moeen 3) It’s a no-brainer, but Smith is continuing with Hazlewood, and Morgan again chops passes his stumps for one. Moeen dots up then turns to midwicket for one. After two dots, Morgan turns to fine leg for one. Stats like these pretty much go without saying given how England have been doing. 10th over: England 18-5 (Morgan 11, Moeen 2) Cummins kindly gifts England a run by starting his fifth over with a wide over Morgan’s head. The legal deliveries are consistently troublesome, however, and Morgan’s battling to get them away. A belting powerplay for England, then. The last ball of it very nearly becomes the first boundary as Morgan drives a bit dodgily through mid-off, but Warner hauls it in on the fence. Still, three! That’s their highest scoring shot yet. Morgan dizzily moves into double figures. Phil knows what’s what. 9th over: England 14-5 (Morgan 8, Moeen 2) The first ball of Hazlewood’s fifth – these two might as well carry on – thrashes into Morgan’s pad and they appeal. It doesn’t look right and umps agrees. Pitched outside leg. Morgan advances next ball and doesn’t get it right, with the ball deflecting to third slip on the bounce. He’s then beaten outside off, before nudging to leg for one. Moeen doesn’t score off the last couple and there’s just a single from it. This innings will, of course, be an absolute statsgasm, whatever happens from here. But 8 is the third lowest score in ODIs ever for the fall of the fifth wicket. Good going. 8th over: England 13-5 (Morgan 7, Moeen 2) Morgan gets one nudged into the off-side off Cummins, then Mo leaves one. Lovely to see three slips in an ODI innings. Smith’s in there now! There’s a gully too, which means there are gaps elsewhere. Moeen realises that and hits and runs under his nose into the off-side. Then Morgan so nearly chops on. Goes to drive, it ain’t there and fizzes past his stumps. They run one. Moeen dips under a shorter one and leaves another. A WICKETLESS OVER! A WICKETLESS OVER! 7th over: England 10-5 (Morgan 5, Moeen 1) Not much Buttler could have done about that, frankly. But there’s been a wicket in each of the last four overs, and four of England’s top six have made ducks today. Moeen is in a bit earlier than anticipated. His first ball is short, and beats him. He leaves his second, then nudges his third to leg for one. A run! And another as Morgan splices horribly through square-leg. I just wonder. England say they live by the sword in this format. They’re dying by it, too. 35 is the lowest ever ODI score, and they are right in the mixer for that. Good question. Another! You can literally hear Michael Clarke shout “you beauty!” off mic this time. That’s a gorgeous delivery from Hazlewood to Buttler, and he’s gone. It’s just nipped away and he’s caught behind! England are five down! 6th over: England 8-4 (Morgan 4, Buttler 0) They crossed as Root played that horrible hoick and Cummins just eases down the ground for a couple. He doesn’t look to score off either of the last two balls. Six for four is England’s worst ever four-down ODI score... It’s also just the fourth time both openers have made a duck in ODIs. Australia have started brilliantly in fine conditions for batting. England are FOUR DOWN! Root has been very watchful but his first shot in anger makes him the third duckee in the top four! Cummins bangs it in, he tries to pull, top edges and only finds fine leg. Trouble... 5th over: England 6-3 (Root 0, Morgan 2) A leftie in for England then. Couple of defended dots get Morgan, the skipper, settled, before he eases a lovely little drive to mid-off’s right for a couple. He leaves the last. Brian Withington is awake and not happy: “Strewth!” he gasps. “4-3 would not even be a particularly good score for England V Australia at football, never mind cricket.” What a start for Australia! Hazlewood’s got Bairstow for none! He goes to launch into a drive and is caught behind. Hazlewood’s length has been immaculate... 4th over: England 4-2 (Bairstow 0, Root 0) Couple of solid defensive strokes gets Joe Root going. Suspect England are glad to have him a place lower at No4 today. It’s a wicket maiden as he defends the next two! 16 balls for Cummins to Hales, then. Four dismissals. Good going. Cummins has got Cummins again! After a dot, he’s jagged one back and it’s bowled him off the front pad! That’s four times in the series... 3rd over: England 4-1 (Bairstow 0, Hales 3) Nice enough drive from Hales off Hazlewood, but straight to cover. The next, from a bit shorter, is guided just past point for one. Bairstow plays out four dots. He’s in no rush. Interesting, Australia have two slips, and neither is Steve Smith. Cam White and the Bison, Mitch Marsh, are in there. 2nd over: England 3-1 (Bairstow 0, Hales 2) Pat Cummins from t’other end. He’s got Hales out three times for 11 runs, and it’s Hales on strikes now. Leaves, defends, then takes one to midwicket to give Jonny Bairstow a look. His first ball hits his thigh, and his second is defended firmly to midwicket. Just one from the over as he blocks the last to cover. 1st over: England 2-1 (Bairstow 0, Hales 1) Hales decides to, you know, have a look at a ball, and leaves his first outside off. He defends the next couple, which are a bit straighter. Then there’s a wide, which Hales tries to wildly cut. Leave them alone, son! He takes a single to extra cover off the extra ball. The one to get Roy was a decent catch from Smith. Loose shot but, let’s be honest, most of Jason Roy’s shots are a bit loose. Good question here from Kenneth. He’s called Nugget and he’s the dressing room attendant. The Aussies love him and you can learn more about him here... What a start! The Aussies appeal off the first ball as Roy ambles down and plays across his front pad to one going high down leg. And he’s nailed a drive to point second ball! Smith takes the catch and he’s gone for nothing... Right, time to get going... Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow on the way out for England, with Josh Hazlewood (Starc is rested) to get the Aussies started. Adelaide Oval is a magnificent ground but the crowd, at least at this stage, does not look magnificent. As the anthems are wheeled away by a band with some fancy looking electric string instruments, there’s barely anyone listening. Test Match Special are celebrating Australia Day by wearing shirts in honour of the least Australian man I know, Dan Norcross. He’s convinced that it always rains there. It did rain during every single Ashes Test! Morning Stuie! Seems likely... You can contact me! Do that in these two ways: By email at will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On the Twitters @willis_macp Up goes the coin and it comes down in Steve Smith’s favour! He chooses to bowl first! Eoin Morgan says he would have done the same because it’s a, and I quote, “really well put together wicket”. He probably doesn’t really care. Smith says Aaron Finch is out of the best next two games but will be back for the T20s next month. Travis Head will open with Dave Warner, and Mitchell Starc is rested. AJ Tye gets a run in his place. For England, it’s Tom Curran, not David Willey, in for Liam Plunkett. That is a bit more middle-overs-like-for-like I reckon. It’s just Curran’s second ODI, and England have resisted the temptation for further change. Australia: Warner, Head, White, Smith (c), Marsh, Stoinis, Paine (wk), Cummins, Tye, Zampa, Hazlewood. England: Roy, Bairstow, Hales, Root, Morgan (c), Buttler (wk), Moeen, Woakes, Rashid, Curran, Wood. Hello! Greetings one and all, wherever you are in the world. It’s Australia Day and cricket in Adelaide on Australia Day is a thing – and so here we are! Australia against whitewash-hunting England, which really doesn’t sound right. Australia have lost 10 of their last 11, appear to have no idea what their best XI is, and no obvious gameplan. They score too slowly, but have called up Glenn Maxwell for the injured Aaron Finch (by far their best batsman so far this series). The mail is that Maxwell won’t play and that Travis Head will open the batting on his home ground – he went bananas there on Australia Day last year. England need to make at least one change, because Liam Plunkett is out of the series with a hammie problem. David Willey is the likeliest to come in; I wonder at what stage of the series England might consider another tweak or two – your Sam Billings, your Dawid Malans, that sort of thing. They probably won’t given their desperation for a whitewash. In the last game, in Sydney, Jos Buttler scored what is generally considered to be the best of his five ODI centuries. It was also his slowest and that it was his best is outrageous given the quality and speed of: this one this one this one and this one What a cricketer. Anyway, all the news from the toss very shortly. Speak then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/25/arsene-wenger-arsenal-chelsea-eden-hazard-carabao-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T00:03:13Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger works out Chelsea’s Hazard dependency to earn Wembley date | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/25/arsene-wenger-arsenal-chelsea-eden-hazard-carabao-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/25/arsene-wenger-arsenal-chelsea-eden-hazard-carabao-cup","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger works out Chelsea’s Hazard dependency to reach final","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At half-time in the latest fun, slightly ragged instalment of the Arsenal-Chelsea stasis the sense of two teams battling for the right to lose to Manchester City at Wembley was tangible. For periods in the first half at the Emirates it was hard to remember a time before Arsenal and Chelsea had been playing each other, apparently endlessly, without any sign of resolution. In the end something did happen. Arsenal got hold of Eden Hazard, and in the process managed to disarm almost completely this lop-sided Chelsea team. It is no secret Chelsea have a chronic case of Hazard-dependencia – unsurprisingly given Hazard’s basic rarity value. With Alexis Sánchez tinkling his tiny piano in Manchester, with Mesut Özil ghosting about hopefully here but only rarely intersecting with the earthly plane, there was a lack of sparkle in both teams in the opening half-hour, a void filled by a player who seemed at times to be playing three positions at once. At kick-off Hazard had lined up in a role that lurked between false and real nine. And for a while Arsenal’s back three seemed baffled. With seven minutes gone N’Golo Kanté’s pass reached Pedro in open green space. He found Hazard, who took two steps and finished with startling ease, like a man taking a final touch on the training pitch while wondering idly if it is lasagne for lunch again. After which Hazard dropped deeper, prompting and linking like an old-school No 10. Briefly he became a scowling No 4, Chopper Hazard, earning a booking for hustling Özil to the ground. A bit later he was an invisible nine, setting Willian away in space with a dummy that threatened to draw a snort of laughter, the kind of step-over that is not just telegraphed but sent registered delivery with regular tracked updates. The game changed, and indeed sprang into broader life, the moment Arsenal worked out how to stop Hazard. Arsène Wenger deserves credit here for his tactical flexibility, his willingness to shift and react instantly. Yes, really. And one more time just for the fun. Arsène Wenger deserves credit here for his tactical flexibility, his willingness to shift and react instantly. Mohamed Elneny dropped deeper and began to man-mark Chelsea’s lone star. Hazard twinkled and broke when he could but was often crowded out. Deprived of one attacking option Chelsea found themselves with no attacking options. Arsenal had already struck back, exerting enough pressure to force a comical head-tennis own goal from Antonio Rüdiger. And steadily they wrenched the initiative with Jack Wilshere having another fine game. Granit Xhaka found himself on the ball a lot more, liberated by Elneny to play the passing, running role that suits him best. His goal to make it 2-1 was a fitting reward for an increasingly invigorating team performance As opposed to…what exactly? Quite how Chelsea have come to rely so heavily on their best player is a matter for the club’s transfer committee. Money has been spent. But on players who look lost, blunt, out of time. The nicest thing you could say about Ross Barkley’s Chelsea debut was that it did eventually end. Clearly these failings of recruitment are a source of real tension with Antonio Conte. The increasingly bizarre mooted signings of the last few days – Andy Carroll , Ashley Barnes, a triple-sized second-hand Ikea wardrobe – have come across as a kind of sulk, the managerial equivalent of being told, no, you can’t have a new hat and flouncing off down the road wearing a brown paper bag saying ‘look what you’ve made me do’. Here his players proved Conte’s point. Stop Eden, stop Chelsea. Through the departures Hazard has remained, still the would-be galáctico, still the next next-best, still brilliant, still at Chelsea.

The encounter might happen in “two or three weeks”, said the president, before setting off for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Trump will face interviewers who have already have amassed a wealth of knowledge about certain notorious events – especially the circumstances around the president’s firing of James Comey as FBI director, and Michael Flynn’s departure as national security adviser. Mueller’s team has charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort with money laundering and conspiracy, while Flynn and former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos have each pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about their contacts with Russians. Trump rejected criticism of his vocal attacks on the Russia inquiry. “You fight back, oh, it’s obstruction,” Trump said. “There’s been no collusion whatsoever … there’s no obstruction whatsoever.” Does he expect to get a fair shake from Mueller? “We’re going to find out.” * * * ‘Disgusting and deplorable’ – Hostesses were groped and propositioned for sex at a high-society fundraiser in London, with the “deplorable” scenes leading to the abrupt disbandment of the charity behind it. An undercover FT reporter at the men-only Presidents Club charity auction at the Dorchester hotel said she was grabbed at repeatedly and an attendee flashed his penis at another of the women, who it seems were hired to be treated as pieces of meat. Great Ormond Street and Evelina London children’s hospitals said they would be handing back hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations. The education minister Nadhim Zahawi was reprimanded for attending the event – a No 10 source said: “The prime minister is appalled by what has been reported. This shows there is a long way to go to ensure all women are treated properly as equals.” The Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: “Is this what these men demand in order to donate to charitable causes? Utterly appalling and shameful.” Amelia Gentleman writes this morning that the whole affair exemplifies the institutional sexism that poisons the British establishment. * * * Mark E Smith dies – Music has lost one of its most original talents after the frontman of The Fall died on Wednesday aged 60. The irascible singer and writer Mark E Smith formed the band in the punk boom of the 1970s but soon forged his own iconoclastic, contrarian musical style that survived four decades. In a moving appreciation, our music critic Dave Simpson, who wrote a book charting Smith’s extraordinary turnover of 66 band members, recalls how he was a student fan when he first met the notoriously difficult Mancunian but came to know a man who could be kind-hearted and hilarious company. * * * ‘Larry Nassar, I hate you’ – The child sex predator who relentlessly preyed on young gymnasts at the highest levels of the sport in the US under the guise of medical treatment is expected to spend the rest of his life in jail. Larry Nassar, former team doctor for USA Gymnastics, has been given 40 to 175 years in prison. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told him: “I just signed your death warrant … sir, you do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again.” Nassar admitted in November to molesting seven girls in his care. But 156 girls and women came forward at his seven-day sentencing hearing to tell of abuse, while two dozen more submitted private letters to the court. Simone Biles, one of the stars of the Rio Olympics, was among those who said she had also been abused by the 54-year-old though she chose not to testify. Rachael Denhollander, the first of Nassar’s victims to come forward publicly in September 2016, said she was “absolutely” satisfied with the sentence. “The number of sexual assault victims Larry had was plain to me. Whether or not anyone would feel safe to come forward, that was the wild card.” * * * Tastes like carbon – Scientists can now calculate how much your sandwich is contributing to global warming. The worst offender is the ready-made “all-day breakfast” sandwich of egg, bacon and sausage. A home-made ham and cheese sandwich treads more lightly on the Earth, and making your own sandwiches produces half the carbon emissions of buying them in the shops. The British Sandwich Association (yes, there is one) says more than 11.5bn sandwiches are consumed each year in the UK, and researchers at the University of Manchester say that generates about 9.5m tonnes of CO2 – “equivalent to the annual use of 8.6m cars”. * * * Murder in Hampstead – An ageing, reclusive author brutally beaten to death in his cluttered home. A Chinese exile turned MI6 informant, caught using the dead man’s bank card. Then a murder trial, with journalists ejected during the suspect’s defence on grounds of national security. The intrigue surrounding the 2006 death of Allan Chappelow and the conviction of Wang Yam for his murder is revisited today by Duncan Campbell and Richard Norton-Taylor. Wang still protests his innocence, saying he raided Chappelow’s overstuffed mailbox and committed the financial fraud after going undercover to infiltrate a gang. A witnesses at his appeal said Chappelow had been a participant in a violent BDSM scene on Hampstead Heath and suggested he might have fallen prey to one of his partners. Still in jail today, could Wang Yam be innocent? * * * Macaque of the clones – Depending how you look at it, this is either a breakthrough in genetic research or a disturbing step closer to making copies of human beings. Scientists in China have produced two cloned macaque monkeys called Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua. The exercise was similar to making Dolly the Sheep: a cell nucleus from the donor animal was added to an unfertilised egg without a nucleus. The “new” nucleus was then “reprogrammed” and zapped with electricity. It is the first time a primate species has been cloned in this way. The scientists involved have promised that people are not next, saying “society will not permit it”.

Its impressive investigation into sexual harassment at a top city party features on many front pages. The FT itself follows yesterday’s exclusive with news that the Presidents Club will close down after the paper’s revelations. The Guardian also splashes on the story and says that guests at the party are rushing to distance themselves from the terrible behaviour reported. The Telegraph says that Theresa May has rebuked her families minister for taking part in the “debauched” city dinner. Meanwhile the Sun uses most of its front to shout out the headline “Sleaze Ball” and says police are being asked to investigate the “gropers gala”. The i has “City rocked by sexism investigation”. The Mail decides to go its own way for its main story and leads instead on the cloned monkeys from China. It does have the city party debacle on the front as well though. Lastly, the Mirror has the headline “Grenfell’s miracle baby” and tells the story of a pregnant woman who fled the burning tower and has now given birth.

A decision on whether to charge the officer, Mohamed Noor, over Damond’s death has been beset by delays, which the Hennepin county attorney, Mike Freeman, has previously blamed on the lack of evidence gathered by investigators. The Star Tribune reported on Wednesday that Freeman has convened a grand jury to question key witnesses under oath. Grand jury deliberations are held in secret – and the fact that one has been convened is not officially acknowledged. The decision appears at odds with a previous announcement by Freeman that he would not use grand juries in police shooting cases, a practice he has described as one of the biggest regrets of his career. That announcement was made during an investigation of the shooting of unarmed black man, Jamar Clark. “The accountability and transparency limitations of a grand jury are too high a hurdle to overcome,” Freeman said in March 2016. Freeman’s office was unable to comment on whether a grand jury had been convened. “Because grand jury proceedings are secret, we cannot comment on grand jury subpoenas or any testimony that occurs before a grand jury,” the office said in a short statement. “Hennepin county attorney Mike Freeman will continue the office’s two-year-old policy where he makes the decision on whether or not to bring charges in officer-involved shootings.” Noor shot Damond in Minneapolis in July 2017 after she called police to report a woman screaming outsider her house. The latest information released by investigators suggests Damond approached the police vehicle, tapped the back and walked to the driver’s side window. Noor was in the passenger seat and is believed to have shot across the driver, striking Damond in the abdomen. Activists released a video of Freeman, the county’s top prosecutor, speaking about the case late last year. Freeman criticised investigators for failing to secure enough evidence. “I’ve got to have the evidence and I don’t have it yet,” he says in the video. “And let me just say, it’s not my fault. So if it isn’t my fault, who didn’t do their jobs? … Investigators and they don’t work for me.” He also criticised Noor’s decision to invoke his constitutional rights and not speak to investigators. Freeman also attacked Noor’s partner, who was in the driver’s seat at the time. “He won’t answer my questions and he doesn’t have to. We all have fifth amendment rights ... I can’t talk to her because she’s gone and the other cop just gave us shit,” he said. The Star Tribune reported that Damond’s family were happy with the decision to convene a grand jury. The family’s lawyer, Bob Bennett, said witnesses had been uncooperative and untruthful. “I and the family are happy that the Hennepin county attorney is using every means at their disposal to get people to cooperate in this investigation and suffer the penalties of perjury if they lie to the grand jury,” Bennett told the Star Tribune."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/24/women-groped-and-sexually-harassed-at-london-charity-gala","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T00:05:04Z","webTitle":"MP calls for tougher laws after women 'groped' at men-only charity gala","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/women-groped-and-sexually-harassed-at-london-charity-gala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/women-groped-and-sexually-harassed-at-london-charity-gala","fields":{"headline":"MP calls for tougher laws after women 'groped' at men-only charity gala","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chair of the parliamentary committee on women and equalities, Maria Miller MP, has suggested strengthening the Equalities Act, after details emerged of a men-only charity dinner – attended by senior figures from business and politics – at which hired “hostesses” were allegedly groped, sexually harassed and propositioned by guests. Senior female politicians lined up to condemn “stomach-churning” behaviour by attendees of the Presidents Club charity dinner, held at London’s exclusive Dorchester hotel and hosted by comedian David Walliams. The annual event, attended by 360 guests including bankers, entrepreneurs and celebrities, included an auction to raise money for good causes. But according to an undercover investigation by two journalists from the Financial Times, some of the 130 women employed as hostesses to entertain the all-male guest list were subjected to sexual harassment. The women were allegedly groped repeatedly and invited by diners to join them in bedrooms at the hotel, while some reported men putting their hands up their skirts. One of the staff, who the FT said were only selected for the job if they matched the criteria of being “tall, thin and pretty”, reported an attendee exposing his penis to her. The women were allegedly told to wear black underwear to match short, black, skirts they had been given for the evening. It was claimed that they were paid £150 for a six-hour shift, plus £25 for a taxi home, not including any time they spent at an after-party at which one woman was told to “down that glass, rip off your knickers and dance on that table”. Lots at a charity auction held at the dinner included a night at Soho’s Windmill strip club and a course of plastic surgery, accompanied by the slogan: “Spice up your wife.” A guest list seen by the Guardian, named billionaire Sir Philip Green, Dragons’ Den entrepreneurs Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis and TV presenter Vernon Kay. Political figures listed among invitees included Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi and Labour peer and party fundraiser Jonathan Mendelsohn, while current and past supporters of the event include Formula 1 magnate Bernie Ecclestone and property developer Nick Candy. It is unclear if any of the men attended and there is no suggestion that they engaged in the activities referred to [see footnote]. Miller said: “British business need to take a long hard look at itself. How seriously is business taking equality at work if they are still using men only events for entertainment? “If business leaders are simply paying lip service to equality issues then perhaps it’s time the government gives the Equality Act some real teeth?” Labour MP Jess Phillips, a leading campaigner in efforts to tackle a culture of sexism and harassment, said: “This is horrendous example of rich men acting with disgusting entitlement. “It cannot just be me calling it out, let’s hear from the establishment, the Conservatives, business, that this is disgusting and not in their name.” The deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, said the report was “simply stomach-churning”. She said: “More than 300 rich businessmen were perfectly happy to attend such an event, which shows the rotten, sexist culture still alive and kicking in parts of the business community. Time’s up on this crap.” Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality party said: “Men from across political, business, and entertainment worlds are implicated in this grotesque circus of sleazy rich men pawing at young women and buying crude ‘lots’ in the name of charity. “Those who are worried that women’s confrontation of sexual harassment has gone too far and turned into a ‘witch hunt’, look no further.” Conservative MP Anna Soubry said: “I should imagine the charities will be appalled that their good name has been sullied in this way. “It was never acceptable but it’s 2018 for goodness sake and I thought – hoped – we’d moved on to being a more civilised decent society. Well we need to.” Other lots included in the charity auction included lunch with foreign secretary Boris Johnson hosted by former England cricketer Ian Botham, or tea with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The Presidents Club told the FT: “The Presidents Club recently hosted its annual dinner, raising several million pounds for disadvantaged children. The organisers are appalled by the allegations of bad behaviour at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters. Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. The allegations will be investigated fully and promptly and appropriate action taken.” In a statement, the Dorchester hotel said it had a zero-tolerance attitude to harassment and said it would cooperate with the authorities if any complaints were made. The Bank of England told the FT it “did not approve any prize for auction on the occasion described nor would it have for that organisation under its guidelines for charitable giving”. • This footnote was added on 24 January 2018. After publication, Nick Candy confirmed that he is a past patron of the Presidents Club and did not attend last week’s event. What women say about the Presidents Club Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee “The Presidents Club charity dinner – a front for groping, harassment and appalling sexism by rich men. Is this what these men demand in order to donate to charitable causes? Utterly appalling and shameful.” Maria Miller, chair of the parliamentary committee on women and equalities “British business need to take a long hard look at itself. If business leaders are simply paying lip service to Equality issues then perhaps it’s time the government gives the Equality Act some real teeth?” Melanie Leech, chief executive, British Property Federation “The behaviour reported to have taken place at the President’s Club charity dinner is shocking and totally unacceptable.” Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general, CBI “If even half of what’s been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment. We want all women to feel confident and respected in every walk of life. We can and must do better than this.” Nicola Horlick, City fund manager “These are some of Britain’s top businesspeople and I can’t understand how they can think it is appropriate ... 120 girls were there ... and some of them seem to have been very badly treated and, actually, molested, and that is a criminal offence. These people have to be held to account.” Anne Milton, education minister: “I thought things had changed and it is absolutely clear that it hasn’t changed. I think there is an association between rich, wealthy people and this sort of behaviour. We have to send a clear message that this is unacceptable.” Jess Phillips, Labour MP “What happened is that women were bought as bait for men who were rich men, not a mile from where we stand, as if that is an acceptable behaviour – it is totally unacceptable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/23/ursula-k-le-guin-sci-fi-fantasy-author-dies-at-88","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T11:44:25Z","webTitle":"Ursula K Le Guin, sci-fi and fantasy author, dies aged 88","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/23/ursula-k-le-guin-sci-fi-fantasy-author-dies-at-88","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/23/ursula-k-le-guin-sci-fi-fantasy-author-dies-at-88","fields":{"headline":"Ursula K Le Guin, sci-fi and fantasy author, dies aged 88","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The literary universe has been rocked by the death of Ursula K Le Guin, the American author whose seminal works, including the children’s fantasy Earthsea cycle and the groundbreaking gender-fluid science fiction novel The Left Hand of Darkness, have been hugely influential over the last half-century. Le Guin’s death on Monday at the age of 88 was announced by her family on Twitter on Tuesday. Her publisher, Gollancz, said she had been in poor health in recent months, although her son Theo Downes-Le Guin told Reuters that “her mind was as sharp as a tack until the last moment”. Her death was mourned by fellow authors and fans including Neil Gaiman, Stephen King and China Miéville, who described her as “a colossus of literature, a radical, a trailblazer”. The author died at her home in Portland, Oregon, where, according to her son, she was working until the last. “She was more or less never not writing. She surprised even herself writing stories until about two months ago,” he said. “She told me a few days ago she felt a little guilty because she was just writing for her own pleasure now.” Le Guin published the first novel in her Earthsea sequence, which traced the life of the wizard Ged, in 1968. The Left Hand of Darkness, a science fiction novel set on a planet where inhabitants only assume the attributes of a gender in order to reproduce, would follow the next year, with the 1970s seeing her release a sequence of pioneering science fiction novels including The Dispossessed and The Lathe of Heaven. The third novel in the Earthsea cycle, The Farthest Shore, won her the National Book Award in children’s literature, while The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed won her both the Hugo and the Nebula prizes. The author of more than 50 books, spanning poetry, criticism, short stories and a translation of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin went on to be named winner of the World Fantasy award for lifetime achievement, and was made a “grand master” of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Her honours extended beyond genre: in 2014, she was awarded the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, cited for how over “more than 40 years, [she] has defied conventions of narrative, language, character, and genre, as well as transcended the boundaries between fantasy and realism, to forge new paths for literary fiction”. On receiving the medal, she said she would share it with her fellow science fiction and fantasy authors, “the writers who were excluded from literature for so long … who for the last 50 years watched the beautiful rewards go to the so-called realists”. “We are terribly diminished by Ursula Le Guin’s absence,” said Miéville, a science fiction and fantasy writer. “She was, rather, a colossus of literature, a radical, a trailblazer.” “She influenced a generation and more of writers – women by inspiration and example – but also any men with an ambition to work with science fiction and fantasy to aspire to more than the forms were allowed to do, or be,” said Guy Gavriel Kay. “We’re poorer for her loss, and richer for having had her presence.” A pioneering feminist, Le Guin pushed at boundaries in both her writing and her campaigning. In a famous letter in 1987, she declined to write a blurb for an anthology containing no writing by women, saying that the tone of it “is so self-contentedly, exclusively male, like a club or a locker room”, ending: “Gentlemen, I just don’t belong here.” In 2004, she attacked the SyFy Channel’s adaptation of her Earthsea books over its casting of Ged as a white man, when in the books he has “red-brown” skin. “Most of the characters in my fantasy and far-future science fiction books are not white. They’re mixed; they’re rainbow,” she wrote in Slate. “Whites are a minority on Earth now – why wouldn’t they still be either a minority, or just swallowed up in the larger coloured gene pool, in the future?” The author was also a vigorous campaigner in industry battles against Google and Amazon, and regularly blogged, sharing her thoughts on everything from Donald Trump (“He is entirely a creature of the media. He is a media golem. If you take the camera and mic off him, if you take your attention off him, nothing is left – mud,” she wrote in February) to her cat, Pard. A fierce defender of the science fiction and fantasy genres, Le Guin took on everyone from Margaret Atwood to Kazuo Ishiguro when she identified a sniffy attitude towards the form. “Realism is a genre – a very rich one, that gave us and continues to give us lots of great fiction,” Le Guin told the Guardian in 2016. “But by making that one genre the standard of quality, by limiting literature to it, we were leaving too much serious writing out of serious consideration. Too many imaginative babies were going out with the bathwater. Too many critics and teachers ignored – were ignorant of – any kind of fiction but realism.” In 2015, she launched an online fiction writing workshop for aspiring authors after declaring she had no more energy for another novel herself, and was ever passionate about the importance of literature. “We read books to find out who we are. What other people, real or imaginary, do and think and feel … is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become,” she said. She was also a reviewer for the Guardian. Her most recent piece was published in November 2017. Her publisher at Gollancz, Malcolm Edwards, said that “those of us who had the pleasure of working with her will remember her as a gracious and good-humoured woman with an iron will, gently expressed”. “She was by common consent one of the greatest – if not the greatest – contemporary SF and fantasy author. This is a very sad day,” said Edwards. Gollancz will release a collection of Le Guin’s non-fiction on 22 February, Dreams Must Explain Themselves, and has an omnibus of the Earthsea novels, illustrated by the artist Charles Vess, out later in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/23/arsene-wenger-arsenal-carabao-cup-mourinho-mkhitaryan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T22:30:13Z","webTitle":"Wenger backs Mkhitaryan to recover from Mourinho snub with Arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/23/arsene-wenger-arsenal-carabao-cup-mourinho-mkhitaryan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/23/arsene-wenger-arsenal-carabao-cup-mourinho-mkhitaryan","fields":{"headline":"Wenger backs Mkhitaryan to recover from Mourinho snub with Arsenal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Since Alexis Sánchez’s transfer to Manchester United was confirmed on Monday evening there has not been a single tweet from one of his former Arsenal team-mates to wish him well or say what a pleasure it was to play alongside him. These guys and this club are not noted for their reticence on the social media platform. Sometimes, it is what is left unsaid that makes the point. Arsène Wenger went the other way. The manager had something to get off his chest on Tuesday morning and he dived right in. Arsenal are one game from the Carabao Cup final – they entertain Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium in the semi-final, second-leg on Wednesday night, with the scoreline locked at 0-0 from the first leg – and Wenger was asked whether victory and a Wembley appearance would lift the mood at the club. “To change the mood?” Wenger said. ‘I have no illusions at all. The mood is decided by you [the press]. Look, we have been in a few finals. Has it changed your mood? No. You celebrate some teams who have not been in a final for 25 years and yet you kill us, even though we have won the FA Cup three times in the last four years. It’s like that. We have to live with that.” Tottenham Hotspur’s last appearance in an FA Cup final was 1991 and there is the sense in some quarters at Arsenal that the British press have anointed them as their darlings – despite their lack of silverware. Similarly, they feel that Liverpool, who have struggled for trophies in the past decade or so, have been feted more than criticised. It is into this climate – one characterised by the mentality of the siege and where meltdowns bubble around every corner – that Arsenal welcome Henrikh Mkhitaryan. The Armenian, who joined from United in a straight swap for Sánchez, is cup-tied against Chelsea and must wait until next Tuesday to make his Arsenal debut – at Swansea City in the Premier League. The pressure will be on him to provide positivity from the off. If things had worked out differently, Mkhitaryan would have become an Arsenal player in the summer of 2016. “I met him and we were close at the time but, in the end, it didn’t work,” Wenger said. The attacking midfielder would leave Borussia Dortmund for United; Wenger has said many times that Arsenal cannot compete for players – on a financial level – with either Manchester club. Mkhitaryan struggled under José Mourinho at Old Trafford and Wenger said that the challenge for him would be to put the psychological scars behind him – in the same way that Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne have done. Both of them struggled under Mourinho at Chelsea. “You worry about how much it has affected him but it’s a new chance for him and that’s what you want in life,” Wenger said. “With his quality, I’m sure that he will take it. I might have to analyse with him how it went [at United], what we can do, how can we help him?” It is clear that Mkhitaryan is no like-for-like Sanchez replacement and Wenger raised the prospect of him filling the midfield boots of the long-term injury victim Santi Cazorla. “Personally, I see him first wide but I’m thinking as well that there is the possibility for him to play through the middle, Wenger said. “As a No10? Or even deeper.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/24/self-driving-cars-dangerous-period-false-security","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T08:01:25Z","webTitle":"Who's driving?

Autonomous cars may be entering the most dangerous phase","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When California police officers approached a Tesla stopped in the centre of a five-lane highway outside San Francisco last week, they found a man asleep at the wheel. The driver, who was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, told them his car was in “autopilot”, Tesla’s semi-autonomous driver assist system. In a separate incident this week, firefighters in Culver City reported that a Tesla rear-ended their parked fire truck as it attended an accident on the freeway. Again, the driver said the vehicle was in autopilot. The oft-repeated promise of driverless technology is that it will make the roads safer by reducing human error, the primary cause of accidents. However, automakers have a long way to go before they can eliminate the driver altogether. What’s left is a messy interim period when cars are being augmented incrementally with automated technologies such as obstacle detection and lane centering. In theory, these can reduce the risk of crashes, but they are not failsafe. As a Tesla spokeswoman put it: “Autopilot is intended for use only with a fully attentive driver.” However, research has shown that drivers get lulled into a false sense of security to the point where their minds and gazes start to wander away from the road. People become distracted or preoccupied with their smartphones. So when the car encounters a situation where the human needs to intervene, the driver can be slow to react. At a time when there is already a surge in collisions caused by drivers distracted by their smartphones, we could be entering a particularly dangerous period of growing pains with autonomous driving systems. “People are already inclined to be distracted. We’re on our phones, eating burgers, driving with our knees,” said Nidhi Kalra, senior information scientist at the Rand Corporation. “Additional autonomy gives people a sense that something else is in control, and we have a tendency to overestimate the technology’s capabilities.” Steven Shladover, of the University of California, Berkeley’s Path programme, was more sharply critical of car manufacturers: “These companies are overselling the capabilities of the systems they have and the public is being misled.” Waymo, Google’s self-driving car spin-off, discovered the handoff problem when it was testing a “level 3” automated driving system – one that can drive itself under certain conditions, but in which the human still needs to takeover if the situation becomes tricky. The next level, four, is what most people consider “fully autonomous”. Most of the advanced driver assist features introduced by Tesla, Mercedes, BMW and Cadillac are categorised as level 2 automation. During testing, Waymo recorded what its CEO, John Krafcik, described as “sort of scary” video footage of drivers texting, applying makeup and even sleeping behind the wheel while their cars hurtled down the freeway. This led Waymo to decide to leapfrog level 3 automation altogether, and focus on full autonomy instead. “We found that human drivers over-trusted the technology and were not monitoring the roadway carefully enough to be able to safely take control when needed,” said the company in its 2017 safety report. Ian Reagan from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) shares Waymo’s caution, although he acknowledges that the safety potential for automated systems is “huge”. “There are lots of potential unintended consequences, particularly with level 2 and 3 systems,” he said, explaining how the IIHS had bought and tested several cars with level 2 automation including vehicles from Tesla, Mercedes and BMW. “Even the best ones do things you don’t expect,” he said. During tests the IIHS recorded a Mercedes having problems when the lane on the highway forked in two. “The radar system locked onto the right-hand exit lane when the driver was trying to go straight,” he said. Tesla’s autopilot suffered from a different, repeatable glitch that caused it to veer into the guardrail when approaching the crest of a hill. “If the driver had been distracted, that definitely would have caused a crash,” he said. Concern over this new type of distracted driving is forcing automakers to introduce additional safety features to compensate. For example, GM has introduced eye-tracking technology to check the driver’s eyes are on the road while Tesla drivers can be locked out of autopilot if they ignore warnings to keep their hands on the steering wheel. That hasn’t stopped some enterprising owners from finding a way to trick the autopilot warning system by wedging an orange or a water bottle into the steering wheel. In spite of these problems, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, remains bullish about his company’s autonomous technology, even suggesting that by 2019 drivers would be able to sleep in their cars – presumably without being arrested by highway patrol officers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/24/tv-writers-women-men-pay-gap-anonymous-spreadsheet","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"TV writers circulate anonymous spreadsheet to fight gender pay gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/24/tv-writers-women-men-pay-gap-anonymous-spreadsheet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/24/tv-writers-women-men-pay-gap-anonymous-spreadsheet","fields":{"headline":"TV writers circulate anonymous spreadsheet to fight gender pay gap","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Television writers are crowdsourcing information about their salaries in a Google spreadsheet, in the latest instance of workers attempting to address racial and gender discrimination through anonymized transparency. Hundreds of salaries have been entered into the spreadsheet, which asks writers to “help us achieve parity by sharing any info you are willing to”. Contributors have entered data points including their job title, gender, whether or not they are a person of color, and how much they were paid per episode. Though the Guardian is not able to verify the salary data, the document offers some insight into possible pay disparities. According to the spreadsheet, for example, a white male co-executive producer earned $25,000 per episode on a show, while a non-white female co-executive producer working on a show produced by the same studio and airing on the same network earned $10,000 per episode. In another case, a white woman reported earning $14,000 per episode as a co-producer of a show, while a non-white, female co-producer on a show produced by the same studio and airing on the same network earned $10,000 per episode. “TV female writers trying to seek parity for our sisters of color,” tweeted Audrey Wauchope, a writer for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend who shared a link to the document on Twitter but said that she had not created it. “We all sit at the same table and do the same work.” The spreadsheet began circulating this week amid an industry-wide conversation about sexism, sexual harassment and pay inequality. Several actors spoke out about the gender wage gap on the red carpet at the Golden Globes – an issue epitomized by subsequent reports that Mark Wahlberg was paid $1.5m for reshooting scenes in All The Money in the World, while co-star Michelle Williams was paid just $1,000. The document includes entries from all levels of television writers, from executive producers/showrunners earning five-figures per episode to writers’ assistants earning less than $1,000 per week without benefits. The person who created the spreadsheet told the Guardian by email that they want to remain anonymous: “I’m worried if I ‘out’ myself I may get a reputation with the studios.” A second spreadsheet collecting information about television actors’ salaries is also circulating, though it has attracted far fewer entries. “The whole point of this exercise to me ... is to pierce the veil of silence so that you can have some information when you negotiate,” said Melissa Silverstein, the founder and publisher of the website Women in Hollywood. “I think it would be really helpful for women to know what men get paid, because that’s part of the problem: men get paid more.” The most recent analysis of diversity in film and television by the Writers Guild of America West, the union representing film and television writers, found that women and people of color “remained seriously underrepresented among the corps of writers”, with a persistent earnings gap between male writers and female writers, and white writers and non-white writers. The Guild contract establishes minimum compensation levels for writers at various levels in film and television, but individuals can negotiate higher rates. “It’s this very blind process, and I’m certain that male writers are getting more than female writers,” said one woman of color who writes for a television show and asked to remain anonymous because she did not create the spreadsheet. “It’s very nice for us to be able share this information so we ... understand what our worth is.” The TV writers spreadsheet is the latest crowdsourced document attempting to upend entrenched inequality by sharing sensitive information. Since October, the media industry has been convulsed by the “Shitty Media Men” list, a document that collected anonymous allegations of sexual assault and harassment against more than 70 men working in publishing and journalism. An anonymous spreadsheet for women working in academia has compiled more than 2,000 accounts of harassment, while a spreadsheet circulated among Google employees collected salary and bonus information of about 1,200 employees. The Google document showed that male employees were paid more than women – an allegation that has also been made by the US department of labor but that Google has consistently denied. The television writer who spoke with the Guardian said that seeing the information in the spreadsheet might influence her actions going forward. “I kind of just let my reps do all the work,” she said, “but it definitely is going to make me think twice when an offer comes in and they’re trying to lowball me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T23:20:37Z","webTitle":"Chile president-elect reveals hardline cabinet with ties to Pinochet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick","fields":{"headline":"Chile president-elect reveals hardline cabinet with ties to Pinochet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Chile’s president-elect, the billionaire businessman Sebastian Piñera, has unveiled a new hardline cabinet, including prominent conservative figures and some politicians once closely aligned with the Pinochet dictatorship. The new interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, was a vocal supporter of Augusto Pinochet during his 1973-1990 regime, which named him president of the Catholic University Students Federation. Chadwick and the new justice minister, Hernán Larraín, were also supporters and defenders of the secretive German enclave Colonia Dignidad, which was established by the fugitive Nazi officer and paedophile Paul Shäfer in the early 60s. It later emerged that the enclave was used by security officials to torture and murder opponents of the regime. Both Chadwick and Larraín later made statements distancing themselves from Pinochet’s regime. Piñera’s victory in December’s runoff ended eight years of government by a centre-left coalition under Michelle Bachelet (two non-consecutive four-year terms), and marked the latest in a string of electoral gains for the right in Latin America. Although Piñera campaigned on a centrist platform, many analysts predicted that he would tack to the right upon election. On the night of the election, one group of Piñera supporters celebrated by hoisting aloft a bust of Pinochet. The new ministerial lineup is dominated by men in their 60s. None of the most senior positions will go to women, who will head just seven out of the 23 ministries. Many of the newly nominated ministers had previously served in Piñera’s previous government, between 2010 and 2014. Antoine Maillet, a political scientist at the University of Chile, said the new cabinet – which will take office on 11 March – clearly demonstrated an intention to turn back Bachelet’s progressive reforms. “They definitely want to change the course the country is taking,” he told the Guardian. A key part of Bachelet’s legacy was an effort to roll back Chile’s draconian abortion laws, but the lineup of Pinera’s government suggests that too may soon be threatened. The new minister for women and gender equality, Isabel Plá, and the incoming health minister, Emilio Santelices, were both vocal opponents of a landmark ruling last year to legalise abortion under certain circumstances. The political commentator Claudio Fuentes said that most of the appointees were close allies of Piñera. “This isn’t a government of innovation,” he said. “There are few new faces and no signs of a more liberal approach by Piñera. Ideologically this is simply a very traditional and conservative, pro-business government.” Alfredo Moreno, a businessman and former foreign minister in Piñera’s previous government, will leave his post at one of Chile’s leading business organisations to become minister of social development, an area in which he has no previous experience. “But he’s very close to Piñera, who’s clearly marking him out as a future presidential candidate,” said Fuentes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/23/trappist-1-planets-likely-life-water-earth-like","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T22:44:32Z","webTitle":"Two planets in unusual star system are very likely habitable, scientists say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/23/trappist-1-planets-likely-life-water-earth-like","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/23/trappist-1-planets-likely-life-water-earth-like","fields":{"headline":"Two planets in unusual star system are very likely habitable, scientists say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Scientists have identified two planets circling round a dim dwarf star as especially likely candidates to have habitable conditions, with probable water and a source of heat, attributes thought necessary for life beyond Earth. Since their discovery last year, the seven planets and their star, called Trappist-1, have thrilled astronomers hunting for a world resembling Earth. Never before had scientists found so many Earth-sized planets around a single star, or in a zone where the extreme temperatures of space would not obliterate the chances of life. The finding suggested that there may be planets as rocky and large as Earth all over the Milky Way, and scientists quickly set to work analyzing the Trappist-1 system. With colleagues in Hungary, Dr Amy Barr of the Planetary Science Institute built mathematical models of the seven planets and their interiors, and found that six of the seven worlds probably have water, as liquid or ice, with a global ocean possible on one. The team then modeled the planets’ orbits to determine a likely surface temperature on the worlds. “That’s one of the main innovations of the paper,” Barr told the Guardian. “The planets are also on eccentric orbits – kind of egg-shaped – so every time the planet goes around the star it gets stretched and squeezed.” Jupiter’s moon Io, experiences the same kind of push-pull, called tidal heat. Io’s surface is riven by erupting volcanoes, lava flows, scars and caldera. Barr said the same forces are probably at work in the Trappist-1 system: “The planet kind of works its own internal friction, because that stretching and squeezing creates heat in the interior.” In the paper, set to be published in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, the team concluded that planets b and c (each world goes by a lower-case letter), experience tidal heat, and that planet c probably has little to no water, but mostly iron and rock. Planets d and e – the two identified as most likely to be habitable – also experience tidal heat, they found, but much less. They calculated that those planets are “in this kind of temperate region”, Barr said, with a “very reasonable surface temperatures”. Planet d, the team estimates, has a temperature around 15C (59F) or perhaps as low as slightly warmer than the melting point of ice. Planet e was colder, Barr said: “the temperatures you would get in Antarctica, but also reasonable”. The likelihood of tidal heating is encouraging to scientists in search of planets with the conditions for life. Tidal heat not only warms a planet, but also drives chemistry and flow in its mantle, conditions amenable to the development of life – at least as humans know it. Because Nasa has yet to launch its next-generation space telescope, the James Webb, scientists like Barr and her colleagues have turned to computers to investigate puzzles with limited data. A paper last year found that Trappist-1, although older and more dim than our sun, projects a stellar wind far more severe than the solar wind that lashes Earth from our sun. This wind probably stripped away the atmosphere – another condition for life – from the planets closest to Trappist-1, while the more distant planets fared better. Another team investigated whether the Trappist-1 worlds could hold water – another condition – and found that four of the seven might. But while the pieces of research by various teams have generally supported each other, Barr and other astronomers, astrophysicists and geophysicists are most eager for more observations. Should the James Webb launch on schedule this year, it will provide far more data about specific exoplanets, and ease the challenge of writing about a system as a whole. “It’s hard to write a paper about seven planets all at once,” Barr said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/23/cia-chief-says-north-korea-is-a-handful-of-months-from-endangering-us","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T19:37:49Z","webTitle":"CIA chief draws new 'red line' on North Korea nuclear buildup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/23/cia-chief-says-north-korea-is-a-handful-of-months-from-endangering-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/23/cia-chief-says-north-korea-is-a-handful-of-months-from-endangering-us","fields":{"headline":"CIA chief draws new 'red line' on North Korea nuclear buildup","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The CIA director, Mike Pompeo, has said that the Trump administration is intent on preventing North Korea from being able to fire multiple nuclear missiles at the United States, apparently sketching out a new red line for the regime in Pyongyang. Speaking in Washington, Pompeo explained for the first time what the administration meant when it warns that it would not allow the regime of Kim Jong-un to threaten the US with a nuclear weapon. Despite personal warnings from Donald Trump on Twitter and in speeches, the US has not been able so far to prevent North Korea from testing a hydrogen bomb and conducting three test launches of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) – including one that appeared capable of reaching New York or Washington. Pompeo suggested the threshold for US military action was set higher. “Kim Jong-un will not rest with a single successful test,” the former Republican congressman told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute. “The logical next step would be to develop an arsenal of weapons. That is not one, not a showpiece, not something to drive on a parade ground on 8 February [army day] but rather the capacity to deliver from multiple firings of these missiles simultaneously.” “That increases the risk to America and that is the very mission set that President Trump has directed the government to figure out a way to make sure never occurs,” he added. He said that North Korea was “a handful of months” from the ability to “hold America at risk” and he said the CIA was focused on ensuring that “a year from now they are still several months away”. Pompeo added that CIA officials were spread out around the world trying to ensure that economic pressure on the embattled regime was effective and that Trump was focused on a diplomatic solution. “We are also equally at the same time ensuring that if we conclude it is not possible, that we present the president a range of options that can achieve what is his stated intention [the nuclear disarmament of North Korea],” the CIA director said. Pompeo argued that the North Korean leader could not be sure he could hit the US mainland until he had developed a substantial arsenal with multiple nuclear-tipped missiles. “US policy is that we are going to denuclearise permanently, that we are going to foreclose that risk. But it is still the case that if we haven’t gotten there, it is still a secondary mission to ensure that we keep them from having that capability,” he said. “In the deterrence model you have to be certain that what you aim to deliver will actually be successful. At the very least you need to make sure your adversary believes that. That is what Kim Jong-un is driving at. He is trying to put in our mind the reality that he can deliver that pain to the USA and our mission is to make the day that he can do that as far off as possible.” Pompeo denied reports that North Korea’s successful ICBM tests and the underground testing of an apparent hydrogen bomb in September had caught US intelligence by surprise. “That is just untrue,” he said. “The intelligence community on this one actually understood the capability and the testing capacity. We’ll never get the week or the month right on something that is this complicated but we can get the direction of travel and the capacity for rate of change right, and we did.” However, he said the previous administration had not concentrated sufficient resources on North Korea and its weapons programmes. “When I came in, there was insufficient focus on the problem set,” the CIA director said. “It wasn’t the case that it had been ignored. It wasn’t the case that we had missed material things, but it didn’t receive the focus of attention that is going to be needed to deliver what this administration is going to ask of the intelligence community. So we within weeks of me coming in, I created a Korea mission centre.. “We are in a much better place than we were 12 months ago,” Pompeo said, but added: “We are still suffering from having gaps. “There is enormous pressure that has been being put on me, and I in turn have placed enormous pressure on my team to solve the riddle, to close each of those gaps to the maximum extent that we possibly can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/24/tasmania-new-find-of-extremely-rare-red-handfish-doubles-population-to-80","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T06:27:13Z","webTitle":"Tasmania: new find of extremely rare red handfish doubles population to 80","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/tasmania-new-find-of-extremely-rare-red-handfish-doubles-population-to-80","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/24/tasmania-new-find-of-extremely-rare-red-handfish-doubles-population-to-80","fields":{"headline":"Tasmania: new find of extremely rare red handfish doubles population to 80","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Divers in Tasmania have discovered a new population of red handfish, doubling the known population of the elusive and extremely rare fish and raising hopes that more may be found. Until last week the remaining population of red handfish, Thymichthys politus, was believed to be confined to one long reef in in south-east Tasmania. A recent survey at that site found eight individual fish at that site, prompting scientists to estimate the reef housed 20 to 40 handfish. The second site, discovered on a similarly-sized bit of reef a short distance away, is estimated to house the same number of fish. It was discovered after a member of the public reported seeing a red handfish in the area and a team of seven divers spent two days searching the reef. “We were diving for approximately three and a half hours and at about the two-hour mark we were all looking at each other thinking this is not looking promising,” diver Antonia Cooper said. “My dive partner went to tell the other divers that we were going to start heading in and I was half-heartedly flicking algae around when, lo and behold, I found a red handfish.” University of Tasmania researcher with the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, Rick Stuart-Smith, said it was possible there were other undiscovered populations. However, Stuart-Smith, who coordinates the annual survey project, said the new populations were likely to be genetically isolated because red handfish are not built for long swims. “If they are disturbed they can do a little burst, they will swim 50cm in a burst and then settle again,” he told Guardian Australia. “They waddle on their fins, they are just trudging along the bottom. In fact you hardly ever see them actually moving. “Imagine something that’s seven or nine centimetres long trying to walk 1km on a rocky ocean bottom … they are sitting ducks, plus it’s just a big effort for them.” There are three species of critically endangered handfish endemic to Tasmania. The red handfish is the rarest of those still that can still be found in the wild. Ziebell’s handfish, Brachiopsilus ziebelli, was likely to be extinct, Stuart-Smith said. A captive breeding program for the spotted handfish, Brachionichthys hirsutus, began in September, and the fish was made the mascot of the Dark Mofo festival. Stuart-Smith said researchers would review the viability of a captive breeding program for red handfish now that the known wild population was large enough to cope with the capture of a few breeding pairs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/24/explosion-attack-save-the-children-office-jalalabad-afghanistan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:06:30Z","webTitle":"Isis claims attack on Save the Children office in Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/explosion-attack-save-the-children-office-jalalabad-afghanistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/24/explosion-attack-save-the-children-office-jalalabad-afghanistan","fields":{"headline":"Isis claims attack on Save the Children office in Afghanistan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gunmen stormed the offices of Save the Children in Jalalabad on Wednesday, killing at least six people and wounding 27 in an attack claimed by Islamic State. The latest assault on a foreign charity in Afghanistan underlined the growing dangers for aid workers in the country, who have become casualties of an increase in militant violence in recent years. The attack began just after 9am when a suicide car bomb was detonated outside the offices. The attackers then used rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) to blast their way inside. Afghan security forces fought the gunmen for nearly 10 hours, at one stage rescuing nearly 50 people from the basement of the building as fighting continued on the floors above, said a member of the Ningarhar provincial government, Sohrab Qaderi. Army officials said at least six people had been killed – two soldiers, two guards working for Save the Children and two other civilians, one of whom also worked for the British charity. Another 27 people were wounded, including nine Afghan security service members. Save the Children confirmed “with profound sadness” that three of its staff members had been killed in the attack. “All other staff have been safely rescued from the office. Four were injured in the attack and are receiving medical treatment,” a spokesman said. “Save the Children condemns this attack in the strongest possible terms. We are shocked and appalled at the violence carried out against our staff in Afghanistan, who are dedicated humanitarians, committed to improving the lives and wellbeing of millions of children across the country.” The incident was claimed by Isis, which has established a foothold in eastern Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is the capital. The group said in a statement it was targeting British and Swedish groups in the region. All Save the Children programmes across Afghanistan were being temporarily suspended and offices shut. “Investigations into the nature of the attack are ongoing and the motive cannot yet be confirmed,” the organisation said. “We remain committed to resuming our operations and lifesaving work as quickly as possible, as soon as we can be assured that it is safe to do so.” Up to four heavily armed insurgents are thought to have been involved in the attack. Initial information suggested the men had been wearing military uniforms, said Attaullah Khogyani, a provincial government spokesman. Television footage and video shot by onlookers during the attack showed thick smoke billowing from a burning car outside the complex and a fire burning on at least one floor of the building. Zabiullah, a Save the Children employee who uses one name, said he had heard “a very big explosion” and seen gunmen rushing into the office. “The attackers just opened the doors and threw grenades then opened fire,” he said. “When me and my friends saw the situation we rushed the basement. I saw six of my colleagues who were wounded. We were terrified and locked the door.” Mohammad Amin, who was in the compound at the time, told AFP from his hospital bed that he had heard “a big blast”. “We ran for cover and I saw a gunman hitting the main gate with an RPG to enter the compound,” Amin said. “I jumped out of the window.” Worried relatives gathered at the scene during the gun battle between the militants and security forces. “I am here because my son is stuck inside,” said one onlooker, Khan Jan. “I am worried for him. I haven’t been able to get in touch with him. He switched [off] his phone.” A Taliban spokesman said his group was not involved in the attack. At the weekend Taliban gunmen raided a luxury hotel in Kabul, killing at least 22 people, mostly foreigners. The UN’s mission in Afghanistan tweeted that it was looking into reports of Wednesday’s violence. “Attacks directed at civilians or aid organisations are clear violations of international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” it said. The assault on Save the Children, which has operated in Afghanistan since 1976, follows an ambush of International Committee of the Red Cross workers last year. Six employees were killed in that attack, and the charity said in October it would “drastically” reduce its presence in the country. The decision by the Red Cross, which has been working in Afghanistan for more than 30 years, highlighted the growing dangers facing aid workers. The UK ambassador to Afghanistan, Nick Kay, said Wednesday’s incident was an outrage. “Any attack on children &amp; humanitarians is a crime against humanity,” he said on Twitter. US and Afghan forces have been carrying out ground and air operations against Isis fighters in Nangarhar. While Afghan security forces are conducting most of the fighting against Isis and Taliban militants, US troops operate alongside them in a training capacity and are frequently on the frontline. The last major attack in Jalalabad was on 31 December, when an explosion at a funeral killed 18 mourners and wounded 13. There was no claim of responsibility. Last April the US detonated the largest conventional bomb it has ever used in combat against Isis fighters in the Achin district of Nangarhar province. The Afghan government claimed the “mother of all bombs” killed 90 militants. Bilal Sarwary contributed to this report from Kabul.

Only donations from foreign governments should be banned rather than all donations from people who are not Australian citizens or residents, Melbourne University professor Joo-Cheong Tham has submitted to the joint standing committee on electoral matters. In December the Turnbull government introduced a bill to ban donations by non-citizens or non-residents following controversy over the then Labor senator Sam Dastyari’s dealings with the Sydney-based Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo. In June ABC’s Four Corners program investigated more than $4m of donations to the major parties by an Australian Chinese citizen, Chau Chak Wing, who was a member of a Communist party advisory group. Tham argued the foreign donation ban was “not justified” by those cases because neither would be banned since Huang is an Australian resident and Chau an Australian citizen. Nor would the restrictions likely apply to their businesses. He argued the ban “excludes many persons resident in Australia who should be entitled to influence its political process” including international students and people on temporary skilled visas. Tham, the director of the Electoral Regulation Research Network, told Guardian Australia the focus on foreign donations was “exaggerated and misconceived”. “It doesn’t deal with the more fundamental problems with money in Australian politics – which come less from the foreignness of money and more the corporateness, the use of money to buy access and influence.” He proposed more restrictive caps on donations and election spending whatever their source. Tham recommended that proposed associated entities changes be wound back so advocating for or against a particular policy or an individual would not make a third party group an associated entity. GetUp has opposed the changes, which it interprets as an attempt to frame it as an associated entity of Labor and the Greens. The Institute of Public Affairs has labelled the change “potentially very dangerous” and likely to capture many third-party groups and impose higher disclosure requirements. Tham said the scope was “ludicrous”, suggesting mining companies and environmental groups could be affected because they lobby for and against particular policies and urge a vote against particular parties. “Associated entities provisions are meant to capture groups that are de facto extensions of political parties,” Tham said. “An organisation saying ‘don’t vote for X or Y candidate’ – that, in itself, should not render an organisation an associated entity.” Tham said limiting donations to people with “a meaningful connection to Australia” was “constitutionally suspect”, echoing warnings from legal experts Anne Twomey and George Williams that it could breach the implied freedom of political communication. The Human Rights Law Centre has also warned aspects of the electoral funding and disclosure bill are “likely” to face a constitutional challenge. Tham said, in the Unions NSW decision striking down a law limiting donations to enrolled voters, the high court had “clearly recognised that individuals resident in this country might be entitled to influence the political process because they are affected by its outcomes”. Tham supports new categories of political and third-party campaigners but proposed raising the spending thresholds that trigger higher disclosure requirements. For example, he noted that the SA Road Transport Association and Royal Australian College of Practitioners had spent more than $100,000 on political expenditure and would therefore be subject to the same regulation as political parties. When introducing the bill, the special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, said it was necessary “to support the integrity of Australia’s electoral system and Australia’s sovereignty” by limiting influence through donations to those with a meaningful connection to Australia. Cormann said the bill will “improve the consistency of the regulatory treatment of all political actors”. Groups that campaign to influence the outcome of elections should be “subject to the public accountability of more traditional actors, such as registered political parties or candidates,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/24/mona-foma-festival-2018-a-tale-of-two-cities-told-in-parties-and-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T02:29:56Z","webTitle":"Mona Foma festival 2018: a tale of two cities told in parties and protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/24/mona-foma-festival-2018-a-tale-of-two-cities-told-in-parties-and-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/24/mona-foma-festival-2018-a-tale-of-two-cities-told-in-parties-and-protest","fields":{"headline":"Mona Foma festival 2018: a tale of two cities told in parties and protest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every festival has its own personality and vibe. If the Mona’s big summer festival Mona Foma (Mofo) was a person it would be a rich, eccentric uncle who leaves his house open for a big party and wanders around the grounds looking amused while guests try to dance with peacocks. So it will be sad to see Mona’s very own rich uncle, the Museum of Old and New Art’s owner, David Walsh, retire this particular party, which has been going in Hobart since 2009. The festival is relocating to Launceston for the next four years so Walsh can build a hotel on the museum site and the north of the state can reap some of its economic benefits. At Mona Foma’s final Hobart festival the lineup was eclectic, and the loose theme this year was protest music. So-called “world music” featured strongly – as did heavier, darker stuff including Saturday night’s headliner, Mayhem – Scandinavia’s masked black metal band. But first, to the 11-day festival’s final gig – the Violent Femmes with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. The TSO has been in talks with Mona Foma’s curator, Brian Ritchie – also the Violent Femmes’ bass player and a Tasmania resident – for some years about a potential collaboration. It would be the Milwaukee acoustic-punk trio’s first with an orchestra. They agreed, and the orchestra’s tuba player Tim Jones committed a year to arranging the Femmes’ music. Over two nights the band and the TSO played Hobart’s Federation Concert Hall, much to the delight of locals who, on the night I went, gave the performance a long, rapturous standing ovation. They jumped straight into it at the start with a fast and furious Add it Up, probably the weakest song of the set – with sound jarring. Would the orchestra’s sound be too big for the songs and wash them out? Thankfully, on other numbers the band and orchestra complemented rather than competed with one another. The concert included some of the Femmes’ best-known pop-punk songs including Blister in the Sun, American Music, Please Do Not Go and Gone Daddy gone. The final song – Good Feeling – may as well have been written for the TSO’s string section. It was slowed right down, full of yearning. It was the arrangement with the lightest touch – and the most affecting. Some of the Femmes’ lyrics – reminiscent of teenage parties and wild crushes – sound slightly weird coming from middle-aged mouths and accompanied by a full orchestra (“I need a date to the prom, would you like to come along? But nobody would go to the prom with me, baby”), but you could sing Good Feeling when you’re 90 and it would still sound so right. The Femmes themselves look as if they could keep going into their 90s. At the start of the night, Ritchie led the band into the concert hall like a piped piper, playing a bamboo flute. He carved up the bass acoustic guitar and then, with Confessions, started blowing on an instrument like looked like a shell. Could it be a conch?! And Gordon Gano’s voice hasn’t aged – in fact it sounds richer than it did on the band’s 1983 debut album. John Sparrow on drums kept an infectious rhythm that had many in the concert hall wriggle-dancing in their seats. In addition to the two shows with the TSO, the Violent Femmes played a free concert during Mona Foma’s first weekend in Launceston at a free community block party. The three-day event in Tasmania’s second city kicked off on 11 January and featured performances by Gotye and the Canadian contemporary dance troupe Monumental. Ritchie, wearing his Mona Foma curator hat, says the festival was a great success. As well as 6,000 people attending the block party, “our farewell to Hobart saw our usual 3,000 per day onsite at Mona over three days, plus two sold-out performances of Violent Femmes with the TSO”. He said more than 5,000 people had partied over three nights at the festival’s afterparty, Faux Mo, “with plenty more enjoying free events across the city”. Highlights were many. Brian Jackson and the local Southern Gospel Choir delivered a powerful set, with Mona’s operations manager, Maria Lurighi, also on vocals. Jackson – who has collaborated with Nina Simone and Gil Scott-Heron – delivered The Revolution Will Not Be Televised less as a song and more as a wake-up call. Over on the Turrell stage the eclectic Breadwoman drew a curious crowd. The performance artist Lilian Steiner played with a loaf of bread on her face and wielded a breadstick as if it was a lightsaber. It was music without borders, with some of the best sets of the weekend coming from far away, including the Iraqi oud player Rahim AlHaj and cellist Karim Wasfi, the Tunisian singer Emel Mathlouthi, the Argentinian folk hip-hop trio Femina and the Indonesian/Catalan combo Filastine &amp; Nova. Godspeed You! Black Emperor finished off the first night of the festival with a set that lacked energy at the start but built to a beautiful crescendo. The backdrop to the concert – looming, brutalist tower blocks on a large screen – added to the end-of-days vibe. The Faux Mo parties – held after the festival each night in a large warehouse on the pier – were lots of fun, although older hands were nostalgic for parties of yore, which were held in abandoned office towers or at the old Odeon. The festival organisation was, again, very smooth. There were plenty of buses and ferries to get people to and from the festival site and – with Mona sharing its site with a winery – there was loads of high-quality booze and food for sale (although some of the food I had at the weekend was not well-cooked). You could also suck on a sauvignon blanc icy pole in the shape of Donald Trump’s head. Seeing a Trump head melt in the sun is quite captivating. It was almost too good to lick."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/23/bristol-city-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T21:58:36Z","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero guides Manchester City to Wembley despite Bristol City rally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/23/bristol-city-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/23/bristol-city-manchester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Sergio Agüero guides Manchester City to Wembley despite Bristol City rally","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City remain on course to compete for silverware on four fronts this season and the first of those trophies is now within touching distance. Pep Guardiola’s team will face Arsenal or Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on 25 February after another masterclass from Kevin De Bruyne brought Bristol City’s terrific run to the semi-finals to a memorable end. De Bruyne, who signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract 24 hours before this second leg, scored the winner with the last kick of the game but it was the wonderful assist for Sergio Agüero, four minutes after the interval, that took the breath away on a night when Bristol City refused to go quietly. Lee Johnson’s side contributed to their own downfall by handing Manchester City the lead two minutes before the interval, when Leroy Sané punished a mistake from Hordur Magnusson, and the Championship club could have been forgiven for surrendering when Agüero scored his 23rd goal of the season. Instead, they showed tremendous courage and spirit to claw their way back into the game through Marlon Pack’s towering header and Aden Flint’s injury-time equaliser to spark hopes of an improbable comeback. De Bruyne, however, was not finished for the evening and tapped in a cross from Sané to restore their lead. When the final whistle followed seconds later, applause broke out from three sides of the ground as the Bristol City supporters got to their feet to acknowledge the efforts of a team that eliminated four Premier League clubs en route to the semi-finals, including Manchester United, and pushed Guardiola’s team all the way. “The fact is it’s taken them two injury-time goals in both legs to beat us,” said Johnson, the Bristol City manager. For Guardiola, there was personal satisfaction to be taken from the fact that he will return to Wembley, the stadium where he won the European Cup as a player with Barcelona in 1992, and he expressed his happiness with an “amazing” first-half performance against Bristol City that prevented the home team from feeding off the energy of the raucous home support. As for the idea that the first trophy of his reign is close, Guardiola politely made a point that the process, and not just the end result, should be cherished. “I know we will be judged for the titles, the trophies that we are going to win, but, I’m sorry guys, for the last six months we are so happy,” the Manchester City manager said. “We won a lot of games. Every weekend we were so happy. In the training sessions we were happy and that belonged to us. Nobody can take away what we have done. But, of course, all the teams are judged by the titles they are able to win and we are going to try.” Agüero’s late header in the first leg had shifted the balance of this tie in Manchester City’s favour, especially with away goals counting only after extra time, but the Bristol City supporters had turned up daring to dream and determined to make themselves heard. There was a flag placed on every home fan’s seat and it was quite an atmosphere early on. Manchester City, though, were dominant from the outset. They won a corner within 12 seconds and that set the tone for what followed as Guardiola’s team controlled possession and attacked with intensity. It was relentless at times and on the few occasions that the home team seized the ball, Guardiola’s players pressed aggressively and snapped at their heels to win it back almost immediately. Chances came and went for Manchester City, with the best of them falling to David Silva, whose angled shot was brilliantly turned away by Luke Steele, and it had started to look as though their opponents would get to half-time on level terms. They would have done but for a mix-up in their own area that culminated in Magnusson trying to shepherd the ball out of play. Bernardo Silva picked the left-back’s pocket and the loose ball ran into the path of Sané, whose low shot found the back of the net despite Flint’s best attempts to keep it out. Johnson went for broke and introduced a second striker at the start of the second half but within four minutes of the restart the game appeared over. Sané released De Bruyne in one of those devastating counterattacks that start on the edge of their area and the Belgian showed some dexterous footwork before delivering an inch-perfect pass for Agüero, who took a touch before dispatching a superb shot beyond Steele and into the far corner. Although Guardiola bemoaned the way his players “lost a bit of a control” after that goal, Bristol City deserve credit for their response. Pack, climbing high at the far post, emphatically nodded Jamie Paterson’s cross past Claudio Bravo before Flint tapped in to bring parity in the 94th minute. De Bruyne, fittingly, then had the final word. Guardiola’s response when he was asked how happy he was that the 26-year-old has signed a new contract, said it all. “You cannot imagine,” the Spaniard replied."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/24/elton-john-announces-retirement-touring-final-tour-50-year-career","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:20:10Z","webTitle":"Elton John retires from touring … with 300-date world tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/elton-john-announces-retirement-touring-final-tour-50-year-career","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/24/elton-john-announces-retirement-touring-final-tour-50-year-career","fields":{"headline":"Elton John retires from touring … with 300-date world tour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Elton John has said he will be retiring from touring, 50 years on from the launch of his enormously successful pop career. In an event at New York City’s Gotham Hall on Wednesday, John announced his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour, a three-year, five-continent outing that will feature more than 300 concerts, and will be the last of his career. “It’s time to come off the road so I can fully embrace the next important chapter of my life,” he said. “I need to dedicate more time to raising my children.” The name of the tour takes its inspiration from John’s 1973 album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. On the title track, the singer meditated on fame and celebrity, referring to the music as his “back-to-my-roots” phase: “When are you going to come down? When are you going to land?,” he sings in the first verse. With the unveiling of his final stretch of concerts, the singer seems to have finally answered that question. The tour will begin in Pennsylvania in September 2018, and will visit 10 cities across the UK in 2020. In the gold-leafed grand ballroom of Gotham Hall, once the Greenwich Savings Bank, John’s name and logo – a giant E with a star in lieu of the middle stripe – shone on the granite walls of the atrium. His arrival was preceded by a short introduction by CNN anchorman Anderson Cooper, and then a virtual reality installation that guided audience members through the highlights of his storied career. When the video ended and the headsets were removed, Sir Elton surfaced at his piano and began to play two of his biggest hits, Tiny Dancer and – appropriately – I’m Still Standing. After his performance, John officially announced the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, and addressed speculation that the announcement had anything to do with his health, saying, “if you’re going to do 300 shows, you’re not in ill health.” The reasoning, instead, is that the singer would like to spend more time with his two children. “When I stop, they will be 10 and eight and that’s a very important time in their lives. I don’t want to miss them, and I don’t want them to miss me,” said John, wearing an embellished blazer with the words “Gucci Loves Elton” engraved on the back. The fashion brand, whose creative director Alessandro Michele reminded John of his “dear friend” Gianni Versace, will be designing all of the outfits for the Farewell tour. “It’s going to be the most produced, fantastic show I’ve ever done,” added the singer. “It’s a way of saying thank you and going out with a bang. I don’t want to go out with a whimper.” Speaking to The Guardian after Wednesday’s event, John added that the announcement served as the culmination of discussions he had with partner David Furnish in 2015 about the pair’s children. “We had taken them around everywhere when they were little, because they were very portable,” he said. “But then they weren’t so portable and we had to have a big discussion about what I wanted to do with my life, the children and my career. And I said I’d like to end with a big tour and spend the rest of my life with my children.” John was quick to note, though, that the last leg of his touring career is not meant to signal an end to all creative endeavours. “I’m not stopping music,” he said. “I will hopefully be making more records, writing more music. Mostly I’ll be taking my kids to soccer games. But I’ll be creative, hopefully, until the day I die.” John joked that the day had “been like D-Day, like a military operation,” and added that he’s “not one to do things by half.” In organizing the Farewell tour he and his team encountered logistical issues they hadn’t before, not least because of the geographical scope of the tour. John said that due to school he won’t be taking his two sons to every date, but that he wants to show them Japan and the Far East in particular. John’s announcement comes exactly 50 years after he met longtime songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, who wrote lyrics for Tiny Dancer, Rocket Man, Bennie and the Jets, and Candle in the Wind. The 1997 rerelease of the latter, a tribute to the late Princess Diana, is potentially either the first or second bestselling worldwide single of all time, the uncertainty owing to the dearth of sales information for Bing Crosby’s song White Christmas. On Monday, John appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he received a Crystal award in recognition of his work with the Elton John Aids Foundation, which has raised more than $200m (£140m) since the singer established the charity in 1992. “The world needs to be changed,” John said while accepting his award alongside fellow honourees Cate Blanchett and Shah Rukh Khan. “The inequality in this world is, to be honest with you, disgraceful.” In addition to the announcement of his world tour, John also recently extended his Las Vegas residency The Million Dollar Piano, adding dates at the Colosseum until May 2018, bringing the total number of shows to 207. John’s Caesars Palace residency began in February 2004 with The Red Piano, which lasted for 248 shows until March 2009 and grossed more than $169m. In 2016, John announced that he would be releasing his first autobiography, Crazy Life (written in conjunction with the Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis) in 2019, to be published by Henry Holt in the US and Pan Macmillan in the UK. The singer has hinted at some of the book’s contents, calling it a “no-holds-barred account” of his distinguished half-century in music. In 2014, shortly after the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the UK, he married his longtime partner David Furnish. The pair have two sons, Elijah (five) and Zachary (seven). John is also a godparent to the children of various famous friends, including David and Victoria Beckham, and Yoko Ono and John Lennon. The singer told The Guardian that fans can expect to hear a medley of his greatest hits, but also songs that he hasn’t played live for decades. “For your own sanity you have to play some things you haven’t played for a long time; chestnuts I call them,” John said, referencing the songs Have Mercy on the Criminal, from his 1973 album Don’t Shoot Me, I’m Only the Piano Player, and Street Kids, from Rock of the Westies. “Most people I know that did world tours would come back and do another one,” John said when asked if he’d renege on his curtain call and tour again years from now. “And, really, you’ll have to shoot me...I’ve done 4,000 shows. I’ve been in a van since I was 17.” • This article was amended on 30 January 2018. Have Mercy on the Criminal is on the 1973 album Don’t Shoot Me, I’m Only the Piano Player, not the 1970 album Tumbleweed Connection as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/burgundy-wines-fiona-beckett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T16:00:55Z","webTitle":"Can burgundy on a budget ever hit the spot? | Fiona Beckett on wine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/burgundy-wines-fiona-beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/02/burgundy-wines-fiona-beckett","fields":{"headline":"Can burgundy on a budget ever hit the spot?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Like a first love, the first wine you fall for stays with you for ever. For me, like many other wine writers, it was great burgundy, which is unfortunately a taste that’s impossible to indulge on anything other than a City boy’s salary. That situation has been exacerbated by the fact that burgundy has been having a torrid time of late. Thanks – or, rather, no thanks – to the region having been hit by hailstorms and frost over the last couple of vintages, volumes of the top wines are down and prices inevitably up (and not helped by our current exchange rate – thanks, Theresa). The picture is not quite as bad as it’s sometimes made out to be, however. Take chablis, for example. It may have suffered losses, but there’s still a heck of a lot of it about. Prices may have inched up, but as a staple of supermarket own-label ranges, there are always going to be discounts and bottles to be had for less than a tenner (hello, Aldi’s Jean Bouchard Chablis 2015 at £9.99; 12.5% abv). Even so, it’s worth paying a bit more for one that’s made from old vines – and it’ll still cost a great deal less than you’d pay in a restaurant. On the face of it, Mâcon Villages from the south of the region is a far better bet, but for me it generally fails to hit the spot. If you dream of that seductively creamy style with a whiff of struck match (is that nice? Yes, weirdly it is), Mâcon, with its riper, slightly blowsier fruit and heavy, buttery style, doesn’t quite deliver. If you can’t afford Meursault, Puligny-Montrachet or anything else with Montrachet on the label, look for appellations such as Saint-Romain and Saint-Aubin; I occasionally treat myself to The Wine Society’s Exhibition Saint-Aubin Blanc (the 13.5% abv 2015 is £16). Good red burgundy is, if anything, even more elusive. There’s nowhere to go (other than the many excellent pinot vineyards outside Burgundy) if you can’t afford the likes of Vosne-Romanée and Chambolle-Musigny, while well-known appellations such as Nuits-Saint-Georges and Gevry-Chambertin can be maddeningly inconsistent. Simple, youthful bourgogne rouge can be charming, but most red burgundy needs a good few years to reveal itself at its best. Again, lesser appellations (Mercurey and Santenay, for example) can be rewarding, but they won’t take you to the stars. All the burgundy lover can do is look out for bin ends and bargains where you can find them. And that means making friends with your local wine merchant. Jean Loron La Crochette Mâcon-Villages 2015, £12.60 Tanners; 13% abv I’m not usually a big mâcon fan, but this 2015 has real finesse and elegance. Think lemon sole fried in butter. Domaine de la Motte Chablis Cuvée Vieilles Vignes 2014 Famille Michaud, £12.99 at D Byrne &amp; Co, Clitheroe, on offer at £13.99 Rannoch Scott; 12% abv Classic chablis: clean, pure and mineral. Just lovely. Perfect for shellfish, particularly oysters. Wm Morrison Red Burgundy, £8; 12.5% abv The sort of basic bourgogne rouge you come across in a Parisian wine bar. Deliciously light and fresh with delicate raspberry fruit. Perfect with a plate of charcuterie. Château de Chamilly Mercurey Clos la Perrière 2015 £27 (£162 for a six-bottle case) strictlywine.co.uk; 13% abv Massively gratifying, opulent, sweet-fruited pinot from a lesser appellation that should drink well for another two to three years at least.

Simon Dudley, the council’s Conservative leader, was widely criticised for asking Thames Valley police to take action against “aggressive begging and intimidation” and “bags and detritus” in the street. Dudley survived a no-confidence vote held by the local authority’s Conservatives on Monday evening, which prompted the resignations of the Tory councillors Paul Brimacombe and Asghar Majeed. The opposition group in the Tory-controlled council is expected to hold a no-confidence vote on 29 January. “Immediately following the announcement of the result of the no-confidence vote, Councillor Majeed and Councillor Brimacombe resigned from the Conservative group and departed the meeting,” the remaining Tory councillors said in a joint statement. “It was not considered appropriate by them to wholeheartedly disagree with the will of the group on this fundamental issue and yet to remain within the group. With the departure of the last of the few dissenting voices within the Conservative group, possibly an even more cohesive and purposeful Conservative group will emerge. “Councillors Majeed and Brimacombe will continue to represent the residents of Oldfield and Cox Green respectively as independent Conservative councillors, with the same core values upon which they were elected.” More than 270,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to Dudley’s letter to the police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, in which he claimed the council had evidence that homelessness was “a voluntary choice” for some people in the borough. “A large number of adults that are begging in Windsor are not in fact homeless, and if they are homeless they are choosing to reject all support services,” he wrote. The council leader has since apologised for the comments he made in the letter, insisting that he was not referring to genuine homeless people, and said he lamented the reference to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on 19 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/23/sam-curran-england-chris-woakes-odi-whitewash-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T22:00:13Z","webTitle":"Sam Curran gets England T20 call as Chris Woakes calls for ODI whitewash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/sam-curran-england-chris-woakes-odi-whitewash-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/23/sam-curran-england-chris-woakes-odi-whitewash-australia","fields":{"headline":"Sam Curran gets England T20 call as Chris Woakes calls for ODI whitewash","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sam Curran has been added to England’s Twenty20 squad for the tri-series with Australia and New Zealand. The 19-year-old Surrey all-rounder has been drafted in owing to the continued uncertainty around Ben Stokes’ availability and the fact Joe Root will take a break. Stokes, who was set to come out for the New Zealand leg of the series, is due to appear in court on an affray charge on 13 February. That date clashes with England’s game against New Zealand in Wellington which the England and Wales Cricket Board had earmarked for the 26-year-old’s international comeback. Stokes confirmed via Twitter on Monday he will not meet up with the squad until after his hearing: “As has been confirmed in the media a first hearing date at court has been set for 13th February. In the circumstances, I have decided it would not be right to join my team-mates until after attending court.” He remains part of the squad for the five ODIs and two Tests against New Zealand. It is Curran’s maiden international callup. A left-arm seamer and left-handed batsman, he has spent the winter in New Zealand, playing for the Auckland Aces in the domestic Super Smash T20 competition. Across nine matches, he scored 157 runs and took nine wickets, fulfilling his usual role at Surrey of batting in the middle order and opening the bowling. He will join his brother, Tom, when he meets up with the squad in Perth this week. Chris Woakes has said England are desperate to win the ODI series 5-0. Victory in the third ODI at Sydney by 16 runs gave the tourists their first bilateral ODI series win in Australia. Now, 3-0 up with two to play, Trevor Bayliss and Eoin Morgan have urged the team to push for a whitewash. “You don’t come out to Australia and win too often,” Woakes said. “Once you’ve got your foot on the throat you want to keep it down. Losing the Ashes was really disappointing but to make it 5-0 in the ODIs would be an incredible achievement. “Both Trevor and Morgy mentioned it. We had discussions in the changing room, praising performances. But the end of the chat was making sure we’re on it and don’t let up. It has been a long tour for a few guys in the dressing room and we’ll be making sure we do what we can to make it 5-0. “If the roles were reversed, Australia would be doing exactly the same. They’d be trying to make sure it was 5-0 and they’d be making it as uncomfortable for us as possible. This is international cricket and you have to be ruthless. If we want to improve and get to the 2019 World Cup in the best possible shape, we need to make sure when we’re on top, we stay on top.” To achieve that England will need to crash Friday’s Australia Day festivities in Adelaide. The hosts have won seven of nine ODIs against England at the venue. The opportunity to play party poopers is one Woakes is keen to embrace for the fourth ODI. “That is a huge motivation. We’ll be trying to go out there on Australia Day and turn them over. To do that their own backyard is a very difficult thing to do. We want to make sure we do win 5-0.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/23/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-aymeric-laporte-fred","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T18:25:19Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola looking at Aymeric Laporte and Fred","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/23/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-aymeric-laporte-fred","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/23/manchester-city-pep-guardiola-aymeric-laporte-fred","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola looking at Aymeric Laporte and Fred","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City are weighing up approaches for Aymeric Laporte of Athletic Bilbao and Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Fred as Pep Guardiola seeks to strengthen his squad before the end of the January transfer window. Having seen primary target Alexis Sánchez join Manchester United on Monday, Guardiola is determined to bring in new faces before the end of the month and has opted to make a renewed attempt to secure Laporte after the French defender decided against a move to the Etihad Stadium in June 2016. The 23-year-old signed a four-year contract containing a release clause of €65m for two seasons, which is now believed to have risen to €70m (£61.5m) but that has not put off City from contacting his agents – former Spain internationals Carles Puyol and Iván de la Peña – this week to discuss a potential transfer. Guardiola is keen to provide cover for his defence as doubts over Vincent Kompany’s fitness persist, with West Brom’s Jonny Evans and Iñigo Martínez of Real Sociedad also under consideration. But it is understood City would prefer to sign Laporte, who has yet to win a full cap for France but has made almost 200 appearances for Bilbao since making his debut in 2012. He is predominantly left footed – a trait that Guardiola is believed to have prioritised – and has been earmarked as a long-term partner in central defence for John Stones while also being able to fill in at left-back. City have also opened negotiations with Shakhtar over a move for Fred, with the Ukrainian champions indicating they would be willing to sell the 24-year-old for €40m (£35m). Predominantly a defensive midfielder who can also play at left-back, Fred signed a five-year contract this month but is believed to be open to a move to the Premier League either this month or at the end of the season. City retain an interest in Nice’s Jean Michaël Seri, who has also been identified as a target for United, and Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Weigl although it now appears more likely that Fred could be the long-term replacement for Fernandinho as more meetings with his agent, Kia Joorabchian, are planned for this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/24/shirley-scott-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T15:04:47Z","webTitle":"Shirley Scott obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/24/shirley-scott-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/24/shirley-scott-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Shirley Scott obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My wife, Shirley Scott, who has died from cancer aged 68, committed her life to the management of charities. As Official Custodian for Charities and then as chief executive of the Charity Finance Directors’ Group (CFDG) she played key roles in shaping the financial management structures of modern organisations. Shirley was born in Bedford to Kenneth, a civil servant who had been a radio operator during the second world war, and Mary Mould (nee Holmes), who had worked as a typesetter before marrying. When Shirley was young the family moved to Sidcup, where Shirley was educated at Chislehurst and Sidcup girls’ high school. She left at the age of 16 to do a course in remedial gymnastics but this proved dissatisfying and a holiday job at the Charity Commission led to a change of direction and new career. By 1988 she had risen to the senior ranks of the commission and had been involved in its introduction of IT. She was appointed Official Custodian, managing £1.25bn of investments for 40,000 charities. The Woodfield Report which came out in the same year had recommended sweeping changes to the commission and Shirley then took on responsibility under the 1991 Charities Act of divesting those funds to the charities that owned them. Following divestment, she was persuaded to apply for the role as the first chief executive of CFDG, which she started in 1994. She ensured that it became expert on charity finance, consulted by the sector and government. She supported the introduction of new accounting standards in 1995, 2000 and 2005. Under her leadership the membership grew from 280 to over 1,000 and the staff from two to 10. After 11 years Shirley decided to reduce her workload and she took on roles helping smaller charities with governance. Her final staff role was as clerk to the Richard Reeve’s Foundation, a longstanding charity providing educational support to residents of the City of London and Camden. She stood down in 2014 when she was diagnosed with cancer. Wildlife, particularly birding, dominated her social life, along with a love of cricket and rugby. She volunteered for 15 years at Birdfair and was a trustee of Surrey Wildlife Trust and the Shepperton local history society. Shirley made friends wherever she went. She is survived by me, and many nephews, nieces and cousins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/23/que-sera-sera-hunts-brexit-complacency-strikes-fear-into-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T18:59:17Z","webTitle":"Que sera, sera, Hunt's Brexit complacency strikes fear into committee | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/23/que-sera-sera-hunts-brexit-complacency-strikes-fear-into-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/23/que-sera-sera-hunts-brexit-complacency-strikes-fear-into-committee","fields":{"headline":"Que sera, sera: Hunt's Brexit complacency strikes fear into committee","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I’m Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary.” Hunt said by way of introduction. Before pausing and correcting himself. “I’m Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary.” It was an easy mistake to make. Since Christmas, several cabinet ministers have been more interested in doing any job other than the one the prime minister wanted them to do – and it’s been hard to keep track of who’s doing what. Michael Gove has been bidding to take over the Ministry of Justice and any other post that’s going begging. Boris Johnson has had his eyes on Hunt’s department by calling for a Brexit bonus for the NHS to make it look as if he isn’t the liar everyone believes him to be. And Hunt himself firmly resisted all attempts to move him on to the Department for Work and Pensions and ended his audience with the prime minister by expanding his empire. Even Theresa May doesn’t appear that interested in doing her own job. Though in her case that’s more a reflection of her lack of self-belief. Hunt was appearing before the health select committee to give evidence on the impact of Brexit, but he was happy to let his wingman, the agreeably nice but dim parliamentary under-secretary of state Lord O’Shaughnessy, take the brunt of the early exchanges. What contingency plans was the department making to maintain the supply of medical supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, asked the committee chair, Sarah Wollaston. “We are planning for a deep and special partnership with the EU post-Brexit,” O’Shaughnessy said confidently. Wollaston gently pointed out that wasn’t what she had asked. O’Shaughnessy once again replied that everything was going to be fine so there was no need to worry about contingency plans. But were there any contingency plans? Yes, said O’Shaughnessy. Though he couldn’t say what they were, mainly because they were so top secret not even he and the health secretary had been allowed to see them. But they were good plans. The best plans ever. “So are we any further down the road than we were in November?” asked Labour’s Ben Bradshaw, peevishly. Yes, we were now in January. So we were two months further down the road. If no wiser. At this point the committee sensibly gave up talking to O’Shaughnessy and moved on to Hunt. Though with no greater end results. In his five years as health secretary, the only thing Hunt appears to have learned is how to give a passable imitation of a GP who has been struck off. “Let me put your mind at rest,” said Hunt, before going on to strike fear in every member of the committee with his complacency. Everything was going to be fine because everything was going to be fine. Trust me, I’m a doctor. He was sorry that the committee hadn’t been able to find anything about Brexit in his departmental plan but he was sure there was a footnote in there somewhere. He was sorry that everyone else in the health sector the committee had spoken to about Brexit was in a state of near panic and wanted to stay in the single market, but he was totally chilled. Que sera, sera. If the government got a transitional deal, all would be well but if not, something would turn up. In any case, people got far too worked up about fatal diseases. And there was no need to worry about Brits getting their medicines more slowly after Brexit because we were already getting them far more slowly than other EU countries anyway. Brilliant. By the end, the health secretary was telling the committee anything he thought it wanted to hear. Just to get them off his back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/23/oscar-nominations-2018-shape-water-metoo","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T19:27:07Z","webTitle":"Oscar nods pour in for The Shape of Water in year coloured by #MeToo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/23/oscar-nominations-2018-shape-water-metoo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/23/oscar-nominations-2018-shape-water-metoo","fields":{"headline":"Oscar nods pour in for The Shape of Water in year coloured by #MeToo","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Shape of Water, a romantic fable about a janitor who falls in love with a sea creature, has won 13 Oscar nominations, leading a field of films with an unexpectedly strong British showing. Guillermo del Toro’s cold war-era fantasy was nominated for best picture, best director and best actress for Sally Hawkins, who plays the mute cleaner, as well as in 10 other categories, part of a bumper haul on Tuesday just one nomination shy of the record for the most in Academy Awards history. Christopher Nolan’s second world war epic Dunkirk followed with eight nominations, including best picture and director. Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri got seven, including best picture and best actress for Frances McDormand, who plays a mother seeking justice for her murdered daughter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the results, based on the votes of 8,400 members, in an elaborate ceremony in Los Angeles which set the stage for the 90th Academy Awards’ full red carpet pomp on 4 March. Nine films were nominated for best picture, with Call Me By Your Name, Lady Bird, Darkest Hour, Get Out, Phantom Thread and The Post completing the list. Gary Oldman was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, confirming his status as frontrunner. He will face competition from his fellow Brit Daniel Day-Lewis, who plays a dressmaker in Phantom Thread, a drama set in London’s 1950s couture world written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Daniel Kaluuya, another Brit, was nominated for his turn in Get Out, a horror-satire about race in America. They will vie for a statuette against Timothée Chalamet, who stars in the gay coming of age story Call Me By Your Name, and Denzel Washington, who was praised for his performance in the otherwise largely unloved legal drama Roman J Israel, Esq. James Franco had been tipped for a nomination after picking up a Golden Globe for his performance in The Disaster Artist but was locked out, prompting debate over whether it was due to allegations of sexual misconduct, which flared just before voting closed, or the Academy’s coolness towards comedies. The #MeToo movement of feminist activism against sexual misconduct in Hollywood will colour this year’s Oscars, as it did the Globes and other awards. The producer Harvey Weinstein used to dominate Oscar campaigning but the Academy expelled him last October amid allegations of serial predatory behaviour, including rape. Award contenders have pitched their films as riding current cultural waves. Three Billboards: a woman confronting male authority to exact justice for a raped, murdered daughter. The Post: a newspaper publisher played by Meryl Streep – who bagged her 21st Oscar nomination – defending press freedom against an abusive president. “Hollywood has turned over the Oscars to the independent world with its myriad social issues,” said Richard Rushfield, who publishes a trade newsletter, The Ankler. “It’s much more attuned to the issues of the moment. Whether that speaks to mass audiences worldwide or to a highly sensitive cultural niche is another question.” Lady Bird, about a mother-daughter relationship, has benefitted from its female focus, bagging nominations for its stars Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf and director Greta Gerwig, said Sasha Stone, who runs the site Awards Daily. “The mood is pushing Lady Bird higher than it normally would.” Gerwig said in a statement: “This is an unbelievable honor and I am beside myself with joy and gratitude. I couldn’t be prouder of my brilliant women who led the cast.” Stone attributed the unexpectedly strong showing of Darkest Hour, with seven nominations, and other results to the Academy’s British voting bloc, who also are Bafta members. “They’re very influential – they are a strong and powerful group.” After the #OscarsSoWhite controversies of 2015 and 2016 the Academy accelerated recruitment of younger, more diverse members. It remains 72% male and 87% white but will probably avoid controversy this time. Jordan Peele was nominated for directing Get Out and the race drama Mudbound was nominated in the cinematography, adapted screenplay and original song categories. It missed bigger categories but analysts attributed that to Oscar voters’ sniffiness about the film’s television-focused distributor, Netflix. The Shape of Water leads the pack but Three Billboards has momentum after sweeping the Globes and other awards. However, McDonagh, its British writer-director, missed out on a directing nomination, which could impede its chances of taking best picture. “I’m thrilled that our film has received seven nominations from the Academy, and that the beautiful work of our editor Jon Gregory, our composer Carter Burwell, my gentle brothers-in-arms Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, and our fearless leader Frances McDormand, have all been recognised so wonderfully,” McDonagh said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/25/nicholas-hytner-on-julius-caesar-shakespeare","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T14:57:32Z","webTitle":"Nicholas Hytner on Julius Caesar: 'I've staged many plays but never one that warns of such a terrible future'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/25/nicholas-hytner-on-julius-caesar-shakespeare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/25/nicholas-hytner-on-julius-caesar-shakespeare","fields":{"headline":"Nicholas Hytner on Julius Caesar: 'I've staged many plays but never one that warns of such a terrible future'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The leaders of the metropolitan elite are terrified that the state could slide at any moment into tyranny. They’re convinced that they’re working for the common good, but they’re equally concerned for their own position in a system that works well for them. Many of them went to school together. Their privilege comes with their class and education. So they decide to get rid of the tyrant before he gets the chance to abuse his power any further. They suppose the streets will echo to the cry of freedom. They have no doubt that the people will share their fear for the future. But their arrogance is their undoing. Their remoteness from the street blinds them to the fragility of their grip on popular opinion. The liberal establishment is trounced by a demagogue who appeals to the gut, and tells the stories the mob wants to hear. The masses turn on the liberals. The tyrant is replaced by another, younger and more ruthless. Once the body politic is infected with the virus of authoritarianism, it can’t be eradicated. This is the story of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. No wonder every theatre company here and in the United States seems to be doing it. “Rome’s leader, Julius Caesar, is a force unlike any the city has seen,” said New York’s Public theatre when it announced its production last summer. “Magnetic, populist, irreverent, he seems bent on absolute power. A small band of patriots, devoted to the country’s democratic traditions, must decide how to oppose him.” And they went for it. Caesar had bouffant blond hair, and a red tie that hung pendulously below his waist. In a borough that voted nine to one against Donald Trump, the director Oskar Eustis delivered a sensational commentary on the state of the nation, though outraged Trumpists who hadn’t seen it (neither, to be honest, did I) bullied the Public theatre’s commercial sponsors into withdrawing their support. It’s hard to imagine better evidence of Shakespeare’s continued pugnacity as an analyst of contemporary politics. Shakespeare’s plays change with every new company of actors, and with every new audience. A leader bent on absolute power may be of less immediate concern in London than in New York, and I can’t see quite as much of Trump in Caesar as the Public theatre did. I hope Julius Caesar will work on the Bridge theatre audience in 2018 as it may have done at the Globe in 1599. Shakespeare’s dramatisations of the past were all permeated by current concerns. He used history as a way of exploring dangerous subject matter that would have had him thrown in jail if he’d gone at it directly. The vigour of the argument in favour of Caesar’s murder was no small achievement for a playwright who was subject to a monarch who had herself survived countless assassination attempts. The Elizabethan authorities may have decided that the disastrous consequences of the assassination were warning enough for anyone who might still have had designs on the life of the ageing queen. And the play takes Caesar’s mighty past for granted (the conquest of Gaul trumps a string of failed casinos in Atlantic City), though it loses no opportunity to draw attention to his current decrepitude: he’s deaf in one ear, epileptic and wanders around in his night clothes worrying about his wife’s dreams. But Julius Caesar is not, as it’s title suggests, about the tragic fall of a great man. It is rather a tragedy of irreconcilable opposites, maybe the first of its kind in English. You can’t leave this potential tyrant where he is, the play seems to say, but if you get rid of him, “there will a worse come in his place”. Action is inherently tragic, its results uncontrollable. Which is maybe where the play reverberates here and now, as a clamorous premonition of our own destiny, in a Rome of the contemporary European imagination. In New York, faced with a Trump presidency, you can see how necessary it must have been to give Brutus, Cassius and their “small band of patriots” custody of “the country’s democratic traditions”. In London, I wonder whether the Bridge theatre audience will be ready to see in them an unequivocal endorsement of liberal presumptions. Cassius (Michelle Fairley) is clear-eyed about the threat of “this age’s yoke”, eloquent in her defence of the status quo, and astute enough to know that any move against Caesar’s populist insurgency needs as its leader a politician with a popular following of his own. Which is why she turns to Brutus (Ben Whishaw), a man of famous intelligence, who “sits high in all the people’s hearts”. He is from a family renowned for its courage and integrity, and he thinks hard before he acts. He’s the antithesis of the blowhards who threaten the end of the liberal order. You’d think nothing could go wrong for him. And he has such confidence in his own decency that he too thinks it will be plain sailing once the logic behind the removal of Caesar (David Calder) is explained to the people. He assures Mark Antony, over Caesar’s corpse, that the reasons for killing Caesar are “so full of good regard that were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, you should be satisfied”. He privately dismisses Antony as a sports-mad party animal; and he’s almost as censorious of his own associates if they disagree with him. “I am armed so strong in honesty,” he says, that criticism passes by him “as the idle wind”. But he entirely misjudges the opposition. He assumes that he has only to lay out the facts; and after Caesar’s murder he goes public with a well-constructed argument in its defence. But despite the warnings of his colleagues, he trusts the people to listen to a plurality of opinion. He lets Mark Antony speak the eulogy at Caesar’s funeral. It isn’t hard to recognise in Mark Antony (David Morrissey) the silver-tongued cynic whose relish for “domestic fury and fierce civil strife”, for “blood and destruction”, has echoed through recent European history. He is a tremendous player of the crowd, and a fabulous storyteller, though he pretends otherwise. “I am no orator,” he says, “but, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man.” Nevertheless, he describes Caesar’s murder in gripping, gory detail, though he doesn’t let on that he wasn’t there to witness it. His absence doesn’t stop him displaying the clothes Caesar was wearing when he died, and riffing on which assassin was responsible for each bloody rip in them. He produces Caesar’s will and promises every Roman a hand-out of 75 drachmas. Job done, he later conspires to change the will: he has a civil war to finance. So much for the suckers who cheered for him. If you come to see the play at the Bridge, you can choose to be one of those suckers: we’ve taken the seats out of the stalls so you can stand and be part of the crowd. You can also sit in comfort and watch what’s done to the crowd. You may seethe with rage at the lies they’re told; you may thrill to them. Either way, I hope there will be no way of avoiding the gulf between Roman and Roman. Over the years, I’ve staged plays by Shakespeare that seemed to speak about the Iraq war, the 2008 financial crisis, and the power of the surveillance state, among many other contemporary preoccupations. I’ve never before staged a play that has said so much about our present, or warned of such a terrible future. It addresses directly the failure of dismayed liberals (count me as one of them) to understand and overcome the appeal of populism. It exposes the manipulative half-truths and outright falsehoods that are the populists’ stock in trade. It is unsentimental about the gullibility of the multitude: if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, says one of the establishment, they would have forgiven him. Seventy-five drachmas, £350 million per week, whatever it takes. In Julius Caesar, once the populist genie is out of the bottle, there is nothing to stop the slide into violence, and a contemporary Julius Caesar does not need to travel far to suggest civil war on the streets of a great city. We may hope to avoid that dystopia in London, but the tragic destiny of a society that has succumbed to mutual incomprehension and loathing may be harder to escape. • Julius Caesar is at the Bridge theatre, London SE1, until 15 April. bridgetheatre.co.uk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/24/surgeon-captain-rick-jolly-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:12:49Z","webTitle":"Surgeon Captain Rick Jolly obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/surgeon-captain-rick-jolly-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/surgeon-captain-rick-jolly-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Surgeon Captain Rick Jolly obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rick Jolly, who has died aged 71 of complications from a heart condition, was the only serviceman in the Falklands war of 1982 to be honoured by both the British and Argentinian sides. The awards were in recognition of his achievements in managing three frontline field hospitals in which more than 1,000 casualties – among them around 300 Argentinian soldiers and airmen – were successfully treated, and in later years in fostering a bold and imaginative spirit of reconciliation between the once warring armies. In the wake of the conflict, which was triggered by the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, Jolly was appointed OBE, then in 1999, he stood in Buenos Aires in front of more than 50 Argentinian veterans, on some of whom he had personally operated, to receive one of the country’s highest honours, the Orden de Mayo. He told his audience that they had not been cared for because of some military command or international convention but “because we were human beings who respected life”. Jolly was the senior medical officer of 3 Commando Brigade, the force of around 5,500 Royal Marines and paratroopers dispatched on the commandeered cruise liner SS Canberra to liberate the Falklands in April 1982. His plan to use Canberra as a floating field hospital was abandoned after it became clear that the ship’s vulnerability to air attacks meant that it needed to be kept 200 miles out at sea. So Jolly was instructed, at 90 minutes’ notice, to set up his first field hospital in a single-storey, derelict meat- processing plant at Ajax Bay, one of the three British landing sites on the western coast of East Falkland. Here, in an atmosphere of cheerful squalor, Jolly and his team of 120 doctors, nurses and medical assistants carried out more than 200 major operations on casualties from both sides through the three weeks of the intense and violent conflict, often working through the night in freezing surroundings, lit only by torchlight. Because of the proximity of a British ammunition dump, they were not allowed to display a red cross on the building, in accordance with Geneva conventions, and an Argentinian Skyhawk hit the plant with two bombs, which remained unexploded in the roof throughout the campaign. As the British advanced across East Falkland towards the capital, Stanley, Jolly’s team established smaller medical stations at Teal Inlet, to the north, and Fitzroy, to the south. In all, more than 650 combat casualties from both sides passed through their hands; only three men died of their wounds. The “Red and Green Life Machine”, as Jolly nicknamed the Ajax Bay facility, was also close to the satellite communications terminal, which beamed messages back to London. It thus provided a safe haven for this correspondent to write his weekly dispatch. From the beginning, Jolly played a central role in the development of the Falklands campaign. He was one of the seven-man team that flew secretly to Gibraltar within hours of the Argentinian invasion to assess how the Canberra might be adapted to fit military assets, such as a helicopter landing pad and gun emplacements. Later, as the cruise liner sailed south, he organised first aid classes for the marines and paratroopers (and journalists) on board, though his enthusiasm for illuminating his presentations with gory slides depicting mutilations and war wounds was not to everybody’s taste. A large, jovial, extrovert figure, Jolly did not lack personal courage. As a young medical officer attached to 42 Commando in Belfast in 1972, he had insisted on going out on street patrols to be on hand if casualties occurred. Likewise, in the Falklands, as Argentinian jets pounded the British taskforce in the battle for San Carlos Water, he set out in a Wessex helicopter to bring back injured sailors from the damaged frigate, HMS Argonaut. Skimming low across the water, he spotted three survivors of the burning hulk of another frigate, HMS Ardent, one in danger of drowning because his life jacket had been holed. Despite not wearing an immersion suit, Jolly insisted on being winched down 20ft to pluck the men to safety from the freezing water. Later that day, he flew three young Argentinian conscripts back to the Canberra for treatment for gunshot wounds; like many of their comrades in the weeks ahead, the men expected to be tortured, and found it difficult to accept that they were being cared for with the same dedication as their foes. Jolly retired from the navy in 1996. That year, with a former paratrooper, Denzil Connick, he co-founded the Falkands’ veterans’ group SAMA, the South Atlantic Medal Association, and launched a campaign of lectures and interviews to highlight the problems of post-traumatic stress disorder among Falklands survivors. He also took up a defence fellowship at University College London to study the effects of biological and chemical warfare on ships’ crews. Two years later, Jolly wrote to the Foreign Office suggesting a meeting with the Argentinian president, Carlos Menem, who was about to visit London with a delegation that included five Falklands veterans. It turned out to be the breakthrough he had dreamed of: away from the formalities of a state reception, he and the SAMA team took their Argentinian counterparts for a slap-up meal at a South American restaurant in Chelsea, and lifelong contacts were established. The following year, Jolly accompanied the Prince of Wales on an official visit to Argentina, taking with him a list of 79 Argentinian wounded who had been operated on at Ajax Bay. Jolly’s devotion to the welfare of Falklands veterans – of both sides – never faltered. In 2002 he led a group of 250 former British personnel on a visit to the islands to mark the 20th anniversary of the conflict. Five years later, he stood outside the Imperial War Museum in London to welcome former Argentinian pilots arriving for the opening of a major exhibition on the history of the war. As the then commander of 3 Commando Brigade, now Major-General Julian Thompson, who masterminded the land campaign, wrote in his memoir, No Picnic, Jolly was “a man who found his moment in the Falklands campaign”. Richard Tadeusz Jolly was born in Hong Kong, the son of a Polish gunner held as a prisoner of war by the Japanese for five years; his mother was an ambulance driver. He was educated at Stonyhurst college, Lancashire, and studied medicine at St Bartholomew’s hospital, London, qualifying as a doctor in 1969. He joined the Royal Navy on a five-year short commission, and completed the gruelling Royal Marine commando course in 1972. After serving with 42 Commando in Belfast, he completed two tours with the Fleet Air Arm and as medical officer at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. After a short break in service in the late 1970s, he took command of the Royal Marine Medical Squadron in 1980. His bestselling account of the South Atlantic conflict, The Red and Green Life Machine: A Diary of the Falklands Field Hospital, was published in 1983; it has been reprinted several times as Doctor for Friend and Foe. His other books included Jackspeak: A Guide to British Naval Slang and Usage (1989) and For Campaign Service (1979), a novel about British service personnel in Northern Ireland, written under the pseudonym Christopher Hawke. Jolly is survived by his wife, Susie (nee Matthews), a former children’s nurse, whom he married in 1970. Their son, James, predeceased him. • Richard “Rick” Tadeusz Jolly, naval doctor, born 29 October 1946; died 13 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/24/far-right-german-politician-converts-islam-alternative-fur-deutschland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T16:45:54Z","webTitle":"Far-right German politician converts to Islam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/far-right-german-politician-converts-islam-alternative-fur-deutschland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/24/far-right-german-politician-converts-islam-alternative-fur-deutschland","fields":{"headline":"Far-right German politician converts to Islam","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A politician for Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, which campaigns on an anti-Muslim ticket, has converted to Islam and left the party, a spokesman has confirmed. Arthur Wagner, a leading member of the party in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, said he would not comment on his reason for leaving the party, but confirmed to a Berlin daily that he had converted to Islam and that he had renounced his party membership on 11 January. “It is a private matter,” he told Der Tagesspiegel, adding that it had been his decision to leave. A party spokesman said it had not been concerned by Wagner’s conversion, and also confirmed it had not pushed him to leave. It claimed it had not known of his move when he announced his departure. “The party has no problem with it,” said Daniel Friese, a spokesman for the Brandenburg branch of the AfD. Being a Muslim was no barrier to being a member of the party, he said, despite the fact that among the party’s campaign slogans before September’s general election were “Islam has no place in Germany” and “Against the Islamisation of Germany”. The party has been accused of stoking resentment towards the hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees living in Germany. “The AfD contains interest groups for Muslims, Christians and homosexuals,” Friese said. Wagner, who formerly belonged to the Christian Democrats and joined the AfD in 2015, is an active member of the German-Russian community and the vice-chair of the regional Russian-German committee. He has also acted as a translator for refugees from Chechnya. He is believed to be the first AfD member to have converted to Islam after joining the party, although the party spokesman said there were other Muslims within its ranks. The AfD was voted into the Bundestag for the first time last September as the third largest party. If talks towards forming a grand coalition government between Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance and the Social Democrats are successful, the AfD would become the main opposition party in the Bundestag, with the right to speak second in debates, after a member of the government. Wagner’s case, although considered highly unusual, was being compared by German media to that of Arnoud van Doorn, a member of the Freedom party of the Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders, who was asked to leave the party in 2013 when it emerged he had converted to Islam and travelled to Saudi Arabia to perform the hajj."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/26/trump-accused-abortion-block-women-aclu","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"'Blatant and brazen' Trump accused of blocking abortions for undocumented women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/26/trump-accused-abortion-block-women-aclu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/26/trump-accused-abortion-block-women-aclu","fields":{"headline":"'Blatant and brazen' Trump accused of blocking abortions for undocumented women","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Trump administration is engaging in the most flagrant violation yet seen of the constitutional right to an abortion by preventing undocumented women held in detention centers from seeking medical treatment, constitutional lawyers have warned. On this week’s 45th anniversary of supreme court’s landmark Roe v Wade ruling, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have accused Trump-appointed officials of in effect holding pregnant women hostage in order to stop them reaching abortion clinics. Four cases in which women have been blocked have so far been confirmed, provoking a flurry of legal challenges, while the total number denied their constitutional rights could be much higher. “I’ve never seen anything quite as blatant and brazen as this,” said the ACLU’s senior staff attorney Brigitte Amiri. “We are celebrating the 45th anniversary of Roe v Wade, which clearly states that the government cannot ban abortion, yet this is precisely what the Trump administration is doing to these women.” Amiri added: “It’s shocking. The government is physically holding these women hostage for the purpose of preventing them having abortions.” The new policy was introduced in March 2017 – two months after Trump’s inauguration – in the Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR, a federal agencyresponsible for the custody of about 5,000 unaccompanied children who enter the US illegally. The undocumented minors are among the most vulnerable people in the country, many having fled abuse; some are found to be pregnant on arrival as a result of rape. The rule change was the brainchild of Trump’s appointee as director of the ORR, Scott Lloyd. His selection to lead such a sensitive outpost of the federal government raised eyebrows as Lloyd had virtually no experience working with refugees or children. He did, however, have a long track record within the anti-abortion movement. Before joining the Trump administration he worked for Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal society that has for years funded attempts to criminalize abortion. As BuzzFeed noted, in 2011 Lloyd wrote an article in which he argued that women should be forced to notify the biological father “of their decision to abort, and gain their consent”. The rule change, set out in an email from Lloyd, instructed custodial centers to stop taking “any action that facilitates” access to an abortion. Women would be redirected to “counseling centers” where they would be given ultrasounds of their fetuses and advice on alternatives to terminating the pregnancy. The Center for Investigative Reporting later revealed that the list of approved counseling centers was compiled by an anti-abortion group, Heartbeat, that strives to make abortion “unwanted today and unthinkable for future generations”. ‘The attempts at coercion are mind-boggling’ Court disclosures show that Lloyd personally flew from Washington to San Antonio, Texas, to apply pressure on a pregnant woman who was asking for an abortion; after his visit she dropped the request. He is also known to have talked on the phone with at least one other woman in ORR’s custody who was seeking an abortion. Another woman was forced to go to the ER after she had taken an abortion pill to try to stop the termination mid-process. “The coercion is mind-boggling – Scott Lloyd is the government official who holds these women’s immigration status in his hands, and here he is talking to them about their pregnancy,” Amiri said. The ACLU has taken the ORR and Lloyd to court on four separate occasions in which undocumented teens – known anonymously as Jane Doe, Jane Roe, Jane Poe and Jane Moe – were barred from seeking terminations. In the first case, the shelter holding Jane Doe, aged 17, was forbidden by the new leadership of ORR from allowing her out of the facility to attend an abortion clinic. Court documents show that the shelter was told it would lose its government grant if it let her leave the premises. It is not known what happened in the most recent case of Jane Moe, who has been released into the care of a sponsor. In the first three cases, federal courts overruled the ORR and allowed the women to go ahead with ending their pregnancies. Lloyd has now petitioned the US supreme court for a review of the decision to let Jane Doe have an abortion. He has also asked the country’s highest court to punish the ACLU lawyers involved in the case for alleged misconduct, on grounds that they assisted her in carrying out the termination quickly, despite the fact that she was acting entirely within her legal rights. The most startling aspect of Lloyd’s conduct has been a memo he wrote in the case of the third woman, Jane Poe, an teenage immigrant who was pregnant as a result of a rape in her native country and who had threatened to harm herself unless she were allowed to end the pregnancy. In the memo, which was disclosed to the Washington district court that is hearing the ACLU’s request for a class action lawsuit against the ORR’s new anti-abortion policy, Lloyd sets out his stance in crystal-clear language. Addressing the nature of the rape, he begins: “Certainly, it is understandable that a woman who is pregnant from the vile actions of a criminal would want to terminate her pregnancy. I do not, and am in no position to, judge anyone who has taken such an action.” Nonetheless, he goes on to say: “I cannot authorize our program to participate in the abortion requested here, even in this most difficult case … Implicit here are the dubious notions that it is possible to cure violence with further violence, and that the destruction of an unborn child’s life can in some instances be acceptable as a means to an end.” He concludes that the abortion is not in Jane Poe’s best interest. “We have to choose, and we ought to choose to protect life rather than to destroy it.” In fact, under Roe v Wade not only does Scott Lloyd not have to choose, he is constitutionally prohibited from doing so. The supreme court ruling states clearly that it is the woman herself who gets to choose – a constitutional right that Jane Poe’s immigrant status does not impinge. The Guardian invited the ORR to comment, but the agency did not immediately respond. In his memo, the ORR director invests himself with powers over pregnant women that even American parents do not have over their own children. “Parents in this country do not have the power to veto their children’s abortion decision, even if the child is under 18. And nor does Scott Lloyd,” Amiri said. She added: “What is going on here is Lloyd imposing his own personal anti-abortion ideology on these young women to deny them access to care, even if they have been raped, even if they are suicidal.” In Amiri’s view, the goings on within the relatively obscure world of refugee resettlement should sound alarm bells across the country: “This is a canary in a coal mine. The Trump administration would like to do to all women what they are doing to these women – prevent them accessing abortion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/24/john-worboys-victims-sentence-equivalent-life","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T17:07:20Z","webTitle":"John Worboys's victims were told his sentence was equivalent to life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/john-worboys-victims-sentence-equivalent-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/john-worboys-victims-sentence-equivalent-life","fields":{"headline":"John Worboys's victims were told his sentence was equivalent to life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Victims of John Worboys were given written assurances by crown prosecutors at the time of his conviction that his sentence was “to all intents and purposes” the same as a term of life imprisonment. Letters from the CPS lawyer who conducted Worboys’s prosecution and a Metropolitan police detective in the case, passed to BBC News, told victims in March 2009, before he was sentenced, that the black-cab rapist was unlikely to be charged with further offences “partly because of the lengthy sentence anticipated”. The disclosure that victims whose complaints did not result in a prosecution were given written assurances that Worboys would serve the equivalent of a life sentence will further fuel debate over his release after serving 10 years. The victims were also given the clear impression that he was unlikely to be released after serving his minimum tariff of eight years. A CPS specialist casework lawyer who conducted the prosecution, wrote to victims on 28 April 2009, after Worboys was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP): “An indeterminate sentence is a new sentence that has been introduced only a few years ago. To all intents and purposes, it is a sentence of life imprisonment.” He said Worboys had been convicted of 19 counts including rape, assault by penetration, sexual assault and drugging his victims in relation to 12 individual victims. For 17 of the counts the judge had given him an IPP sentence with a notional term of 10 years – the maximum for those offences – with an order that he could apply for release after five years. For the remaining two counts of rape and assault by penetration he was given a notional sentence of 16 years with an order that he could apply for release only after eight years. “When a prisoner is sentenced to life imprisonment there is always the possibility they can apply to the Parole Board for release after the expiry of a certain amount of time. With a few minor technical differences, the sentence received by Worboys is exactly the same,” the crown prosecutor wrote. The lawyer went on to tell victims that “merely because he is allowed to apply after eight years does not mean he will be granted parole. It is clear from the judge’s sentencing remarks that he is considered a dangerous offender.” The prosecutor then stressed that the Parole Board would have to consider that Worboys had committed “an awful lot of serious offences” and that he had continued to maintain his innocence even after being sentenced. “Contrition is also a factor which is considered most carefully by those responsible for considering any application that he might be released.” Connell thanked the victims for coming forward even though their complaints were not included in the prosecution. “I selected the charges for the indictment on the basis that they were the most serious allegations and provided the best evidence against Worboys,” he explained. “There are dangers in putting too many charges on an indictment as the trial can be too long and complicated.” Another letter, from a detective inspector, who was on the Worboys inquiry, and dated 18 March 2009, five days after the taxi driver’s conviction, said Worboys was unlikely to be charged with further offences. “This is partly because of the lengthy sentence anticipated. Also, given the significant publicity that the case has attracted, it is unlikely that he would be able to obtain a further fair trial,” he said. The Metropolitan police confirmed on Monday that a fresh complaint of sexual assault against Worboys dating from 2009 had been received in the past few weeks and was now being investigated. Worboys was moved to Belmarsh prison in London at the weekend, with his release anticipated in the next few weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/feb/01/football-transfers-how-spending-has-escalated-over-the-past-three-windows","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T16:02:37Z","webTitle":"Football transfers: how spending has escalated over the past three windows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/feb/01/football-transfers-how-spending-has-escalated-over-the-past-three-windows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/feb/01/football-transfers-how-spending-has-escalated-over-the-past-three-windows","fields":{"headline":"Football transfers: how spending has escalated over the past three windows","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In January 2017 there were 547 transfers for a total value of £651m.

Crystal Palace are perhaps the standout surprise in that top five, having had to spend to stay in the Premier League. Neymar deal sees spending reach another level The summer window 2017 saw Europe’s clubs lose all their senses. PSG spent £198m on Neymar alone and the scariest thing about their net spend of £155.1m is that it did not include the signing of Kylian Mbappé, who somehow arrived on loan from Monaco. Milan went on an extraordinary spree and Manchester City played their part too. As for the clubs bringing money in, there were two clubs from France, two from Germany and one from Italy in the top five.

Barcelona – because of Philippe Coutinho – led the way with a net spend of £103.7m and Manchester City were in the top five again despite the feeling they had a quiet window. Athletic Bilbao profited from City’s money for Aymeric Laporte to be in the top five earners. What will the 2018 summer transfer window bring?

The Department for International Trade (DIT), which is in charge of developing post-Brexit free trade agreements, is struggling to make deadlines, recruit enough specialist staff or retrain its existing workforce, the National Audit Office said. The report will raise concerns over the leadership of Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who has accused British business of failing to prepare for new trade deals he was set to negotiate and of becoming “too lazy and too fat” on previous successes. Labour’s Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said the department could put UK business at risk. “Failure to get the right trade deals in place from day one of Brexit could mean higher prices, lost jobs and companies going out of business,” she said. “It is deeply worrying that the NAO’s report says DIT is already behind schedule and it is not clear how it will be able to get the negotiators it needs.” Auditors found that the department was falling behind in some areas. “Delivery of the work streams will be challenging and DIT has put back some of its delivery milestones as the timetable for legislation and the overall negotiation process has moved on,” the report said. The civil service model, which sees staff move every few years, was “not best suited” to developing specific trade and negotiation skills, and there would be a “premium” on retraining and recruiting outside employees. “Considerable work will need to be done to build skills that have not existed in government for a generation,” the NAO said. Auditors noted the £25m in additional funding granted by the Treasury to the DIT for EU exit work over the 2017-2018 financial year, but said it was not yet clear how much DIT would need to fulfil its obligations. The report said: “While DIT continues to plan for successful delivery on the key scenarios, uncertainty around the nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU and any implementation period mean that it needs to be flexible and keep its plans under review. As yet there is no final cost associated with DIT’s role in EU exit.” A spokesperson for DIT defended its progress. “Overall, our plans are on track and we have met every EU exit delivery milestone to date. “This is not slippage; we have deliberately adjusted some downstream work strands as a result of the changes to the EU exit negotiation timetable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/25/larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-usa-gymnastics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"Larry Nassar is locked up for life.

Now the real work begins","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The courtroom erupted into applause on Wednesday afternoon as Larry Nassar, the former USA gymnastics team doctor and Michigan State University sports medicine physician, exited stage left to spend the rest of his life in prison for the systematic sexual abuse of athletes under his care. Survivors and their families in the gallery wept and embraced. It was a catharsis hard-won by the bravery of dozens of young women, empowered by solidarity, who stepped forward to hold the powerful to account. The terms of Nassar’s guilty plea on seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct allowed for anyone who said they were a victim to read an impact statement in court. Remarkably, the total of 88 girls and women initially scheduled to speak nearly doubled over the course of the sentencing hearing as it spilled over into a second week. One by one they faced their nightmare incarnate, from household names like six-time Olympic medalist Aly Raisman, whose scorched-earth salvo will be long remembered, and countless more who never reached the elite level, putting forth searing testimony on the pathology of a sociopath who leveraged his authority and professional heft to betray the trust of young athletes and their families. The last of the 156 survivors to testify before Nassar’s fate was sealed on Wednesday was Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast turned Kentucky attorney who became the first woman to come forward publicly in September 2016 for the Indianapolis Star story that convinced dozens more to break their silence. “The number of sexual assault victims Larry had was plain to me,” she said in the immediate aftermath. “Whether or not anyone would feel safe to come forward, that was the wild card.” “You do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again,” the judge, Rosemarie Aquilina, said before sentencing Nassar to jail for up to 175 years. “Anywhere you walk, destruction would occur to those most vulnerable. I just signed your death warrant.” Now the real work begins. So far culpability for Nassar’s monstrous acts has fallen almost exclusively on the disgraced physician himself. But many of the statements from the survivors and their attorneys have targeted the individuals and institutions that allegedly enabled or were negligent in preventing Nassar’s abuse for as long as two decades: Michigan State, USA Gymnastics, the United States Olympic Committee and Twistars Gymnastics Club, all of which have been named as co-defendants in civil suits that appear headed to trial. Denhollander is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and Twistars, an elite-level training facility in the Lansing area which referred athletes to Nassar. Those athletes allege that complaints through the years to coaches, counselors, police and university-employed trainers were never followed up with proper investigations. Another lawsuit filed by an unnamed former US gymnastics team member accuses Bela and Martha Karolyi, the former national team coordinators widely credited with transforming the United States from outsider to the head of the sport’s new world order, with fostering a toxic environment that enabled Nassar’s abuse. And then there’s Michigan State, where Nassar had taught and practiced medicine from 1997 until 2016. Larissa Boyce and Tiffany Thomas-Lopez are among former athletes who claim to have spoken with coaches and trainers about Nassar only for the complaints to go nowhere. He remained employed and was allowed to continue working with patients even during when Amanda Thomashow’s allegations prompted a criminal sexual conduct investigation by campus police that cleared Nassar in 2014. Last week the Lansing university’s board of trustees called on the state’s attorney general to review the school’s handling of the complaints amid mounting pressure for the resignation of school president Lou Anna Simon. The calls had come from both the student body, including a withering front-page editorial by the independent school newspaper that cast “Simon, her appointees and cheerleaders” as “enablers”, and from the faculty, who on Tuesday called for an emergency meeting to raise a vote of no confidence in Simon. Still, the eight-member board have firmly thrown support behind Simon, with one trustee maddeningly citing her fundraising proficiency. Hours after Wednesday’s sentencing, Michigan state legislators voted overwhelmingly for a resolution calling for the president’s ouster with Simon stepping down that evening. It’s a start. Just as problematic is the timeline around USA Gymnastics. The Indianapolis Star reported the governing body, which previously claimed to have called law enforcement “immediately” after it was first alerted to suspicions about Nassar, waited five weeks to alert the FBI while conducting their own internal review. Raisman, who brought home three golds from two Olympics, said USA Gymnastics “threatened” her to be quiet with McKayla Maroney having also revealed she was pressured to sign a non-disclosure agreement in return for a financial settlement. The unfolding scandal has led to last year’s resignation of longtime president Steve Penny and three other board members in recent weeks, followed by Wednesday’s call by the US Olympic Committee for all USA Gymnastics directors to resign en masse as the USOC launches an independent investigation into “who knew what and when” about Nassar. These overhauls are due diligence, but the unfortunate truth underlying Wednesday’s outcome is while the institutions that oversaw Nassar failed these young women time and again, it required the external force of investigative journalists, and the public pressure their work ignited, to hold a predator to account. “Every previous time there’d been an allegation, nothing happened,” prosecuting attorney Angela Povilaitis said in Wednesday’s closing remarks. “His lies worked. With each time that he got away, he was empowered to continue, to perfect, and to abuse even more. “What finally started this reckoning and ended this decades-long cycle of abuse was investigative reporting. Without that first Indianapolis Star story in August 2016, without the story where Rachel came forward publicly shortly thereafter, he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids.” Only in the late stages of the grueling 16-month trial, after Olympic gold medalists Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles, Maroney and Raisman came forward as accusers, was the previously lacking national media coverage of the Nassar story commensurate with the one of the biggest sex abuse scandals in sports history. And only if we let it slip from our field of vision will those who enabled his heinous acts, whose silence made it possible, escape their reckoning. “Inaction is an action,” Aquilina said. “Silence is indifference. Justice requires action and a voice. And that is what has happened here in this court.” A monster has been slain, to be sure. But it’s early days in the search for justice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/26/kylie-minogue-dancing-track-of-week","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Kylie, Young Thug and Bleachers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/26/kylie-minogue-dancing-track-of-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/26/kylie-minogue-dancing-track-of-week","fields":{"headline":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Kylie, Young Thug and Bleachers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK Kylie Minogue Dancing The original Kylie (take that, Jenner!) returns with a track that’s a real multitasker.

Top stories Proposed changes to Australia’s national security laws will “criminalise” reporting and undermine the media’s ability to act in the public interest, the nation’s major news outlets have warned. In a joint submission, 14 major media outlets including the ABC, Fairfax Media and News Corp said sweeping changes to national security laws proposed by the federal government would place journalists at “significant risk of jail time” for doing their jobs. The reforms would increase tenfold the maximum penalty for anyone who communicates or “deals with” information that could potentially “cause harm to Australia’s interests”, where that information is obtained via a government official without authorisation. Those interests include information which prejudices international relations “in any way” or damages relations between the federal government and a state. Penalties for breaching the laws would range from five to 15 years’ imprisonment for standard offences, stretching to 20 years for aggravated offences. Media organisations warn the bill “criminalises all steps of news reporting” and applies “criminal risk” to journalists and other editorial staff. “The result is that fair scrutiny and public interest reporting is increasingly difficult and there is a real risk that journalists could go to jail for doing their jobs,” the submission states. Labor has urged the Turnbull government to submit the revived Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to economic analysis, saying the public ought to know if it will actually benefit Australia. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has lauded the resuscitation of the agreement, which had been on life support since Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the deal a year ago. But the shadow trade minister, Jason Clare, said the deal was radically different without US involvement and voters ought to be told how it would affect Australia’s farmers and manufacturers. “The original TTP was made up of countries that represented 40% of the world economy,” Clare said. “This represents about 13% of the world economy. It’s also struck out or suspended about 20 different clauses, so it’s a different agreement.” Two doctors have written in the Guardian about their conclusion that Julian Assange’s ongoing stay in the Ecuadorian embassy is “dangerous” to his health. Sondra Crosby, a doctor and associate professor at Boston University’s school of medicine and public health, and Brock Chisholm, a London-based consultant clinical psychologist, examined Assange for 20 hours over three days in October. They write: “While the results of the evaluation are protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, it is our professional opinion that his continued confinement is dangerous physically and mentally to him and a clear infringement of his human right to healthcare.” Although the two did not go into details, Assange’s health appears to be deteriorating significantly after more than five years holed up in the embassy. The Coalition’s proposed foreign donation ban goes too far and would still not bar two high-profile Chinese donors who were the subject of claims of foreign interference, a leading academic has said. Only donations from foreign governments should be banned, rather than all donations from people who are not Australian citizens or residents, Melbourne University professor Joo-Cheong Tham said. The Turnbull government bill was introduced following controversy over the then Labor senator Sam Dastyari’s dealings with the Sydney-based Chinese businessman Huang Xiangmo. ABC’s Four Corners program investigated more than $4m of donations to the major parties by an Australian Chinese citizen, Chau Chak Wing, a member of a Communist party advisory group. Tham argued the foreign donation ban was “not justified” by those cases because neither would be banned since Huang is an Australian resident and Chau an Australian citizen. Two baby macaque monkeys have become the first primate clones to be produced using the same approach that gave rise to Dolly the sheep, researchers have revealed. Scientists say the development of Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua will allow them to compare macaques to others that are genetically identical except for particular genes that have been deliberately tinkered with. That, they add, will not only help researchers probe the mechanisms behind human diseases, but aid drug screening and the development of other therapeutics. “There is now no barrier for cloning primate species, thus cloning humans is closer to reality,” Dr Mu-ming Poo, co-author of the research, said. “However … we absolutely have no intention, and society will not permit, this work to be extended to humans.” Sport Rafael Nadal is expected to return to the game next month following his hip injury at the Australian Open.

Thinking time If you’ve ever wanted to party with priceless art, this may be your moment. Galleries right across Australia are embracing the idea of daring after-hours events, complete (in some cases) with food, wine and a chance to get closer than usual to unfathomably expensive artworks. It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but it makes for a cultural experience that is less hushed, more immersive and able to provide a deeper appreciation of the art on show. Adding rhythm and wine to an otherwise static exhibition space can make for a breathtaking experience, and one that is not easily forgotten, as Steph Harmon has discovered. The era of the electric car is coming but, by global standards, Australia is lagging far behind. Only 0.1% of all new car sales in 2016 in Australia were electric and that was actually down 23% on the year before. Other nations are powering ahead – Norway on 29%, the Netherlands on 6% and China, France and the UK on 1.5% of new cars in the same year. So what should be done? Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, says the future of the industry hinges on government intervention and the Coalition should introduce a temporary tax, stamp duty or rego-fee exemption for electric cars – to “kickstart” the industry – and a national plan of action. Australians are rightly proud of the Snowy Hydro scheme, which is an icon of Australian and engineering history. An extention to the scheme announced by the prime minister was a cause for celebration, and the hard figures behind it are even more encouraging, writes Tristan Edis. “This achievement opens our eyes to what might be possible in addressing what is the most carbon emission-intensive electricity supply in the developed world. If we simply kept up the level of construction commitments seen in 2017 for another decade it would produce almost two-thirds of Australia’s entire electricity consumption.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump’s hatred of sharks has led to an unexpected boon for shark conservation groups, with donations to their causes rising since Trump allegedly said: “I hope all sharks die.” One anonymous donor has even adopted a shark in the wild – naming it Donald J Trump. Media roundup The Age has a red-hot front page, reporting that extreme sunburn is landing an increasing number of Victorians in hospital. In the past decade more than 2,500 people attended public hospital emergency departments with severe burns, including a record 355 cases in 2017, the paper reports. The Courier Mail splashes with police allegations a Queensland mother poisoned her disabled children to claim welfare cash. Gold Coast Detective Inspector Mark Thompson said the case was “extremely traumatic” to investigate. The woman “intends to vigorously defend the charges”, her lawyer Emily Lewsey said outside court. The ABC has crunched the numbers and designed a comprehensive graph that charts every single road death in Australia since 1989 – with nearly 6,000 riding motorbikes, nearly 17,000 under the age of 26, and more than 20,000 who weren’t driving when they died. Coming up The Fair Work Commission will hear the NSW government’s last-ditch legal proceedings to stop a 24-hour rail network strike scheduled for Monday. Regardless of whether the strike goes ahead, services today and Friday – Australia Day – are being cut back. If the strike takes place, no trains will run across NSW on Monday and all stations will be closed.

He didn’t ring the council offices, though. Instead, he called the very first British radio phone-in programme, What Are They Up to Now?, on Radio Nottingham, one of the new BBC local radio stations. He may not have realised it, but his call launched a radio revolution. Fifty years later, radio is still awash with phone-ins, even though today you can sound off on Twitter and Facebook or blog your grievances without risk of interruption. So why have they survived? Vanessa Feltz, the presenter of the award-winning BBC Radio London breakfast show, thinks that the answer lies in the power and immediacy of the voice. “I think there’s a tremendous desire to be heard, and hear other people’s voices.” Andrew Crisell, the author of Understanding Radio, compares radio favourably with both print and television. “As soon as it’s written, it is crystallised – dead, inert. The medium of radio offers more than mere text – there are also paralinguistic features, such as nuance and tone, but without as much noise as TV. The very fact that you can’t see people makes radio a very intimate and confessional medium.” And confess they do, in abundance. Jane Garvey, who hosts Woman’s Hour’s phone-ins on BBC Radio 4, is astonished by what callers are happy to reveal on air. Last week, for example, in a series of phone-ins dealing with the menopause, run in conjunction with BBC Radio Sheffield, one caller breezily admitted that “I stained a few beds from Amsterdam to Istanbul”. Listeners disclose their psychosexual problems on Radio 1’s The Surgery; their need for advice trumps their embarrassment. Crisell is right: there’s something therapeutic, it seems, about baring all when no one can see you. Feltz has been moved by callers speaking out for the first time about the sexual abuse they experienced as children, while Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5 Live’s breakfast phone-in, Your Call, cried when listeners told him about their desire for assisted dying. The inhibited Brit has increasingly become a collector’s item. Phone-ins can be lifelines in emergencies, allowing dejected football fans to sound off about their team’s abject performance (invaluable for Arsenal supporters) and can become channels for the outpouring of grief and anger – such as the Radio City and Radio Merseyside phone-ins in 1989 after Hillsborough – or every single phone-in after the death of Princess Diana. At times of profound national disagreement, such as with Brexit, they also allow a collective venting. According to Gill Farrington, the editor of 5 Live Breakfast, the network saw Brexit coming: “We’re not stuck in the metropolitan bubble. People were contacting us to give us their view, so the shock wasn’t so strong for us.” Campbell goes further, arguing that phone-ins like his were rare but essential spaces where listeners were confronted with opinions beyond their tribes. But has the radio phone-in really democratised discourse or has it in fact degraded it? When prejudiced views are discharged on air, they are also being fanned and spread. What’s more, many phone-in hosts, especially on commercial radio, are professional polemicists and controversialists with distinct ideologies and a range of techniques for delegitimising callers whose opinions differ from their own. Prof Ian Hutchby, who studies applied linguistics at Leicester University, has looked at the ways these hosts often put callers on the defensive – by challenging their argument with a pithy “So?” or “What has that got to do with it?” or by summarising the caller’s claims in a way that only proves the host’s point. Even though listeners do argue back, the power in a phone-in isn’t distributed equally. Indeed, some political phone-ins sound as if they exist solely to polarise debate and set up extreme positions; Hutchby calls this “confrontation as spectacle”. What makes it particularly concerning for some is the limited range of opinion among presenters. The commercial station LBC, for example, which claims to be “Leading Britain’s Conversation”, but can’t throw off its reputation as being “Loved by Bigoted Cabbies”, has in its peak time weekday slots rightwing hosts Nick Ferrari, Iain Dale, Nigel Farage and (until May last year) Katie Hopkins. The sole antidote is James O’Brien, Corbyn-doubter and self-confessedly “politically homeless” (although recently described by the Sun as a “smug, sanctimonious, condescending, politically correct, champagne-socialist public schoolboy remoaner”). Ferrari, the winner of the journalist of the year award in last year’s British Journalism awards for his election interview with Diane Abbott among other things, seems to draw his agenda from the Daily Mail and also often quote from it. Criticised by the Broadcasting Standards Commission, Ofcom’s predecessor, in 2003 for reinforcing prejudice (he had encouraged listeners to phone in with stories about the treatment of asylum seekers compared with British citizens), he was cleared by Ofcom for describing the 2015 Paris attacks as “a Muslim problem”. Ferrari tells me that “the great disadvantage of being a liberal is that you have to be all things to all people … on the one hand, on the other hand. News from a rightwing perspective can often be more entertaining – you can say: ‘This is an absolute disgrace and has to stop this afternoon at three!’” The EU referendum, he maintains, allowed people to say things that they felt they hadn’t been able to say before about how the world had changed and that they didn’t like it. Fine – but what if they attributed it to an incorrect cause? “That’s where another listener comes in to challenge them.” Though usually civil with callers, especially first-timers, Ferrari – and O’Brien, too – can also adopt the abrasive stance pioneered by Brian Hayes at LBC in the 80s, probably the closest that Britain, with its broadcasting code, has come to a US “shock jock”. But today’s scariest US-based example of that genre, Alex Jones – conspiracy theorist, talkshow host and Donald Trump defender-in-chief, who rants about gay sex in coffins in a demonic voice while appealing to God – makes Ferrari sound like Karl Marx with a charm-school diploma. Of course, the BBC can’t and won’t go there. To the many Trump fans who called after his UK visit was initially “postponed”, Campbell pointedly responded: “I say nothing.” BBC listeners, he says, don’t want their phone-ins Fox-ed up. Feltz, when confronted by an anti-abortion campaigner who stands outside a west London abortion clinic praying for souls, argues that her role is to “get him to explain his sense of moral rectitude and not to judge – let listeners decide for themselves”. Yet for all the multiplicity of views, the range of phone-in hosts and callers across both the BBC and commercial radio remains noticeably non-diverse and, in former BBC director general Greg Dyke’s memorable words, “hideously white”: 5 Live’s Nihal Arthanayake and Dotun Adebayo are among the very few BME national phone-in presenters in the country. Nearly three years ago, the BBC Trust found that the network was skewed towards white listeners and also merited its moniker of Radio Bloke: 75% of callers to Campbell’s breakfast phone-in were men. Since then, 5 Live has made an effort to recruit more women. Emma Barnett, the presenter of a new mid-morning show on the network, believes that when women hear a female host, they’re more likely to phone the station. And most female phone-in hosts, in the UK at least, differ in style from their male counterparts: combining briskness with empathy, they’re less likely to be haranguers. Even so, they seem to be held to different standards. Garvey, recalling her LBC days, says, “If I did a mildly stroppy confrontational interview with a politician I was regarded as aggressive in a way that my co-host never was.” In its attempt to attract more female callers, 5 Live draws on the arsenal of social media, reading out tweets and emails, posting the day’s topics on Twitter and Facebook, and phoning up female tweeters (it’s notable that women are more inclined to tweet than call) to encourage them to speak on air. Today’s phone-ins are part of the digital landscape – it’s how they have reinvented themselves – and the ubiquity of the mobile phone has made calling them easier and somehow more modern. Radio stations love phone-ins because they are cheap and turn news into entertainment: there’s no denying the sadistic pleasure in hearing a sloppy thinker being skewered by a sharp host. They also allow us to eavesdrop on people’s most intimate experiences and deepest opinions – we become, in Crisell’s words, “auditory voyeurs”. Ultimately, Barnett thinks them “terribly entertaining: we want them to say what they’ve been saying at their radio, but on the radio”. So, might even Gogglebox be descended from the phone-in? In the 30s, Bertolt Brecht wrote that radio could be the “finest possible communication apparatus in public life … if it knew … how to let the listener speak as well as hear”. He would have thrilled, surely, to the sound of Barry from Bracknell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-state-of-union-workers-rights-working-class-record","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"As State of the Union nears, is America great again for the working class?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-state-of-union-workers-rights-working-class-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-state-of-union-workers-rights-working-class-record","fields":{"headline":"As State of the Union nears, is America great again for the working class?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Few parts of the American body politic have been analysed as thoroughly as the love affair between a certain section of America’s working class and Donald Trump. And as the president prepares to give his first State of the Union speech on Tuesday, American workers are likely to hear once again how well they have fared under his presidency. An analysis of the record tells a different story. If you take the view from the White House or Republicans in Capitol Hill, America is great again. The US added 2.1m jobs in 2017 as the unemployment level fell to an 18-year low. Stock markets have boomed, pushed up in part by Trump’s promised tax cuts. For Trump’s supporters, the figures prove he is making good on his promises. Massive corporations have shared (small) portions of their share of Trump’s $1.5tn tax windfall to their employees. America should be sick of winning! Yet the recovery in the jobs market is slowing after one of the longest growth streaks in history and problems remain. And the record-busting rise in share prices has also been fueled by an unprecedented era of low interest rates, an era that is also coming to an end. Shareholders and CEOs may have done very well out of Trump’s first year in office. But workers’ rights, says lobby group Good Jobs Nation in a new analysis, have been systematically attacked in a way that will affect labour for decades to come. Indeed Trump’s most significant accomplishment, according to director Joseph Geevarghese, has been to “eviscerate” all the gains the labour movement made under the Obama administration. If your vision of the future is one where teenagers can work in logging or with pesticides and restaurant owners can grab their staff’s tips, America is great again. But many working Americans have ended the year with less security than they started with. Legislation It’s become a truism to argue that Trump has achieved little in office. Like many truisms, it’s not true. Trump’s tax plan, the largest overhaul of the tax system since Ronald Reagan, may be his only major policy move so far. But he has also made significant moves to end or roll back legislation aimed at protecting American workers – and 90 more pieces of legislation are in the works. Last March, Trump revoked Barack Obama’s 2014 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, which barred companies from federal contracts if they had a history of violating safety, workplace harassment or wage theft laws. This year Republicans plan to push ahead with the repeal of other rules they believe will free business from burdensome legislation meant to protect workers, including: The Outdoor Recreation Enhancement Act, which would block requirements that federal government contractors at national parks pay workers $10.10 an hour, overtime and sick pay. The Future Logging Careers Act, which will expand the use of child labour in the forestry industry so that 16- and 17 year-olds can work in logging under adult supervision. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering a rollback of a 2015 rule that banned children under 18 from working with toxic pesticides. The Department of Labor (DoL) has proposed repealing an Obama-era rule that workers who earn tips should keep them and that they could only be shared with other employees who received tips. The Trump administration argues the new rule is fairer because it means that tips can now be shared with “back of the house” employees who don’t get tipped. Critics point out that the establishment’s owner will now collect the tips and is not obligated to share them. In fact the rule specifically states that pooled money can be used for structural improvements or to lower prices. All these moves have been cheered by the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing thinktank that gambled on ignoring Trump’s less than impeccable conservative credentials during the election in the hope of influencing his policies if he won. His efforts to “rein in the regulatory state already are showing promise, but more work needs to be done”, Alden Abbott, deputy director of Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation, recently wrote. Unions This year could be a disaster for US unions. The Trump administration has filed an amicus brief in support of a supreme court case that could spell financial calamity for them. The case, Janus v American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, is financed in large part by the conservative Bradley Foundation. It argues that non-union members who are forced to pay an “agency fee” to cover the expense of representing them in wage negotiations etc should be exempted because they should not be forced to subsidise a union’s political spending. A similar case, Friedrichs v California Teachers Association, ended in deadlock at the supreme court. Now that Trump has put conservative justice Neil Gorsuch on the court, unions expect to lose. Some are preparing to lose a third of their income. Department of Labor The DoL provided the Trump administration with one of its earliest defeats – its failure to appoint former fast-food boss Andy Puzder as its head after a massive backlash from workers and unions. But that hiccup has not prevented similarly controversial nominations. Patrick Pizzella, nominee for deputy labour secretary, lobbied in support of a programme that imported indentured labourers to the Marianas Islands to work in sweatshops where there were reports of forced abortions and beatings. Cheryl Stanton, his pick for wage and hour administrator, the top enforcer of minimum wage and overtime protections, has been sued for failing to pay her house cleaners. On the subject of minimum wage it is also worth noting that the president has distanced himself from campaign promises to raise the federal minimum wage. He now thinks that this is an issue for states to decide, in line with his Republican colleagues. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) The agency – which oversees the rights of private-sector workers to organise into unions, bargain collectively and engage in workplace protest – has been remade under Trump. Under Obama the NLRB made franchise companies, notably McDonald’s, liable as “joint employers” for unfair labour practices at the businesses that they effectively control. That rule is being rolled back. “Trump ran as being the workers’ champion,” said Geevarghese. “He has done exactly the opposite.” Instead of being an agent of change, Geevarghese said the Trump administration had mirrored the orthodoxy of the rightwing arm of the Republican party. He said the only answer was for people to “hit the streets in greater numbers than ever before”. “The worst, worst thing you can do is let a liar get away with his lies,” he said. So when Trump outlines his achievements next Tuesday it is worth remembering that after discounting CEOs and shareholders, the man who promised change for working Americans has, for many, made life more uncertain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/24/enrique-iglesias-sues-universal-for-lost-royalties-in-multimillion-dollar-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:41:37Z","webTitle":"Enrique Iglesias sues Universal for lost royalties in multimillion dollar lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/enrique-iglesias-sues-universal-for-lost-royalties-in-multimillion-dollar-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/24/enrique-iglesias-sues-universal-for-lost-royalties-in-multimillion-dollar-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Enrique Iglesias sues Universal for lost royalties in multimillion dollar lawsuit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Enrique Iglesias is suing his former record label for “systematically underpaying” his streaming royalties. According to a new lawsuit filed in a Miami federal court, Iglesias alleges that he only received what is described as a “small fraction” of his 50% royalty rate for streaming from Universal Music Group (UMG), resulting in multimillion dollar losses, Billboard reports. The Latin star is also challenging the equivalency of physical and digital sales in his contract. In a statement provided to Billboard, Iglesias’ attorney James Sammataro outlined the lucrative nature of Iglesias’ partnership with UMG, which ended in 2015. “Despite this record-breaking success, Universal has wrongly insisted that artists like Enrique be paid for streams in the same manner as they are paid for physical records despite the fact that none of the attendant costs (production, distribution, inventory, losses) actually exist in the digital world.” Streaming did not exist in 1999, when Iglesias first signed with UMG. The suit claims his original contract indicated digital download sales would be paid at the same royalty rate as for physical albums, at 50% of UMG’s net receipts, and that “for any type of use not specifically covered”, the royalty rate would remain the same. When Iglesias re-signed with UMG in 2010, his deal included two additional albums, though didn’t specifically mention streaming. Iglesias’ suit claims this was “not an oversight”, stating that “until approximately 2016, Interscope properly recognised and credited Iglesias’ streaming royalties at 50%”. However, Iglesias’s streaming royalties were then lowered, in line with a label directive – hence the lawsuit, which requests a proper accounting of Iglesias’ royalties, access to UMG’s books, and damages. Universal are yet to respond to the lawsuit. Born in 1975, the son of fellow Latin music star Julio Iglesias, Enrique’s pop career began in the mid-1990s. After his huge 1999 hit Bailamos, he successfully crossed over in the English-speaking market with songs like Hero, Not in Love and I Like It. He since returned to predominantly Spanish-language pop, scoring a massive global hit in 2017 with Súbeme la Radio. He is currently signed to Sony."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/24/exposing-uk-government-folly-of-investment-in-new-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:23:33Z","webTitle":"Exposing UK government folly of investment in new nuclear | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/exposing-uk-government-folly-of-investment-in-new-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/24/exposing-uk-government-folly-of-investment-in-new-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Exposing UK government folly of investment in new nuclear","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1976, Lord Flowers pronounced that there should be no further commitment to nuclear energy unless it could be demonstrated that long-lived highly radioactive wastes could be safely contained for the indefinite future. Ever since, efforts to find a suitable site for a geological disposal facility have been rejected by communities (Wanted: community willing to host a highly radioactive waste dump in their district, 22 January). There is, therefore, little evidence to support the government’s claim that “it is satisfied that effective arrangements will exist to manage and dispose of the waste that will be produced from new nuclear power stations”. Deep disposal may be the eventual long-term solution but demonstrating a safety case, finding suitable geology and a willing community are tough challenges and likely to take a long time. The search for a disposal site diverts attention from the real solution for the foreseeable future, which is to ensure the safe and secure management of the unavoidable legacy wastes that have to be managed. It is perverse to compound the problem by a new-build programme that will result in vastly increased radioactivity from spent fuel and other highly radioactive wastes which will have to be stored indefinitely at vulnerable sites scattered around our coasts. A new-build programme would create an unmanageable and intolerable burden on communities into the far future. To suggest that a repository is the solution is in the realm of fantasy. Prof Andrew Blowers Member of the first Committee on Radioactive Waste Management • The fact that the UK government is still going ahead with plans to construct new power stations, generating even more toxic radioactive waste, troubles and puzzles me immensely. Here, on the beautiful isle of Anglesey, where tidal, solar and wind energy production are all highly feasible alternatives and could also provide opportunities for well-paid employment, politicians appear to be happy for an area of outstanding natural beauty to be contaminated for further than the foreseeable future, not to mention the immense eyesore that will occupy acres of fertile land. It is an eye-wateringly costly venture that many fear will expose taxpayers to huge financial risk and will also leave future generations guarding the threat to their environment and health long after it ceases to function. Future generations will doubtless wonder, when most of Europe is shutting down its nuclear power stations and not planning any more, why in the world the local population didn’t protest harder.

The deal, the value of which was undisclosed, is the first time a major global sporting team has officially partnered with a cryptocurrency firm. It comes as an increasing number of regulators and business leaders express concern about the dangers of consumers risking their savings in unregulated virtual currencies. In an ICO the issuing company accepts a cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin or Ether, in exchange for “tokens” in the venture, which can represent a share in a firm or even a prepayment voucher. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority warned consumers last year that they should be prepared to lose their money if they invested in Bitcoin. The FCA declined to comment on Arsenal’s decision to promote a cryptocurrency, but a spokesman pointed out that the regulator was planning to “conduct a deeper examination of the fast-paced developments” of ICOs and would take “further regulatory action” if necessary. Vinai Venkatesham, Arsenal’s chief commercial officer, said: “We are pleased to welcome CashBet Coin as our partner. We are looking forward to working with CashBet Coin as they launch their new cryptocurrency.” CashBet said it was delighted to be able to secure a deal with Arsenal as the firm is “actively targeting a global, multibillion-dollar marketplace of i-gaming content providers, operators and players”. CashBet, which plans to raise between $40m (£28m) and $70m from the sale of CashBet Coins tokens in its ICO, uses Arsenal’s crest and player’s images on its website and the club describes CashBet as its “first official cryptocurrency partner”. CashBet Coins will initially be priced at 50 cents and are designed to be used on CashBet’s mobile phone gambling apps. Tim Buckley, the chief executive of investment firm Vanguard, said on Wednesday that his company would never invest in cryptocurrencies because they have no value. Axel Weber, the chairman of Swiss bank UBS, said on Tuesday that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were speculative, risky and “not an investment we would advise”. “Retail clients, who don’t fully understand these products, should be protected from going into these products, because if there is a retail client affected in the future, the question will be again: ‘Who was the bank that sold them these products?’ and then banks will be blamed again for what has happened,” he said. The consultancy Ernst &amp; Young warned that ICOs are at risk of cybercrime. Of the $3.7bn raised in ICOs last year, about $400m has been stolen by hackers, according to an EY analysis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/24/david-meller-presidents-club-groping-scandal-wealthy-tory-donor","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:22:21Z","webTitle":"David Meller, the Tory donor 'desperate to be part of establishment'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/david-meller-presidents-club-groping-scandal-wealthy-tory-donor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/david-meller-presidents-club-groping-scandal-wealthy-tory-donor","fields":{"headline":"David Meller, the Tory donor 'desperate to be part of establishment'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Until the Financial Times’s revelations the Presidents Club co-chair David Meller was moving along a familiar path. A generous Conservative party donor and wealthy businessman who helps run his family’s company, Meller moved into education by sponsoring state schools in England after forming his own charity, the Meller Educational Trust. Meller’s interest in academies was quickly rewarded by the Department for Education. In June 2013 he was appointed as a non-executive director on the DfE’s board, and less than a year later he was named chair of the government’s apprenticeship ambassador network. By January 2016 Meller had also been named as a co-chair of government’s apprenticeship delivery board, which was tasked with helping the government hit its target of 3m apprenticeships by 2020. Meller shared the board’s chairmanship with Nadhim Zahawi, the Conservative who also attended the Presidents Club event exposed by the FT. The honours continued, with Meller named to the board of the Mayor’s Fund for London, a social mobility charity. Meller was also on the charitable foundation behind TBAP, a trust that provides alternative education for excluded pupils. By the time of the announcement of the latest new year’s honours list, it was no surprise to see Meller receiving an CBE “for services to education”. It may have helped that Meller has been a trustee of the Conservative-leaning thinktank Policy Exchange, founded by Michael Gove. There he has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Theodore Agnew, a wealthy businessman and academy sponsor before being elevated to the House of Lords as an education minister. Meller even agreed to serve as the finance chair of Gove’s ill-fated Conservative leadership campaign – although the campaign only lasted about 24 hours. Now 58, Meller says he attended a comprehensive and obtained four O-levels but struggled with dyslexia during his time at school – an experience that first drove his interest in education. Meller’s CV was further burnished by his place on the boards of several other worthy causes. But it is his co-chairmanship of the Presidents Club – which claims to have raised £20m for children’s charities in the UK – that has turned from a plus to a minus. “It’s quite sad, really. He was so bloody desperate to be part of the establishment. Did all the stuff you’re meant to, threw money at the Tories, ended up with just an MBE rather than the peerage he desperately wanted,” said a former colleague. “And now he’ll never get his ultimate prize. All because he couldn’t have enough nous to not go to an event where women were only there to be groped.” Meller’s interest in supporting education policy saw him transform his charity into an academy trust in 2011, having sponsored a school, Bushey Academy, in 2009 after being approached under the last Labour government. But although it has since become a multi-academy trust, last year it directly governed just two secondary schools – one in Bushey and another near Watford.

One witness giving evidence on Wednesday at the trial of Darren Osborne, 48, at Woolwich crown court said the incident in Finsbury Park was a “horrific attack on Muslims” and that he had suffered from nightmares. Another said there were bodies strewn on the ground after the van hit pedestrians and he had wanted to run, fearing the driver was armed and could try to kill more people, but went back to tackle him. Giving evidence on Wednesday, the imam of the local charity Muslim Welfare House, Mohammed Mahmoud, told the jury he had protected the man from the crowd because he felt he should face justice. “I shouted: ‘No one touch him,’ told people to get back and said: ‘We are handing him in unscathed to the police,’” Mahmoud told the jury. “It was a natural response. He posed no harm to anyone. He was immobilised, he wasn’t a threat and, therefore, he should answer for his crime in a court such as this, which he is doing now, and not in a court in the street.” Witnesses described a white van slamming into a group of people. “As the van drove into the road, I could hear the engine revving … The van just ploughed the people,” said Mahad Mohamed Ismail in a witness statement read to the jury. “There were people underneath the van … It was revving like the driver had his foot flat down on the accelerator.” Ismail said that since the attack he had been having nightmares. “I am paranoid when I go out and hear a van revving. I witnessed a horrific attack on Muslims. I feared for my life when that van was coming towards me. Words cannot describe how I felt.” Osborne denies one charge of murdering Makram Ali and another of attempting to murder other people. During Wednesday’s hearing, witnesses described seeing Ali collapse and a group of people gather to help him, shortly before a white van hit them. The driver tried to escape but was apprehended by people nearby, the jury heard. A statement was read to the court from Waleed Salim, who said he and his cousin Hamdi Alfaiq had been hit by a van. “I helped a group of people trying to lift the van, but it was really heavy so they had to drag my cousin out.” Giving evidence in person, Alfaiq said he did not remember being under the vehicle. The court heard an audio recording of a 999 call by Adnan Mohamud, who initially asked for an ambulance for Ali. A lengthy pause followed, before Mohamud told the call handler: “Someone’s just come and run over a whole lot of people. He ran over a lot of people. A lot of people are dying. He has just run over everyone … people are dying, man.” In a witness statement read to the court, he said: “I remember [the driver] saying: ‘I have done my job. You can kill me now.’ He was smiling as he said it.” Mohamud said he would never forget the smile on the driver’s face, which had convinced him the incident was no accident. Another witness, Mohammed Geedi, said he had been on his way to a nearby mosque when the incident happened on 19 June. He told the jury he could see the van’s headlights and was aware of it accelerating and shifting up from first gear to second. He said he had been knocked to the ground. “I looked at a lot of people splattered all over the place.” After the incident, he said, he helped a group of people restrain the man they believed to be the driver. Geedi told the jury he saw Ali speaking before the van struck. “He was alive. He looked alive,” he said. Immediately after the impact, he said, he saw tyre marks across Ali’s body and the man’s “tongue was sticking out”. Geedi said he feared a continuing attack with guns or knives, similar to that at London Bridge, but went back to help. The jury was also played video footage from the camera worn by one of the first officers on the scene, PC David Jones. The three clips showed Osborne speaking angrily about Muslims, as well as senior Labour figures, in terms similar to those in a letter found in the van. PC Jones said the remarks had been made unprompted.

The vessels, designed to fit beneath bridges as they transport their goods around the inland waterways of Belgium and the Netherlands, are expected to vastly reduce the use of diesel-powered trucks for moving freight. Dubbed the “Tesla of the canals”, their electric motors will be driven by 20-foot batteries, charged on shore by the carbon-free energy provider Eneco. The barges are designed to operate without any crew, although the vessels will be manned in their first period of operation as new infrastructure is erected around some of the busiest inland waterways in Europe. In August, five barges - 52 metres long and 6.7m wide, and able to carry 24 20ft containers weighing up to 425 tonnes - will be in operation. They will be fitted with a power box giving them 15 hours of power. As there is no need for a traditional engine room, the boats have up to 8% extra space, according to their Dutch manufacturer, Port Liner. About 23,000 trucks, mainly running on diesel, are expected to be removed from the roads as a result. At a later date, six larger 110m-long barges, carrying 270 containers, will run on four battery boxes capable of providing 35 hours of autonomous driving. Their use alone could lead to a reduction of about 18,000 tonnes per year of CO2, it is claimed. According to the latest statistics from Eurostat, 74.9% of freight in the EU is transported by road, compared to 18.4% by rail, and 6.7% along inland waterways, although the use of water routes has been rising. The barges are being developed in the Netherlands with €7m in subsidies from the EU and additional funds from the ports involved. Port Liner believes it could produce about 500 barges a year to revolutionise the freight industry, although the electric motors and batteries could also be retrofitted into older boats. The company’s chief executive, Ton van Meegen, told shipping industry trade journal the Loadstar that the barges would be the first in the world to sail on carbon-neutral batteries and that only the low bridges in the low countries prevented them from being loaded with more goods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/24/consumers-are-being-squeezed-two-views-from-monetary-policy-committee-insiders","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T18:13:30Z","webTitle":"'The squeeze continues' – experts debate Brexit watch data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/24/consumers-are-being-squeezed-two-views-from-monetary-policy-committee-insiders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/24/consumers-are-being-squeezed-two-views-from-monetary-policy-committee-insiders","fields":{"headline":"'The squeeze continues' – experts debate Brexit watch data","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011 We are starting 2018 with a very upbeat outlook for the world economy. Taking all the key indicators of the health of the global economy together – growth, unemployment and inflation – we arein the most positive period of economic performance for the world economy since the financial crisis. Global growth this year should be close to 4%, and the average unemployment rate for the G7 economies is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Inflation is starting to pick up in a number of countries, with upward pressure on global food and energy prices. However, inflation still remains relatively low in most major economies around the world. This positive global picture is supporting the growth of sectors of the UK economy that trade internationally, including manufacturing. The volume of UK exports of goods, excluding oil and gold, is up nearly 10% on a year ago. Strong export performance is providing support to the growth of the UK economy while domestic demand remains relatively weak. Brexit uncertainty is holding back business investment while the squeeze on consumer spending from inflation continues. Retail sales volumes in the final quarter of 2017 were just 1% up on a year ago, the weakest growth recorded since 2013. This consumer squeeze should ease gradually over the course of this year but it is likely to continue to hold back UK economic growth during 2018. The latest data shows that wage increases continue to run below the rate of price inflation, even though it fell back slightly in December. PricewaterhouseCoopers’ latest estimate is that UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the final quarter of 2017, which would produce an annual growth rate of 1.4% over the past four quarters – the lowest growth recorded since 2012 when we were in the depths of the euro crisis. While most other major economies have been speeding up over the past year, the UK’s has slowed down. And despite the strength of the global economy, another year of disappointing growth is in prospect for 2018. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank’s MPC from June 2006 to May 2009 The background to the UK economy’s performance at the start of 2018 is that the stimulus being provided by the European Central Bank has meant the eurozone economy is humming along. Growth in the eurozone is helping to pull along the UK economy, which is growing at a much slower pace. The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.2 in December from 53.8 in November. Alongside solid readings from the smaller manufacturing and construction, this suggests economic growth of between 0.4% and 0.5% in the final quarter of 2017. This though looks likely to still be a lot slower than most other EU countries. In the third quarter of 2017 the UK with growth of 0.4%, versus 0.6% for the EU as a whole, grew faster than only Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania and Denmark. It seems unlikely the UK will rise up the EU growth rankings in the fourth quarter, but hope springs eternal. This month the story is of a struggling consumer. Even though inflation this month fell back to 3%, it is still more than double the 1.4% in the eurozone. The IHS Markit Household Finance Index found British households reported the sharpest deterioration in financial wellbeing, while inflation expectations reached the highest levels for almost four years. That isn’t surprising given the fact that nominal earnings growth in November 2017 was only 2.3%, down from 2.4% a month earlier. This means real earnings fell for the eighth month in a row. Real earnings are still 3% below their levels at the start of the great recession in 2008."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/25/oldest-known-human-fossil-outside-africa-discovered-in-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T19:00:25Z","webTitle":"Oldest known human fossil outside Africa discovered in Israel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/25/oldest-known-human-fossil-outside-africa-discovered-in-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/25/oldest-known-human-fossil-outside-africa-discovered-in-israel","fields":{"headline":"Oldest known human fossil outside Africa discovered in Israel","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A prehistoric jawbone discovered in a cave in Israel has prompted scientists to rethink theories of how the earliest human pioneers came to populate the planet, suggesting that our ancestors left Africa far earlier than previously thought. The fossil, dated to nearly 200,000 years ago, is almost twice as old as any previous Homo sapiens remains discovered outside Africa, where our species is thought to have originated. Until recently, several converging lines of evidence – from fossils, genetics and archaeology – suggested that modern humans first dispersed from Africa into Eurasia about 60,000 years ago, quickly supplanting other early human species, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, that they may have encountered along the way. However, a series of recent discoveries, including a trove of 100,000 year-old human teeth found in a cave in China, have clouded this straightforward narrative. And the latest find, at the Misliya cave site in northern Israel, has added a new and unexpected twist. “What Misliya tells us is that modern humans left Africa not 100,000 years ago, but 200,000 years ago,” said Prof Israel Hershkovitz, who led the work at Tel Aviv University. “This is a revolution in the way we understand the evolution of our own species.” The find suggests that there were multiple waves of migration across Europe and Asia and could also mean that modern humans in the Middle East were mingling, and possibly mating, with other human species for tens of thousands of years. “Misliya breaks the mould of existing scenarios for the timing of the first known Homo sapiens in these regions,” said Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London. “It’s important in removing a long-lasting constraint on our thinking.” The fossil, a well-preserved upper jawbone with eight teeth, was discovered at the Misliya cave, which appears to have been occupied for lengthy periods. The teeth are larger than average for a modern human, but their shape and the fossil’s facial anatomy are distinctly Homo sapiens, an analysis of the fossil in the journal Science concludes. Sophisticated stone tools and blades discovered nearby suggest the cave’s inhabitants were capable hunters, who used sling projectiles and elegantly carved blades used to kill and butcher gazelles, oryx, wild boars, hares, turtles and ostrich. The team also discovered evidence of matting made from plants that may have been used to sleep on. Radioactive dating places the fossil and tools at between 177,000 and 194,000 years old. Hershkovitz said the record now indicates that humans probably ventured beyond the African continent whenever the climate allowed it. “I don’t believe there was one big exodus out of Africa,” he said. “I think that throughout hundreds of thousands of years [humans] were coming in and out of Africa all the time.” Reconstructions of the ancient climate records, based on deep sea cores, show that the Middle East switched between being humid and extremely arid, and that the region would have been lush and readily habitable for several periods matching the age of the Misliya fossil. The idea of multiple dispersals is supported by recent discoveries such as the teeth unearthed in China, human fossils in Sumatra from around 70,000 years ago, archaeological evidence from Northern Australia at 65,000 years and fossils previously discovered near Misliya dating to 90,000-120,000 years ago. The scenario also raises the possibility that the eastern Mediterranean may have acted as a crossroads for encounters between our own ancestors and the various other human species, such as Neanderthals, who had already reached Europe. “We’re like a train station that everyone’s passing through,” said Hershkovitz. Scientists have already shown that interbreeding with Neanderthals, whose lineage diverged from our own 500,000 years ago, occurred some time in the past 50,000 years. As a legacy, modern-day Eurasians carry 1-4% of Neanderthal DNA. However, a recent analysis of DNA taken from a Neanderthal leg bone found in a German cave hinted at much earlier encounters between the two species, dating back more than 200,000 years. The new fossil adds plausibility to this theory. “It means modern humans were potentially meeting and interacting during a longer period of time with other archaic human groups, providing more opportunity for cultural and biological exchanges,” said Rolf Quam, Binghamton University anthropology professor and a co-author of the study. The discovery also raises intriguing questions about the fate of the earliest modern human pioneers. Genetic data from modern-day populations around the world strongly suggest that everyone outside Africa can trace their ancestors back to a group that dispersed around 60,000 years ago. So the inhabitants of the Misliya cave are probably not the ancestors of anyone alive today, and scientists can only speculate why their branch of the family tree came to an end. Prof David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard University and an expert in population genetics and ancient DNA, said: “It’s important to distinguish between the migration out of Africa that’s being discussed here and the “out-of-Africa” migration that is most commonly discussed when referring to genetic data. This [Misliya] lineage contributed little if anything to present-day people.” “These early exits are sometimes termed ‘unsuccessful’ or ‘failed’,” said Stringer. “Some of these groups could have gone extinct through natural processes, through competition with other humans, including later waves of modern humans, or they could have been genetically swamped by a more extensive 60,000 year old dispersal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T11:08:21Z","webTitle":"12 camels disqualified from Saudi beauty contest in 'Botox' row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats","fields":{"headline":"12 camels disqualified from Saudi beauty contest in 'Botox' row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Twelve camels have been disqualified from Saudi Arabia’s annual camel beauty contest after receiving botulinum toxin injections to make their pouts look more alluring.

The key attributes in camel beauty are considered to be delicate ears and big nose. But there are strict rules against the use of drugs in the lips, or shaved or clipped body parts. This year, a dozen camels were banned after a vet was caught performing plastic surgery on them. Camels were also given Botox-type injections at his clinic, according to Saudi media. “They use Botox for the lips, the nose, the upper lips, the lower lips and even the jaw,” Ali al-Mazrouei, the son of an Emirati camel breeder, told the UAE daily the National. “It makes the head more inflated so when the camel comes it’s like, ‘Oh, look at how big that head is. It has big lips, a big nose.’” After the ban was imposed, the chief judge of the show, Fawzan al-Madi, told Reuters: “The camel is a symbol of Saudi Arabia.

Really it should at least be co-credited to Matangi/Maya Arulpragasam – for one thing, it’s her own footage of her early career and in Sri Lanka, where the film sources its greatest energy. More than that, she’s the controlling spirit of this enjoyable documentary: always the centre of attention, performing and setting the mood with absolute magnetism. It’s clear she’s the director of her own life and Loveridge just happens to occasionally be in the right place at the right time. The structure of the film is mostly linear and traditional, following MIA from early days as the child of Sri Lankans immigrant in London to present-day fame, controversy and motherhood. But there’s nothing traditional about her – she and her siblings had to be tough and reinvent themselves in the absence of a father who was away as an activist in the Tamil resistance movement. Her music, artwork, fashion and general angry-rave aesthetic appears to have come to her with little effort; she just knew it would work. Toughness is a recurring theme. Arulpragasam never takes an easy route, composing her own music and conceptualising her own music videos from the start: leaving a cushy situation as Justine Frischmann’s wing woman to work independently, turning up at XL Recordings to ask them to sign her, and all the ways she annoyed the US press once notorious there. Appearing on American TV heavily pregnant, declaring that there was a genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka at awards ceremonies, and constantly avoiding ducking difficult situations. The film comes from a place of deep admiration for MIA, but unlike more fawning biographies, it makes a convincing case that this admiration is well earned. Many people will be unaware of the viciousness of the backlash against her by a US media establishment who attempted to portray her as a fake fashionable radical. Lynn Hirschberg of the New York Times is caught on camera gushing over her interviewee before condemning her in a lead magazine article. A terrible parody video accuses her of being a champagne socialist. Bill Maher patronises her on his chat show when she tries to explain her concerns. In an aggravating moment, a radio DJ entirely fails to comprehend the message of her ironic video for Born Free, in which red-haired men and children are hunted down and shot in the head. There’s a key section where Arulpragasam’s frustration with her treatment is summed up in her claim that people want brown celebrities to smile nicely like Aziz Ansari rather than have political opinions and feel like a threat. It’s in these later stages of the film, as her life becomes ever more complex, that Loveridge captures the best original material. While it’s a thrill to see her breezily workshop her tracks early in her career, including a great exploratory version of Paper Planes and a visit to see Afrikan Boy and dance with him, she remains emotionally elusive; it’s the painful times in more recent years are where we really get to know her. We’re backstage as she’s condemned and sued by the NFL for displaying a middle finger during the super bowl. It’s edge-of-the-seat stuff as she and her team are confused and scared by the fake gravity of the situation. Madonna is no help. Arulpragasam’s son says he doesn’t like the Super Bowl at all and he just wanted to be with his mum, and they have a cuddle. As she’s done since she was a teenager, she shrugs her shoulders, trusts her instincts, and moves on knowing she was in the right. Whilst not the most beautiful looking material, this extended sequence is pacy and well-edited and, like many set pieces in the film, proves a theory suggested almost from the first lines of the film – that this unique pop star always knew she was special and that would annoy people. The documentary is open-ended, with a mini-conclusion of the family moving back to the UK from the US, but this isn’t a happy ending. It seems MIA will be fighting forever, a one-woman awkward squad whose background, both economically and racially, means she’s not allowed to get too popular. It’s right that for once, in this film, she truly gets to control her own narrative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/24/facebook-regulated-cigarette-industry-salesforce-marc-benioff-social-media","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T12:32:20Z","webTitle":"Facebook should be 'regulated like cigarette industry', says tech CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/24/facebook-regulated-cigarette-industry-salesforce-marc-benioff-social-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/24/facebook-regulated-cigarette-industry-salesforce-marc-benioff-social-media","fields":{"headline":"Facebook should be 'regulated like cigarette industry', says tech CEO","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook should be regulated like a cigarette company, because of the addictive and harmful properties of social media, according to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff. Social networks would be regulated “exactly the same way that you regulated the cigarette industry”, Benioff told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Here’s a product – cigarettes – they’re addictive, they’re not good for you, maybe there’s all kinds of different forces trying to get you to do certain things. There’s a lot of parallels. “I think that, for sure, technology has addictive qualities that we have to address, and that product designers are working to make those products more addictive, and we need to rein that back as much as possible,” he added. Benioff, who founded B2B cloud computing company Salesforce in 1999, and is now worth more than $4bn, suggested that regulation of some form was inevitable for the technology industry. “We’re the same as any other industry,” he said. “Financial services, consumer product goods, food — in technology, the government’s going to have to be involved. There is some regulation but there probably will have to be more.” A string of Silicon Valley heads have spoken out in recent months about their fear that social media could be more psychologically damaging than anyone expected. Last week, venture capitalist Roger McNamee – an early investor in Facebook – wrote a Guardian column warning that the company would would have to “address the harm the platform has caused through addiction and exploitation by bad actors”. “I was once Mark Zuckerberg’s mentor, but I have not been able to speak to him about this. Unfortunately, all the internet platforms are deflecting criticism and leaving their users in peril,” McNamee wrote. Earlier, Sean Parker, Facebook’s first President, had described the business practice of social media firms as “a social-validation feedback loop … exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology”. Parker now describes himself as “something of a conscientious objector” to social media. As part of its attempt to win back control of the narrative, Facebook has announced it will begin taking into account how trusted a publisher is as part of its News Feed algorithm. The company’s metric for determining trust, however, is a simple two-question survey, causing some to query its potential. ‘Never get high on your own supply’ – why social media bosses don’t use social media"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/25/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-with-great-drumming","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T12:00:15Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs with great drumming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/25/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-with-great-drumming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/25/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-with-great-drumming","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs with great drumming","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of suggestions on last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. The drummer is the heartbeat, the timekeeper, the engine. As basic as a stomp or as subtle as a whisper. Hitting things comes naturally to humans, but it takes years of practice to get into this playlist. We begin our rundown with Bickram Ghosh, a master tabla player from Kolkata. After a famously long apprenticeship, tabla players learn use the heel of their hand to change the note of their drum while playing. Ghosh is perhaps better known for his fusion music, but his Adi Taal is a stunning classical piece. Billy Cobham, who comes next, is a jazz fusion drumming wizard who has worked with acts from Horace Silver and Miles Davis to Mahavishnu. This is the title track from his wonderful 1974 LP Total Eclipse, on which he really makes the drum kit talk, breathe and converse with the other instruments – all while keeping time. Personal note: I went to school with Pete Thomas and witnessed a drum battle between him and Andrew Ranken. Both went on to make a living hitting things with sticks, Ranken with the Pogues and Pete with our next act, Elvis Costello and the Attractions. On the outstanding Lipstick Vogue, Thomas does the Metropolitan Line rockabilly shuffle and drives this live favourite along. King Sunny Ade hails from Nigeria and came to western ears in 1982 with Juju Music, an album featuring the polyrhythms of Yoruba mixed with country slide guitar and produced with dub effects. Ja Funmi features the talking drum of Rasaki Aladokun, which is squeezed under the arm to change the tone. Beautiful. Steve Cropper, the house guitarist at the Stax Records studio, tells of a letter he received asking whether they had a drum machine. Yes, he replied, his name is Al Jackson Jr, half of the mighty house band Booker T &amp; the MGs’s rhythm section, along with Donald “Duck” Dunn on bass. Hold On, I’m Coming, a classic recording from Sam &amp; Dave, showcases the skilled metronomic beat-making of this unshowy maestro. In the world of jazz many of the most influential drummers lead bands. Hard bop group Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers recorded 76 albums: this extraordinary track, Tobi Ilu, is from a 1962 collaboration released under Art Blakey and the Afro-Drum Ensemble and clearly speaks many rhythmic languages, often together. The session drummer by contrast plays what is required. Only the very best make a career of this and here Hal Blaine is employed as the foundation stone for Phil Spector’s celebrated Wall of Sound on Be My Baby, a colossal song by the Ronettes. Often mistaken for a Cuban, Tito Puente was born in Manhattan and spent his hugely successful career bringing mambo and cha cha cha to a wide audience via his timbales – single-headed drums popular in Latin music. This song cements his position as drum king – El Rey Del Timbal. Tool were a new band to me, but after listening to the seven suggested songs, I am a total convert. Theirs is a progressive metal of a melodic and complex nature, and drummer Danny Carey plays the most hypnotically unusual tempos which are – on this song Lateralus – inspired by the Fibonacci sequence. Carlton Barrett played drums with the Upsetters, and then Bob Marley and the Wailers on all of their LPs, in a rhythm section with his brother Aston. They internationalised the “one drop” reggae beat, and by 1980 when Coming in from the Cold was released Barrett was caressing his kit with the delicious delicacy of a virtuoso. I could’ve filled every slot on this playlist with jazz drummers, so well represented were they in your nominations. But tucked away with just two mentions was one of the instigators, one of the original inspirations, Count Basie drummer “Papa” Jo Jones, credited with moving the pulse from the bass drum to the hi-hat in the 1930s, changing the course of time-keeping. Max Roach, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson all cite him as a major influence. The drummer’s drummer par excellence is Steve Gadd, perhaps most famous for Paul Simon’s 50 Ways, but on this list playing Aja with Steely Dan in 1977. Exquisite. Finally, back to the source. Malcolm McClaren took this sound into the pop charts with Adam Ant and Bow Wow Wow, but how about some credit for The Burundi Drummers and their massive thrilling sound?

The threat of bringing the press watchdog, founded in 2014, before the courts raises fundamental questions about media regulation and Ipso’s public accountability. One of the challenges is being brought by Rachel Elgy, an expert in equality training and a part-time student, who complained about a comment piece by Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun’s former political editor. Ipso ruled in October that the column did not breach accuracy or discrimination clauses in the editors’ code of practice. It said Kavanagh “was entitled to speculate on the validity of the status of refugees entering Germany, and the reference to ‘a million more so-called refugees’ was clearly presented as his speculation”. Kavanagh was a member of Ipso’s board when he wrote the article last summer and during its consideration of the complaint. His position prompted claims that the organisation was biased in his favour. The Sun article led to a fierce backlash when it was published, with more than 100 MPs from major parties signing an open letter to the paper, criticising the piece for using “Nazi-like language” regarding the Muslim community in Britain. Kavanagh subsequently apologised for causing offence, saying: “I can honestly say it never occurred to me that this could be interpreted as a play on ‘the Jewish problem’ and I will happily apologise to anyone who is thus offended.” Elgy has begun a crowdfunding appeal to pay for her judicial review challenge. She told the Guardian: “It feels like journalists regulated by Ipso feel they can say anything and they are protected. It ends up with them seeming to be above the law. “A press standards organisation should be finding where journalists are not upholding good standards. That should be [its] role.” Her claim alleges that Ipso’s ruling is flawed because the article was inaccurate, discriminatory and could incite hatred. It says Ipso’s conclusions were flawed under its code and inconsistent with previous rulings. Another legal challenge is being prepared against Ipso’s ruling on the Sunday Times’ reporting of a public meeting organised last year by the Balfour Apology Campaign. It has not yet come to court. Ipso declined to comment on the judicial reviews. In its decision rejecting the complaint over the Sun article, the regulator said: “The board has no role in the consideration of individual complaints, which are adjudicated on by the complaints committee. Mr Kavanagh played no part in the consideration of this complaint.” Kavanagh stood down from the Ipso board at the end of 2017 after serving two years of a three-year term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/24/the-golf-ball-the-next-addition-to-londons-skyline","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T13:53:25Z","webTitle":"The Golf Ball: the next addition to London’s skyline?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/24/the-golf-ball-the-next-addition-to-londons-skyline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/24/the-golf-ball-the-next-addition-to-londons-skyline","fields":{"headline":"The Golf Ball: the next addition to London’s skyline?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"London’s suggestive skyline already boasts a Gherkin, a Walkie Talkie and a Cheesegrater. Soon they may be joined by the Golf Ball. According to plans seen by the Guardian, a giant glass sphere taller than St Paul’s Cathedral could be built next to the Olympic park in east London. The design for the concert venue was commissioned by the Madison Square Garden Company, which also owns the New York Knicks basketball team. MSG’s executive chairman, James Dolan, was recently accused in a US court filing of knowing about Harvey Weinstein’s alleged predatory sexual conduct. Dolan is also a financial supporter of Donald Trump. Early designs circulating for the orb suggest the venue could accommodate up to 20,000 people. Such a size would allow it to rival the O2 arena in the former Millennium Dome in Greenwich, which is operated by another US entertainment company, AEG. According to sources, MSG has commissioned Populous, the architects behind the nearby London Stadium, Wembley and the planned Bristol arena, as well as stadiums across north America. One design visualisation shows that the lower half of the orb would be fitted with tiered seating, while the upper half would form a spectacular vaulted roof. A tripod of pylons would elevate the illuminated sphere above the ground, allowing visitors to use pedestrian concourses beneath the venue. One source said the building could reach 130 metres (427ft) – comparable in height to the arch of Wembley stadium and 20m taller than St Paul’s. The designs have yet to be submitted for consent to the London Legacy Development Corporation, the planning authority for the Olympic park area. But they appear to be in tune with the LLDC’s policy that the carpark site should be used for “large-scale town centre use with supporting elements”. However, property industry sources said the site could accommodate up to 1,400 new homes, and campaigners are expected to oppose the plan because of a shortage of affordable housing in the area. The London borough of Newham, where the orb would be built, has 25,079 households on its housing waiting list. Neither MSG nor Populous would confirm or deny their involvement in the proposal, although blueprints seen by the Guardian bear the MSG logo. A spokeswoman for MSG in New York said: “We do not comment on rumour or speculation.” A spokesman for Populous said: “There’s nothing for us to say.” A previous proposal to build a “snow dome” ski centre on the site, backed by the former London mayor Boris Johnson, was scrapped in 2016. It remains unclear when the orb designs were drawn up or how likely they are to be advanced. The owner of the site is currently registered as Westfield, which operates the shopping centre directly to the west of the proposed venue. Westfield said it was “not able to comment”. If it goes ahead, the venue would be MSG’s first outside the US. The company also operates Radio City Music Hall in New York and the Forum in Inglewood, California, as well as Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, which has hosted Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Led Zeppelin and Simon and Garfunkel. MSG’s Dolan was a board member of the Weinstein Company in 2015-16, and in December he was named in a class-action lawsuit filed by six women against the film producer Harvey Weinstein. The suit alleges Dolan “knew of Weinstein’s pattern and practice of predatory sexual conduct toward women from his personal relationship with Weinstein and his position as a director of [the Weinstein Company]”. A spokeswoman for Dolan has previously said he was “confident that he acted appropriately in all matters relating to his time on the Weinstein board”. Dolan is a well-known backer of Trump and has donated to a fundraising committee called Trump Victory. He sent Radio City Music Hall’s Rockettes dancing group to perform at the US president’s inauguration. A spokeswoman for the LLDC said: “We are not in formal pre-planning discussions with any party about this site. Since the termination of the previous publicised plans for a snow dome, we have received no full applications nor held any pre-app discussions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/24/local-people-tackle-tide-of-beach-plastic-in-mumbai","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T16:54:39Z","webTitle":"Local people tackle tide of beach plastic in Mumbai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/local-people-tackle-tide-of-beach-plastic-in-mumbai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/24/local-people-tackle-tide-of-beach-plastic-in-mumbai","fields":{"headline":"Local people tackle tide of beach plastic in Mumbai","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A beach in Mumbai is looking much cleaner thanks to the efforts of local people to remove a tide of plastic waste that appears on the shore. A regular group of people, including children, use equipment donated by Bollywood stars to scour a 3km stretch of Versova beach every weekend, and have collected more than 12,000 tonnes of plastic since 2015. Their work highlights the growing problem of plastic in the seas – blamed for killing millions of sea creatures every year, and threatening the plankton and small fish at the foundations of the marine food chain. Researchers have calculated that 90% of the plastic refuse deposited in the world’s seas – dominated by tiny pellets, plastic bags and packaging – comes from just 10 rivers: two in Africa and eight in Asia. They blame poor or non-existent waste collection, and lack of education among the tens of millions of people living upstream in chronic poverty. While considerable areas of the beach are still polluted by plastic, the Sunday afternoon clean-ups have achieved a lot: once plastic reached waist-high, now couples stroll and children can play cricket on the shore. “We are clearing up the mess created by our parents,” 15-year-old Titiksha Kabra told Sky News. “If we don’t want our generation to face the problem of plastic, we have to come here and clean it up.” Plastic pollution has fast risen up the environmental and political agenda, and the issue was given prominence by the latest BBC Blue Planet series presented by David Attenborough. Highlighting the 8m tonnes of plastic added to the oceans every year, Attenborough said: “Surely we have a responsibility to care for our planet. The future of humanity, and indeed all life on earth, depends on us.” Many countries have legislated to force shops to charge for plastic bags, a measure that in the UK saw a reduction in use of as much as 85%. The study of the most polluting rivers listed the Yangtze river in China as the most polluting, while two Indian rivers, the Indus and the Ganges, were also on the list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/26/salman-rushdie-the-books-that-changed-me","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Salman Rushdie: ‘I couldn’t finish Middlemarch.

The pleasure of re-reading Buddenbrooks was so deep that I resolved to embark on a year of re-readings, which is why I now find myself about halfway through the first book of Don Quixote, in the terrific Edith Grossman translation. This is proving to be a more complicated encounter. On the one hand, the characters of Quixote and Sancho Panza are as beautifully realised as I remember them, and the idea of a man determinedly seeing the world according to his own vision, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, feels strikingly contemporary. On the other hand, how many more times are the Knight of the Dolorous Countenance and Sancho going to get beaten up and left in pain in various roadside ditches? The “greatest novel ever written” – I voted for it myself once – turns out to be just a little bit repetitive. To make the reading easier, I’m breaking it up and reading other books by other authors after every couple of hundred pages of Cervantes. At present, that interposed book is David Grossman’s wonderful A Horse Walks into a Bar. The book that changed my life Truthfully, the books that changed my life were books I wrote myself, not books I read. When Midnight’s Children was published in 1981 I was hoping that a few people who were not friends or relations of mine might read and like it. I was completely unprepared for what happened. It gave me the life I had always wanted, a writer’s life, and for most of the 1980s I lived that life with real gratitude and happiness. Then in 1988 another book changed my life in another way. But in spite of everything that followed the publication of The Satanic Verses I remain proud of it. And strangely I’m grateful for it, too. Its troubled pathway has taught me a lot about how to live, and what to live for. The book I wish I’d written There are too many of these, of course, but if I have to choose one, then (today, anyway) I’ll choose Kafka’s Metamorphosis. Transformations have been important in my own work, but the transformation of poor Gregor Samsa is the archetype of this kind of story. His own deluded conviction that it will somehow be all right and he will return to being the person he formerly was is painful to read, and his rejection by everyone close to him even more painful. It’s also short. Five hundred pages of the sad case of the giant bug would probably be unbearable. Fifty pages … unbeatable. The book that influenced my writing When I was starting out, long before I published anything, I fell under the spell of Pynchon’s mammoth novel Gravity’s Rainbow. I wrote an entire draft of a novel called The Antagonist, set mainly in Ladbroke Grove, which was such an obvious pastiche of the mighty Tom as to be unpublishable. Fortunately, I worked this out in time, and never submitted it. The typescript now languishes among my papers in the archives of Emory University in Atlanta, where scholarly masochists can read it, if they must. These days I have, I think, shaken off Pynchon’s influence. However, thanks to a favourable review I wrote of one of his later novels, I was able to meet the famously invisible man. I had dinner with him at Sonny Mehta’s apartment in Manhattan and found him very satisfyingly Pynchonesque. At the end of dinner I thought, well, now we’re friends, and maybe we’ll see each other from time to time. He never called again. The book that is most underrated Juan Rulfo’s only novel, Pedro Páramo, is recognised as a classic in the original Spanish, but many English-language readers seem unaware of it. This is the novel Gabriel García Márquez read so many times he claimed to have memorised it, and in Rulfo’s phantasmal Comala we clearly see the origins of Macondo. The book that changed my mind I can think of books that made little explosions in my mind, showing me literary possibilities I hadn’t dreamed of until I read them. James Joyce’s Ulysses was one such book. Jorge Luis Borges’s Fictions (Ficciones) was another, and three stories from that collection, “Death and the Compass”, “Funes the Memorious” and “The Garden of Forking Paths” have never left me, and still help me to think about what I’m doing, or might do, or should never try to do. The last book that made me cry I don’t cry when reading. Watching movies at home alone is another story. The last book that made me laugh Gary Shteyngart’s Super Sad True Love Story. That, or PG Wodehouse’s The Code of the Woosters. The book I couldn’t finish The humiliating answer I’m always obliged to give to this question is Middlemarch. I know, I know. I’ll try again. The book I’m most ashamed not to have read Writer friends speak to me constantly of the joys of Anthony Trollope, but I haven’t discovered them. That’s quite a lot of books to be ashamed of not having read. The book I most often give as a gift I don’t have a book that I regularly gift, I’m afraid. The last book I gave as a gift was a first edition of The Negro Mother, and other Dramatic Recitations by Langston Hughes. The book I’d like to be remembered for Readers’ responses to the novels I wrote for my sons, Haroun and the Sea of Stories and its sort-of-sequel, Luka and the Fire of Life, have brought me so much happiness that it would be great if they were the ones that survived.

The Academy is already heaving at 8pm for the arrival of one of pop’s odder current phenomena. Screaming/streaming sensations Asking Alexandria are from the unlikely metal bastion of York, more synonymous with Terry’s chocolate and Shed Seven than screamo, metalcore and the various amalgams of teen-friendly hard rock. And yet here they’re rocking the house with their bizarre fusion of guttural thrash and arena-sized 80s choruses, a la Europe’s The Final Countdown. The guitarists headbang in unison and theatrically flounce about like a metal Ballet Rambert, while singer Danny Worsnop demonstrates that, by heck, a bloke born in little Gilberdyke in North Yorkshire can develop an American accent and sing like a Dalek. “Motherfuckers, we’re back,” he roars – and so is he, having already left the band (acrimoniously, upon which he recorded a country-influenced album) and returned, in true Spinal Tap fashion. They’ve since hugged and made up, but there does seem to be a slight musical gulf between the hoarse-tonsilled frontman and the band’s sheet-metal guitars and twiddly bits. He earnestly sings “here’s one from the heart” in Someone Somewhere – a distant relation of David Bowie’s Rock’n’Roll Suicide for modern alienated adolescents – and when things go acoustic he seems to unleash a fantasy alter ego as a dustbowl-dwelling, Jon Bon Jovi-style balladeer. No such seriousness with Black Veil Brides, whose grand entrance features air punching and a stool-standing drummer. Four lifesize Ron Wood dolls fronted by an American version of Depeche Mode’s David Gahan, they’re an explosion of vertical black hair, studded belts, leather jackets, uncomfortably tight trousers and silly-shaped guitars, with a drum barrage like something from the Napoleonic wars. With their Kiss-sized, bellow-friendly choruses – at least one of which goes “I’ll never let you steal my coffin” – and truckloads of whoa-ohs, the Ohioans are the Hold Steady of hair metal, the closest thing today’s youth will experience to the hilarious, now largely extinct 80s rock troglodytes captured in Penelope Spheeris’s tragicomic rockumentary The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: the Metal Years. However, they have better songs than many of those bands ever had, and epic anthems such as When They Call My Name (which features bells – and presumably a whistle) prompt crowd hysteria. “Uh ohh! Uh ohh!” yell the band in Wake Up. “Uh ohh! Uh ohh!” reply the audience, who squeal as guitarist Jinxx reappears playing violin, wearing a top hat. Birmingham is treated to a wonderful real-life Tap moment when singer Andy Biersack admits: “This is really embarrassing, but I’ve forgotten where we are,” to shrieks of Brummie hilarity. But for all the silliness, the American – who commands the swaying crowd like a demented conductor – seems genuinely touched by the screaming adoration. When they end with – but of course – In the End, the screams of “we want more” are louder than the band (a considerable achievement). Black Veil Brides are not so much a guilty pleasure as one requiring outright penitence, but – whisper it – they are a fantastic live experience. At 02 Academy, Manchester, 24 January.

The volunteers, all members of the Arizona-based group No More Deaths, appeared in court on Tuesday charged with a variety of offences including driving in a wilderness area, entering a wildlife refuge without a permit and abandoning property – the latter an apparent reference to leaving water, food and blankets on migrant trails. The charges came a week after No More Deaths, a coalition of religious and community activists, published a report accusing border patrol agents of condemning migrants to death by sabotaging water containers and other supplies. It also accused agents of harassing volunteers in the field. Hours after the report’s publication one activist, Scott Warren, 35, was arrested and charged with harboring two undocumented immigrants, a felony. No More Deaths stopped short of calling it retaliation for the report but said the timing was suspicious. Warren was among the eight who appeared in court this week. It is a separate case which predates the report; the defendants started receiving summonses last month. However, No More Deaths said the charges fit a pattern of interference in efforts to save the lives of migrants who trek for days or weeks across harsh deserts which bake by day and freeze by night. “The charges also come during a nationwide crackdown on immigrant rights organizers, while the Trump administration seeks to end Daca, and increase deportations, potentially forcing thousands more into the dangerous desert journey,” it said in a statement on Wednesday. The charges relate to activities in Cabeza Prieta national wildlife refuge, which covers more than 800,000 acres of remote desert along Arizona’s border with Mexico. Some 32 sets of human remains were found there last year, according to the Pima County office of the medical examiner, making it one of the region’s deadliest crossing routes. It has few natural water sources. Border patrol agents have free rein in the refuge but activists are denied permission to use administrative roads and since July last year are banned from leaving humanitarian supplies, said No More Deaths. Sid Slone, the refuge manager, told the Guardian activists have the same access as the general public. He declined to elaborate on migrant and humanitarian activity in the refuge, citing the legal case. Border crossers are advised to drink between five to 12 litres of water daily, depending on conditions. Few manage to carry more than seven litres even though journeys can last weeks. The No More Deaths report said water containers were vandalised 415 times, on average twice a week, in an 800 sq mile patch of desert south-west of Tucson, between 2012 and 2015. It said border patrol agents were the main culprits, citing video and other evidence. The border patrol said it does not condone such vandalism and that rescue beacons and search, trauma and rescue units often save migrants’ lives. The agency tangled with activists on occasion during the Bush and Obama administrations but there has been a marked uptick since Donald Trump entered the White House. Dozens of agents entered a No More Deaths encampment last June and removed migrants who were receiving medical care. The Guardian accompanied Warren, the activist facing felony charges, in 2015 when he inspected water supplies left at Organ Pipe Cactus national monument. “It’s satisfying to know people are getting the water,” said Warren, an Arizona State University instructor. Last Wednesday, the day of the report, border patrol agents detained him in the town of Ajo on suspicion of supplying food, water and clean clothes to two undocumented migrants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/25/students-sit-in-university-social-cleaning-london-stop-elephant-castle","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T10:51:02Z","webTitle":"We’re staging a sit-in to stop our university’s social cleansing plans | Sahaya James","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/students-sit-in-university-social-cleaning-london-stop-elephant-castle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/students-sit-in-university-social-cleaning-london-stop-elephant-castle","fields":{"headline":"We’re staging a sit-in to stop our university’s social cleansing plans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Tuesday night we occupied University of Arts London’s (UAL) London College of Communication (LCC) building to demand our university puts a stop to its disastrous development plans in Elephant and Castle. The university has entered into a partnership with the property firm Delancey, with a plan to knock down the much-loved Elephant and Castle shopping centre opposite the Southwark campus – home to 70 local, mostly black, Asian and minority ethnic-owned businesses – in order to build luxury apartments and a new campus. Delancey has made provision for a paltry 3% of the 1,000 new flats to be available at an affordable rent, while businesses and market traders based in the shopping centre will be turfed out, without any coherent plan in place for their relocation or any guarantee of a right to return at the end of the process. Elephant and Castle has been at the centre of a decades-long sweep of aggressive gentrification – most famously the demolition of the Heygate estate, home to 3,000 people, later to be replaced by Lendlease’s Elephant Park luxury housing development. Although communities in Southwark have come together to fight plan after plan, the market forces working against them, in combination with a lack of central government funding for housing, have often been too powerful to resist. The last decade has seen a slow transformation of Elephant and Castle. Some might describe this as a regeneration, but certainly not the former residents of council estates and other affordable housing in the area who over the years have been forcibly “decanted”. When we were out flyering for the 19 January protest at Southwark council, many residents of the area would say the same thing to us: “Why are you fighting this? Don’t you know it already happened 10, 15 years ago?” What is at stake here is not just the much-loved shopping centre, but the destruction of entire communities and cultures. The grand visions of community regeneration the developers have promised over the years, always seem to result instead in the replacement of social housing and community facilities with swathes of gleaming luxury apartments unaffordable to any but the richest of the rich, and streets of Pret a Manger coffee shops. And premium developments such as these do not only destroy communities, they have a direct effect on house prices in London too, making the city less and less liveable for young people and students. Last week, Southwark council’s planning committee, in a surprise turn, voted by four votes to three to reject the development plan after weeks of trying to win community support for the scheme. UAL and Delancey have publicly stated that they will contest this vote at a council meeting on 30 January scheduled originally for a discussion of the “reasons for refusal” of the plan. In the public statements they issued following the planning committee vote, both Delancey and UAL make reference to the importance of ensuring the LCC is able to build its new campus so it can stay in the area and continue various outreach projects in the community. This is an attempt to whitewash the destructive and poorly thought-through plan using UAL’s prestigious reputation. The institution publicly stands by commitments to social justice, diversity, and inclusivity, but its plans would achieve the opposite of these. UAL plays a key role in whether or not the project will go ahead. Despite motions passed by all the unions on campus – GMB, Unison and the students’ union – encouraging UAL’s management to drop the plan, so far it has refused to acknowledge the council planning meeting vote. We students will not give up. We will not be leaving until UAL listens to our demands and the demands of the community, and condemns the plans as what they are: social cleansing. • Sahaya James is campaigns officer at Arts SU, the University of the Arts London’s students’ union, a member of the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts national committee and is standing to be president of the NUS"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/jan/26/michael-gove-you-were-doing-so-well-then-you-attacked-civil-servants-again","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T07:32:40Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove, you were doing so well.

Then you attacked civil servants again","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last Sunday morning, I was in my pyjamas, wiping baby sick off my sleeves when, scrolling through the news on my phone I saw the headline “Gove rants at clock-watching civil servants”. I didn’t so much spit my coffee out in shock as sigh with the heavy heart of a teacher catching a recidivist pupil making a nuisance of himself again. Yes, Michael, we’ve had our past troubles with you calling civil servants names and making evidence-free accusations of professionals breaking civil service impartiality. But only two weeks ago in departmental emails you were praising the diligence, determination and passion of staff at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We seemed to be making progress. Yet here we are again with more baseless claims, this time of “civil servants working 12 hours and taking two days off” and “going home early on Wednesdays”. Members of the FDA union, whom I represent in Defra, were less than impressed to find out that while their secretary of state was serving up kind words internally he was bad-mouthing them to his cabinet colleagues as clock-watching plodders. The facts are these: in the FDA’s most recent working hours survey (pdf) , 95% of respondents in Defra reported working more than their contracted hours every week, while 90% of respondents felt excessive hours were a problem in the department. A further 60% of respondents did not take their full annual leave entitlement, reporting that they felt unable to due to workload pressures. Half the staff in the senior civil service in Defra work the equivalent of an extra day a week in unpaid additional hours, while one in five work the equivalent of an extra two days unpaid every week. A far cry from knocking off early on a Wednesday. Defra not only provides essential services for the nation, it is also one of the government departments most impacted by Brexit. And yet there are still hundreds of unfilled Brexit positions in the department, leaving work to be picked up by existing staff. On top of this, the government is pressing ahead with spending cuts to the department and relying on excessive unpaid hours to keep the ship afloat. This problem of long, unremunerated hours is endemic across the civil service, so one might expect an experienced cabinet minister like Gove to be aware of the issues, but it seems that he can’t resist using Whitehall as a convenient punching bag when it suits, posing as a self-appointed expert on the civil service. Well, to paraphrase a prominent public figure, FDA members have had enough of self-appointed experts. I have written to Gove asking him to clarify whether he made the reported comments and whether they reflect his views on civil servants’ working patterns in Defra. I have also invited him to meet me to discuss the problem of excessive hours in Defra and how we can tackle it. This is not a “see me after school” note, but an opportunity for a mature dialogue about the proper resourcing of the civil service to meet government commitments. I and my members are waiting for a response. Steven Littlewood is national officer for the FDA union, representing managers and professionals in public service.

His success was remarkable as he had no scientific training and completed his A-levels only after joining the Board of Trade in his teens in 1961. Paul was born in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), to an English mother, Maud (nee Godden Griffiths), and a Danish father, Carl, a civil servant. His childhood was turbulent as his parents fought constantly. When they finally separated, Maud returned to Britain with Paul and his younger brother, Michael, settling in Hastings, where the boys went to the local grammar school. While Paul was still studying for his A-levels his struggling mother packed him off with £1 and the name of a contact in a London hostel to start work as a clerical officer at the Board of Trade. He lived in the hostel, working at London Zoo at the weekends to earn more money, and studied alone for his A-levels. However, he managed to rise through the ranks of the civil service. He worked on the Committee of Inquiry into Civil Aviation, which led to the Edwards report of 1969. He then went to the British embassy in Paris, negotiating traffic rights for British airlines. After two years as assistant secretary to the National Enterprise Board, in 1981 he became secretary of the newly formed British Technology Group. His next posting, in 1985, on promotion to assistant secretary in the DTI’s finance division, saw him at his most determined and creative as he pushed the DTI towards the fundamental realignment of the civil service into executive agencies following the Robin Ibbs “Next Steps” report of 1988. This led directly to his appointment to the Patent Office as it became one of the early “Next Step” agencies. Among his successes was the reversal of the downward trend of UK patent applications and the elimination of the backlog of trademark applications, which helped to secure the viability of the UK Patent Office. He retired early in 1999 because of heart trouble. The same year, he was made Companion of the Order of the Bath. Paul and I married in 1966. He is survived by me and by our two sons, Christopher and Michael, and three grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/26/gavin-williamson-ruthless-brilliant-and-a-little-bit-alan-partridge","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T18:15:28Z","webTitle":"Gavin Williamson: ruthless, brilliant and a little bit Alan Partridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/26/gavin-williamson-ruthless-brilliant-and-a-little-bit-alan-partridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/26/gavin-williamson-ruthless-brilliant-and-a-little-bit-alan-partridge","fields":{"headline":"Gavin Williamson: ruthless, brilliant and a little bit Alan Partridge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Far from uniquely in Westminster, Gavin Williamson’s self-image doesn’t always accord with how others see him. The 41-year-old defence secretary cultivates the aura of a modern-day Machiavelli, with a pet tarantula in a tank in his office signifying a ruthless approach to his enemies. The biggest noise he has made so far at the Ministry of Defence was his blood-curdling call for the deaths of British citizens who travelled to Syria to fight for Islamic State. It is arguably illegal, but it was a politically astute suggestion, pleasing voters on the right. He is the proud owner of a Falklands war-era Land Rover, which “epitomises everything that is so fantastic about Great Britain: a go anywhere do anything attitude”. In his maiden speech as MP for South Staffordshire in June 2010, he announced himself as “a straight talker” and urged the country to rediscover “the Victorian spirit of ingenuity and inventiveness”. His antennae are well-tuned to the interests of the readers of the Sun and the Daily Mail. One acquaintance described him as “sociable and free of the superior air of so many Tories”. Understandably, the married father of two’s rapid rise from backbencher via the whip’s office to defence secretary in just seven years has seen his confidence soar. But some see him as slightly comic; an over-promoted upstart out of his depth in one of the biggest offices of state. When Theresa May appointed him to defence following the resignation of Michael Fallon after a sexual harassment scandal, the Conservative backbencher Sarah Wollaston remarked: “There are times when offered a job that it would be better to advise that another would be more experienced and suited to the role.” Even Williamson himself admitted to his local newspaper that he was “flabbergasted” to be offered the job by the prime minister, something critics took with a pinch of salt, suspecting that he had knifed Fallon to win the office for himself. Soon after, he clashed with Philip Hammond in the House of Commons over a briefing from an ally of the chancellor that compared the defence secretary to Private Pike, the weedy character in the BBC comedy Dad’s Army. As people rushed to find out who he was – there was reportedly some frantic Googling in the MoD – those looking at his social media accounts compared him to Steve Coogan’s comic creation Alan Partridge. Posts on Williamson’s Instagram feed include: “Very pleased with my new garden incinerator only £14.99 from #aldi, cracking good value. Question is could we make use of one in the whips office?” and “You can’t beat a small treat such as Car magazine. Much cheaper than actually buying a new car.” Kate Moody, who sold him the tarantula, told BBC Radio 4: “He said it may have been a midlife crisis. It was a sports car or a tarantula and the tarantula won.” Williamson was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in June 1976 to Labour-voting parents, Ray and Beverley. He went to comprehensive school before studying social science at Bradford University. In 2001 he married Joanne Eland and worked managing a pottery in Staffordshire and then an architectural design firm. He was elected to Staffordshire county council aged 25 and then in 2005 – still not 30 – failed in his first parliamentary election. He was elected at his second attempt and after roles as parliamentary private secretary to several ministers he was selected for the same job by David Cameron. He voted for remain in the Brexit referendum, partly out of loyalty to Cameron. After he ran May’s leadership campaign she appointed him chief whip and he was “brilliant”, according to Nick Timothy, May’s former chief of staff. Williamson was pivotal in the deal struck with the Democratic Unionist party to keep the Tory minority government in power and May “rated him”, said Timothy. He arrived at the MoD in November just as the military was facing cuts including a reduction in the size of the army and the reduction of some assault ships. “He was dealt a really hard hand being brought in without any experience at the tail end of a defence review,” said a senior defence industry insider. “He came in not really understanding what it all meant apart from it was bad news politically. Quite a number of Conservative MPs were up in arms about [the cuts].” But Williamson sees how the role can further his own ambitions, say observers, especially if he can secure extra defence funding, with figures, including Michael Gove, considering him a contender for the party leadership. “He’s not a traditional Conservative,” said the defence insider. “He doesn’t have a public school background. He is from a middle-class northern background which is what the Conservatives need more of.” • This article was amended on 29 January 2018. An earlier version said Scarborough was in east Yorkshire.

The only surprise is its spectacularly inappropriate name, Operation Olive Branch. Ankara’s antipathy to the prospect of an autonomous or independent Kurdish state is longstanding. But the conflict is supercharged by the ambitions and jockeying of the various powers with their hands in this crisis. “My enemy’s enemy is my friend” is a maxim of short-term convenience, not long-term commitment. The US needed the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defence Forces to take on Islamic State – particularly given Turkey’s lack of interest in assisting until late in the day. Ankara grudgingly tolerated the situation and sought to contain it. But with the collapse of Isis’s so-called caliphate, the kaleidoscope has shifted, and the fact that “my ally’s ally is my enemy” is in focus again. The Kurds hoped to establish a corridor along the north-western border with Turkey and believed their contribution to the fight against Isis helped make the case for a self-governing region within a federalised Syria. Turkey’s hostility to those territorial ambitions has been inflamed by the US’s patronage – not least because it fears those weapons could be turned upon its citizens, since it regards the Kurdish militia and the party backing it as the Syrian wing of a terror group which has fought a long insurgency in Turkey. The US announcement of plans for a 30,000-strong SDF-based “border force” was described as a “terror army”by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The last straw was the US secretary of state’s remarks that American troops would remain in Syria indefinitely, effectively offering a military guarantee to the Kurds. America’s goals are to prevent Isis cells re-emerging in liberated areas, and to maintain influence in the region, resisting Moscow’s attempts to stitch up a Syria settlement. Washington has upped the pressure by holding Russia responsible for gas attacks on civilians. But despite its multiplying differences with Ankara – particularly following 2016’s failed coup, and the refusal to extradite the cleric that Mr Erdoğan blames for it – it needs to keep its Nato ally onside. Last month Mr Erdoğan denounced Bashar al-Assad as a terrorist mass murderer with no place in Syria’s future – hardening a position which appeared to have softened recently. But Turkey and Iran are co-sponsoring Vladimir Putin’s Syrian dialogue this month, which western countries fear could be used to outflank the UN process and reach a deal leaving Mr Assad in place. Mr Erdoğan’s relations with Mr Putin are better than ever, after the nadir of 2016, when Turkey shot down a Russian jet. Moscow moved personnel from Afrin and allowed the Turkish strikes in airspace it controls. For the Kremlin, what’s not to like? As well as pushing forward its own deal, it sees a chance to influence the Kurds, who have tilted towards the US, and to enlarge divisions within Nato. It may also be keeping Mr Assad on his toes. Mixed and contradictory messages from the US administration are making matters worse, but the underlying problem is that so many parties are pursuing such complex and conflicting ambitions. While the US and Turkey may yet reach a deal for the sake of their own interests, the prospects of a solution are at least matched by the risks of further destabilisation in a tormented region. Everyone expected this to happen. No one knows how it will end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/men-only-clubs-and-menace-how-the-establishment-maintains-male-power","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Men-only clubs and menace: how the establishment maintains male power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/men-only-clubs-and-menace-how-the-establishment-maintains-male-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/men-only-clubs-and-menace-how-the-establishment-maintains-male-power","fields":{"headline":"Men-only clubs and menace: how the establishment maintains male power","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"How much more shock do we have the energy to articulate? How many more times do we need to become enraged at the status quo before something changes? The Financial Times’ scoop on the behaviour of senior city figures at the Presidents Club gala charity dinner has unleashed new fury about the institutionalised acceptance of harassment of women. But what is particularly depressing about this exposé is that it simply captures in slightly sharper focus a reality with which we should all be very familiar. A brilliant piece of undercover reporting revealed extraordinary details of how senior City executives behave behind closed doors. We heard that young women hired for the evening (on the basis that they were “tall, thin and pretty”) were told by the recruiter to expect “annoying” behaviour at the male-only event. They were given wine before the evening began, apparently to give them dutch courage. The women duly reported how men repeatedly put hands up their skirts and pulled them on to their laps; one guest decided to expose his penis to a hostess. The event was unusually grim but, with a business culture that remains stubbornly male-dominated, should we be surprised? We know that many male City employees still go to lapdancing clubs for a fun night out. We know City organisations have struggled in their vaunted attempts to get more women on boards. While companies are bravely talking about their efforts to redress the gender pay gap (large employers will be compelled to report details of how they pay their male and female staff in April), we know that women are, on average, much worse paid than men throughout the City. Broadly, power remains in men’s hands. The response to this latest scandal has taken a familiar turn, dividing along gender lines. While senior women have condemned it, many of the Financial Times’ (male) readers have expressed unhappy bemusement at finding this article on the front page. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, says: “If even half of what’s been written about this event is true, it is deplorable and confirms how far we have still to go to stamp out sexual harassment. We can – and must – do better than this.” But in the reader comments section beneath the FT piece, many couldn’t understand what all the fuss was about. “I’m surprised to see the FT reporting this sort of thing,” one person wrote. Another commented: “As long as all parties were properly informed, I see no problem.” One concluded: “I’m amazed by the puritanical tone of this piece. What a boring, self-righteous place Britain is becoming.” There was no tedious self-righteousness on the night of the gala event. The charity auction invited bids for a night out at the Windmill Club (a lapdancing venue in Soho) and a course of plastic surgery, offered as an opportunity to “Add spice to your wife”. One guest asked a woman working there if she was a prostitute. Another guest told a female “hostess” that she looked too sober, gave her some alcohol, and told her: “I want you to down that glass, rip off your knickers and dance on that table.” Women working that night told the Financial Times that they found the experience frightening. For Fairbairn, this event just stands at the extreme end of a spectrum of male-friendly business socialising, a culture that explicitly or implicitly excludes women, and that has for decades smoothed the path of male advancement. The key lesson is not that events such as this one should not be happening, but that a more fundamental change needs to be made to the nature of business networking to allow women to participate. “The fact is that many more men go to black-tie dinners than women, even proportional to the leadership teams in business, because of the choices that women make and the priorities that they have and the juggling that they are doing around family life,” says Fairbairn. This applies to corporate hosting of weekend sports events, as well as evening events of any variety. “We need to find ways of making the social side of business much more inclusive,” she adds. “This is just an extreme example, but there is a real question here about why women are choosing not to take leadership roles, why, when they get to a position of seniority, they may choose to take a step back. I think that has a lot to do with a sense of belonging and whether it is a culture they want to be part of. There is a lot of reflection to be done.” She has been pushing the CBI to hold more of its events at lunchtime or in the early evening, to make them compatible with family life. “We get far more women coming along.” Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality party, says the event needs to be seen in the context of recent sexual harassment claims at Westminster and the scandals emerging around abuse in international sport and Hollywood. “The shock that has been expressed at this event is revulsion at something we walk across the top of every day,” she says. “It’s not just the City, it’s everywhere. The scene described in the FT is just the rotten underpinning of it all. And when we raise our voices to protest, we are told we are being shrill.” Why should we be surprised at the gala dinner “hostesses” being required to wear “black underwear and black sexy shoes”, when female receptionists at City front desks are still required to wear heels and makeup, and when Richard Branson continues to think no press conference is complete without him picking up an air hostess and turning her upside down? These attitudes are still so entrenched that it’s hard to maintain consistent outrage. The charity event at the Dorchester has been going on for more than 30 years and snippets about what happens there occasionally emerge – in 2010, at the height of the recession, it was, according to a report in the Independent, a “majestic” event sponsored by HSBC, where “the boys tucked into the girls”. You cast a jaundiced eye at reports like this, and then try to forget how dismal the City remains. The conviction that men should be allowed to be men stretches far beyond the City. It is worth remembering that many senior establishment men cling firmly to their right to spend time in men-only environments outside of the world of finance. Anyone shocked by the idea of 360 men from business, politics and finance gathering at the all-male Presidents Club annual dinner should note that men-only clubs continue to flourish throughout London. Mostly, the atmosphere is tamer, and has none of the sexual harassment present at the Presidents Club, but these remain establishments where powerful men can spend time together without women. Environment secretary Michael Gove and former attorney general Dominic Grieve belong to the private members, men-only Garrick Club in London, as do actors Hugh Bonneville, Damian Lewis and Stephen Fry, along with broadcasters John Simpson, Jeremy Paxman and Melvyn Bragg and a handful of supreme court judges. Baroness Hale, president of the supreme court, has expressed her despair at judges’ membership of men-only institutions, but to no effect. “I regard it as quite shocking that so many of my colleagues belong to the Garrick Club, but they don’t see what all the fuss is about,” she has said. If asked, Garrick members protest that the club is not a networking environment and that discussing work inside the building is frowned upon. But it’s a nonsense to pretend that important invisible connections are not forged in these clubs. The Travellers Club in central London, which has historically been a crucial meeting place for diplomats, continues to refuse female membership. In 2012, members expressed embarrassment that female ambassadors from around the world were unable to join, and issued a proposal to allow “lady heads of some diplomatic missions in London to be accorded honorary membership for the duration of their tenure”. The motion was rejected. A leaked consultation on the possibility of female membership in 2014 revealed male concerns that the arrival of women would jeopardise the club’s reputation as a place where men can enjoy “male banter, without having to bother with the etiquette that one inevitably must adhere to in female company (whether it be offering her drinks, waiting for her to eat, or standing when she arrives or leaves)”. Another member said his experience of mixed clubs where “one does unfortunately encounter lady members, is that their presence leads to very different and far less enjoyable themes of conversation”. Other male-only clubs are still thriving, such as White’s (where David Cameron was a member, until he decided it would be wise to resign), and Brooks’s, where senior City figures are often members. These clubs exist, hidden in plain sight. Another, very different exposé of profound inequality is unfolding on the government’s gender pay-gap equality website, where the precise details of how all companies with more than 250 employees are paying their staff are gradually being logged. So far, only 655 out of about 9,000 companies have provided details (with most holding back, presumably concerned about potential reputational damage). We do know already, for example, that women who work for Virgin Money are paid on average 32.5% less an hour than men, and that, while 72.6% of the lowest-paid workers in this company are women, they make up just 35% of the best-paid workers; women’s bonus pay at Virgin Money is on average 45.3% lower than men’s. At easyJet, women’s average hourly rate is 51.7% lower than men’s, 89.3% of the best-paid employees are men (while 68.9% of the worst-paid members of staff are women), and female bonus pay is 43.8% lower. Robustly welcoming the initiative, Accenture UK (where female bonus pay is 52% lower than males; and where 72% of the best-paid employees are men) declares that it has an “unwavering commitment to gender equality”. With such huge disparities between how men and women are paid, and so few women in top-paid roles, it’s easy to understand how events such as the Presidents Club gala are tolerated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2018/feb/04/north-york-moors-new-cycling-hub","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T11:00:49Z","webTitle":"Cycling the North York Moors – a galaxy on my doorstep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/feb/04/north-york-moors-new-cycling-hub","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/feb/04/north-york-moors-new-cycling-hub","fields":{"headline":"Cycling the North York Moors – a galaxy on my doorstep","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The best trips, I reckon, are those where you arrive home feeling like you’ve been to the other side of the cosmos. And the strange thing is that those trips don’t have to involve travelling very far – or remortgaging the house. I’m on a mission to see how close to home I can find such a trip. Not only that, but how cheaply it can be done, and how easily arranged. When someone mentions Fryup Dale, my “other end of the cosmos” radar lights up. It is on the North York Moors, has an irresistible name, and no one I know has heard of it. I leap into action. On an OS map I locate Fryup, and realise, with a shock, that I know nothing of these valleys: Great Fryup, Little Fryup, Glaisdale, Kildale and Baysdale. A new cycling centre, the Yorkshire Cycle Hub, complete with bunkhouse, cafe and cottages, is opening. I ring Phil, who runs the place with his wife, Sarah. He’s the son of a local retired farmer and a keen mountain biker. “The idea came from seeing cycling centres in Oregon. We loved them so much, we decided to bring their spirit and style back home.” He goes on to explain that he’s not offering any dedicated mountain bike tracks. “There’s no red, blue and black – the normal type of trails you might expect. But this is a wonderful area for cycle exploration – on either road or mountain bikes. You could try the Epic – it’s a 52km mountain bike circuit.” “How long does that take?” There is a pause. “It’s quite tough. Actually, no one has ever completed it.” This is it, I think: the far side of the galaxy on my doorstep. I book a stay at the centre’s cottage and set about building an expedition team. My own family all refuse. They’ve been to the other side of the universe with me before. But an unwary friend signs up with two of his children: Laurie, eight, who doesn’t like cycling uphill, and Martha, 12, who doesn’t like cycling at all. I’m nursing a shoulder injury; Robbie has back problems. It’s an expedition in the great tradition of British exploration: incompetent, badly prepared and certain to be remembered for a long time. We arrange to meet at the cottage late on a Friday night. I pack flapjacks. Driving over the moors at night proves the perfect introduction to my intergalactic expedition. After Kirkbymoorside on the southern edge of the national park, darkness engulfs me. Far away to the east, the lights of the coast twinkle like a distant constellation. I pass the Lion Inn on Blakey Ridge, all lit up in the emptiness and surely one of the remotest pubs in Britain. Then I turn on to a single-track lane, a wriggling wormhole that eventually drops me into Great Fryup dale. The cottage sits in the heart of the dale with a horizon of black moors. A few lights show from farms, but otherwise this is a great stargazing spot. Robbie turns up with two sleepy children. He and I sit round the log fire, eat the flapjacks and drink rum. “Your two not keen on cycling uphill?” I ask. “It’ll be fine,” he says. Next morning, we head for the cafe,hoping for breakfast. Phil and Sarah do not disappoint. We opt for the Great Fryup – local sausages, black pudding, eggs and so on. The cafe is in a converted barn with superb views. Upstairs, the bunk rooms are a cut above others I’ve seen. For evening meals there’s a good pub two miles away. Sarah stands us in front of a large map and points out some potential routes. “I suggest you take the road up here, then do a huge horseshoe along this trail. That section is actually part of the Epic.” The mechanic is already lining up our bikes and I heave myself aboard, wondering if that extra slice of toast had been a good idea. Laurie is distracted by all the farm animals: sheep, cows and horses in stone-walled fields. Chickens skitter across the road and there’s a red postbox with Victorian insignia. “Is this Real Yorkshire?” asks Laurie. “Can we live here?” We cross a cattle grid and the lane kicks up. Laurie gets off and walks, which spurs Martha to pedal powerfully on. I try to hang on to her wheel. Finally at the top, she throws her bike down, lies down in the middle of the road and goes to sleep. There is, of course, no traffic at all, but this makes me unaccountably nervous. “Martha,” I say, “that may not be the best place to rest.” No answer. Then a fake sarcastic snore. Martha, I’m realising, may prove the toughest member of our expedition. When Robbie and Laurie arrive, we leave the road and begin the trail around the head of Fryup dale. This is a wonderful swooping trail to do at high speed. Fall here and, with a bit of luck, you would land on heather. Robbie falls. My shoulder pings. Laurie and Martha nail it. For lunch we hide from the biting wind in a grouse butt, listening to the chuckles of birds and admiring the vast panoramas. After a couple more hours on the bikes, and an unscheduled dip in an excessively large puddle for me, we return. Laurie and Martha disappear into the cottage. “Everything’s new. Can we live here?” Robbie and I examine the Epic route. Maybe next time? Phil is optimistically planning a leader board and prizes. At sunset I drive home across the moors. I’ve been away from home for only a night, yet I feel I’ve made the jump to hyperspace and back. • The trip was provided by Yorkshire Cycle Hub and North York Moors national park North York Moors national park.

You never quite know what you’re getting. The last Showcase series, The Polybius Conspiracy, was addictively enjoyable, but suffered a backlash when listeners realised that its tale wasn’t a real-life story, but a carefully crafted, impeccably researched drama. Personally, I enjoyed being fooled and slowly realising, but others got cross: “I feel so dumb and really disappointed,” said one. “Why didn’t they just say it wasn’t real?” It’s interesting. Podcasting is still a young medium, and nearly every one of its breakout hits is based on fact. Drama series, such as Homecoming or Limetown, choose realism over flights of fancy – they’re made to seem as though they’re factual. Often, actual works of fiction only become valued once real life is brought in, as with My Dad Wrote a Porno or The Worst Idea of All Time. Facts are a podcasting fundamental. I was thinking about this while listening to Showcase’s new series, Secrets. We’re two episodes in. Producer Martin Johnson gave the series an eye-rollingly pompous introduction – “We all have them. Secrets. Small precious boxes of memories. Of something that can’t be shared” – but Secrets is an odder, more interesting show than this makes it seem. There are two elements. First, fellow producer Mohamed El Abed gradually reveals his own story of secrets, based around his family. Each episode brings more insights. This is kind of interesting; but only kind of. Far more fascinating is the second element of the show: the interviews that come after Abed’s own story. The first episode featured Neil Woods, a British cop who went undercover as a heroin addict to get evidence on gangster drug dealers. It was astonishingly absorbing. In the second, we heard from Norwegian wildlife photographer Terje Hellesø. In 2011, the well-respected Hellesø was exposed for making fake photographs of the natural world. In Secrets, he says this: “I’m not that worried about showing something as it looks. To me it’s more important trying to work forward symbolism, personal feelings, more than showing how anything just looked like.” In other words, he fictionalises real life to reveal what he believes to be its truth. But people don’t like that. They want his pictures to be literally true. They want the world to be romantic and astonishing, for real. They want facts, especially where and when they expect them. For facts, you go to the BBC. And here is food writer Bee Wilson with her excellent new series about sugar, Sweetness and Desire. I very much enjoyed her unpicking of our relationship with this desired and demonised substance: she took in slavery, world wars, ye olde sweete shoppes, and hot sweet tea as a working-class staple. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, one of the expert interviewees referred to Didsbury as “a town close to Leeds”. Didsbury is close to Manchester, as the BBC well knows (most of its up-from-London Salford employees live there or thereabouts). I found her testimony a bit harder to believe after that. The wrong facts can pull you out of your listening enjoyment and make you begin to question what you hear. Another lovely programme is the World Service’s BBC World Hacks. Last week’s was particularly delightful. Harriet Noble reported from a primary school in Canada, where kindness is being taught to nine-year-olds by a baby: Naomi, seven months. Naomi can’t speak, so the children have to work out how she is feeling from what she does. The children are being taught to care. The results are arresting: three years later, of those children inclined towards bullying, 88% are behaving more kindly. Facts again. We want the world to be extraordinary. Some facts give us hope that it might be. Trump a year on: shows that take him to task Three Pillars of Trump: Defence BBC World Service Jonathan Marcus, the BBC’s defence and diplomatic correspondent, views Trump’s first year from a military perspective. Trump chose a general to head the Pentagon; he promised to end wars he didn’t understand; he pledged to invest in defence. Were his promises empty? Should he be let anywhere near the Big(ger Than Yours) Red Button? This is sober, interesting analysis, with Marcus talking to those who know in the US military. The next two programmes tackle foreign affairs and health. Is the Orange Bloviator actually the Great Disruptor? Trump: A Year in Tweets BBC World Service Anthony Zurcher looks at the president from the POV Trump loves best: Twitter. Two panels - one rightwing, one left – discuss Trump’s most controversial tweets. Yes, really. You may well regard this as the media eating itself: it’s actually far more revealing (and funny) than you might imagine. The feel is of a US political chatshow, although, wisely, both sides are kept apart. As with most US political chatshows, it can get a bit over-talky, but it’s useful to know how both sides think. You find yourself wondering: what could ever bring them together? FDRH Podcast: Year 1 Trump Report goldfarbpod.com Michael Goldfarb, a distinguished US radio reporter resident in the UK, uses his elegant essay podcast to consider one year of the Trump. Is the president crazy or just a typical country club type? Does the way he talk simply reflect how people talk when they are among friends? Goldfarb turns his beautiful voice and clever mind not only to what Trump has achieved in office, but how he has achieved it. “He has smashed what Americans and the world have come to expect as normal presidential behaviour,” says Goldfarb. He certainly has.

Leading a charity through a merger has been one of the most challenging tests of my career – both mentally and physically. We had not needed to merge; it was a decision made by two charities – Rural Action Yorkshire and North Yorkshire and York Forum – that were both in a position of strength. That did lead me to wonder sometimes why we had not opted for a simpler life and continued as we were. We had initially spoken to each other to explore how we might be able to partner on projects or services in the future. But North Yorkshire is a fairly crowded area for the sector and we felt the economic situation was unlikely to get much easier for small and medium size charities in the short term. By coming together, we aimed to create a more resilient charity with a wider range of funders. And over the past 18 months, I have learned a lot about what a chief executive needs to do to survive the process. Be committed Chief executives need to mirror the boldness and bravery of the boards’ decision to merge. I was incredibly fortunate that many aspects of the merger were made easier for me by both trustee boards, who remained focused on the end goal. There were no hidden agendas to secure their own trustee positions, no infighting about who would be chair, no lines in the sand about the new organisation’s name or logo. Once that decision to merge is made, chief executives have to either commit fully, or face the fact that he or she might not be the right person to lead the change. It’s fine to make constructive challenges, double check facts, and express concerns to your trustees – but if you waiver in front of stakeholders and staff, you jeopardise the success of the merger. The whole team needs to be committed. Ask for support Do not underestimate the amount of time you’ll spend in the office during a merger. On top of the day job, you’ll dedicate entire evenings and weekends to ensuring the smooth transfer of staff and operations. I had fantastic personal support from my family, but I also had valuable moral support from peers in my sector who’d been through mergers before. Just as important were colleagues who ensured I ate lunch (or at least some chocolate biscuits) and saw daylight occasionally. Accept you need help and take everything that’s offered.Sometimes good enough is good enough My favourite example of this is the process of developing our logo. We kept the offices of one of the merging charities and I had the grand ambition to use the colours of our new logo to signal that this was a new organisation. But logos take time and before we had one, the office refurbishment was upon us. With painters prepping around staff still at their desks, a paint chart was slammed on my desk with a five minute deadline to pick the colours. I picked two colours, the walls got painted in time, those colours became our logo colours and it was fine. Sometimes good enough works – and we had bigger decisions to worry about. Keep a sense of humour Paint-gate was a fraught moment but when the tension died down we were able to laugh about it. During the merger I had moments that were tense and frustrating – and you risk becoming rather self-important about all of those difficult decisions you need to make to drive the project forward. Remember to keep a sense of humour – and never forget that it’s just a job at the end of the day. Take good advice The Institute for Voluntary Action Research (IVAR) worked with us during the merger to offer independent advice and share good practice. I also took advice from trustees, friends, family, and colleagues. It’s a good idea to develop your professional network so you can pick up the phone to others who have been through a similar experience. We also undertook a post-merger evaluation with our trustees and staff, which gave us valuable insight in understanding where our “good enough” decisions needed another tweak. Would I lead another merger? The outcome has been transformational for our charity. We have a bigger team, with a wider range of expertise, and more funding to innovate more. We are less reliant on one main funder and have been able to diversify the projects and services we run. So, despite its challenges, the answer has to be yes. That’s providing someone keeps the biscuit tin full at all times – and nobody asks me about the colour of the office walls. • Leah Swain is the chief executive of Community First Yorkshire.

Theatre503 in south-west London is staging three days of plays and panel discussions exploring themes of consent, power and the new normal. De Angelis, writer of the West End hit Jumpy, praised the London theatre for its boldness. “How brave and creative of 503 to say, ‘Let’s do it and let’s do it now,’” she said. It is great that they could react so quickly, like a bigger theatre hasn’t been able to do – or hasn’t done.” Her play will centre on an intergenerational encounter. “I’ve tried to not write the obvious, I’ve looked at the idea of what being empowered to speak means. Who has the power to speak? Why it can be difficult to speak. It seems the easiest thing in the world but actually, why has it been difficult in the past?” One aspect of the debate has been the sometimes differing views of older women and younger women, something brought into focus with comments this week by Germaine Greer, who criticised the “whingeing” #MeToo movement. The backlash against Greer has saddened De Angelis. “I’d hate people to just dismiss her, I think it’s awful,” she says. “You can disagree with her but why denigrate her? She is a warrior and she has come through a lot of battles and maybe there’s something in what she says as well as there being something you want to take issue with.” On the plays’ subject area, she said: “The whole point of theatre is that it is not black and white, it is always interested in the nuances, the difficulties, the conflicts, the obstacles. Good theatre is not a simple ideological statement.” Lisa Spirling, Theatre503’s artistic director, said they were not setting out to come up with definitive answers. “It feels a little like we are dipping our toe in. No one has the answer to what we’re in, everyone is finding their way. For us it is very much the start of a conversation.” The project has been undertaken at lightning speed. Spirling began approaching writers in December and a diverse cast of actors began rehearsing the plays, all under 10 minutes long, on Monday. None of the plays are verbatim pieces, Spirling said. “It is writers being inspired about the world around them and digging a little deeper. Sometimes it is writers investigating really uncomfortable aspects of the subject.” The full lineup of writers is De Angelis, Bean, Chris Bush, Dipika Guha, Fergus Church, Amy Evans, Kevin Forde, Patrick Russell, Elise van Lil and Deidan Williams. Bean’s play will look at relationships in the future. “The genius of Richard is that he sets something up, then he pulls the rug from under you,” said Spirling. After performances of the 10 plays there will be discussions, with diverse panels that will include psychiatrists, academics, journalists and people who have been at the centre of social media storms. Among the participants will be Erica Whyman, deputy artistic director of the RSC, the literary agent Mel Kenyon, and the writer and columnist Kate Maltby. Spirling said it was important that the theatre did not become not a kind of “liberal echo chamber”. Theatre503 is a small theatre, above a pub in Battersea, that regularly punches above its weight. It has a track record of responding to contemporary events: last January it hosted a weekend of commissioned short plays responding to Donald Trump’s election. This year’s festival will be titled The Words Are Coming Now. Spirling said: “Everyone at some point has had a conversation about it, someone they care about or someone at work, everyone has their own experiences. It can be an hour later, a year later, it can be 50 years later and people think, ‘Now I want to say something.’” • The Words Are Coming Now is at Theatre503, London, 25-27 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/24/momentum-founder-no-national-campaign-deselect-labour-mps-jon-lansman","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T09:32:38Z","webTitle":"Momentum founder: no national campaign to deselect Labour MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/24/momentum-founder-no-national-campaign-deselect-labour-mps-jon-lansman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/24/momentum-founder-no-national-campaign-deselect-labour-mps-jon-lansman","fields":{"headline":"Momentum founder: no national campaign to deselect Labour MPs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Momentum, the grassroots group of Jeremy Corbyn supporters, has stressed it will not campaign nationally to deselect any Labour MP after reports of a “hit list” targeting up to 50 for replacement. Jon Lansman, the organisation’s founder who recently won a seat on Labour’s ruling body, dismissed the idea that Momentum was working to oust any MP and said the idea of a list had “no factual basis whatsoever”. But he said local constituency parties could take it upon themselves to replace any MP who was not performing well or failing to listen to members. Lansman made the comments in an interview with the Independent at a time when Corbyn-sceptic Labour MPs are increasingly worried that their local activist bases may want to replace them. Some Corbyn supporters, such as the leftwing MP Chris Williamson, have supported the idea of colleagues undergoing a full mandatory reselection process. However, Labour is undertaking a review of party democracy that could introduce less drastic changes that would still make it easier for MPs to be challenged. Lansman offered some reassurance for Labour MPs, saying: “Momentum nationally is not going to campaign to deselect any MP and we will stick by that. We are not going to campaign to deselect any individual MP. “We have made it clear that we are not going to campaign to deselect anyone, at all, anywhere.” He said the existing process was already in place should local parties wish to ditch their candidate at an election, known as the trigger ballot. “No Labour MP that works hard and campaigns and listens to their members has anything to fear from the selection process,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/24/liam-fox-backs-call-use-brexit-dividend-fund-nhs-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T08:51:58Z","webTitle":"Liam Fox backs call to use 'Brexit dividend' to fund NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/24/liam-fox-backs-call-use-brexit-dividend-fund-nhs-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/24/liam-fox-backs-call-use-brexit-dividend-fund-nhs-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Liam Fox backs call to use 'Brexit dividend' to fund NHS","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liam Fox has said it would be unthinkable not to spend some of the “Brexit dividend” from leaving the EU on funding the NHS, but the government could not make any promises at this point. The pro-Brexit trade secretary waded into the debate after Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, infuriated colleagues by having his allies brief that he wanted £100m a week from EU spending to be set aside for funding healthcare. At least eight members of the cabinet intervened to reprimand Johnson for letting his position be known before confidential cabinet discussions on the NHS. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, stressed the importance of trust between cabinet members, according to one person present. “I’m talking to you, foreign secretary,” she reportedly said. However, Johnson appears to have successfully put the issue on the national agenda, with ministers repeatedly pressed about whether the government will give some of the money saved from leaving the EU to the NHS. Fox told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he supported giving more money to the NHS and healthcare would always be a priority, but the government could not set out how any money from Brexit would be spent after the UK’s proposed transition period ends in 2021. “Once we have left the EU, once we have completed any implementation period that requires contributions to the EU, yes, we have control over more of the money and the government at the time will be able to determine how we spend the money on the priorities the British people have at that point,” he said. “But I completely agree, not least as a GP myself, that spending more money on healthcare has to be a good thing for the UK … I find it absolutely unthinkable that health would not be among the top of [the priorities].” Fox refused to be drawn into the spat over Johnson, but acknowledged: “I think it’s very useful to remind people that we will get a dividend from leaving the EU.” Other cabinet members are less convinced there will be huge sums to spend on public services after leaving the EU, which they believe will cause other financial pressures. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, made clear that Johnson was the foreign secretary, not someone involved in health policy. “I gave the health secretary [Jeremy Hunt] an extra £6bn in the recent budget and we will look at departmental allocations again at the spending review when that takes place,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/25/little-mix-lhg-live-sign-language-interpreter","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T14:23:34Z","webTitle":"Deaf woman sues Little Mix concert promoter over sign language provision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/25/little-mix-lhg-live-sign-language-interpreter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/25/little-mix-lhg-live-sign-language-interpreter","fields":{"headline":"Deaf woman sues Little Mix concert promoter over sign language provision","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A deaf woman is suing the promoter of a Little Mix concert alleging it failed to provide adequate sign language provision. Before attending the concert at Sussex’s South of England Event Centre last September, Sally Reynolds petitioned the organiser, LHG Live, to provide a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter so that she and her two friends, who are also deaf, could enjoy the concert with their daughters, who are able to hear, the BBC reports. Initially LHG offered Reynolds carer tickets and said she could bring her own interpreter. Citing the Equality Act 2010, which states that any organisation supplying a public service has a duty to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that a disabled person receives as similar as possible an experience to a person without a disability, Reynolds applied for a court injunction to oblige LHG to supply a BSL interpreter. Before the hearing, LHG agreed to provide an interpreter, who appeared during Little Mix’s set. However the interpreter did not appear during supporting performances, by Ella Eyre and the Germein Sisters. Reynolds is now suing LHG for failing to make reasonable adjustments for the entire performance. “People with sensory impairment actually want to attend musical and sporting events just as anybody else does,” her solicitor, Chris Fry, told the BBC. “So it is important that venues and promoters recognise the legal duties to make reasonable adjustments extend to them.” In a statement, LHG Live said: “We consulted with [Reynolds’] recommended agency and agreed to provide the professional interpreter of her choice for the Little Mix show. This included specific staging and lighting, and a set list in advance.” A spokesman for the band said: “Little Mix strongly believe their concerts should be completely inclusive for all. The band welcome all fans to their shows, including those with hearing impairment, and encourage the promoters they work with to make provisions to ensure their fans can enjoy the concert experience.” Attitude is Everything, an organisation dedicated to improving deaf and disabled people’s access to live music, were unable to comment on the specificities of the case, but added: “We will be following the case highlighted today regarding BSL interpretation of concerts. We welcome Little Mix’s statement and will be consulting deaf audiences, artists and the industry to establish best practice in this area in 2018.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/25/wind-and-solar-success-shows-spirit-of-snowy-lies-with-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T17:00:52Z","webTitle":"Wind and solar success shows spirit of Snowy resides with renewable energy | Tristan Edis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/wind-and-solar-success-shows-spirit-of-snowy-lies-with-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/wind-and-solar-success-shows-spirit-of-snowy-lies-with-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Wind and solar success shows spirit of Snowy lies with renewables","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced he wanted to massively expand the Snowy Hydro-Electric Scheme, he was on a political winner. The Snowy Hydro Scheme is an icon in Australia’s history, driven by leaders across both Labor and Liberal Governments. For many Australians it is a symbol of what we’re capable of achieving as a country when we put our mind to something. From 1949 to 1974 it was constructed by a multi-cultural team including many immigrants escaping a Europe that had been ravaged by war. When seen up close, the tunnels, dams and power plant infrastructure are a truly impressive sight. They are a testament to how our country can successfully harness the hard work and talents of people from across many countries and cultures. Several decades on it continues to deliver great benefits to the country with rapid-response power supply and irrigated agriculture. No wonder the American Society of Civil Engineering deems it one of the engineering wonders of the world. Australians are sick of politicians who seem to be only capable of bickering and tearing others down. That’s why Turnbull’s announcement to build Snowy 2.0 made for such a refreshing and welcome change. Finally a political leader who, rather than trying to tear others down, telling us what can’t be done and what’s wrong, instead wanted to build something to achieve something great and inspiring. But there’s something else in the here and now that Australians can now point towards as a symbol of what great things we can achieve. In just the past year Australia started construction on renewable energy projects that within the next two years will produce more than twice the amount of electricity generated by the Snowy Hydro-Electric Scheme (which took a quarter century to build). Green Energy Markets has been tracking construction activity in the Australian renewable energy industry dating back to 2001. Pulling together the data for our Renewable Energy Index it was staggering what had been achieved last year. The 3,700MW of capacity committed to construction in 2017 (more than twice the capacity of Hazelwood power station) completely dwarfed anything achieved before. On top of this construction activity at the big utility-scale level, Australian households and businesses installed a record amount of solar PV on their rooftops – exceeding 1,000MW. We now have a cumulative total of 6,500MW of rooftop solar, with almost all of it installed since 2010. A little appreciated fact is that while the Snowy scheme is certainly an engineering marvel, the amount of power we’ll produce from wind and solar dwarfs that produced by the Snowy Scheme. And this wind and solar power has been built far faster. This achievement opens our eyes to what might be possible in addressing what is the most carbon emission-intensive electricity supply in the developed world. If we simply kept up the level of construction commitments seen in 2017 for another decade it would produce almost two-thirds of Australia’s entire electricity consumption. For those who continue to doubt our ability to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels it’s worth looking back on what was said not long ago. In May 2015, the then energy minister Ian Macfarlane told ABC Radio that achieving the 2020 Renewable Energy Target would be “an enormous challenge”, which he had serious doubts could be met. He said all the best wind farm sites were gone and there were no other competitive technologies available to share the load. To back up his claims he cited the current head of the Australian electricity industry association saying, “Matthew (Warren)’s view is that it is almost impossible to build this many wind towers in the time they have available.” On Tuesday this week, two and half years later, the current energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, declared, “ there will be enough renewable energy projects built over the next three years to meet the Renewable Energy Target in 2020”. He added, “This milestone has been surpassed ahead of schedule following a record level of investment in renewable energy in 2017.” Then in a comment that represents a perfect rebuttal to the lack of foresight of his predecessor, Frydenberg observed, “One of the major shifts in the market is the huge increase in share of large-scale solar. In the first 6,000 megawatts committed under the scheme, solar contributed only 4% of the total. In the firmly announced projects since 2016, solar now makes up 46%.” Rather than spending all their time looking in the rear-view mirror to dream up reasons for why Australia can’t achieve great things, imagine if our leaders, like those behind the original Snowy Hydro scheme, tried harder to think through how great things could be done.

I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Wednesday morning. The freeze on social security benefits introduced two years ago will lead to fewer and fewer children escaping the poverty trap, according to a study. The biggest increases in child poverty since the freeze in 2016 have occurred in areas already identified as deprivation hotspots, an analysis by the End Child Poverty coalition of charities has found. In four parliamentary constituencies – Bethnal Green and Bow, and Poplar and Limehouse in east London, and Ladywood and Hodge Hill in Birmingham – children are for the first time in recent years more likely than not to grow up poor. In 25 constituencies, mostly located in London, Birmingham and Greater Manchester, more than 40% of children now live below the poverty line. On a local level the figures are even more damning, with 62% of children in Coldhurst ward in Oldham living in poverty. End Child Poverty says the government must end the benefits freeze which the group says is a major factor in an “emerging child poverty crisis”, along with rising prices. * * * Afghanistan attack – Gunmen have stormed the offices of Save the Children in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad in an ongoing attack that has left at least 11 people injured. Details are still emerging but witnesses said a car bomb exploded at the gates of a compound housing the charity’s offices at around 9.15am local time (4.45GMT). Attackers then ran into the building and opened fire. Mohammad Amin, who was inside the compound, said he saw gunman hitting the main gate with an rocket-propelled grenade. * * * Neville problem – The appointment of Phil Neville as coach of the England women’s football team has been overshadowed after dubious tweets he appears to have sent a few years ago began to circulate, with one making light of domestic violence. The message, which was posted via Neville’s Twitter handle @fizzer18 on 1 July 2011, reads: “Relax I’m back chilled – just battered the wife!!!” Another accused women campaigning for equal pay of being “hypocrites”. The former England and Manchester United player deleted the account on Tuesday night but has not confirmed whether he sent the tweets. Neville replaces Mark Sampson, who was sacked in September on grounds of unacceptable behaviour with a player in a previous job. * * * Doctors’ block – Doctors from overseas have been prevented from taking up posts at UK hospitals because they don’t earn enough to satisfy immigration rules. The Guardian has learned of at least 20 doctors who have fallen foul of the rules which require applicants to earn more than £55,000. A consultant who was hoping to recruit one of the doctors said the situation was “lunatic”. University Hospitals Birmingham confirmed 18 staff had been turned down for tier 2 visas in the past two months, while Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge said three had been knocked back. * * * Paradise revisited – The Paradise Papers leak has produced another twist after it emerged that the law firm at the centre of the leak provided offshore services to a bank accused of facilitating terrorist financing, transnational organised crime and the Syrian government’s chemical weapons programme. Appleby, a Bermuda-based offshore firm, represented the Cayman Islands holding company of FBME Bank for at least a year after the US Treasury published a roster of serious allegations against the bank. FBME, which the US said was “a financial institution of primary money laundering concern”, was banned from the US financial system last year. FBME denies all the allegation. Appleby, which is suing the Guardian over the Paradise Papers investigation, declined to comment on its relationship with the holding company of FBME. * * * The big dry – Residents in Cape Town have been warned that they will have to queue for water at standpipes from 12 April unless they reduce their consumption drastically in the face of the worst drought for 100 years. “Day Zero”, when the city officially runs out of piped water, has been brought forward nine days to 12 April after the latest drop in reservoir levels. If the emergency measures are needed, people will be limited to 25 litres a day. A typical shower uses 15 litres per minute, the country’s water watchdog says, while a toilet consumes 15 litres per flush. Lunchtime read: Seven years after the Arab Spring, hope fades Seven years ago, the series of revolutions that became known as the Arab Spring started in Tunisia. The autocratic government of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown and soon the movement spread to Egypt, Libya and Syria. It felt like the region was on the cusp of significant, epochal change. Sadly, as Emma Graham-Harrison finds, Tunisians are still waiting for the killers of hundreds of protesters to face justice and even for the new regime to recognise those who sacrificed their lives. Further east, the impact of the Arab Spring in Egypt is even more remote. Ruth Michaelson reports from Cairo on elections in March which president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi seems destined to win easily after crushing dissent, and along with it the hopes of thousands of protesters who once turned the capital’s Tahrir Square into the centre of the Arab awakening. Sport South Korea has its first tennis slam semi-finalist after Hyeon Chung beat controversial American Tennys Sandgren in straight sets at Melbourne Park. Sandgren, who has been linked to far-right websites, copped another blow in the shape of a searing put-down by Serena Williams. In a different semi, Bristol City went down fighting in their Carabao Cup second leg clash against Manchester City, losing 3-2 on the night and 5-3 overall. Back down under, all-rounder Sam Curran has been drafted into the England squad for the upcoming tri-series against Australia and New Zealand. Business Forget the bankers, Elon Musk might one day put all the fat cats in the shade. The US entrepreneur has agreed to work free for 10 years in exchange for a bonus of £40bn if he can turn Tesla into a $650bn company. Asian shares were mostly down overnight after huge gains in recent weeks. The FTSE100 is set to drop slightly at the opening bell. The pound is buying $1.402 and €1.138. The papers Don’t ya love the British press - so much variety today. The FT leads with the news of the Murdochs’ hopes of an easy takeover of Sky being scuppered (for now) by the regulator. It also has an investigation into a “men only” charity dinner which makes for shocking reading. The i splashes on “Fake news unit to fight web threat” while the Telegraph chooses news that Nicola Sturgeon has apparently ordered the Union Jack to be “eradicated” from Scottish government buildings and replaced with the Saltire. The Guardian’s splash is the Paradise Papers – as outlined above – and the Mail’s headline is “Health risk of herbal pills”, saying millions are risking their health by combining them with prescription drugs. The Mirror focuses on “taxi rapist” John Worboys who is set for early release from prison. It says police are investigating new allegations against him. And finally the Sun has the most unusual story and best headline. “Apocalypse Cow” it screams. Not sure what to make of it all but apparently the Wetherspoon’s Tuesday Steak Club has been stunned – because steak has been pulled off the menu.

Nothing, according to Anne Milton, apprenticeships and skills minister. “The last year has been a period of significant change, it will take time for employers to adjust,” she said, putting a heroically optimistic spin on another set of alarming figures. Thursday’s data, covering the August-October 2017 quarter, showed a 27% drop in the number of apprenticeships on a year ago. That wasn’t as bad as the 59% plunge in the May-July period, but travelling in the wrong direction more slowly is not progress. Most independent observers think the government will miss its five-year target of reaching three million apprenticeship starts in England, from a starting point of May 2015. The numbers turned south immediately after the government introduced the apprenticeship levy, a 0.5% payroll charge on all big employers, in April last year. You don’t have to be Hercule Poirot to think the levy-funded reforms could be the problem. That was certainly the view of the Chartered Institute for Personnel Development (CIPD) when it warned of “unintended consequences” a couple of weeks ago. Nearly half of employers were simply re-badging existing training schemes as apprenticeships to claim back their levy allowance. Almost a fifth don’t plan to develop apprenticeships and regard the levy as just another tax. The only real advance has been in degree apprenticeships. Rather than trust that the numbers will somehow improve, ministers could try listening to employers. Roughly speaking, the view of the CBI and the Institute of Directors is that the scheme is bureaucratic, costly and inflexible. That is why there are calls for a more flexible “training levy” – one that covers all workplace training, not just apprenticeships. In one regard, you can’t blame ministers for being suspicious of these corporate cries. The danger is that employers would divert allocations from a more loosely defined scheme into general running costs. On the other hand, it’s blindingly obvious that the new scheme doesn’t command confidence. Worse, it’s failing for reasons that were predicted. As long ago as June 2016, the CIPD warned the government it was designing a “blunt instrument” and that a “one size fits all” approach was a mistake. Ministers should heed the calls for a rethink. Conceived by George Osborne in 2015, the levy-backed scheme was sold at last year’s launch as the way to equip the nation with the skills required for life after Brexit. The plan isn’t working and Brexit approaches. Asos’s ambition now looks credible It was stock market news a couple of months ago when the value of Asos, the online fashion retailer, surpassed that of ancient old Marks &amp; Spencer. The position now? Asos has accelerated away. M&amp;S is still worth about £4.9bn but Asos, after a strong run for its shares, is at £5.7bn. The valuation looks extraordinary when you remember that Asos is on course to achieve profits this year of only about £100m versus roughly £575m from M&amp;S. It’s one hell of premium to put on Asos’s future growth and profit potential. The company is being valued at more than 70 times this year’s earnings. For that money you get a retailer that is clearly motoring. Sales in the UK rose by 23% to £301m in the past four months and the international operation achieved 32% to £489m. After the enormous hiccup of three profits warnings in 2014, Asos has become an remarkably consistent machine. If you caught the bottom for the shares that year you paid £20; now the price is a shade above £70. The big risk is that capital is spent badly. Investment will be close to £220m this year, including the construction of a $40m warehouse in Atlanta in the US. But that life’s when you’re trying to be “the world’s leading fashion destination for twentysomethings”. Come back in 10 years to learn whether the goal was achieved – but the ambition looks increasingly credible. Sky News not in ‘critical’ condition How not to reassure anxious staff. “I wouldn’t describe Sky News as critical to the business today,” said Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of Sky. He went on to say that no part of business would merit the “critical” description, but his remarks will only reinforce the impression that Sky’s directors are prepared to see Sky News become collateral damage in the great Fox-Disney saga. If that’s not Darroch’s view, he may wish to tell colleagues whose payoffs would be rather smaller than his."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/06/feel-free-zadie-smith-review-essays","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Feel Free: Essays by Zadie Smith review – anyone for a cultural thought experiment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/06/feel-free-zadie-smith-review-essays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/06/feel-free-zadie-smith-review-essays","fields":{"headline":"Feel Free: Essays by Zadie Smith review – anyone for a cultural thought experiment?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"One unavoidable sensation in reading Zadie Smith’s recent essays is that “recent” isn’t what it used to be. Smith is now an insistently transatlantic writer, dividing her life between New York and Queens Park in London. These pieces were written during the eight years of the Obama administration, and therefore largely in the time – which, alarmingly, starts to look like a relatively rational period – of coalition government in the UK. There is only one mention of Donald Trump in the book; Theresa May does not get a look in. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, has a walk-on as a politician who still looks more a dead-end past than a born-again future, someone who has “profoundly betrayed the youth vote… [and] must go”. This sense of prelapsarian history does not necessarily hobble Smith’s compendious musings – a brick of an essay collection like this one is the acknowledgment of a certain status in a novelist, something like a “major retrospective” for a painter – but it does make several of them read like lively period pieces. Smith’s Brexit Diary, reproduced from the pages of the New York Review of Books, only takes us to the point of Nigel Farage’s triumphant union jack shoes (though, written from her in-laws’ home Ulster, it does contain many prescient lines: “in Northern Ireland it was clear that one thing Brexit certainly wasn’t about, even slightly, was Northern Ireland” and “in Britain Nigels come and go, Ruperts are for ever”). Though they might not have felt such at the time, these are missives from a gentler, more hopeful age. Within them – as Smith’s enthusiastic attention ranges over subjects as diverse as Ella Fitzgerald’s style and the depiction of corpses in Renaissance paintings and the discomfiting smudging of English seasons one into the other – there is an additional nostalgia. The further Smith’s acclaim as a novelist has taken her from her growing up in Willesden in the 1980s, the more she wants to hold it in mind. That defining multicultural landscape on London’s north circular serves her writing much like the butcher’s shop and the trials of afternoon tea in Leeds serves Alan Bennett. It invites us to share the writers’ belief that nothing much of what has happened since has fundamentally changed them. If in doubt about what she thinks, Smith’s reflex is to return us to the community around the flats and maisonettes in which she once lived, and from which she emerged thanks to a retrospectively benevolent state that gave her NHS glasses and had faith in public libraries and educated her for free and looked after her aged father. Another attraction of this golden time is that hers was the very last generation in human history that grew up with the printed rather than the digital page. Both in practice and in spirit Smith makes a vivid case for the importance of bookish culture, even as she sometimes fears it is a valediction. She is a rigorous and often inspired reader – writing with equal acuity about, say, Ursula K Le Guin or Hanif Kureishi. The standout essay here is “Generation Why” (2010), her dismantling of the idea of Facebook and the addictive solipsism it promotes: “500 million sentient people entrapped in the recent careless thoughts of a Harvard sophomore,” she writes. (For 500 million, now read 1 billion.) Strangely perhaps, given Smith’s antipathy to virtual worlds, the reality she tends toward in her nonfiction is generally a mediated one. There is next to nothing in these pages that could be classed as “reporting” in the sense of going out into a less friendly corner of the messy walkable world and testing what you think you know against what you find. Smith is not an essayist in the mode of a Joan Didion, someone who likes to pitch up in a place and try to make sense of it. Instead she uses the format to engage in sort of cultural thought experiments from her desk. Some of these essays gesture toward the voice that Geoff Dyer has made his own; her analysis of the kinship between notable dancers and the act of writing contains some seductive moves – “it’s very hard to bring to mind Prince dancing where it is practically impossible to forget Michael Jackson” – but you wonder whether her heart is completely in it. Likewise, her writing is just about sharp enough to have you stick with her through a deconstruction of the self-involvement of Justin Bieber as seen through the lens of the philosopher Martin Buber, but you may not be convinced of the point. That latter essay makes the argument that in our culture of self-advertisement, “recognising the reality of other people – and having them recognise the reality of you – is at the heart of the matter”. In one of her pieces here, about her reluctance to use the first-person voice in her novels she writes of her love of a “fiction that faces outward, toward others”. It’s a manifesto that makes you wonder, just from time to time, how her nonfiction would sound if she put her supple gifts of description and analysis to work more often in places other than galleries and libraries. • Feel Free by Zadie Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton (£20).

All the same, I was a bit surprised to find myself so utterly charmed by Red Winter by the Swedish cartoonist Anneli Furmark. Yes, at the heart of this graphic novel is a clandestine love affair, and yes, it comes with plenty of snow and subtly lit interiors. But it’s also a cold-eyed and occasionally chilling analysis of the ruthlessness, bullying and groupthink indulged in by a certain kind of small-time, small-town Marxist. It is, in other words, a book in which the difference between, say, the APK (a Swedish Leninist political party) and the SKP (which is, or was, Maoist) actually matters – at least to some of its characters. The action takes place in an isolated and somewhat bleak town in the north of Sweden in the late 70s; the four-decade reign of the Social Democrats has just come to an end and across the country far-left parties are mobilising, hoping to overthrow capitalism (though naturally they seem not to be able to work together). Ulrik came here from the south, having been deployed by his party to spread the word, and spends his free time selling its newspaper in the street and attending endless meetings with his zealous comrades. But all is not going entirely to plan. Siv, the woman with whom he has fallen passionately in love, is not only a married mother of three some 14 years his senior, she also works – oh, the horror – for the youth wing of the local Social Democrats. Both of them fear discovery: Siv has her husband and children to think about, not to mention her friends and neighbours in this close-knit community; Ulrik knows that his comrades would regard such a relationship as little more than sleeping with the enemy, even if he’s as careful as any spy not to allow his pillow talk to touch on politics. But they also dream of running away together, and perhaps it’s this that, in the end, draws the attention of Siv’s suspicious daughter Marita, and of Ralf, the most horribly devout member of Ulrik’s Maoist chapter. Even when they’re present, these two seem somehow to be elsewhere. Furmark makes the most of this narrative tension: at moments, her comic has the flavour of a thriller. But she’s also a wonderfully lyrical cartoonist. When Siv speaks of love, it’s akin to poetry; when Marita goes out to play, she enters the enchanted forest of her own imagination. Best of all, though, are her gorgeous watercolours, which utilise blue and orange – ice and fire – to such marvellous effect. Something about her depiction of this subarctic region, where in the winter the sun struggles to rise, brings to mind the forested landscapes of Tove Jansson. Cosy as her kitchens and bedrooms are, outside is a dangerous realm.

Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said on Thursday that he wants to work out a bipartisan agreement with the ranking Democratic on the committee, Dianne Feinstein of California, to release transcripts from interviews conducted last September. Grassley said he had hoped to interview Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who also attended the meeting. But he says the chances of that were “shot” and Kushner was now “spooked” after Feinstein unilaterally released a transcript from a different interview conducted as part of the congressional Russia investigation. Trump Jr was forced last year to release damning emails that revealed he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage Hillary Clinton’s election campaign. The emails showed British-born music promoter Rob Goldstone telling the future US president’s son that “the crown prosecutor of Russia” had offered information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father”. Trump Jr replied: “If it’s what you say, I love it.” Grassley said on Thursday that the committee would start releasing “all witness interviews that we have done related to that meeting” right away. Feinstein said she was delighted. The panel never spoke with Kushner or former campaign manager Paul Manafort, both of whom also attended the Trump Tower meeting. “I had hoped to speak with all the witnesses surrounding the Trump Tower meeting … but with the unilateral release of the transcript for Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, it seems to have spooked other potential witnesses,” Grassley said. The judiciary committee has the power to subpoena witnesses. Earlier this month, Feinstein unilaterally released the transcript of a congressional interview with Glenn Simpson, whose research firm, Fusion GPS, was behind the dossier on alleged contacts between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russian government. The dossier – compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele – makes an allegation that there was a “conspiracy of cooperation” between Russian agents and the Trump campaign, and the president has frequently scorned it since its publication last January. Meanwhile, more than 20 White House employees have given voluntary interviews to special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian election interference and any possible obstruction of justice, according to a document released by Trump’s attorney John Dowd on Thursday. The special inquiry is proceeding in parallel with the congressional investigations and Trump said on Wednesday that he was “looking forward” to speaking under oath to Mueller’s team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/ng-interactive/2018/jan/26/guardian-icm-brexit-poll-full-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T16:31:33Z","webTitle":"How Britain's views have changed – full Brexit poll results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2018/jan/26/guardian-icm-brexit-poll-full-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/ng-interactive/2018/jan/26/guardian-icm-brexit-poll-full-results","fields":{"headline":"How Britain's views have changed – full Brexit poll results","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How Britain would vote if the referendum were re-run Across all respondents, excluding don’t knows, remain leads leave by 51% to 49%.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Shiller hailed bitcoin as a “really clever idea”. But although he was impressed with the technology behind it, he was concerned that it had “gone viral as a currency”. “I tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it’s not a permanent feature of our lives,” said Shiller, who has previously warned that the bitcoin price could collapse. “We are over-emphasising bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications.” Theresa May said in Davos that she was concerned that criminals were taking advantage of digital currencies, which can be used to anonymously transfer funds. “In areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,” May told Bloomberg. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also flagged up concerns about misuse of digital currencies. “My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “So in the US our regulations [say] if you’re a bitcoin wallet, you’re subject to the same regulations as a bank.” South Korea has recently announced a clampdown on digital currencies. From next month, people will be banned from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading. Digital currencies have been a key topic of conversation at Davos. Ethereum, a rival to bitcoin, has set up its own lounge on the main promenade of the ski resort. Banks are showing particular interest in the blockchain – the digital ledger that underpins a cryptocurrency. A senior Swedish central banker said bitcoin was too volatile to be classed as money. “In my view, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and the others, the way I’ve seen them so far, they don’t meet the criteria to be called money,” said Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of the Riksbank. “They are not a very stable store of value – they fluctuate a lot – and it’s not a very efficient medium of exchange because you don’t buy your groceries with bitcoin, you don’t get your salaries in bitcoin, and you certainly can’t pay your taxes with bitcoin.” Skingsley said she understood that digital currencies were attractive in countries where people did not trust the public authorities, but she said bitcoin was a “poor alternative” as it was too volatile. “If you’re talking of money in an efficient economy, over time it’s much better if you have a trustworthy authority that releases enough money – not too little and not too much,” Skingsley said. However, some investors at Davos disputed the idea that bitcoin faced a rocky future. Jennifer Zhu Scott, of Radian Partners, said bitcoin was a “very lousy currency” and a “very lousy payment system” but insisted that it worked as an asset. “I don’t think bitcoin is disrupting currency or money. Bitcoin is disrupting gold,” she said. Zhu argued that bitcoin was extremely efficient as a store of value, as there could only ever be 21m in circulation – and only about 16m have been created so far. Neil Rimer, a general partner at Index Ventures, conceded that bitcoin could theoretically crash to zero, but he also hailed the progress since it was created nine years ago. “This is one of the most audacious, generous and profound inventions that I have witnessed in my career. It does have the ability to help many, many people,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/25/rg-gregory-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T17:52:23Z","webTitle":"RG Gregory obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/25/rg-gregory-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/25/rg-gregory-obituary","fields":{"headline":"RG Gregory obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, RG Gregory, who has died aged 89, was a poet, playwright, theatre-in-the-round director and inventor of Instant Theatre, a technique that involves actors and audiences in the creation of stories. In 1972 he founded the language-arts company Word and Action (Dorset) and was committed to working in the round as a way of liberating people’s imagination. The second of five children of Albert, a Southampton docker, and Kate, he was named Raymond George, and known as Ray as a boy, but he did not like the name and to everyone except his immediate family he was Greg. When the second world war broke out, he and his older brother, Ron, with the whole of their school, Taunton’s grammar, were evacuated to Bournemouth and billeted with local families. By the age of 17 he had decided he wanted to be a writer. Following the postwar Labour government’s opening up of higher education, Greg was the first in his family to go to university, studying English literature at King’s College London. When he married Pat Williams in 1952 he started teaching, working in Southampton, Uganda and then in the Grove school, Market Drayton, in north Shropshire. He developed his ideas about theatre-in-the-round, became friends with Stephen Joseph, pioneer of the form in Scarborough, and wrote more than 20 plays for school and theatre groups. As head of English in Kololo school, Kampala, Uganda, in 1965-67, he dropped classroom teaching and developed the “block”, where students learned in a workshop format producing magazines, plays and poetry. Three years after Ugandan independence, the school was a tense mix of its original students of Asian origin and new students from local African communities. My father addressed this by establishing a theatre festival with performances in all the different languages spoken in the school. In the early 1970s he left his teaching post and moved back to the south coast and set up Word and Action (Dorset). In the early years of the group Pat and Greg separated and Greg met Liz Reeve, who became his long-term partner. For more than 30 years, WA(D) performed Instant Theatre, and scripted plays in Dorset, around the UK and all over Europe. It employed around 100 people and was largely self-funding. Greg retired from WA(D), and moved back to Market Drayton in 2005, when he married Jean Corbishley. He became the “enabler” of the local University of the Third Age poetry group and published his own verse. In all he did, he was a great believer in the human spirit. He is survived by Jean, his three children, Sue, Andrew and me, from his first marriage, and two children, Jack and Matthew, from his relationship with Liz, as well as five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/mar/02/working-class-children-born-to-fail-teachers-disadvantaged-pupils","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T07:30:42Z","webTitle":"Born to fail?

No. But working class children do need help to succeed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Getting education right for working class children remains a challenge in many schools. As a working class professor, it’s something I think about a lot. Theresa May has already admitted that the education system is failing to serve the needs of every child and that the odds are stacked against working-class pupils. The team behind the BBC’s new Generation Gifted series, which follows the lives of six disadvantaged 13-year-olds, say they were inundated with headteachers keen to highlight the uneven playing field that bright, disadvantaged pupils face compared to wealthier children. The gap in literacy, writing and maths between students receiving free school meals and their peers is significant, even at primary school. By the end of secondary school, the most disadvantaged students are on average two years of learning behind their better-off classmates. Among girls, the difference is even more stark – a 2017 analysis by the OECD’s programme for international student assessment found that girls in the top 10% for attainment but bottom 10% by income – classed as “bright but poor” – in England trailed their bright and well-off female peers by three school years in science and reading. How do schools begin to close this gap between rich and poor? I believe it starts by addressing the idea that being working class itself is a failure. Instead, we must acknowledge the curriculum’s inbuilt middle class prejudices, understand that not every child will go to university, and emphasise that success comes in all shapes and sizes. Identifying barriers Unfortunately the national curriculum in England has been developed based on the knowledge and learning experienced by middle-class people, rather than a world that all young children can identify with. Many of the social and cultural references in exams, for example, relate to middle-class experiences. As a sector, we need to do better to increase the understanding of how working class, disadvantaged and special educational needs children – groups particularly at risk of underachievement – learn. Despite the push to increase the number of young people who go to university, a recent Ipsos Mori poll found the proportion of pupils from “low affluence” households who believe they will go on to university has fallen to an all-time low, thanks in part to higher tuition fees. In other countries, vocational routes are seen as providing good opportunities. But UK children are pushed to pass the required exams, go to university, get a degree or two, buy their own house and contribute in a pre-specified way to society. More should be done to prepare children for the world of work, whether that is through a vocational or academic route. Schools play a key role in breaking down barriers to learning by providing opportunities for all children – regardless of what their parents earn – to participate in social and cultural activities, sport, the arts, debating, volunteering, wider community-based provision, museums and other trips. But funding cuts have meant schools offer a declining number of extracurricular activities, which disproportionately impacts those from working class backgrounds. Richer students are more likely to have access to these at home and the subsequent opportunities to develop teamwork, creativity and problem-solving skills. Encourage ambition Learning about the workplace doesn’t have to start at secondary school. Offering career advice and suggestions at an early stage helps ambition develop naturally and is particularly helpful for students whose parents are not in work. Working-class children aren’t born to fail. But we need an approach that will build self belief in every child. Schools can help by instilling aspiration, access, attainment , and achievement at the earliest stages of their development. Increasing access to learning for all children should be the benchmark of any successful school. I have seen schools where building self-belief and a sense of belonging has improved academic outcomes, behaviour and attendance. But our approach should change because of more than that. As a society we must strive to create opportunities that build character, resilience, drive and grit for all children, wherever they come from. Sonia Blandford is the author of Born to Fail?

They are excluded from freshers’ week functions ticketed in halls and, if they do go on a night out, they are constantly checking their phones for the last train. Commuter students, living with their families, are not having an easy time in a system geared to the residential experience. But given the soaring costs of halls, staying at home can seem an attractive option. There is mounting evidence, however, that these students are missing out. They are significantly less likely than their peers in halls to say they are learning a lot on their courses, according to the latest student academic experience survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi). “It’s a largely unspoken problem and one that universities need to tackle if they are to treat students equitably,” says Nick Hillman, its director. Since the trebling of fees five years ago and the scrapping of maintenance grants for students from poorer backgrounds, it is hardly surprising that living at home is popular, especially among poorer students. Most universities have a substantial proportion of commuters, some more than half of their undergraduates. And yet, most don’t even know how many they have, says Liz Thomas, professor of higher education at Edge Hill University and author of a recent study of the commuter student experience funded by the Student Engagement Partnership. “Commuter students are an overlooked and often misunderstood group,” she says. “If you look at prospectuses there will be pages devoted to accommodation and little if anything for commuters, best routes to get there, where they can park or where they can store their books and equipment. I find it shocking that students told us about being locked out of lectures or shouted at if they were held up. I have never been locked out of my office when the train was late.” Because they mix less, they may feel that a degree alone will get them a good job, and not understand the value of volunteering and internships, she adds. Commuter students cannot just roll out of bed for lectures. Zamzam Ibrahim, who studied finance at the University of Salford and lives in Bolton, travelled two hours a day. “I didn’t get the opportunity to attend all the fun stuff because travel is so difficult at night and expensive. Students who don’t move out tend to stay involved in their lives back home rather than make new friends and I think we miss out on a massive experience,” she says. However, Ibrahim threw herself into student union activities and last year was elected to the sabbatical post of president of the University of Salford Students’ Union. Knowing the challenges faced by those who commute, she is keen to promote change. “I lived at home because I did not feel my parents could support me financially and the student maintenance loan doesn’t cover the costs if you live in halls. I didn’t take advantage of freshers’ week, for example, because I thought my classes did not start until the next week so it was not worth paying the fares. Now I know that week is crucial for all students.” There is a “tough luck” attitude to students who have caring duties or transport problems, and it has to change, she says. It is not only a moral imperative but a practical one, says Hillman. “The data shows that commuter students are less likely to get good degrees and more likely to drop out,” he says. However, he adds that other factors might also explain their underperformance. Students who live at home are more likely to come from low-income households, to struggle financially and do paid work. They are also more likely to be carers, parents, or mature students. “That makes them even more worthy of support on campus,” he says. Higher education could learn from boarding schools, says Hillman. “Long ago, they developed the concept of ‘day boarders’ who are members of a boarding house while not actually living there. Giving commuter students membership of halls with access to the facilities and opportunities to socialise would cost little and could quickly pay for itself through better academic outcomes and lower drop-out rates.” The high cost of rents and transport in London contributes to a large number of commuter students in the capital. Yousef El-T, a medical student at King’s College London, lives at home with his family for financial reasons and is the vice-president for education (health) of the King’s College London students’ union. The student union’s events at the start of the academic year help students connect, he says. At the University of Leicester, Azza Abdulla, who graduated last year in management and marketing, used to miss lectures if she arrived late. “If you are a few minutes late, through no fault of your own, you risk being humiliated by the lecturer. I can understand that lecturers find it aggravating, but when they confront the student in front of 400 others, it is intimidating and makes you feel ostracised,” she says. She adds that her first few months were challenging because other students had formed social groups in their halls. “It was a big struggle to approach students I didn’t know and find a group of friends,” says Abdulla, now the education officer of the University of Leicester Students’ Union. She is leading a research project to gather evidence on commuter students before putting recommendations to the university. “Everything is catering for on-campus students and we need to find ways to make sure every student feels part of a strong community. Should there be more events and society meetings in the daytime, for example? Do we need more car parking, and can we improve security for students who have to travel home late at night?” Leicester is digitising its campus so students can watch videos of lectures, and that will be a big help to students who commute, she says. Kingston, south-west London, is one of the universities where more than 50% of undergraduates commute, some from as far away as Essex and Portsmouth. It has responded by holding fewer academic sessions early in the morning or in the late afternoon. Small changes can make a big difference. Just bringing back lockers would help, says Ilyas Nagdee, a graduate of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Manchester and now the black students’ officer for the National Union of Students. “On Tuesdays I was in university from 10am to 6pm for four different classes, and every Wednesday I knew I would have backache from carrying heavy books around all day,” he says. Over the past two years Manchester has made a series of changes, such as a residential event before the start of the academic year. It also pays for a full-time engagement officer to look after the interests of its commuter students. This has had a big impact, says Nagdee. “There are many campuses where live-at-home students are in the majority and we are still not meeting their needs. There is a lot more universities could and should be doing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/2018/feb/02/the-appraisal-is-dead-long-live-the-catchup","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T09:49:36Z","webTitle":"The appraisal is dead.

Importantly, they also take up a lot of time – when Deloitte analysed their own process, they found managers and employees spent around 2m hours a year on performance reviews. A growing number of companies have decided to abolish performance reviews altogether, instead introducing more regular catchups. Software company Adobe Systems used to hold annual reviews for staff, collecting 360-degree evaluations for each team member. In 2012, a decision was made to switch to a “check-in” process where managers meet with staff at least once a quarter and discuss expectations, feedback, and growth and development. Adobe has since seen a 30% decrease in the number of employees quitting – and recovered the thousands of hours managers and employees had been spending on their reviews. Sir Cary Cooper, visiting professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University, says performance appraisals are useless. “If you have socially and interpersonally skilled managers from shop floor to top floor they should give people positive and negative feedback every day, not once a year.” Chris Bruney, talent acquisition team lead for EMEA at Hootsuite, says regular contact between employees and managers is important. “We advocate regular employee/manager one-to-one time and we check in with staff regularly throughout the year to hear their views on everything from company leadership to how they feel about the culture of the business,” he says. Regular feedback ensures staff can work on it, explains Cooper: “I might be a person who is quite abrasive in management meetings – rather than waiting until July the following year to tell me that, a really good manager would be straight on it, saying: ‘Be a bit more open, don’t put people down. I noticed you do that.’ That is the way to give examples – regularly. And the same applies to praise, when people do a good job.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2018/jan/25/doomsday-clock-ticked-forward-trump-nuclear-weapons-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T16:54:36Z","webTitle":"'Doomsday Clock' ticked forward 30 seconds to 2 minutes to midnight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/doomsday-clock-ticked-forward-trump-nuclear-weapons-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/25/doomsday-clock-ticked-forward-trump-nuclear-weapons-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"'Doomsday Clock' ticked forward 30 seconds to 2 minutes to midnight","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The risk to global civilisation is as high today as it has ever been in the face of twin threats, nuclear weapons and climate change, a group of leading scientists has announced, putting a significant share of the blame on the Trump administration. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its symbolic Doomsday Clock forward 30 seconds, to two minutes to midnight, in a reflection of how the scientists view the dangers facing the world. The only other time the clock was set so close to catastrophe in its 71-year history was in 1953, after the US and the Soviet Union detonated their first thermonuclear bombs. In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, the clock was set back to 17 minutes to midnight, but optimism about humanity’s future has steadily eroded since then. “To call the world’s nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy,” said Rachel Bronson, the bulletin’s president and CEO, told journalists in Washington. In explaining their decision on Thursday, scientists from the bulletin’s widely respected science and security board said that they were disturbed by the rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, the increasing emphasis and expenditure on nuclear weapons by major powers, the absence of arms control negotiations around the world, and the wavering political will to combat climate change. In the year since the hands on the Doomsday Clock were last adjusted, North Korea has carried out its sixth nuclear test, the most powerful to date and almost certainly its first hydrogen bomb. It has also made three successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the third of which, in November, appeared to be capable of reaching New York or Washington. At the same time, Trump has engaged in a highly personalised exchange of insults with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. He has threatened “fire and fury” against the nation, and vowed to “totally destroy” if Pyongyang continued to threaten the US American strategic bombers have flown north of the 38th parallel that divides the peninsula, along the North Korean coast. The bulletin’s scientists repeatedly singled out the Trump administration as a major factor behind the increased risks to the planet, pointing out the president’s volatility as expressed in his tweets and statements; the inconsistency of the administration’s foreign policy; and its apparent disdain for science, reflected in its high-level appointments, which have included climate change deniers. “Our allies and adversaries alike are being forced [into a] thicket of conflicting policy statements, from a US administration weakened in its roster of foreign policy professionals and unable to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent foreign – much less nuclear – policy,” said Robert Rosner, the chair of the bulletin’s science and security board. “This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability.” Sharon Squassoni, a professor at George Washington University’s institute for international science and technology policy also pointed to Russia’s role in heightening tensions. Last year, for instance, it fielded ground-launched cruise missiles, violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. “Russia has engaged in provocative and illegal behaviours thought to be part of cold war history,” Squassoni said. Some experts argue that the comparison with the height of the cold war was an exaggeration. “During the height of the cold war there was a nontrivial risk of global nuclear annihilation,” Vipin Narang, a North Korea and nuclear expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a tweet. “Today, the risk of single use may be higher but it’s unlikely to threaten global destruction.” The bulletin scientists said that climate change also weighed heavily in their deliberations. After flattening out for some years, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise and the levels of the polar ice caps are at new lows. “Here in the US, the incoming President Trump promptly appointed a cadre of avowed climate denialists and quickly started reversing existing climate measures,” said Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute. Trump was also criticised for downgrading the science in his administration. Lawrence Krauss, the chair of the bulletin’s board of sponsors, said that 2017 marked that the first time since the position was created more than a half-century ago that there was no presidential science adviser. “The White House office of science and technology policy is essentially not staffed,” Krauss said. “The official mechanisms to tie public policy to reality are currently absent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/25/three-times-more-people-dying-from-flu-in-uk-than-last-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T17:13:45Z","webTitle":"Three times more people dying from flu in UK than last winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/three-times-more-people-dying-from-flu-in-uk-than-last-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/25/three-times-more-people-dying-from-flu-in-uk-than-last-winter","fields":{"headline":"Three times more people dying from flu in UK than last winter","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three times as many people are dying of flu this winter in the UK compared with last year, with the death toll since October now at 155, figures show. Last week there was a big jump in the number of people hospitalised with the virus and further increases in the numbers being treated in critical care units or visiting a GP with flu-like symptoms. Across the UK last week 35 people died of flu – more than three times the 11 deaths recorded in the corresponding seven days last January. Similarly, the death toll since October is about treble the 53 that occurred in the same period last winter. The toll is the highest it has been at this stage of winter since 2014-15. The figures from Public Health England show that what it says is the worst flu outbreak since 2010-11 is affecting fewer adults but leaving growing numbers of children unwell. But PHE believes the number of people contracting flu has begun to plateau, a picture confirmed by the Royal College of GPs from its separate flu surveillance system. “We are continuing to see flu circulate. However, rates across most indicators have remained relatively stable and signs are that flu activity is starting to peak,” said Richard Pebody, PHE’s acting head of respiratory diseases. PHE said it hoped the fact that 1.5 million more people had had the flu jab this winter compared with 2016-17 would help limit the infection’s spread. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the RCGP, said: “Influenza rates have levelled out for now. [However] there are still huge numbers of patients being seen in general practice with flu and other common winter conditions – and GPs and our teams are certainly feeling the pressure.” PHE said the rate of people visiting a GP with influenza-like illness (ILI) crept up last week to 54.1 per 100,000 of population in England, from 53.1 the week before. It added: “GP consultations for ILI decreased for adults, [but] increases were noted in the five to 14 years age group.” The number of people calling the NHS 111 telephone helpline or GP out-of-hours services because of flu in children that age underlined that picture, PHE said. The RCGP said that, based on its analysis of flu data from surgeries, the rate of people visiting a GP with flu rose in the south of England last week from 54.3 to 59.6 per 100,000 population, and in London from 42.1 to 44.9. It fell in the north of England from 57.3 to 54.9 per 100,000 population and in the Midlands and east of England from 57.9 to 53.6. Last week 758 people were admitted to hospital as a result of flu – a big rise on the 598 the week before. However, the number of people ending up in intensive care or a high-dependency unit because of flu went up only slightly, from 198 to 205. Those figures are based on a sample of 22 trusts – about one-ninth of the total number – and the 205 figure does not represent the full picture of all those admitted to a UK hospital as an emergency because of flu. The number of flu outbreaks rose last week to 231 from 216, and 163 of those occurred in a care home. About six in 10 children in England have had a free flu jab this winter, slightly more than last year. Almost two-thirds (63.9%) of frontline healthcare workers have also been immunised, up 2.1% on last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/10/raising-a-non-binary-child-as-long-as-one-of-the-side-effects-wasnt-death-it-was-the-right-way","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T05:59:08Z","webTitle":"Raising a non-binary child: ‘As long as one of the side-effects wasn't death, it was the right way’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/10/raising-a-non-binary-child-as-long-as-one-of-the-side-effects-wasnt-death-it-was-the-right-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/10/raising-a-non-binary-child-as-long-as-one-of-the-side-effects-wasnt-death-it-was-the-right-way","fields":{"headline":"Raising a non-binary child: ‘As long as one of the side-effects wasn't death, it was the right way’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘There was a moment, at the height of the problems, where I felt I had lost my perfect girl and now I had a broken boy. I had no idea how to deal with that, so I just forced myself to think ‘I will be really positive: I have not lost a daughter, I have gained a son.’” Ally is recalling the turmoil, two years ago, that surrounded her then 14-year-old daughter Caleb’s decision to transition from female to male; what she didn’t realise then was that Caleb’s journey had only just begun. After three months of taking testosterone, Caleb decided not to transition – choosing instead to avoid identifying as male or female – and began to identify as non-binary, using the pronouns they and their. For now, Caleb remains on hormone blockers, postponing a female puberty while deciding how to proceed. Ally, 47, understands the treatment is controversial but has fully supported Caleb: “I knew the risks, the ethical dilemmas and side-effects. But for me, as long as one of the side-effects wasn’t death then it was the right way forward.” It was, though, something much more prosaic than death that caused early problems: pronouns. While Ally has accepted the situation, other people aren’t so able to grasp what it means to be non-binary: “NHS medical practitioners have told me it is ridiculous. One doctor refused to use ‘they’ – she said it was impossible. Someone else told me they were a ‘grammatical purist’ and would continue to use ‘she’. Although it might seem unusual at first, really, we have to try. These people don’t seem to realise that constantly mis-gendering Caleb is very offensive.” Ally noticed that Caleb was not going to be a typical little girl at a young age: Caleb was very androgynous and a big, muscly child – “not feminine at all. It was then I thought perhaps I was going to have a gay daughter – which would have been fine.” Caleb struggled to fit in at primary school, and was bullied. “It broke my heart, but the school just told me that kids can be cruel and Caleb was sensitive,” says Ally, who split from Caleb’s father when Caleb was a toddler. “Around 13, Caleb’s female friends began to wear makeup, dresses and high heels. Caleb’s attitude was very much ‘No thanks, not for me.’” As the friendship group began to change and break down, Caleb didn’t conform. This is when the abuse on social media began – “teenage stuff on the one hand, but heartbreaking on the other, as it made Caleb so unhappy,” says Ally. Caleb was given medical leave from school and began seeing a counsellor for stress and anxiety. Ally decided on a fresh start, and a new school. “Caleb made new friends and all was well in our world. Then, in August 2015, Caleb came out as gay, aged 14. I wasn’t surprised at all. It made sense. I felt completely comfortable about it.” But just weeks later, Caleb wanted to transition to a boy. “I hadn’t seen it coming at all,” says Ally. “My overriding emotion was that I was really pleased Caleb was able to confide in me. In hindsight, I was so naive. I just thought we’d go to the doctor and get some medicine that would put puberty on pause and give Caleb time to think.” Ally contacted Mermaids, a charity supporting young people who are questioning their gender, and learned that the waiting list to be considered for treatment would be at least three months. “When I realised just what lay ahead, I began to feel very overwhelmed. That’s when I started doing some real research. It was my way of trying to get some level of agency and control back. “Mermaids was invaluable to me. Whatever we have gone through, there has been someone there who has gone through it, too. It was a relief to know we weren’t alone and this wasn’t my fault.” As they waited for treatment, Caleb also began a social transition. “I wrote to the school, telling them that Caleb would now be living as a boy,” Ally recalls. “I included links to training and more information for them and thought that would be it. But I was so wrong.” After going public with their transition at school, Caleb was verbally abused, spat at, pushed, shoved and slapped. “Caleb’s social media pages were plastered with abuse, calling them tranny and freak. These students also consistently and constantly mis-gendered Caleb, using ‘she’. It demolished Caleb’s self-confidence and the new identity they were trying to build. “The school said it would train staff and pupils about trans issues, but nothing materialised. I began to feel quite depressed, and I pulled Caleb out of school. They were placed in a small medical unit for students with mental health issues. I just wanted Caleb to be able to study somewhere they were not constantly under fire. I tried to shut out my own grief and anxiety, but there were days when I felt there was very little hope. I did have moments where I would sob for the daughter I had lost.” Caleb began to self-harm and even admitted to Ally that they had made a plan to kill themself. Ally began to sleep on Caleb’s bedroom floor, to ensure her child would still be alive in the morning. With no resolution from school, Ally reported the main culprits to the police for hate crime; they received a caution. Caleb finally received a referral, via London’s Tavistock Centre mental health trust, to start on hormone blockers, but was told a physical examination – including a genital examination – would be necessary first. Ally says: “Caleb began to sob. They couldn’t bear to look at themself in the shower, let alone strip naked for a stranger. They said, ‘Mum, please, I can’t do it,’ so we walked away. I was furious the system would force young people with such severe gender dysphoria to undergo such an exam.” Ally then contacted Dr Helen Webberley, a GP who specialises in gender and who issues private prescriptions for hormone treatment. In August 2016, she prescribed blockers for Caleb. Three months later, Ally approached Webberley again, this time for a prescription for testosterone. Caleb was 15, and NHS guidelines recommend that young people should be 16 to have cross-sex hormones, or have been on blockers for at least a year. (In September 2017, the General Medical Council began to investigate Webberley after concerns were raised by the Tavistock Centre about her medical treatment of other young trans people. Webberley says: “I welcome the GMC investigation if it will assuage the fears of those who wrongly accuse me of substandard practice.”) Caleb started using a low-dose testosterone gel, but after three months told Ally they had changed their mind. Caleb felt instead that they could not conform to being male or female, and were non-binary. The low dosage of testosterone, and short amount of time it was taken for, seems not to have had a permanent effect. Caleb, now 16, remains on hormone blockers. Ally realises this isn’t a long-term solution, but after more than two years of emotional trauma and turmoil, she is still reluctant to make any detailed plans for the future. For the moment, Caleb is studying fashion and design at college. “I am hopeful for the future,” Ally says. “I don’t know whether Caleb is extraordinary or has become extraordinary because of what has happened. Caleb is the gentlest of souls but the strongest of spirits. It will be 18 months before they can even be referred for adult surgery. People can change and evolve and grow – we have seen this through our journey. Caleb is kind, generous, sassy and funny. I look at them and I think, by the skin of my teeth, we made it.” In treatment: the NHS and young trans people NHS England guidelines state that young people who identify as transgender can be prescribed hormone blockers from puberty, providing they meet “relevant criteria”. There is no set age for this; each case is assessed individually depending on the patient’s development. It is recommended that cross-sex hormones (testosterone or oestrogen) are not prescribed to patients who meet the eligibility criteria until “around their 16th birthday”. Criteria include the patient being assessed by specialists over a period of time; the patient having received hormone blockers for a period of time; and the patient understanding the long-term impact of cross-sex hormones on their fertility. Gender reassignment surgery is not undertaken until a patient is over 18.

Ministers have already had two previous plans declared illegal but environmental lawyers ClientEarth argue that even the latest plan fails to cut widespread illegal levels of pollution in the “shortest possible time”, as required by EU law. Nathalie Lieven QC told the court: “On [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’] own assessment there continues to be a very significant impact on human health for many years into the future.” The barrister said that pollution will not fall below legal limits until 2028 in London and 2021 in most other urban areas. The judge hearing the case on Thursday, Mr Justice Garnham, sharply criticised the government when ruling against ministers in a previous case: “The continued failure of the government to comply with directives and regulations constitutes a significant threat to public health.” The government has already spent £370,000 of taxpayers’ money in failed attempts to fight air pollution court action. Nitrogen dioxide pollution, mostly produced by diesel vehicles, has been illegally high in most urban parts of Britain since 2010. The government’s latest plan, produced in July, was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors. In September, the UN’s special rapporteur on pollution said the government was “flouting” its duty to protect the lives and health of its citizens and the problem was declared a public health emergency by a cross-party committee of MPs in April 2016. ClientEarth argues that the latest plan backtracks on “clean air zones” in Birmingham, Derby, Leeds, Nottingham and Southampton. These zones would use charges to deter polluting vehicles from city centres and were mandatory in previous plans, but are now only “expected” to be implemented. ClientEarth also say it is unacceptable that the plan requires no action in 45 polluted local authorities including Leicester, Oxford, Liverpool, Cheltenham and Sunderland. The government’s own analysis shows charging zones to deter dirty cars are by far the most effective policy, but ministers have told councils they should only be the option of last resort. However, Kassie Smith QC, representing the environment secretary Michael Gove, said the complaints about the government plans are “misconceived”, as work was being undertaken to improve air quality in England. She also said new measures could not be introduced in time to accelerate the government’s compliance with the legal limits. Justice Garnham’s verdict will be issued in the coming weeks. Jenny Bates, at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s time for the government to stop dragging its feet and commit to the urgent action needed [including] improving public transport.” Earlier on Thursday in parliament, Sue Hayman, Labour’s shadow environment, asked Gove: “Just how critical does the situation have to get before the government finally starts to comply with the high court rulings?” The Welsh government was also being sued by ClientEarth, but it conceded at the start of the hearing that its plans were inadequate and agreed to a “consent order”, which means they will work with ClientEarth to improve the plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/26/goodbye-mark-e-smith-presidents-club-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T23:57:57Z","webTitle":"Goodbye to Mark E Smith, and good riddance to a charity fundraiser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/goodbye-mark-e-smith-presidents-club-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/26/goodbye-mark-e-smith-presidents-club-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Goodbye to Mark E Smith, and good riddance to a charity fundraiser","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Monday Theresa May’s attempt to show solidarity with the Scots by holding a Burns Night dinner at No 10 didn’t get off to the best of starts as the official invitation list contained a number of misspellings. Not only was the chief executive of Standard Life, Keith Skeoch, labelled as Keith Sceogh, the prime minister’s team didn’t even seem to know the names of three of her own Scottish MPs. Andrew Bowie became Andrew Bowies, David Duguid became David Dugauid and Ross Thomson became Ross Thompson. To make matters even worse, No 10 managed to get the names of the Scotch Whisky Association and the Scottish Rugby Union wrong. If just one name had been misspelled, then it could have been written off as mere carelessness. Just one of those unfortunate things. But to have made so many errors in a comparatively small list suggests something rather more deliberate. Albeit unconsciously so. As any psychologist would be quick to point out, no one makes that many easily avoidable mistakes entirely by accident. Tuesday The Financial Times’s exposé of the Presidents Club charity fundraiser was jaw-dropping in so many ways. From the shameless exploitation of women to all the men who were there but insist they left long before anything untoward took place. If these men are to be believed, there was no one left at the Dorchester apart from the hostesses from 10.30pm onwards. The Conservative children’s and families minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said that even though he didn’t see anything to give cause for concern, he left early because he felt uncomfortable. He must be telepathic. What also came to light was the secondary market in auction prizes. It turns out that the prize of tea with the governor of the Bank of England wasn’t something that Mark Carney had put forward as a gesture of support for the Presidents Club; rather it was one that the Bank had offered to a previous charity auction and which the winner couldn’t be bothered to take up. Given the choice of a quick cuppa with Carney to discuss monetary policy or watching the World Indoor Bowls championships on TV, the bowls had won hands down and the prize had been passed on to another charity. Wednesday Normally the Oscars nominations rather slip me by as I’ve never seen any of the films in contention, but this year I happen to have recently seen two of the ones in the running for multiple awards. While I’ve no problem with Gary Oldman winning the best actor in a prosthetic category, I fail to see what all the fuss about Darkest Hour is about. The whole film lapsed into absurdity when Churchill leapt out of his ministerial car to disappear into the underground so that he could hold a seminar with the ordinary men and women of Britain on the merits of appeasement during a one-stop ride on the District line between St James’s and Westminster. Thank God he happened both to catch the slowest Tube in London and bump into a focus group who were up for a fight, otherwise 20th-century history would have had to be rewritten. On the other hand, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was a masterpiece of dysfunctional small-town American life. Gripping from start to finish with not a frame wasted. It deserves to win everything going. Thursday Who should turn up among the plutocrats and political and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos than a rather aimless David Cameron. The former prime minister has done little of any value since he resigned as prime minister – there again he did little of value when he was prime minister – and has now become a professional hanger-on among the global elites. No doubt hoping to pick up a £650K one-day-a-week sinecure. The rightwing press pounced on remarks he was overheard to make that Brexit wasn’t a total disaster as a sign he had come round to thinking leaving the EU was a good idea. Not only did this seem to be rather clutching at straws, it was a total category error. The whole point about Dave is that he is incapable of taking any responsibility for everything. Especially for screwing up the country. So the most it is psychologically possible for him to admit is that Brexit was a mistake. Friday I can’t help feeling that Elton John is hedging his bets by declaring he is going to give up touring by announcing a 300-date world tour that lasts three years. That’s a long time in which to change his mind. Not that I blame him for deciding he wants an easier life. Or just a different one. The excitement of going on stage to sing Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting must begin to pall when you’ve done it countless times before over the past 45 years, your back’s playing up and you’d rather be catching up with Spiral on BBC4. Growing old with grace seems to be especially difficult for rock musicians, something the Rolling Stones have managed spectacularly badly. The young Mick Jagger and Keith Richards would have hated what they have now become. Only Leonard Cohen and David Bowie really seemed to manage the transition to old age with real class, but then there was always something timeless about both of them. But Mark E Smith, who died on Wednesday and went down fighting, just as he had lived, ran them close. My favourite story about the Fall’s lead singer was that he only agreed to appear on Jools Holland’s show on the proviso that the presenter didn’t accompany the band with his boogie-woogie piano.

In a further loosening of the grip of the Catholic church in the country, the intoxicating liquor bill 2017 was passed in the Dáil with all-party support and will now be enacted in time for Good Friday 2018, which falls on 30 March. “It is a very significant change,” said Gillian Daly, of the Licensed Vintners Association in Dublin. “Easter is a big weekend with tourists flocking to Ireland, and a lot of them show up for the world-famous Irish pubs and are shocked to find they are not open. It has been a long wait for this.” Easter weekend is arguably the biggest religious feast in the Catholic calendar. Drinkers regularly ignored the booze ban and stocked up at off-licences on Holy Thursday. Introducing the bill in the Dáil, the minister David Stanton said overturning the ban on selling alcohol was a sign of “changing demographics and increasing diversity in our population”, which he said had “led to a reduction in traditional religious practice” in the country. The church and state were once so intertwined in Ireland that there were also bans on divorce and contraception, both now long gone. A ban on abortion has been more divisive, with a referendum on the issue expected before the summer. The Northern Ireland hospitality sector made an immediate call for full alignment in the region.

The awards come flooding in, as do vague references to Stanislavski’s method, and the clickbaity headlines set the internet ablaze: Matthew McConaughey packs on 40lb for his turn as a gold-miner! Christian Bale ate a single can of tuna a day for The Machinist! Cameron Diaz uglies up in Being John Malkovich! Watching the spectacle of celebrity mutation excites us both as gossip-mongers and moviegoers, since we appreciate dedication to craft as much as we do a grainy on-set photo of Matthew McConaughey cradling his pot-belly like a stray dog he’s just encountered. But just as often as these good-looking people make themselves less so in the name of art, actors are cast as substantially less attractive real-life people and don’t undergo the same bodily metamorphosis. CGI, hair and makeup go a long way, but for every Charlize Theron-as-Aileen Wuornos or Robert De Niro-as-Jake LaMotta, there are times where we’re asked to accept a character as “ugly” because their hair is frizzy or their teeth imperfect. But let’s face it: sometimes, by no fault of their own, actors are simply too attractive for the role. This came to mind when the former Disney Channel star Ross Lynch played Jeffrey Dahmer last year, and when Zac Efron was cast as Ted Bundy in an upcoming biopic, and when Margot Robbie channeled Tonya Harding, and, most recently, as Taylor Kitsch and Darren Criss appear, respectively, in the new series Waco as Branch Davidian cult leader David Koresh, and as serial killer Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. In Waco, Kitsch tries to expunge himself of Friday Night Lights heartthrob Tim Riggins to play Koresh, pseudo-prophet, alleged sexual abuser, and leader of the Branch Davidian religious movement. Kitsch plays the part formidably, but you can’t help but wonder how Waco would look if the camera weren’t so enamored by its lead, who broods and smizes so frequently it’s as if he’s been conditioned to play up his looks. Then you remember it’s Kitsch, and he probably has been. Although he shares something of a resemblance to Andrew Cunanan, Darren Criss’s performance in Versace is similarly gratuitous in the way only an excessively handsome person could make it, and the end result is a particularly doe-eyed brand of menace. I’ll hold off on any pre-emptive judgment of Efron’s turn in the new Joe Berlinger-directed Bundy biopic, but I’m not optimistic about that one, either. Hollywood is of course a business, one that’s in the business of prettification; often, our enjoyment of its product is incumbent on our suspension of disbelief. But that becomes more difficult with biopics, particularly those concerning subjects of ill repute. When serial killers and cult leaders and disgraced figure skaters are made more attractive – read: packaged for box office consumption – than they really were, is something lost in the process? Are the films forcing upon us a redemptive arc that hasn’t been earned? First, let’s look at the scholarship: there are, to put it mildly, competing schools of thought among academics about the conflation of beauty with evil. In a 1998 essay, the philosopher Mary Devereaux looked at the case of Leni Reifenstahl’s 1935 film Triumph of the Will, regarded by most cineastes as one of the most important, visually engrossing films ever made and, also, a heinous lionization of Adolf Hitler and the Nuremberg rallies (pardon the obeisance to Godwin’s Law). Devereaux argued that the film’s valuable insofar as it makes you question the Platonic notion that beauty and moral goodness proceed from one another. “Indeed, one of the most shocking things about Triumph of the Will is that it so clearly demonstrates that beauty and goodness can come apart,” she wrote, “not just in the relatively simple sense that moral and aesthetic evaluation may diverge, but in the more frightening sense that it is possible for art to render evil beautiful.” Some scholars are purists, and others still feel that the moral can’t be divorced from the aesthetic, and that the gussying up of reprehensible people amounts to a reappraisal, a muddying of the ethical waters. Triumph of the Will is of course a loftier, more high-stakes case study than the ones at hand; Hollywood has so far stopped short of casting a preternatural beauty to play Hitler. But there’s something to be said about the industry’s insistence on endearing us to crummy people by making them sexy. If it’s not manipulative and cynical, it is disingenuous; these casting decisions are oriented around bankability, not believability. In the best-case scenario, the performance, like Robbie’s in I, Tonya, is still gutsy and commendable, even as the film itself lazily deploys scrunchy hairbands and braces to sell its version of Harding (her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly also gets a not-insignificant sprucing up at the hands of the uber-handsome Sebastian Stan). At worst, they result in tone-deaf marketing, like how Jennifer Aniston, in Cake, was meant to be “ugly”. “This isn’t about culling conventionally attractive people from your TV screens,” wrote Lindy West in a Jezebel piece called Why We Need More Ugly People on TV. “It’s not about telling you who you ‘can’ and ‘can’t’ find attractive. It’s about decoupling women’s value from their desirability, and embracing the idea that people are more complicated than that.” Maybe this is why, when we talk about the lengths actors go for roles, the reverse facelifts they execute in the name of authenticity, we so readily wax poetic about their commitment and artistic zeal. Because, most of the time, studios are actually quite lazy in this regard. It’s a point of fact that when we watch a movie or television show the actors therein are considerably better-looking than us laymen. But Ted Bundy was no centerfold, and it seems just a bit unscrupulous to reimagine him as one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/27/tax-return-form","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T12:28:33Z","webTitle":"UK tax returns: here’s how to tackle yours now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/27/tax-return-form","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/27/tax-return-form","fields":{"headline":"UK tax returns: here’s how to tackle yours now","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As Winston Churchill famously put it, “The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.” Churchill was actually speaking about the threat posed by the rearmament of Germany, but he could just as easily have been talking about the lengths people go to put off doing their self-assessment tax return, and the hazards of late filing. With just five days to go until the deadline of midnight on 31 January, it has emerged that as many as 3 million people still have not filed their tax return. On Wednesday this week, HM Revenue &amp; Customs revealed that almost 3.6m of the 11.8m returns issued had not been sent back, though that number will have come down a bit since then. If you still haven’t done yours yet, you need to get cracking. The good news is that if your affairs are simple – perhaps you have been dragged into self-assessment because of the high-income child benefit tax charge – you may be able to get it done in as little as 20-30 minutes. Here are are top tips for getting the job done (relatively) painlessly. The top five basics • Do you need to do one? There is a tool on the HMRC website to find out if you need to send in a tax return for the 2016-17 tax year. Broadly speaking, you need to do a return if you: are self-employed; you received £2,500 or more in untaxed income, such as from renting out a property; your income (or your partner’s) was more than £50,000 and one of you claimed child benefit; your income from savings or investments was £10,000 or more before tax; you made profits from selling things such as shares or a second home and need to pay capital gains tax; you were a company director, unless it was for a non-profit organisation and you didn’t get any pay or benefits; or your taxable income was more than £100,000. • Have you registered? The bad news is that if you have never filed a tax return before, you will need to register first – which can take up to 20 working days. However, it may be quicker to set up a personal tax account and use that for your return. • Get your papers together Dig out all the bits of paper that you need, such as P60/P45/P11D, PAYE coding notices and tax certificates for investments. For self-employed income, you need your bank statements, sales invoices and so on. • Don’t forget the penalties The initial “fine” for a late tax return is a £100 fixed penalty. Then, after three months, there are additional daily penalties of £10 a day, with further penalties after six and 12 months. • There’s plenty of help available Check out the HMRC website or call the helpline on 0300 200 3310. The top five tips • If you are renting out a property, claim all revenue expenses associated with the letting including letting agent fees, mortgage interest, ground rent, replacement of furniture and appliances, but not capital expenditure such as improvements to the property, says accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. • If you are letting out a room in your own home, is it more tax-efficient for you to claim the annual £7,500 (£3,750 if you share the income with your partner) Rent a Room Scheme allowance? • If you use your car for business and your employer pays you less than the HMRC maximum approved mileage rate (45p for the first 10,000 miles and 25p a mile above this), you can claim the excess. • If you are a member of a professional body required for your employment, you can often include the cost of the subscription as an allowable deduction. • Don’t forget to include your state pension figures. Although the state pension is paid gross, it is still taxable and needs to be included on your tax return. The most common errors • Don’t leave things out Probably the most common mistake is to miss something out – maybe a source of income you have forgotten about. And estimate if you have to, says Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. She adds: “If you’ve left it too late and there’s some paperwork outstanding that’s not going to get to you in time, you can submit an estimated return and update it when the paperwork arrives. You won’t pay a fine for this – whereas you will if you wait for the paperwork in order to submit the return.” • Don’t get your numbers in a muddle Another common error is, say, mixing up net with gross. • On the wrong tax code? Thousands of taxpayers may well be paying too much (or too little) tax as a result of having the wrong tax code. To get an idea of whether you are on the right one, try MoneySavingExpert.com’s online tax code calculator. • Don’t forget gift aid Include all the gift aid donations you have made during the tax year to claim any higher-rate tax relief. If you donated £100 using gift aid, the total value of your donation to the charity was £125, so if you pay tax at 40% you can personally claim back £25. • Don’t forget to pay what you owe! The deadline for paying any tax owed is also 31 January. “The payment can clear on the same day if you pay by debit card, but will sometimes take a day to go through. If you pay by BACS or direct debit it can take three days, or five days if this is the first time you have paid HMRC by direct debit,” says Coles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/25/bbc-to-air-major-nature-series-written-and-directed-by-women","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T17:59:39Z","webTitle":"BBC to air major nature series written and directed by women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/25/bbc-to-air-major-nature-series-written-and-directed-by-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/25/bbc-to-air-major-nature-series-written-and-directed-by-women","fields":{"headline":"BBC to air major nature series written and directed by women","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"BBC One will break new ground next week by broadcasting its first major natural history series written and directed entirely by women. The programme, Animals With Cameras, also features a diverse cast: its meerkats, chimps, cheetahs and penguins all turn camera operators to capture unprecedented footage that will help scientists understand and protect threatened species. Women in broadcasting will be celebrating the landmark series amid ongoing concerns about the underrepresentation of female directors in film and television – none won any awards at the most recent Baftas or Golden Globes. On the David Attenborough-fronted Planet Earth II, more than half the production team were female; other wildlife series have had all-female producers. But it is understood that Animals With Cameras, which airs on 1 February, is the first major BBC One nature show to be entirely written and directed by women. The decision was not deliberate, according to one of the directors, Anne Sommerfield. She and her colleagues Hannah Ward and Clare Dornan were “just the best candidates for the job available at the time”. But Sommerfield told the Guardian that it was an important moment. “The fact it was an all-female-directed series is a really encouraging sign,” she said. “I hope it inspires younger female film-makers to pursue their dreams.” Making the series was “an enormous technical challenge” and required “a lot of patience”, she said. “There were many sleepless nights for Chris Watt, who made the cameras and modified or repaired them in the field. He made 66 cameras – more than half of them were lost or broken by the animals.” The BBC came up with the idea of attaching tiny cameras to the creatures after talking to scientists who wanted to use lightweight gadgets to enter animals’ worlds. “We were guided by the scientists … we had the technology,” said Sommerfield, adding that the main motivation behind the experiment was the opportunity to benefit science. One of the many firsts in the series, which is fronted by the cameraman Gordon Buchanan, is its footage of newborn wild meerkats. With the help of Cambridge University scientists, the newborn pups were filmed inside their burrow via a collar camera on a meerkat. This revealed that they communicate with their parents from birth by chirping. “We had to have cameras that were under 5% of meerkats’ bodyweight, and that had lights and recording devices that were less than one-fifth the size of an iPhone,” Sommerfield said. “It had to be voluntary, they had to be 100% comfortable. I was director of casting; like people they are all individual characters. The animals were treated far better than the humans!” She said the animals’ self-shot footage was often ruined because dirt or smears would get on the camera lenses when they fought with or cleaned each other. “There was a lot of trial and error, and thousands of hours of film had to be assessed, some of which was blank or unusable.” Animals With Cameras also features a chimp collecting water to wash its hands; the first footage recorded by a camera mounted on a cheetah; and extraordinary underwater images of a gull snatching a fish from a penguin’s beak. Natural history programmes are currently proving popular with viewers. Blue Planet II was the most-watched television show of 2017, and Planet Earth II’s footage of iguanas being chased by snakes was voted Bafta’s “must-see moment” of last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/27/insured-to-cover-your-mortgage-repayments-youre-probably-losing-a-fortune","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T07:01:04Z","webTitle":"Insured to cover your mortgage repayments?

You’re probably losing a fortune","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Were you sold insurance to “cover” your mortgage? Were you told you had to have insurance, even though you’d rather not? You may well be wasting thousands of pounds. Our “How I spend it” column this week features Rebecca Parkin, a champion money saver, who managed to pay off her mortgage by the age of 42 and live debt-free. But she admits how as a “green” 30-year-old in 2005 she was talked into paying £174 a month for an insurance policy to cover her £85,000 mortgage. By shopping around independently, she has since found cover for £6.90 a month. She told me it was a requirement to have insurance with her mortgage. But there is absolutely no law or regulation that says you must have life insurance, or critical illness cover, or an income protection policy, with a mortgage. That such a financially savvy woman as Parkin was conned into wasting money this way suggests that maybe millions of people are labouring under this illusion – and throwing their cash away. In Parkin’s case, her £174-a-month policy would have generated commission worth around £4,000 to the broker who sold it. Typically, with these sorts of policies, the adviser receives between 185% to 200% of the first year’s premiums. So the incentive to push these policies is immense. The buyers are usually young and inexperienced in financial matters. During the 1990s lenders were still allowed to insist upon life cover. But by 2005 when Parkin was mis-sold her policy, such rules had been swept away. It has to be said that there are plausible reasons why someone should buy insurance cover when they take out a mortgage. If the borrower is self-employed and has kids with a non-earning partner, he or she would be mad not to have some sort of cover in place. But a single person, in their late 20s, with no dependents, working for a decent employer? If they die, the financial consequences are almost meaningless: the flat or house is sold, and the mortgage company takes the money they are owed. It makes no difference that the person has a life policy in place – it’s just a bonus to any relations. What’s more, the employer may have death-in-service cover as part of their benefits package, making buying additional insurance nonsensical. The risks of actually dying during your mortgage years – let’s say from your late 20s to your late 50s – are fantastically low. The average age for a first-time buyer is now just over 30. But the risk of a UK woman aged 25-34 dying in any one year in that age bracket is just 0.04%, while for men it’s 0.08%. Even at 54, the annual death risk for a woman is just 0.24%, rising to 0.36% in men. Once a male reaches the age of 85, the annual death risk is 16.6%, but by that time we can assume the mortgage is safely paid off. There’s a reason why pure life policies for people in their 20s and 30s – that only pay out on death during the life of the mortgage – can be found very cheaply: because they hardly ever pay out. It is less clear cut when it comes to critical illness or income protection policies. These pay a lump sum on diagnosis of things like cancer, or guarantee an income if you can no longer work. Again, they are sensible for the self-employed, although usually very expensive. It’s almost certainly what was sold to Parkin, even though she was a single, full-time teacher with generous sick pay entitlements. You should not entirely rule out buying a critical illness policy, but for most people in their 20s and 30s, the cost is simply too high for the relatively low risk involved. p.collinson@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/26/vegan-diet-lifestyle-health-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T14:00:49Z","webTitle":"Why vegans always have to tell you they’re vegan | Rebecca Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/vegan-diet-lifestyle-health-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/vegan-diet-lifestyle-health-animals","fields":{"headline":"Why vegans always have to tell you they’re vegan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“How do you know if someone is vegan? Don’t worry – they’ll tell you.” It’s an old joke, but it’s still doing the rounds. And now that we’re more than three weeks into Veganuary, there’s no getting away from veganism. I became a convert myself just over a year ago with the help of 2017’s Veganuary campaign. Oh, look. Just a few lines in and I’ve managed to tell you I’m a vegan. I have to say, when I first heard this joke, I was mildly amused and slightly embarrassed, probably because I am one of those annoying vegans who seem to use the word vegan in every sentence. See? I just did it again! My partner isn’t vegan but he’s kind enough to try all of my new recipes, and eats mainly plant-based foods at home. He has the patience of a saint, but even he has cracked the odd joke about my inability to talk about anything else. I am very lucky to have friends and family who are either vegan or vegetarian, or just interested in what I have to say on the matter. But it got me thinking about why vegans feel the need to tell the world. I think the first realisation you have when you become vegan is just how exciting it is. Rather than finding yourself limited to a restrictive diet, which is the expectation of most new vegans, a whole new world of food and a new way of cooking are opened up to you. You start experimenting with ingredients you’ve never used before, or sometimes never even heard of, like nooch or seitan, with amazing culinary results (some of the time), and you want everybody to taste what you’ve tasted. If you’ve been a hardened cheese addict for most of your life, like I was, of course you want your family to try the latest plant-based cheese that melts just like mozzarella! You can also find yourself feeling much more energetic and enthusiastic after the switch to a plant-based diet. I think this is in part because of the amount of healthy nutrients you’re getting on a daily basis; my fruit and veg intake has more than doubled. But for those who have become vegan for the animal rights side of things, every meal is guilt-free and eating almost becomes an exercise in mindfulness, leaving you with positive feelings. Who wouldn’t want their friends and family to feel this too? Most new vegans will join an online group or two; there are plenty to choose from, and Veganuary even has its own Facebook page. The sense of belonging can be invigorating, but it can also blind you to the fact that most of the people around you know very little about the vegan lifestyle, and at worst, have no or little interest. But there is a more serious aspect to vegans shouting about their lifestyle for what feels like 24 hours a day. Although it has become trendy to “eat clean”, and a plant-based diet is often viewed as clean, veganism’s roots are deeply embedded in the world of animal rights activism. Many people are unaware of the cruelty with which their meat, cheese and leather items are produced, whereas others have had fleeting glimpses and choose to ignore it. I was brought up vegetarian for most of my life, but it took 15 years after my mother went dairy-free and gave me explicit explanations of why she had done so before I opened my eyes to the brutality of the dairy and egg industries. I knew what happened on dairy farms: that female cows spend their lives being artificially inseminated, only to have their calves taken from them at birth; that those calves are usually slaughtered for veal while their mothers spend their lives attached to machines draining the milk that was intended for their lost babies. But still I chose to ignore it. Once you open your eyes and have that lightbulb moment, it’s hard to watch the rest of the world tucking into their cheese plates and burgers without feeling you should say something. I often think that if I just told that friend how their omelette ended up on their plate, or that stranger in the fur coat how the mink or coyote that had worn it before had suffered, perhaps they’d reconsider. Maybe I could get them to see the world like I now see it, and, just maybe, veganism could become the norm, rather than the radical. When I talk about veganism to my friends and family, it’s usually in the context of a new project I’m working on, or a great new product I want to share. I’m not one for interfering in people’s choices, although I always encourage people to ask me questions and find out more about why I’m vegan (and how great it is). But in a vegan’s ideal world, slaughter and unnecessary pain would no longer exist – and when you know there is a more compassionate alternative, it’s hard not to mention it once or twice. • Rebecca Jones is a GP in London and blogs as the Vegan Doctor.

It occurred just six months after a similar mix-up at Yarmouth prompted the regulator to promise to act immediately “to prevent this from happening again”. The latest case of mistaken identity, which occurred on 14 January but did not emerge until Thursday afternoon, involved two five‑year‑old geldings trained by Ivan Furtado: Scribner Creek, a bay, and African Trader, described as “bay or brown”. Scribner Creek was declared to run in a one-mile handicap but ran in a seven-furlong event and finished third, earning punters who believed they were backing African Trader an each-way payout at 12-1. African Trader then ran in the mile handicap in place of Scribner Creek and finished in a dead-heat for seventh place. All horses racing on British tracks are micro-chipped for identification purposes and the mix-up occurred despite a new, more stringent regime for scanning horses introduced after a similar incident at Yarmouth in July. Previously, horses were scanned only on arrival at the racecourse but the new rule requires a second scan as a horse leaves the racecourse stable to go out to the saddling boxes, about 20 minutes before the off-time for its race. The mistake was also picked up only by chance, since one of the horses involved was randomly selected for drug-testing after its race. Even then, a routine scan of the horse’s microchip failed to detect the error, which emerged via an internal audit process to check and reconcile raceday sampling data. Had the horse not been chosen for sampling, the switch would have gone undetected. There were no suspicious betting patterns in either race and the BHA is satisfied the horses’ identities had been accidentally confused before their arrival at the racecourse. Charlie McBride was fined £1,500 after the Yarmouth incident, when his three-year-old Millie’s Kiss ran in a juvenile race as Mandarin Princess and “won” at 50-1. Furtado, who has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the correct horse runs in a race, will face a disciplinary hearing but the BHA conceded on Thursday that as the sport’s regulator it has “overall responsibility for the running of a raceday”, and that it needed to “take measures to improve the robustness of the identification processes and reduce the risk of human error”. As a result the BHA will now ensure the microchip scanners, which operate via a smartphone app, are automatically cross-checked with the racecard to ensure a horse leaving for the saddling boxes before a race has been declared to run in it. The BHA said in a statement: “This is the second time in six months there has been an incident in which an incorrect horse has competed in a race. This is simply unacceptable. It affects the betting public, bookmakers and other participants and risks undermining confidence in the integrity of the sport. “What is clearly of greatest concern is the question of why this happened, how it was allowed to happen and what can be done to ensure it does not happen again. It is vital the public’s trust in racing as a fair, well-regulated sport, which is run with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity, is not impacted by similar incidents.” Both horses will be disqualified from their races, with prize money redistributed where appropriate. In accordance with normal betting practice the “weigh-in” result will determine payouts and each-way backers of the 20-1 chance Pudding Chare, who will be promoted to third in the race contested by Scribner Creek, will not be paid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/26/far-right-racism-electoral-successes-europe-us-bigotry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"How the far right has perfected the art of deniable racism | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/far-right-racism-electoral-successes-europe-us-bigotry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/far-right-racism-electoral-successes-europe-us-bigotry","fields":{"headline":"How the far right has perfected the art of deniable racism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In July 2016 the bigoted troll Milo Yiannopoulos, a British darling of the American far right, was banned from Twitter after encouraging a torrent of racist abuse at Leslie Jones, a black actor who starred in the remake of Ghostbusters. In one example he branded her “barely literate”. A few months later it emerged that Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, had given Yiannopoulos, 33, who calls feminism “cancer” and Donald Trump “Daddy”, a $255,000 book deal. “I met with top execs … earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions,” he said. “I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building – but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money.” A few months after that, he suggested that sex between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women could “happen perfectly consensually”. This was apparently one “outrageous opinion” too far. Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled the book. Yiannopoulos sued. In the subsequent court submissions we see the critical notes of his editor, Mitchell Ivers. Yiannopoulos argues: “Given my penchant for black denizens of the dark continent I can’t be accused of being racist … I’m the left’s worst nightmare.” Ivers replies: “Having sex with black people does not prove someone is [not] racist.” Elsewhere the editor demands: “Delete irrelevant and superfluous ethnic joke.” In a section on feminism, Ivers says: “Don’t start chapter with accusation that feminists = fat.” Tellingly, he adds: “It destroys any seriousness of purpose.” When the notes were made public, some liberals hailed them as evidence of Yiannopoulos’s shallow thinking. But they actually lay bare a far more sinister process. Simon &amp; Schuster knew who he was when it signed him. Ivers’ job was to get him into shape, to coach him in how to make his racism and misogyny palatable. What we see in those notes is the strenuous, and ultimately doomed, effort to lend Yiannopoulos’s bigotry gravity; to extract from the dung heap of his hateful worldview “the seriousness of [his] purpose”; to locate the boundaries of acceptable prejudice so that those borders can be more effectively breached. He was not just an editor but an enabler. This is the electoral challenge of the extreme right in the west: to find a plausible balance between how racist it actually is, in its policies, and how racist it can appear to be in its pronouncements. Its raison d’etre is to promote and project a mythical sense of national and racial purity; its conundrum is how to simultaneously attract racists and xenophobes to that project while denouncing racism and xenophobia. In short, to deny any connection between its agenda and the intended effect. This contradiction has been most glaringly apparent in the travails of the UK Independence party. Its most recent crisis was triggered by the disclosure of racist texts by Jo Marney, the girlfriend of the party leader, Henry Bolton. Among other things, when asked, “What’s wrong with black people?” Marney responded “ugly”, and when subsequently accused of being racist she remarked “lol so what”. Particularly upset by Prince Harry’s black fiancee, Meghan Markle, she wrote: “This is Britain not Africa,” and that Markle would “taint the royal seed”, and she worried that black people were “pushing their way to the top slowly, slowly. Next will be a Muslim PM … And a black king.” Bolton split up with Marney (for now) and suspended her from the party. Nonetheless, senior members of Ukip, including Bolton’s deputy, have now resigned en masse, calling for him to step down. It’s not difficult to see where Marney got these views from. Ukip ran its election campaign on banning the burqa and enforcing genital checks on girls from groups (by which it means Muslim) at risk of suffering female genital mutilation. Its former leader Nigel Farage once said: “Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door.” One of its MEPs said Britain should stop sending aid to “bongo bongo land”. During the Brexit referendum, Leave.EU, the organisation with which Ukip associated, targeted its adverts on Facebook towards, among others, members of the far-right British National party and Britain First. So Marney is no outlier. With the Brexit referendum out of the way it’s really just the racism, Islamophobia and xenophobia keeping the party together at 3% in the polls. It’s a wonder they haven’t made Bolton leader for life and put Marney on the frontbench. This is not a problem confined to Ukip or Britain. Within hours of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) riding a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment into the German Bundestag last year, one of its leading members had left the parliamentary group and stormed out of its victory news conference. Frauke Petry, who considers herself a “moderate”, had previously failed to have a senior official expelled for denying Adolf Hitler was “absolutely evil” and branding Berlin’s Holocaust memorial a “monument of shame”. In France, the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, expelled her own father from the party after he repeated his view that gas chambers were a mere “detail of history” and called on France to unite with Russia to save the “white world”. Almost every day the US president says something egregious about one minority or another only to have the Trump whisperers in the Republican party and Fox News explain why, whatever else it was, it definitely wasn’t racist. There is method to this madness. Petry said that the AfD, under hardliners, lacked a credible plan to govern; Marine Le Pen called her father’s comments political suicide. In other words, they wanted to win. And while racism and xenophobia were central to their meaning, they needed them to be coded in their message. To achieve this they must relegate racism from an issue of power and discrimination to a matter of politeness and decorum. Meanwhile, hate crimes against Muslims and refugees are on the rise in Germany; and against African Americans, Jews and Muslims in the US. Hate crimes in the UK leapt 29% last year. These parties often look ridiculous. Bolton is Ukip’s sixth leader in 15 months (two of those have been Farage). Trump is a buffoon. This week an AfD executive member in the state of Brandenburg converted to Islam. The party’s website states: “Islam does not belong in Germany.” The trouble is they are also incredibly effective. They won the Brexit referendum; Trump is in the Oval Office; the Front National made the presidential runoffs again; the AfD became the third largest party in Germany. “We are what we pretend to be,” said the late novelist Kurt Vonnegut. “So we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” For too long we have pretended we are tolerant societies in which racism is not a system of oppression but the marginal obsession of the uncouth. In reality we have simply become more sophisticated about our prejudices. We have plenty of racism, but apparently very few racists. • Gary Younge writes a weekly column for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/25/sadiq-khan-challenges-release-of-john-worboys","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T18:03:04Z","webTitle":"Sadiq Khan challenges release of rapist John Worboys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/25/sadiq-khan-challenges-release-of-john-worboys","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/25/sadiq-khan-challenges-release-of-john-worboys","fields":{"headline":"Sadiq Khan challenges release of rapist John Worboys","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is launching legal action to challenge the Parole Board over its decision to release the black-cab rapist John Worboys. The decision to intervene in the high-profile case comes days after two victims of the serial sex attacker started a crowdfunding appeal for a similar legal challenge against his release from prison. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, Khan said: “I have today lodged with the court an application for judicial review of the Parole Board’s decision to release the convicted rapist John Worboys. It was an astonishing and deeply concerning decision that simply cannot go unchallenged. For victims, and all Londoners, it must be properly scrutinised in the courts. The chair of the Parole Board has welcomed this scrutiny. “I will always put the safety of Londoners, and the needs of victims, first – which is why I instructed leading counsel to begin this process last week. Londoners need to know that those in authority are doing everything they can to keep them safe and that means keeping dangerous individuals off our streets.” The recently appointed justice secretary, David Gauke, announced 10 days ago that the Ministry of Justice would launch a similar judicial review of the decision, but dropped it a week later. The Metropolitan police has confirmed that a fresh complaint of sexual assault against Worboys dating from 2009 had been received in the past few weeks and is being investigated. Worboys, 60, was moved to Belmarsh prison in London last weekend, and his release is expected in the next few weeks. Harriet Wistrich, who represents two of Worboys’ victims, said she had also lodged an application for a judicial review of the Parole Board decision at the high court in London. The application includes a request for a stay of the release of Worboys pending the outcome of the proceedings. Wistrich, a solicitor at the law firm Birnberg Peirce, revealed that a dossier of unreported cases and cases reported but not prosecuted would be presented to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in an attempt to bring fresh charges. Her law firm’s claim is based on the grounds that rule 25 of the Parole Board prohibits the publication of any reasons for its decisions and is unlawful because it undermines the fundamental principle of open justice. Wistrich said the second ground was that the decision to release Worboys after 10 years was irrational because of his long history of cold, calculated attacks on a large number of women, his failure to acknowledge his guilt until very recently – if at all – and the fact he has remained in a high-security prison without being tested in open conditions. She said the Parole Board decided it was unsafe to transfer him as recently as two years ago. Wistrich said she had been contacted by a number of other victims. Her dossier includes “two previously unreported cases from 2002 and 2003 and two cases that were investigated by the police that would pass the evidential threshold but have not been prosecuted”. The supreme court is still due to rule on civil claims for damages against the Metropolitan police over failures in the investigation brought by the two victims represented by Wistrich Both women were assured that Worboys would not be released for a very long time. Neither women were contacted about the parole process and the first they learned of the decision to release him was on 4 January when it was reported in the media. Prof Nick Hardwick, who chairs the Parole Board, has acknowledged that there is “a lack of transparency” in the organisation’s processes and is proposing changes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/25/heathrow-airport-nightmare-mums-struggle-breastfeed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T16:52:51Z","webTitle":"My airport nightmare shows exactly why mums struggle to breastfeed | Sophie McBain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/heathrow-airport-nightmare-mums-struggle-breastfeed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/25/heathrow-airport-nightmare-mums-struggle-breastfeed","fields":{"headline":"My airport nightmare shows exactly why mums struggle to breastfeed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Last weekend I travelled without my baby for the first time, and I needed to express milk ahead of my seven-hour flight to New York. A member of Heathrow staff told me I should use the baby changing room. I felt bad that I would be occupying the room for at least 20 minutes, but I also felt bad because I thought my breasts might otherwise explode, midway over the Atlantic. It seems someone knocked (I didn’t hear them) and when they got fed up with waiting they sought help. I heard keys jangling, and then a male attendant unlocked the door from the outside. While my breasts were still exposed and stuck inside a plastic pump, he began lecturing me about how I should pump inside the terminal building or leave the room unlocked. In my formal complaint to Heathrow, I explained that this is not dissimilar to someone bursting in on you while you are on the toilet and then, with your pants still round your ankles, accusing you of hogging the bathroom. But I also said the problem wasn’t really the attendant’s reaction, it’s the system. No one has given any thought to breastfeeding women at the airport: we have no dedicated place to pump or nurse in private and the staff have no training in how to handle these issues with sensitivity. In case you haven’t yet become acquainted with the ungainly contraption that is an electric breast pump, I’ll fill you in. It consists of a motor attached with tubing to two bottles topped with plastic cones that are designed to fit over your nipples and create a vacuum. With every electric suck, your nipples are gruesomely distorted and milk is forced out and into a set of bottles. The effect is so undignified and so evocative of industrial dairy farming that I prefer my husband not to see me use it – and it’s definitely not a piece of tech I’d like to whip out in the main terminal building, or in the airport Pret a Manger. Every day, about 1,300 planes land and take off from Heathrow, which means there must be hundreds of breastfeeding women passing through. Not all of them will feel able to nurse or pump in public. If, as a result, they decide not to ahead of a long flight, they will not only feel painfully engorged, but they put themselves at risk of a potentially serious condition called mastitis. Surely it’s not too much to expect a couple of small cubicles, with a chair and a plug socket, to be provided? But this isn’t just about Heathrow. The UK has the lowest breastfeeding rate in the world. According to one study conducted in 2014, boosting breastfeeding rates in this country could save the NHS up to £40m a year by reducing the incidence of certain childhood diseases and breast cancer. In the UK, 80% of women who stop breastfeeding within the first six weeks do so before they want to, which suggests a serious lack of medical and institutional support. Creating places for us to breastfeed would be a step in the right direction. A survey by Public Health England found that a third of women feel uncomfortable or embarrassed to nurse outside the home. We tend to place the onus on women to fix this, by baring our breasts in public and loudly asserting our rights should anyone tell us to cover up. Why not instead give women the option to nurse or pump in private, without having to sit on a filthy toilet seat or hog a precious baby changing room to do it? The US offers an interesting example, in this respect. Its breastfeeding rates are higher than the UK’s – even though it is one of only a few countries in the world that has no statutory maternity leave and many women are forced to return to work within weeks of giving birth. One positive side-effect of this terrible policy is that there’s far greater recognition of the needs of women who want to continue breastfeeding while also working full-time or travelling. Employers with 50 or more employees are required by law to provide break times and dedicated private spaces for female employees to express milk. In the UK they have no such obligation. Nursing pods are also becoming more common at American airports. The policymakers tutting over why only one in 200 British women breastfeed their babies for over a year do not seem to have noticed that they have left women with a difficult choice: stay tied to your baby 24/7, pump your milk while sitting on the loo – or move on to formula. We can’t rely on goodwill alone to change things. Heathrow did not formally apologise until my story made news on both sides of the Atlantic. The airport has now said that it will look at whether it’s possible to create space for nursing women. That’s not exactly a commitment to change, but it’s a start – and a welcome acknowledgement that we deserve better. • Sophie McBain is a contributing writer for New Statesman and is based in New York.

On Tuesday she endured another display of Boris the Authentic. He played the NHS as part of playing Brexit, screwing the system and jumping off the cliff. Don’t say this sort of thing doesn’t work. Donald is in the White House and Boris is in the Foreign Office. It’s called the new politics. While his prime minister limps the Davos walk, Johnson is nursing the wounds from his latest leadership play. He thought he could court favour with voters, not from a public platform but in the inner sanctuary of the cabinet room. He was going to tell the chancellor to give the health secretary more money. To make sure the message got through, he did the Johnson equivalent of a Trump tweet. He told the press what he was going to say. Cabinet discussions are sometimes leaked after the fact. It is unprecedented for them to leak beforehand. May did not even let Johnson repeat what they had all read, but lined up eight fellow ministers, led by the home secretary, to give him a ritual thrashing. Trump’s Washington leadership is expressed as a Twitter stream of consciousness. They are like edicts from Stalin or a Roman emperor; no one knows each day what he will say. It is rule by anarchy and fear. Trump is accountable only to an electorate. British politics is less direct and more nuanced. Last year May won the second biggest popular vote in history. But what matters is the arithmetic of parliament, a leader’s relations with colleagues, the chemistry of cabinet, the loyalty of friends. To betray that loyalty, as Johnson did on Tuesday, is normally a capital offence. Thatcher would have chucked him out on his ear. Johnson is no fool. He knows the NHS is popular. Ever since it was nationalised 60 years ago, it has been a political minefield for Conservatives. Demand is unlimited, so supply must be rationed by queuing or charging. Britain has opted for queuing, which means demoralising headlines each winter, and a gift to oppositions. The foreign secretary’s sympathisers argue that he is playing for high stakes. As he and others showed during the referendum, it is a game without rules. He uses the Daily Telegraph to destabilise his boss, because he knows she is weak and others are manoeuvring to succeed her. He shoots off his mouth on Libyan casualties and Iranian prisoners because he does not care. He flagrantly undermines – he would say strengthens – May’s Brexit position, not least when he knows she is about to give an important foreign speech. In the Tory leadership stakes, Johnson’s friend and partner in crime, Michael Gove, is playing the shrewd game, concentrating on being popular in his job of environment secretary. Johnson is all over the shop. He is playing the all-purpose outsider: Joe Chamberlain, Enoch Powell, Michael Heseltine. He is appealing to the country over the heads of colleagues and party. He is pretending they need him more than he needs them. Churchill did that and it worked, but it took a war. At some point, Johnson must presumably imitate Heseltine, pick up his papers and stalk out of Downing Street. But Heseltine spent four years in the wilderness, and still did not become leader. It would require Johnson to have the courage to resign, or May to have the courage to sack him. At present, neither seems up to it. The Conservative party is now defaulting to loyalty. No one dared support him at Tuesday’s cabinet. They did not say he was wrong about the NHS. They said, in effect, Tories do not behave as you are behaving. They do not discard discipline or dump on their own when there is a war on. All we know of the new politics is that it is unpredictable: in France, in Germany, in Italy, in America, not just Britain. Johnson’s career has been a triumph of personality and vanity spending over periodic disaster. In that, at least, he is like Trump. If he plays a cheap card, his supporters cheer. If he makes mistakes, they sympathise. To err is human and shows you are no automaton. Johnson can crack a joke. He can look stupid. To decry these is to commit the elitist fallacy. But as Jeremy Corbyn has cleverly shown, British politics has always been cabalistic. It is about Westminster, where loyalty to tribe runs deep. To overcome this, Johnson must move mountains. He may have won the NHS vote, but he has alienated his colleagues and they matter. He has far, far to go. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/25/yahya-jammeh-former-leader-gambia-extradition-adama-barrow","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T18:00:37Z","webTitle":"Yahya Jammeh, former leader of the Gambia, could face extradition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/yahya-jammeh-former-leader-gambia-extradition-adama-barrow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/25/yahya-jammeh-former-leader-gambia-extradition-adama-barrow","fields":{"headline":"Yahya Jammeh, former leader of the Gambia, could face extradition","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The president of the Gambia has said he wants to extradite and prosecute his predecessor Yahya Jammeh, who is living in exile in Equatorial Guinea, if a national inquiry looking at human rights abuses recommends it. Adama Barrow, whose election in December 2016 prompted a national outpouring of joy and then a political crisis, said he would like to broach Jammeh’s extradition with the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, and they had already discussed the autocratic former leader’s future. “We are more than willing to engage the international community, and to engage the president of Equatorial Guinea, because as a country we believe in justice and rule of law,” Barrow told the Guardian. “I think the international community has a great role to play in this.” He said he had met Obiang recently in the US. “We had a good discussion as far as bilateral relations are concerned, and we will continue to engage him.” After the 2016 election, Jammeh initially congratulated Barrow on his win, calling it a “clear victory”, but then rejected the result. After a month-long standoff, Jammeh finally agreed to leave, taking his fleet of luxury cars with him to Equatorial Guinea. Barrow was responding to questions about a statement Obiang made in which he did not rule out extraditing Jammeh. “If there is a judgment against him, I would like to see the indictment, and I’ll consider it with my lawyers,” Obiang told Radio France Internationale, though he added: “To prosecute a person who has chosen to leave power might be a bad idea politically.” Barrow said there was still some time before extradition could be sought. “Before all these things, we have to build a very strong case [against Jammeh],” he said. “That is why we are setting up the truth, reconciliation and reparations commission.” Last month a law was passed to set up such a commission to examine state crimes during Jammeh’s 22-year tenure. Sabrina Mahtani, of Amnesty, said it and other human rights groups had documented alleged systematic torture, enforced disappearances and other rights abuses under the Jammeh regime. “It is critical that Jammeh and others are investigated and undergo fair trials,” said Mahtani. “Gambians need accountability to be able to move on from a past centred on impunity. However, reform of security services and the repressive legal regime is just as fundamental.” Reed Brody, of Human Rights Watch, said: “Jammeh is accused of killing journalists, torturing opponents, shooting at demonstrators, a massacre of migrants from Ghana, and forcing 9,000 Gambians into his phoney and cruel HIV ‘treatment’ programme.” A senior member of the ruling coalition said Jammeh would be prosecuted, though this was later denied by other grandees. “He will be prosecuted,” Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, a senior politician, told the Guardian. “We are going to have a national commission for asset recovery..” Barrow has established a commission of inquiry into Jammeh’s assets. Gambian ministers alleged last year that Jammeh had siphoned off more than $50m meant for social security, the ports and telecoms, and left the country with a debt of $1bn. Jammeh used to tell people that Allah was his World Bank, Barrow said, but even so, he was taken aback by the sums of money involved. “I never thought it was [so] serious: a sitting president running more than 80 bank accounts,” he said. “Now, Allah’s World Bank has been revealed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/25/the-catcher-was-a-spy-review-paul-rudd-sundance-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T15:24:21Z","webTitle":"The Catcher Was a Spy review – Paul Rudd goes from baseball to Bond in engaging thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/25/the-catcher-was-a-spy-review-paul-rudd-sundance-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/25/the-catcher-was-a-spy-review-paul-rudd-sundance-2018","fields":{"headline":"The Catcher Was a Spy review – Paul Rudd goes from baseball to Bond in engaging thriller","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Paul Rudd is fantastic as the enigmatic Moe Berg, a real life footnote from history in the serviceable thriller The Catcher Was A Spy. This is the type of film that causes you to run to Wikipedia the moment it ends to learn just how much of it is true. As is always the case, this is a bad idea. Nevertheless, this movie, which is all plot and very little drama, remains engaging because the story is so neat. But considering this adaptation of Nicholas Dawidoff’s bestselling book took almost 14 years to get made, and with who knows how many different directors, it is a reminder that every weird true tale doesn’t always lend itself to a film. When we first meet Berg he’s a catcher for the Boston Red Sox in the late 1930s. He’s insightful about the game, but a mediocre player. The coach wants him to retire and begin a coaching career himself, but Berg’s still having fun. He remains mysterious to his other players, seen reading newspapers in foreign languages and rarely socializing. He’s nicknamed the Professor and appears on quiz shows, but he takes his privacy seriously, to the point of attacking a rookie who follows him home. (The rookie suspects he is gay, and wants to catch him.) Berg lives with his girlfriend, whom he keeps at arm’s length, and we get a first glimpse at his desire to help his county in unorthodox ways during a goodwill baseball tour of Japan. Using a small film camera, he climbs to the roof of a hospital to shoot images of a nearby airfield. The two nations are not at war yet, he just has a hunch. After Pearl Harbor he brings this footage to the OSS and ends up getting a job. The Catcher Was A Spy is framed by Berg’s most notable assignment, part of the Alsos Mission to assess the Nazis’ progress in developing an atomic bomb. Berg is to sniff out their lead scientist and, if he deems it necessary, assassinate him. As luck would have it, that scientist was Werner Heisenberg, he of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In a wonderful alignment of an individual and their most famous achievement, it remains impossible to know what Heisenberg (played in this film by Mark Strong) was really up to. The central thrust is getting Berg to Heisenberg, and that involves a little bit of action in Italy to track down Heisenberg’s contacts as the bullets are still flying. Here, director Ben Lewin stages some of the blandest and most awkward action scenes you’ve seen in quite a while. It’s amusing that Paul Giamatti (playing the Dutch-Jewish physicist Samuel Goldsmit, who escaped to the United States and aided in Alsos) is clutching his helmet and whimpering, but there’s an awful lot of people just standing around waiting to get shot. Ben Lewin’s best work is the John Hawkes/Helen Hunt sex surrogate drama The Sessions, but his most recent work is Please Stand By, starring Dakota Fanning as an autistic Star Trek fan writing her own screenplay; a candidate for worst film of the year. He shoots in a perfunctory fashion – other than making sure the evening streets look wet, there isn’t much visual splendor. But for the plot alone the movie does hold one’s attention. What’s more, the specificity of this odd character is, I’m sure of it, one that will linger with me for a long while. All praise goes to Rudd, whose innate agreeableness immediately gets you on “his side,” even as his quirky behavior goes unexplained. He’d make his life so much easier if he’d just open up a bit, but there’s a block he’s suffering from, an outsider’s uncomfortableness that’s rooted in being Jewish yet attending universities like Princeton and getting involved in professional sports. When his OSS boss (Jeff Daniels) wants to wish him luck on a dangerous mission, he realizes he doesn’t know anything about the guy. It is to Rudd’s great credit that, while knowing only a smidge more than the other characters, we feel as if we understand him, and certainly root for him. The film isn’t a home run, but with Rudd in the lead in something so out of the ordinary for him, it’s fair to call a ground rule double."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/25/latin-lessons-dying-out-in-state-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T17:59:45Z","webTitle":"Latin lessons dying out in state schools | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/25/latin-lessons-dying-out-in-state-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/25/latin-lessons-dying-out-in-state-schools","fields":{"headline":"Latin lessons dying out in state schools","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the head of classics at High Storrs school, the last remaining state comprehensive in Sheffield to offer Latin (and classical civilisation) on its curriculum, it was with great sadness but little surprise that I read of Richmond school’s decision to cease teaching Latin from next September (Yorkshire school to stop teaching Latin after 600 years, 22 January). Funding for state schools is now at such a low level that we are seeing a wholesale narrowing of the curriculum, exacerbated by the prescriptive nature of the English baccalaureate “qualification” (discussed so eloquently by Rufus Norris in his 17 January article “Why are we squeezing creativity out of our schools?”), which excludes classical civilisation GCSE from its suite of subjects. While we do not have quite such an illustrious history as our fellow Yorkshire school, classical subjects have flourished here for many years, but we too are struggling and have recently had to launch a campaign to raise funds with which to subsidise smaller teaching groups until such time as our school can once again afford to teach them. We are now, it seems, a country in danger of losing touch with the hugely influential cultures and languages of the classical world in all but London and the south-east.

But there will be no extravagant buying sprees for the boy from Beverley (who has earned enough for a second home in the Bahamas) after reaching the first, and surely not last, grand slam semi-final of his career. Of his A$880,000 (£497,000) prize money, the biggest purse of his career, he said: “It’s not like I’m going to go and spend. You continue doing what you’re doing, like invest in your career and stuff. It’s obviously a nice chunk of money, but there’s nothing I need. I have stuff in place, so I’m very happy with what I have around me.” His coach, Fredrik Rosengren, said he doubted Edmund would be rushing out to buy a Ferrari – to which the player replied, drily: “I have a Jaguar deal, so I can’t …” As for the Davis Cup tie against Spain in Marbella next weekend, he said: “I’ll do everything I can to play, because I want to play. I want to be there with the team. But there is no point going on court if I’m not ready, because you hinder the team; you basically give up a rubber if you’re not ready. I don’t know percentage-wise what the chances are, but if I’m not ready I’ll ask to give the opportunity to other players that are there to play.” Looking back on the best fortnight of his career, he said: “I’m very happy with the way I’ve gone about things: played a lot of tough matches, won some tough matches, beat good players. This type of tournament just gives you the bug to want more.” And despite the obvious discomfort of playing through a groin strain in the latter stages, Edmund remains resolutely up for that aspect of his sport. “It’s unfortunate. It happens. It’s irrelevant,” he said. “Tennis players are always dealing with stuff. That’s just the nature of the sport, any sport.” Cilic described it as a match of “slightly different intensity” to his drawn-out win against Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals – “not as many rallies and not as much rhythm”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/25/uefa-charge-anderlecht-ticket-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T19:36:00Z","webTitle":"Anderlecht’s Uefa charge offers hope for fleeced Liverpool and United fans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/25/uefa-charge-anderlecht-ticket-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/25/uefa-charge-anderlecht-ticket-prices","fields":{"headline":"Anderlecht’s Uefa charge offers hope for fleeced Liverpool and United fans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shortly after 6pm CET on Tuesday Anderlecht were charged with infringing Article 19 (3) of Uefa’s safety and security regulations. Not the sexiest intro, admittedly, but the charge against the Belgian champions offers hope for fans being fleeced at European away games year after year. Anger, however, remains the prevailing mood over a ticketing system open to abuse. Uefa opened proceedings against Anderlecht after the club charged Bayern Munich supporters €100 to attend a Champions League group game in November. Many Bayern fans boycotted despite tickets eventually being reduced to €70 thanks to subsidies from their own club. As at Arsenal two years earlier, when Bayern’s away support was charged €100 to watch a group game, it was time to make a stand. Their outrage at a club cashing in on a rival’s mass following, and at Uefa appearing to ignore their concerns, was well-founded. European football’s governing body took disciplinary action only against Bayern initially, fining the club €20,000 after their supporters tossed fake money on to the pitch (throwing of objects, according to the charge) and displayed an “illicit banner” – again, according to Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body – that read: “Is your gr€€d now finally satisfi€d?” A legitimate question with a costly answer. The announcement this week that Uefa will investigate the source of the problem at Anderlecht is a welcome step, albeit one that follows intense pressure and a continuing campaign against European ticket prices by the Bayern supporters’ group Club Nr 12. It was Club Nr 12 that first accused Anderlecht of breaching Article 19 (3), which states: “Unless the associations or clubs concerned agree otherwise, the price of tickets for supporters of the visiting team must not exceed the price paid for tickets of a comparable category that are sold to supporters of the home team.” Supporters of the Belgian club had, Club Nr 12 pointed out, been able to buy group stage tickets only as a package. The total cost to Anderlecht fans for home games against Bayern, Celtic and Paris Saint-Germain was €141. Uefa’s decision to charge Anderlecht is timely. The rule to prevent clubs over-charging away fans may be well-intentioned but its loopholes are being exposed with increasing regularity. Complaints are rising with prices. Liverpool this week confirmed they had complained to Uefa and Porto over the Portuguese club charging away fans three times as much as their members to watch next month’s Champions League tie. Manchester United fans are having to pay €101 to attend their last-16 first leg at Sevilla. That is €40 more than Liverpool fans paid there in the group stage, so United have charged Sevilla fans an extra £35 at Old Trafford and are using the money to subsidise away tickets in Andalucía. Sevilla are now subsidising their fans for the second leg. They have reported United to Uefa for the price increase and for not making 5% of Old Trafford available for away fans. It is an unedifying tit-for-tat that fails to address the issue and exposes Uefa’s weaknesses in combating inflated prices. Sevilla and Porto may be on suspect ground morally but have not breached Uefa rules. The latter are charging Liverpool fans €75 for tickets to a game Porto club members will attend for €25. Porto’s loophole is that general admission tickets for home supporters are €75. “It is not apparent that there will be any home general admission tickets sold at €75 due to the anticipated demand by FC Porto members,” read a Liverpool statement on Tuesday. “Liverpool FC has therefore raised this significant discrepancy at the highest level with Uefa and FC Porto, who have confirmed that this pricing structure and policy is in line with previous rounds in the competition.” Leicester fans paid £34.50 at Estádio do Dragão in December 2016. Uefa said: “The matter of ticket pricing for away clubs is a topic that has been raised to Uefa on several occasions. Since the pricing strategy regarding ticketing is under the responsibility of the home club, our focus is on encouraging dialogue between the clubs to resolve any disputes or avoid any disagreements relating to such matters. Breaches of regulations can result in disciplinary proceedings being opened.” The stand-off between United and Sevilla does nothing for Uefa’s attempts at conciliation. Giving free rein to home clubs on ticket prices has fuelled the problem in many cases. Premier League clubs differ in their approach to this season’s Champions League. Liverpool have one price structure for the competition – fans paid £59 to watch the group game against Maribor from the main stand and would pay the same for a semi-final against Real Madrid – whereas Chelsea charge £35 for the group stage before raising prices for the knockout rounds. It will cost a non-member £75 to watch the last-16 first leg against Barcelona from the upper West Stand, if any tickets remain for non-members. One proposal by Club Nr 12 is for clubs to charge away fans the lowest-priced ticket available to home supporters. That way the intent of Article 19 (3) is protected and loopholes closed. That arrangement is in place in the Bundesliga. Club Nr 12 has also called for reciprocal ticket pricing, whereby away fans from countries with lower incomes pay no more than they would for home matches. Bayern’s support would benefit from paying the same price for the away leg. Bayern fans can claim a victory should Uefa sanction Anderlecht next Friday but their argument that the Respect campaign should also apply to fan culture unfortunately has a long way to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/01/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-defence-tottenham-hotspur","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T00:10:29Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho laments Manchester United’s ‘ridiculous’ errors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/01/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-defence-tottenham-hotspur","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/01/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-defence-tottenham-hotspur","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho laments Manchester United’s ‘ridiculous’ errors","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho lamented the “ridiculous” defensive errors that condemned his Manchester United team to a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham. The manager watched in horror as his players made what he totted up as four separate lapses in the opening 11 seconds to concede from the kick-off to Christian Eriksen. The second goal was a personal horror show for Phil Jones, as he got his feet into a tangle and hammered Kieran Trippier’s low cross into his own net. Tottenham pressed ferociously throughout the game and they could reflect on one of the finest performances under Mauricio Pochettino. For Mourinho and Alexis Sánchez, who made his first Premier League appearance for United, it was an ordeal. “I don’t think it’s very normal to concede a goal [at the start] like we did,” Mourinho said. “After the kick-off, it’s ridiculous. It is especially ridiculous because the players – they watch it before, we analyse opponents and work on opponents’ dynamics and routines. “We don’t press the ball. One mistake. We don’t win the ball in the air. Second mistake. We don’t win the second ball on the ground. Third mistake. We don’t cover inside, the full-back inside, when Eriksen comes. Four mistakes. Four mistakes and you are losing 1-0 against a good team. The second goal, I don’t say ridiculous, I just say unlucky.” Mourinho introduced Marouane Fellaini in the 63rd minute only to withdraw him seven minutes later. He said the midfielder had suffered a lateral knee ligament injury for the third time. On Sánchez, who struggled in the face of some tough Tottenham challenges, Mourinho added: “He worked hard but the game was not for him. In the second half, I tried to give him a position where he could be more close to Romelu Lukaku but then he felt the need to drop too much to try to organise.” Pochettino said: “We prepared to play in the opposite half from the first whistle. We tried to be aggressive, to put pressure on them, to dominate. I’m happy we scored so early. The performance was fantastic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/01/coalition-cracks-down-on-sale-of-prime-agricultural-farmland-to-overseas-buyers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T05:04:09Z","webTitle":"Coalition cracks down on sale of prime agricultural farmland to overseas buyers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/01/coalition-cracks-down-on-sale-of-prime-agricultural-farmland-to-overseas-buyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/01/coalition-cracks-down-on-sale-of-prime-agricultural-farmland-to-overseas-buyers","fields":{"headline":"Coalition cracks down on sale of prime agricultural farmland to overseas buyers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Turnbull government has announced a further crackdown on foreign buyers of prime agricultural farmland, saying Australians must be given the chance to buy the land first and that foreign investors can only buy the land for residential development if they begin developing within five years. The government has also formalised restrictions on foreign investment in Australia’s energy infrastructure, such as electricity wires, so foreigners know their bids may be officially declined on “national interest” grounds. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, made the announcement on Thursday amid growing concerns over interference in the Australian political system by Beijing and numerous controversies surrounding Chinese investment in Australia’s energy infrastructure and farmland. From now on, sellers of Australian agricultural land must officially advertise and market the holdings to Australians first. Foreign investors will have to demonstrate the agricultural land they intend to buy has been part of a public sales process, and marketed widely to potential domestic bidders for a minimum of 30 days, and that Australian bidders have had an opportunity to take part in the sale process. All acquisitions of agricultural land by foreign investors for residential development will also now require development to begin within a five-year period to prevent land banking (a condition already applying to acquisitions of vacant land). “We welcome foreign investment in Australian agricultural land where it is not contrary to the national interest,” Morrison said on Thursday. “Our foreign investment rules facilitate investment while making sure Australia’s national interest is protected. This includes ensuring adequate opportunity for Australians to invest in Australian land.” He said the new rules build on previous initiatives, such as the agricultural land register and reducing the screening threshold for foreign purchases of agricultural land from $252m to $15m. Morrison said sales of critical energy infrastructure were already scrutinised by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) but future transactions would be officially scrutinised on a case-by-case basis by taking into account the cumulative level of ownership within a sector, the need for diversity of ownership and the asset’s critical importance. It means foreigners now know their bids for Australia’s critical energy infrastructure may be officially declined on national security or national interest grounds. “Where required, ownership restrictions will be flagged to the market as early as possible in the sale process,” Morrison said. “The government is committed to an open foreign investment regime that strikes the right balance in managing national security risks, while promoting job opportunities and enabling economic growth. “With electricity distribution assets, the stakes are higher and Australians expect additional foreign investment protections in place. “Today’s announcement gives clarity to potential investors and avoids surprises for state governments and private sellers of electricity transmission, distribution and generation assets.” Morrison said applications for ownership of critical energy infrastructure would be reviewed by FIRB, with help from the Critical Infrastructure Centre. He said the centre would provide better advice to FIRB once it could draw on ownership information captured in the proposed critical infrastructure assets register, contained in the Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017, which is currently before parliament. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Labor would look at the details of the energy assets announcement but said they did not appear to be “a substantive change” to powers available under FIRB rules. In 2016, Morrison rejected a Chinese bid to lease New South Wales electricity assets and also blocked the sale of Australia’s largest landholder S Kidman &amp; Co to a majority Chinese-owned consortium. The Chinese embassy has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/01/labors-david-feeney-tipped-to-resign-triggering-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T04:31:33Z","webTitle":"Labor's David Feeney resigns, triggering byelection in Batman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/01/labors-david-feeney-tipped-to-resign-triggering-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/01/labors-david-feeney-tipped-to-resign-triggering-byelection","fields":{"headline":"Labor's David Feeney resigns, triggering byelection in Batman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor’s David Feeney has resigned from federal politics, triggering a byelection in the seat of Batman, which the ALP fears it could lose to the Greens. Feeney became embroiled in the dual citizenship fiasco last year after failing to locate paperwork confirming his citizenship status and his eligibility to sit in the parliament. The Labor MP was referred to the court by federal parliament in December after being unable to produce documents confirming he had renounced any foreign citizenship in 2007. At a preliminary hearing in the high court in January, Feeney’s legal team confirmed he was still unable to produce any documentary evidence from British or Irish authorities that he took steps to renounce his citizenship and entitlements. On Thursday, Feeney told reporters that since the necessary records could not be produced: “I am unable to disprove that I am a dual citizen”. “On this basis, having regard for my duty under section 44 of the constitution, I have today written to the speaker of the House of Representatives resigning as an MP effective immediately,” Feeney said. “I have spoken to my family and I have decided that I will not be seeking ALP preselection for this byelection. Today I have written to the Victorian ALP state secretary to that effect”. He said the ALP deserved a candidate in Batman that was able to give “the months and the years ahead 150% of their effort, their commitment and their passion”. “After careful reflection, I don’t believe I’m able to offer this,” he said. Labor sources have told Guardian Australia the likely candidate to replace Feeney in the seat is the Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney, who was looking at a state seat but has been prevailed upon to run federally. The federal seat of Batman is in the same geographical area as the Victorian state seat of Northcote, which the Greens snatched from the Victorian Labor government in late November in a byelection. Federally, the Greens fancy their chances of taking Batman from Labor, and Labor insiders concede privately that outcome is entirely possible. Kearney, with her campaign background, is regarded as a stronger candidate than Feeney in the Melbourne electorate which includes the biggest Greens branch in the country, and a substantial, established field operation. The Greens candidate in the seat will be Alex Bhathal, who went close to taking the seat from Labor at the last federal election. While there is some criticism about Bhathal at the local level, she has the support of the Greens federal team, and party sources say the local backbiting is from a minority of members. The Liberals are unlikely to field a candidate, which will increase the difficulty of Labor’s bid to hold the seat. The Victorian ALP is in the middle of a bare-knuckle factional battle triggered by a proposed power realignment between right and left wing powerbrokers. Before Feeney’s resignation on Thursday, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, sent a public signal for the first time that the federal ALP could seek to stop the controversial Adani coalmine – a hardening of the party’s stance. The Greens have been running an anti-Adani campaign in the suburbs of Melbourne covered by the Batman boundaries for almost 12 months, associating Labor with the project. The Greens campaign will be amplified by local activist groups campaigning against the controversial Queensland mine project. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said in a statement Feeney had informed him of his intentions late on Wednesday. He said he’d been “shocked” when Feeney informed him about his problems with dual citizenship. Shorten said Feeney’s decision to resign from parliament was “the right one and spares the valuable time and resources of the high court”. “Labor will put forward a strong candidate at the upcoming Batman byelection, who’ll stand up for the things that matter to Australians: protecting penalty rates and local jobs, protecting Medicare and schools, keeping taxes lower for ordinary people, and building a strong economy that delivers for all,” the Labor leader said. Feeney’s decision to step down allows the contest in the seat to be brought on more quickly than if the ALP had waited until the outcome of the high court’s deliberation. As well as the imminent resumption of the parliamentary year, Labor needs to plan for its national conference – often a fractious affair – which is due in the middle of 2018. But the eventual outcome in the seat of Batman seems unlikely to end the controversy. Labor has more MPs facing questions about their eligibility to sit in parliament courtesy of dual citizenship questions. On Thursday, the manager of government business, Christopher Pyne declared that Shorten needed to “show some character” and call upon another lower house Labor MP, Susan Lamb, the Labor member for Longman, to resign because of her dual citizenship of the United Kingdom. “Susan Lamb, very clearly, is still a UK citizen,” Pyne told reporters in Adelaide. “The advice from her own barrister indicates she’s never relinquished her UK citizenship”. Pyne said if Lamb departed the parliament in the same way as Feeney, meaning via resignation, “byelections for Longman and Batman can be held on the same day, saving the Australian taxpayer money rather than having separate long, drawn-out byelections and another high court referral of Susan Lamb to the high court, costing taxpayers money yet again”. Asked by journalists about the questions about the eligibility of some Liberal MPs, Pyne said there were no questions about “legitimacy” on the government side. With federal parliament set to resume for 2018 next week, Pyne said the government would not seek to refer anyone to the high court “unless there is a very clear evidence base for doing so”. “This isn’t the Salem witch trials,” he said. “It’s evidence-based.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/01/andreas-pereira-alex-ferguson-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"Andreas Pereira: ‘Alex Ferguson said hi in Portuguese.

I didn’t expect that’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Bom dia.” It was only two words and it was not exactly poetry, but it was enough. Andreas Pereira was being shown around Carrington by Manchester United’s chief recruitment officer, Geoff Watson, with his dad when Sir Alex Ferguson appeared, which was probably always part of the plan, just as greeting him in Portuguese probably was too. A forward for PSV Eindhoven, the Brazilian had arrived as the outstanding player at the Nike Cup, a kind of youth world championship, but the people he passed had no idea who he was and he was not sure what he wanted to do next. Until, he says, the person he passed was the manager. And then his mind was made up. “Suddenly we met Ferguson,” Pereira recalls. “He said ‘hi’ in Portuguese and that was very special to me. I didn’t expect that. I thought: ‘How does he know that?’ It was only a little detail but it made me want to go to United straight away. I wanted to sign immediately and stay there. So, I did stay. And from then I never wanted to go anywhere else.” It was 2011 and Pereira was 15; he is 22 now, and it has not quite worked out like that. Not just yet, anyway. But if he has gone somewhere else, it was because he wanted to – in fact, this summer he had to fight for his loan move to Valencia, arguing his corner in negotiations with José Mourinho – precisely because he believes it is the best way back. Outstanding at youth and under-21 level, Pereira has played 13 senior games for United. His first was a League Cup defeat against MK Dons in August 2014. He forfeited matches this season for the future, pushing to go on loan. He sought minutes, development, and the decision was not taken lightly. Pereira is intelligent and articulate and the thought that went into it is clear, as is the personality it took. If the reward is experience, he has had plenty. Last season he suffered relegation on loan at Granada, under Tony Adams, playing the role of footballer and translator too, proficient in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Flemish; on Thursday his Valencia team, revived under Marcelino García Toral and third in the league above Real Madrid, face Barcelona in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou. In the hours before the game Mourinho may message him; soon after it his dad will call. He always does. A former footballer, Marcos Pereira played in Belgium for eight different clubs, ending at Lommel United, where Andreas began, and retired a year before his son joined Manchester United. “He showed me videos, how I had to play. When I was at PSV, I’d get home from training and we’d train there. I’d practise free-kicks and corners. After games he’d say: ‘You have to do this, you have to do that.’ Sometimes I was, like: ‘Ah, just shut up, I don’t want to speak about football.’ But I always listened and he would tell me: ‘No, it’s for your own good.’” The coaching continues now. “He watches the game on telly at home in England and calls: ‘Why did you do that?’ “My dad always tells me what to do and what not to do on the pitch. He always gives me advice. But coming to Spain again was my decision. I wanted to go somewhere and play a regular season and play every game because I think it was important for me. Last year I did it and I felt stronger for it. I felt good. The United staff recognised it and they saw that I came back a better player. And that’s why I made the same decision this year. “[At first] I was thinking that I want to stay. But as the pre-season went on I had the feeling: ‘I don’t think I’m going to play enough, I’m not going to get a lot of minutes.’ I have to play, I have to continue developing. I knew I would get some game time at United but here I’m playing every week and being important for the team. It was a very difficult decision. I never want to leave United but I want to play as well. In the end it will make me a better player and I will still be a United player.” Mourinho, though, had other ideas; he had mapped out a different path and going against his wishes, pushing for an exit, was risky. “That’s why it is difficult,” Pereira admits. “He told me I had to stay but I wanted to play and get more minutes. He wanted me to stay there and it was important [to him], but I needed to do this. This was important for me and my career. And I’m sure if it works out, next year I will be back there and it will be better for both of us. In the end I think he is happy because he is a very honest coach. I was talking to him right up to the very last minute when I came here.” Although not a regular starter, Pereira has played 22 games, having played 37 times last season, and the level is high. Not that he sees a season of struggle as a waste. “For some players it can be difficult at a smaller club and they suffer; they don’t want to be at a club that’s going to get relegated, so they think: ‘Why am I here? What am I doing?’ But it was good for me to go to Granada. I felt the difference after a full season there and I wanted that again, just at a better team. “I had that chance because Valencia wanted me; it’s a big club and we can do well, as we’re showing. It’s not like last season when we lost 10 games in a row. You can lose but you know you’ll bounce back and to get this club back into the Champions League alone would be a fantastic achievement, especially if you see last season how it was here. It will be very special. For sure, [Mourinho] is happy because Marcelino is a very, very good coach as well and we are doing great.” A very good coach and notoriously strict on nutrition. Pereira laughs. “We don’t eat a lot,” he says. “It’s a bit stressful but you see the positive results on the pitch: we run so much and we never get tired. It’s good. I feel leaner, fitter here this year. “I can play high-level football and have a good year, all year, and then I am ready to be a starter for United. Instead of being on the bench, playing some cup games, where in the end I know my head will get frustrated and then everything will go around and go against me. So that’s why I took this decision. I’m sure Mourinho is happy because he knows at the end of the season I will go back to United.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/feb/01/political-donations-2016-17-search-the-declarations-by-australian-parties","type":"interactive","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T23:41:19Z","webTitle":"Political donations 2016-17: search the declarations by Australian parties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/feb/01/political-donations-2016-17-search-the-declarations-by-australian-parties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2018/feb/01/political-donations-2016-17-search-the-declarations-by-australian-parties","fields":{"headline":"Political donations 2016-17: search the declarations by Australian parties","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/02/trump-immigration-bogeymen-ms-13-chain-migration","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T14:24:40Z","webTitle":"Trump's immigration policies are full of bogeymen and contradictions | Michael Paarlberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/trump-immigration-bogeymen-ms-13-chain-migration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/trump-immigration-bogeymen-ms-13-chain-migration","fields":{"headline":"Trump's immigration policies are full of bogeymen and contradictions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 1968, a British Conservative politician, Enoch Powell, made what became known as his “Rivers of Blood” speech. In it, he sounded an alarm about what he imagined to be an unchecked immigrant invasion of the United Kingdom, at a time when the country’s immigrant population had only grown from 5 to 6% in the previous decade. Crime was low, less than one homicide per 100,000 residents, a tenth the rate of the US. Quoting a constituent, he foresaw the day when “the black man will have the whip hand over the white man”. In subsequent decades, immigration slowly inched upwards, but the scenario Powell envisioned failed to materialize. Half a century later, we Americans live in a Powellesque moment in which politicians’ hysterical rhetoric surrounding immigration is completely at odds with the facts. President Trump, giving his own Rivers of Blood speech on Tuesday, painted a grim picture of a wave of hardened criminal immigrants, exploiting diversity visas and “chain migration”, running around the country murdering people left and right. In reality, illegal immigration to the US is down, not up. Trump would like to take credit for this with his tough talk about walls, rapists, and “bad hombres” from Mexico, but the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country has been falling for the past decade, due not to xenophobic bluster but the Great Recession. Net migration from Mexico is currently negative: more Mexicans are leaving the US than coming in, and have been doing so since the end of the Bush administration. In coming decades, most new immigrants to the US will not be from Latin America at all, but from China and India. Violent crime, too, is down, way down: FBI statistics show violent crimes are just half of what they were in the early 90s. Trump would have you believe that immigrants are responsible for “tremendous amounts of crime”, but research shows immigrants commit less crime than native-born Americans. Yet to convince us the opposite is true, Trump and the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have zeroed in on one group in particular, Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, a gang I’ve researched in El Salvador. MS-13 makes for a picture-perfect boogeyman given its reputation for violence and scary face tattoos, and misreported origins in Central America. In fact, it started in Los Angeles in the 1980s, was originally made up of adolescent stoners who listened to heavy metal, and only grew into a much larger and more vicious, officially designated “transnational gang” thanks to mass criminal deportations by the Clinton administration to poor countries that were ill-equipped to deal with the influx. It can’t really be described accurately as a single gang but is rather a network of gangs with little centralized authority and a franchised name, whose street value only increases with each press conference by Trump and Sessions. And for all the hype, MS-13 is a relatively small player here. Its estimated US membership has remained constant for the past decade at around 10,000, or less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the US: far smaller than the Crips, Bloods, Latin Kings, or Aryan Brotherhood. Even the face tattoo image is out of date; MS cliques have been discouraging members from getting them after belatedly realizing it makes them easy to identify by police. As for the origins of this nonexistent immigrant crime wave, Trump blames “chain migration”, the more menacing nativist buzzword for family reunification, the principle on which our immigration laws are founded. “Chain migration” is actually a conservative idea: the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was passed in 1965, was sold to immigration restrictionists as a law which would preserve mostly white immigration while doing away with the overtly racist, eugenics-inspired quota laws it replaced. Because by 1965, most immigrants to the US were from Europe, it was assumed that giving preference to family members of current immigrants would restrict immigration from other parts of the world. The opposite happened, with immigration surging from Asia and Latin America, not coincidentally many countries with histories of US military intervention: Korea, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Iraq. Yet family reunification has remained the cornerstone of immigration policy, with broad conservative support, for decades. After all, it is a policy which upholds the family as a unit. Families, conservatives argued, were preferable to single men. They encourage stable employment, homeownership, participation in the community, and provide a source of private, non-state welfare for needy relatives. Families are what keeps people out of trouble, the kind Trump imagines immigrants are getting into, and which may actually happen if he succeeds in taking away this base of support. It wouldn’t be the first time US immigration policy had the opposite of its intended effect, from Johnson’s 1965 immigration law to Clinton’s criminal deportations. Similarly, Trump’s recent decision to revoke TPS protection for over 200,000 legal immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador will only increase the number of unauthorized immigrants and lead to more unauthorized immigration in the future: mass deportations mean a loss of cash remittances from those immigrants to countries whose economies are heavily dependent on them, which will only worsen unemployment and send more migrants north. Breaking up families also creates the conditions of insecurity under which predatory gangs thrive. In Central America, deportations from the US give gangs a new vulnerable population to recruit from. In the US, the loss of family networks and raids which push migrants into the shadows give them a new vulnerable population to extort. There aren’t many beneficiaries of Trump’s immigration policy, but there’s at least one: MS-13 couldn’t have asked for a better president than Trump.

The night belonged to Séamus Coleman, a player who had given everything to grace this famous old ground once again. Everton, and Theo Walcott in particular, thrived on his quality and passion to record a crucial first win of the year. Ten months on from suffering a double leg fracture at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland captain returned to the Premier League with a performance that not only allayed doubts about his powers of recovery but instantly underlined his importance to Everton. Coleman came to the fore as Sam Allardyce’s team took control against Leicester and Walcott announced his arrival from Arsenal in style with his first two goals for the club. The defender was also prominent in repelling a late fightback from Leicester that had seemed unlikely until Wayne Rooney fouled Wilfred Ndidi inside the area and Jamie Vardy scored from the penalty spot. Strong in the tackle and rampaging forward even in stoppage time, Coleman set the example for Everton to follow in claiming their first victory for eight matches. The respect he commands was evident on the final whistle. Vardy and Kasper Schmeichel offered hugs and words of praise. Goodison resounded to the sound of “Sixty Grand, Sixty Grand, Séamus Coleman”. Nights like this make 10 months in the gym worthwhile. “For Séamus to finish the 90 minutes and in the 92nd minute go on a run of 80 yards with the ball was outstanding for me and an example to every player at this football club,” said Allardyce. “To perform with that energy and quality when you’ve been out for 10 months is just marvellous to see.” Walcott struck up an instant rapport with the Irish captain on Everton’s right flank and provided the cutting edge the team have lacked all season to continue his fine start since arriving from Arsenal for £20m. His energy and confidence also proved infectious to Everton, who started with a sluggishness reminiscent of their last home appearance against West Bromwich Albion before claiming the upper hand and a deserved win. Claude Puel claimed his Leicester team would not make an excuse of Mahrez’s absence as he waited in vain to join Manchester City but the distraction was unavoidable. The visitors started the brighter and could have established a comfortable early lead when Harry Maguire headed over from a Marc Albrighton corner and Ndidi steered another header against the crossbar, but their levels plummeted as soon as they fell behind. Cuco Martina instigated the breakthrough by dispossessing Ben Chilwell just outside the Leicester penalty area. The ball broke for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who picked out Walcott arriving unmarked at the back post and he converted with ease past Schmeichel. Oumar Niasse, favoured in attack to the new £27m signing Cenk Tosun, should have doubled Everton’s lead but dragged horribly wide with the goal gaping. Goodison was a mass of people with hands on heads at the miss, but moments later it was forgotten. Sigurdsson and Rooney combined in midfield for the latter to send a deep cross to the back post where Michael Keane and Daniel Amartey duelled for the header. The ball appeared to spin off the Leicester defender’s head and fell perfectly for Walcott, standing unmarked on the other side of the area, to volley home his second under the exposed Schmeichel. Everton squandered several chances to extend their lead and it was only after Vardy’s late penalty that nerves crept in and Leicester rallied. Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho struck the bar and post within seconds of his introduction and Martina blocked a goal-bound drive from Matty James. Their recovery petered out. Coleman’s performance did not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/01/data-visualisation-the-geography-of-black-america-then-and-now","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T15:45:03Z","webTitle":"The geography of black America – then and now","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/01/data-visualisation-the-geography-of-black-america-then-and-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/01/data-visualisation-the-geography-of-black-america-then-and-now","fields":{"headline":"The geography of black America – then and now","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Black History Month starts on Thursday, almost a century after Carter G Woodson first conceived of the idea. This animation shows how the geography of black America today has changed since then. Design Woodson shared much in common with another scholar, WEB Du Bois. Both men studied at Harvard and both believed in the power of reason and truth in overcoming prejudice. My starting point for this design was to look back at the beautiful data visualizations which Du Bois created in 1900 (I attempted to update a few of them last year). This one, which shows where black Americans lived in 1900, caught my eye and I wondered how much had changed since then. Classrooms were always a crucial part of Woodson’s goal to raise awareness of African Americans’ contributions to civilization – and they still are. (I have been working with Math For America and Eleanor Terry Vierling to create datasets like this one that students can visualize for themselves. If you’re a teacher, read on to find out how you can use this in your class too.) Data I will admit that this one was not easy. Although the Census Bureau has lots of easily accessible numbers about the United States today, the further back you go in history, the more complicated records get. In this case, most of the older records were buried in a pdf which meant I had to type out individual years. I then tried to adjust the older numbers based on more accurate recent data about population change. The result is still a little imprecise but it does show just how much where black Americans live now has been shaped by where black Americans lived 116 years ago. You can view the data here.

The Australian Electoral Commission disclosures for the 2016-17 financial year were released on Thursday showing both major parties at the federal level declare more than $30m in donations and other receipts including public election funding. The AEC disclosures confirm that Malcolm Turnbull was the biggest single donor to his own party, making a $1.75m contribution to the Liberal coffers just before the 2 July 2016 election. Other large donations to the Liberal party included $500,000 from regular contributor Roslyn Packer, the widow of the late Kerry Packer; $200,000 from the Burnewang Pastoral Company; and $150,000 from each of ANZ, the National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association and supermarket giant Wesfarmers. ANZ gave the same amount to federal Labor while the party declared other receipts totalling $128,100 from the National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association, $110,000 from Woodside Energy and $55,000 from Responsible Wagering Australia. The biggest political expenditure was $3.6m by ACA Low Emissions Technologies Ltd, which manages a fund established by the coal industry to invest in clean coal. Its largest outlay was on political ads to pay for a campaign called Coal - It’s an Amazing Thing. The Minerals Council spent a further $1.3m, including the Making the Future Possible campaign which spruiks coal and prompted a backlash from BHP. The Australian Education Union and the Australian Council of Trade Unions each spent about $890,000, GetUp spent $821,000, while the New South Wales Teachers Federation and Universities Australia spent about $500,000. The Cormack Foundation, an associated entity of the Liberal party, received $3.4m in “other receipts” comprising dividends from its investments and donated a total of $800,000 to the Victorian Liberal party. Labor – including through its state branches – received donations and other receipts from associated entities including $790,000 from the 1973 Foundation, $200,000 from Progressive Business, $869,000 from United Voice and $200,000 from the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association SA. The Liberal party’s New South Wales branch received two donations totalling $78,000 from operators of the Star Casino in Sydney, the Star Entertainment Group, and $32,000 from the Registered Clubs Association of NSW. NSW Labor received $30,000 from Hong Kong Kingston Investment, the company of China-linked donor Chau Chak Wing, $30,090 from the registered clubs and $23,500 from Crown Resorts. In Victoria both major parties received donations worth more than $50,000 from PricewaterhouseCoopers and more than $40,000 from the Pharmacy Guild. The Victorian Liberals declared $363,000 from Vapold Pty Ltd. Donations of more than $13,200 were required to be disclosed in the 2016-17 period. The gap between major parties’ total receipts and declarations from known sources was $46.1m, suggesting a large portion of the $185m in receipts is below the threshold for donations or other money received. The largest donations for the Queensland LNP were from the Marino Property Trust ($74,424) and the Consolidated Properties Group Pty Ltd ($43,580). Jackie Trad, Labor’s deputy premier, was the party’s biggest donor in Queensland ($38,000), followed by KPMG Australia ($37,300) and Ernst and Young ($33,000). In South Australia, the Liberal party received $316,000 from Aus Gold Mining Group Pty Ltd, owned by Chinese businesswoman Sally Zou, and $105,000 from both Ian and Pamela Wall. In Western Australia the party received donations over $100,000 from Fopar Nominees Pty Ltd and Jefferson Investments Pty Ltd. The Liberal Democrats declared one donation of $20,000 from tobacco company Philip Morris. Dick Smith donated $2,000 to the Jacqui Lambie Network. The Nationals received donations from Manildra Group ($37,200) Macquarie Group Ltd ($29,700), the Pharmacy Guild ($29,000) and Philip Morris ($15,700). One Nation received donations totalling less than $3,000, but received $1.7m in funding from the Australian Electoral Commission. The major parties each received more than $20m in public election funding. The Greens did not receive any large corporate donations but its various branches got $150,000 from high-end gambler Duncan Turpie, $95,000 from the estate of Ian Rudd and more than $100,000 from the estate of Cecily Dignan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/31/phil-jones-the-fall-guy-in-manchester-uniteds-back-line-of-pumpkins","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T09:01:00Z","webTitle":"Manchester United's midfield failings and backline of pumpkins fall at Spurs | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/31/phil-jones-the-fall-guy-in-manchester-uniteds-back-line-of-pumpkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/31/phil-jones-the-fall-guy-in-manchester-uniteds-back-line-of-pumpkins","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United's midfield failings and backline of pumpkins fall at Spurs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For Manchester United this was a bruising 2-0 defeat by better-balanced opponents and an occasion that seemed to float past in a series of occasionally bizarre snapshots. Marouane Fellaini gave a new twist to the idea of two-touch football, coming on after 62 minutes, having two touches, then leaving seven minutes later with a knee injury. If it is any consolation, he was still probably one of United’s better midfielders on the night. Paul Pogba marauded weirdly for an hour, a free radical in what was supposed to be a rigid two-man central midfield. With 66 minutes gone he could be seen jogging off, pointedly uninjured, substituted for playing like Paul Pogba. Then there was Phil Jones: A Study In Blue. This is a footballer whose professional life has been measured out in gurning stills, caught on camera with the look of a man who seems to have taken the ill-advised decision to sneak a quick look inside the Ark of the Covenant while simultaneously challenging for a high ball at a corner. There was another one of these at Wembley, Jones captured plunging his face into one of the padded struts behind the goal, looking as though he was trying to hide and to seek a consoling embrace in its plasticised innards. Understandably so. Tottenham’s second goal had come from Jones’s own instep midway through the first half, a horrible own goal to follow some weak marking from Chris Smalling for the first. Images tell a powerful story and it will be hard to resist the obvious story here, a tale of wondrously well-resourced midfield and attack let down by the pumpkins at the back; of a manager who has recarpeted the stairs in sequinned yak-thread weave but forgotten to spend a few hundred quid fixing the roof. This is only half the story. United’s problems started further forward with an obvious failure in structure and personnel in midfield. Spurs were excellent in the centre, quicker and snappier, better organised, hunting in packs of four, but their excellence was emphasised by a bizarrely unbalanced opposition. United’s starting 11 featured a midfield and attack with five players signed for a total of £285m. Even as a set of names on a piece of paper it was a thrilling display of power and muscle. It took 11 seconds for Spurs to put a fist through this. The opening goal came from a punted pass, a ricochet, a sudden sight of goal and an instant finish from Christian Eriksen. As the half wore on it began to look less like bad luck plus opportunism, more like a failure of organisation. For a while the game was bafflingly open. United are supposed to be dour and migrainously defensive away to the bigger teams, as they are also at times at home to bigger teams or indeed the smaller teams. There is nothing wrong with this. Successful defensive football is still successful football. United came to Wembley having not conceded a goal in six games since Boxing Day. And yet the striking thing in those opening exchanges was the absence of control, an open midfield with Pogba haring upfield at every opportunity leaving Nemanja Matic to cover the vast lime-green squares of the Wembley chequerboard. The second goal arrived via a fizzing little triangle involving Mousa Dembélé, Dele Alli and Eriksen, sucking in the red shirts, then zipping the ball out to the right wing. Jones’s attempt to clear Kieran Trippier’s cross became a wonderful no-look sidefoot finish past his own keeper, clipped in with Ronaldinho-ish nonchalance. It was bad luck, of course, but it came from Spurs’ excellence in swarming through those spaces in midfield. Soon after Pogba could be seen in animated conversation with José Mourinho. For a while he dropped deeper, playing flatter alongside Matic. Clearly this is not really where he wants to be or where his mastery of the ball and those feet that are both whiplash dribbling instruments and purveyors of dreamy floated passes are best placed. It is an issue of balance Mourinho will face again given the quality in his squad. Some will suggest this is a problem of basic method, that Mourinho does not really like elite attacking players, that he prefers fit, strong intelligent players who occupy the fixed points within his carefully stitched design. Faced with all this power and possibility he is playing someone else’s game, dragged out of his zone of excellence; forced, awkwardly, to dance. On the evidence of Wembley watching him find a solution will be fascinating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/31/us-prosecutors-issue-subpoenas-fifa-ioc-iaaf","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T21:55:30Z","webTitle":"US prosecutors issue subpoenas seeking information from Fifa, IOC and IAAF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/31/us-prosecutors-issue-subpoenas-fifa-ioc-iaaf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/31/us-prosecutors-issue-subpoenas-fifa-ioc-iaaf","fields":{"headline":"US prosecutors issue subpoenas seeking information from Fifa, IOC and IAAF","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"US federal prosecutors are conducting an extensive investigation into global sports corruption, including at Fifa and the international and US Olympics organisations, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing a grand jury subpoena. As part of the investigation, the justice department is looking at possible racketeering, money laundering and fraud charges related to the world athletics championships and the business executives who have consulted on bids for various other elite competitions, the Times reported. The investigation is being conducted by the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of New York in Brooklyn, which has previously investigated Fifa and systematic doping in Russia. “The office can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation,” Tyler Daniels, spokesman for the US attorney’s office, told the Guardian. The subpoena, one of a number that were delivered in January, solicited documents, testimony and financial records dating to 2013. Since then, the United States has won bids to host the 2021 world athletics championships in Eugene, Oregon and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The subpoena did not explicitly refer to the Los Angeles Olympics bid, but did focus on the world governing body for track and field, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the newspaper said. The IAAF awarded the sport’s 2019 world championships to Doha, Qatar, and the 2021 event to Eugene. The people asked to provide information, including personal and corporate bank records, were expected to appear in federal court in Brooklyn as soon as this week, the Times reported. A spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee declined to comment on Wednesday and a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to a request, the newspaper reported.

Javi Gracia, who was in charge of his first Premier League game since becoming Watford’s manager, is entitled to take some satisfaction from collecting his first point, yet it was hard to see how Paul Lambert, his opposite number, could glean many positives from a stalemate that was every bit as bad as the scoreline suggests. The one piece of good news for Stoke is that they are out of the relegation zone, although it is hard to escape the feeling this was two points dropped for the home team on a night when Jon Moss, the referee, was as busy as anyone. Tempers boiled over time and again, just as they did in the corresponding fixture at Vicarage Road in October, after which Troy Deeney was retrospectively banned, and it was something of a surprise the game finished with 22 players on the pitch. It was a fractious, scrappy affair from start to finish and the smattering of boos at the final whistle were as predictable as the result. Stoke looked desperately flat, there was no real tempo to their game and a glaring lack of conviction in front of goal, where the absence of a centre-forward with a real presence continues to handicap them. Their best chance fell to Xherdan Shaqiri, who thumped a shot straight at Orestis Karnezis, the Watford goalkeeper, shortly after the hour mark. Watford could, and possibly should, have snatched victory in the 84th minute when the ball dropped invitingly for Roberto Pereyra, who was only about six yards out. The Watford substitute ended up hitting the ball with his shin more than his boot, enabling Jack Butland to save. Although Stoke’s Mame Diouf and Maxim Choupo-Moting had early chances, and Richarlison lifted Gerard Deulofeu’s cross over the bar from only six yards out for Watford, goalmouth action was in short supply in a game that had no real ebb and flow. The flurry of bookings hardly helped – four for Stoke and three for Watford – and at times it threatened to get a little out of hand. Christian Kabasele, the Watford defender, appeared to be guilty of play-acting, when he dramatically fell to the floor holding his face after clashing with Diouf. It was that sort of game and not one that will live long in the memory, with the biggest cheer of the night reserved for Badou Ndiaye, a £14m signing from Galatasaray, who was introduced to the Stoke supporters on the pitch at half-time. Lambert tried to find some encouragement from what he has seen so far. “Four points out of six and two clean sheets is a good start for me personally and for the team,” the Stoke manager said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/01/schoolchildren-lost-kiribati-ferry-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T23:17:41Z","webTitle":"Kiribati ferry disaster: 22 schoolchildren among those feared lost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/01/schoolchildren-lost-kiribati-ferry-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/01/schoolchildren-lost-kiribati-ferry-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Kiribati ferry disaster: 22 schoolchildren among those feared lost","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Twenty-two school children on their way to start a new term are among those feared to have died on a ferry missing for 12 days between remote islands in Kiribati. Ten primary school children were among the 88 on board, as well as 13 high school students. One 14-year-old girl was among seven survivors rescued in the central Pacific on Sunday, from a wooden dinghy that had no engine, water, food or radio. The MV Butiraoi ferry left Nonouti Island on 18 January for a two-day, 250km (155-mile) trip to Betio, the largest township of Kiribati’s capital city, South Tarawa. It failed to arrive as scheduled on 20 January. The Nonouti council has gone door to door compiling a list of anyone who had family on the ferry, which was carrying no emergency rescue equipment or locator beacon, and had a recent history of mechanical problems. Using this method, the council has confirmed that a total of 88 people – 45 male and 43 female – boarded the ferry. The Kiribati government has been strongly criticised by families awaiting news of loved ones for its alleged disregard for marine safety, and the fact it took officials six days to call on Fiji and New Zealand for help from the air, using radar equipment and specialised marine rescue teams. Ieremia Tabai, a Nonouti MP, slammed the vessel as “unseaworthy” and said the government should have stopped it sailing. Planes from the US and Australia have also joined in the aerial search, but nothing of significance has been spotted in the massive search area since Sunday, rescuers have said. President Taneti Maamau gave a second public address overnight, saying a full investigation would take place. “The government is with you, the people of Nonouti, including those who have been greatly affected by this incomparable incident and it will not run away from it but to humbly accept it and will try its very best to search for the remaining passengers,” Maamau said on Radio Kiribati. “There are currently six vessels helping out in the search: there are five fishing vessels and including Kiribati’s patrol boat Te Anoai, who continue to search the area of ocean where passengers and debris from the vessel might be found.” A Kiribati medical team of three doctors and four nurses reached the seven survivors on Tuesday. The survivors are now on board the Te Anoai and being transported to the main island of Tarawa for further treatment. They are reported to be in reasonable health. Maamau said he remained hopeful that others could still be found alive. Former president Anote Tong told the ABC that the apparent sinking had shocked his nation and people were angry at the government as they looked for someone to blame. “This is by far the biggest disaster in terms of numbers and also in terms of the people involved,” said Tong, who has called for a thorough investigation of the incident, saying the disaster could amount to a “criminal act” if it was found to be due to gross negligence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/feb/28/why-phantom-thread-should-win-the-2018-best-picture-oscar","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T13:00:17Z","webTitle":"Why Phantom Thread should win the 2018 best picture Oscar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/28/why-phantom-thread-should-win-the-2018-best-picture-oscar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/28/why-phantom-thread-should-win-the-2018-best-picture-oscar","fields":{"headline":"Why Phantom Thread should win the 2018 best picture Oscar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of the most grindingly difficult obstacles to being in a functional and happy relationship is also one that appears to be deceptively simple: figuring out how to share your life with someone you love. Once the initial, doe-eyed stages of courtship are over, there’s a subtle choreography required to interlink two disparate lives. When you’re intoxicated with romance, this can feel like a thrilling process, laying the groundwork for a life of intimacy, saying goodbye to the loneliness that came before. But then the daily, unexpected micro-negotiations begin, an intricately challenging procession of compromises, and suddenly the shared road ahead can feel intimidatingly steep. In Paul Thomas Anderson’s Oscar contender Phantom Thread, the brutality of this is explored in all its jagged splendour with ghoulish humour, unflinching honesty and ultimately, surprising tenderness. It’s a film that manages to feel both artfully pristine and horribly messy, the exquisite production design a deceptive shell for two hours of uncomfortable truths, a relationship drama that will prove frightfully perceptive to anyone willing to look past the fittings and deep into the stitching of their own dating history. Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an uncompromising talent. He designs show-stopping dresses for the elite women of London, working alongside his brittle sister Cyril (Lesley Manville). His work is his life, consuming and often overwhelming, a creative outpour leaving him empty, resorting to the countryside for recuperation. On one particular excursion he encounters Alma (relative unknown Vicky Krieps), a waitress whose striking looks betray a crippling lack of confidence. The pair connect instantly and the process begins. There’s a level of technical craftsmanship alone that makes Phantom Thread an inarguable Oscar frontrunner, from Jonny Greenwood’s wondrous score to Anderson’s own swoon-worthy, and uncredited, cinematography. But there are also many joys carefully woven within the fabric that might take repeat viewings to appreciate fully. Anderson presents us with characters, and a situation, we think we can predict. The obsessive and controlling artist pitted against the vulnerable and naive muse with a sinister, Mrs Danvers-esque antagonist thrown in for good measure. But while certain tropes may recall older, similarly themed works, our preconceptions gradually unravel as his script contorts into something thrillingly new, wonderfully female and fascinatingly dangerous. Reynolds is a well-coiffed man-child stuck in a privileged, yet stultifying, routine. He justifies his petty brattishness with his impressive creative prowess while his slick exterior hides an emotional immaturity. His “confirmed bachelor” status has turned him into an intolerant and impatient monster, yet one who’s awfully familiar for anyone who’s still found themselves single and dating into their 30s and beyond. It’s all too easy to identify with the often unhealthy barriers erected to protect one’s self and the difficulty faced when someone tries to subtly shake up a stubbornly maintained lifestyle. What initially attracts him to Alma is her physicality but also something far deeper, a misperceived submissiveness that he believes will fit smoothly into the life he has spent time and effort to construct. But like Reynolds, Alma is not the character we expected. Both she and Cyril are challenging, powerful women who, through their very different ways, try to stage-manage the diva they both love. When cracks appear, when Alma refuses to play the role he has written for her, he sulks and whines (the theory that this film in any way glamorizes the creative male genius is questionable) and this rift crescendoes in quite spectacular fashion. It’s a film littered with unforeseen humour, a strange romantic comedy of sorts, acting as a sharp-tongued British cousin to Anderson’s whimsical 2003 oddity Punch-Drunk Love, yet even during the lighter moments, it stings and bruises, all too aware of the considerable pain that lies behind trying to make someone fall back in love with you. After suffering through Reynolds’ impetuous attitude and cruel chilliness for far too long, she poisons his tea, thrusting him into a position of vulnerability and back into her arms. Too many think-pieces have viewed this act through literal eyes, outraged at what’s seen as abuse, unwilling to view the ultimate arrangement for what it really represents: the importance of compromise. During the second poisoning, figuring out exactly what she’s cooking up, Reynolds decides to tuck in anyway and as the soundtrack swells with their embrace, it becomes a moment of unlikely, woozy romance. For me, it was a scene not about psychopathy or some cocktail of Munchausen by proxy and Stockholm syndrome but about the importance of coming to terms with one’s harshest faults in order to save an ailing relationship, albeit played out via an absurdist narrative device. It’s an unvarnished view of the reality behind love, the ongoing, sometimes head-smashingly difficult maintenance required to stay with someone. Alma and Reynolds have found a way to make it work, imperfect sure, and to others, sickeningly perverse but wouldn’t the rules of anyone’s relationship seem strange when studied under a microscope for others to judge? The Academy is unlikely to reward such an odd and divisive film (its six nominations were a shock in the first place) but, to quote Reynolds, “I think it’s the expectations and assumptions of others that cause heartache”. Phantom Thread’s proudly unfettered outlook on love doesn’t require the approval of others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/31/scott-lloyd-considered-controversial-method-reverse-abortion","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T21:42:18Z","webTitle":"Trump officials considered contentious method to 'reverse' undocumented teen's abortion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/scott-lloyd-considered-controversial-method-reverse-abortion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/scott-lloyd-considered-controversial-method-reverse-abortion","fields":{"headline":"Trump officials considered contentious method to 'reverse' undocumented teen's abortion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An anti-abortion activist who was appointed by Donald Trump to head a federal agency that detains undocumented immigrant children considered using a highly contentious and untested technique to stop a teenager from completing an abortion that was already in process, it has emerged. Scott Lloyd, the Trump administration’s pick as director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, raised the prospect last March of administering the hormone progesterone to a 17-year-old girl from El Salvador who had entered the US illegally and was being held in custody in San Antonio, Texas. The procedure is unrecognized by the medical profession as a means of reversing abortion and has side-effects attached to it. Lloyd’s plan to apply the controversial hormone method, first reported by Vice News, was revealed in court documents disclosed in an ACLU lawsuit that seeks to stop the Trump administration from blocking access to abortions by female immigrants in the ORR’s care. Since Lloyd took over the agency last year, it has been accused by civil rights groups of effectively holding girls hostage in an attempt to negate their constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies. In an exhibit appended to the lawsuit, a memo from the acting director of the ORR Kenneth Tota dated 4 March 2017 noted that the previous day the teenager had taken a pill designed to produce a medication abortion. In normal usage, a second pill is then taken 24 or 48 hours later. But in the memo Tota ordered the ORR to escort the girl “to the emergency room of a local hospital in order to determine the health status of [teenager] and her unborn child. If steps can be taken to preserve the life of the [teenager] and her unborn child, those steps should be taken.” A partial transcript of Lloyd’s deposition to the ACLU seen by the Guardian shows that he was asked directly whether he had had conversations about reversing the girl’s medication abortion. “I may have,” he replied. He was then asked whether the ORR would seek to try to reverse an abortion of a child who had entered the US on her own and who was in federal custody. “I don’t know, I mean except to save the life of the baby,” he said. Court documents show that in the end the ORR did allow the girl to go ahead and take the second medication abortion pill, thus terminating the pregnancy. But before this happened the ORR had made inquiries about the efficacy of administering progesterone as a means of stopping the abortion mid-flow, according to emails seen by Vice News. Brigitte Amiri, the ACLU lead counsel on the lawsuit, said: “The Trump administration’s cruel and unconstitutional treatment of young immigrant women knows no bounds. The administration forced a minor to go to an emergency room for an ultrasound in the middle of a medication abortion, and contemplated trying to ‘reverse’ the abortion through an unproven method, against the young woman’s will.” Under Lloyd’s leadership the ORR has tried to prevent at least four pregnant teenagers from accessing abortions. In each case the ACLU has launched legal challenges to ensure that the individuals were afforded their constitutional rights set out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion. In the latest lawsuit, the ACLU is pressing for a class action that would prohibit Lloyd and the ORR from blocking access to abortion clinics in all future cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/31/fbi-nunes-memo-release-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T08:41:23Z","webTitle":"FBI has 'grave concerns' about Trump plan to release controversial memo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/fbi-nunes-memo-release-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/fbi-nunes-memo-release-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"FBI has 'grave concerns' about Trump plan to release controversial memo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The FBI said on Wednesday it had “grave concerns” about Donald Trump’s apparent intention to release a memo said to contain classified information about the bureau’s investigation into one of the president’s campaign aides. After both Trump and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, made public statements supporting the so-called Nunes memo’s release, which the US president said he “100%” backed releasing, the fight over its fate took an extraordinary twist with the highly unusual FBI statement ultimately attributable to its director, Trump’s appointee Christopher Wray. The clash between Wray and Trump is only the latest flare-up in what officials warn is an increasingly dangerous showdown between the White House and justice department, with a cycle of firings and retaliatory leaks potentially culminating in a spectacular firing or similar move by Trump that could threaten a constitutional crisis. “We have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy,” the FBI said in its statement. A Trump administration official told Reuters the memo was likely to be released on Thursday. The memo in question, which Democrats have said cherry-picks classified material to make Russia investigators look bad, was assembled by the House intelligence committee chairman, Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump supporter and a member of his transition team. Nunes issued a combative statement in reply, accusing the FBI of “surveillance abuses” and dismissing what he called the bureau’s “spurious objections” to the release of the memo. However, Nunes opposes the release of a parallel memo written by Democrats. Though the Nunes memo’s precise contents are unknown, it is believed to describe a supposedly flawed request by the FBI to extend surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aide. The memo is being treated as potentially explosive in part because it is said to place responsibility for the supposedly flawed request at the door of the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the Trump-Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump used the mishandling of another FBI investigation as a pretext for firing former director James Comey in May 2017. The axe fell on Comey after Trump requested a loyalty pledge from the director which Comey said he declined to give. Trump made a similar request of Rosenstein, CNN reported for the first time Wednesday, in a December meeting in which Trump is said to have asked whether the deputy attorney general was “on my team”. “Of course, we’re all on your team, Mr President,” Rosenstein replied, CNN quoted unnamed sources as saying. The prospective removal of Rosenstein, whom Trump has attacked elsewhere, would constitute a grave threat to the special counsel investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, analysts have warned. Trump reportedly sought to exact a loyalty pledge from a third top justice department official, asking former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe whom he voted for in the presidential election in a meeting following Comey’s firing. McCabe stepped down in a surprise announcement Monday. Eric Holder, the former attorney general, issued a warning about releasing the Nunes memo on Wednesday. “People must understand what is at stake by release of the bogus, contrived Nunes memo,” Holder wrote on Twitter. “It uses normally protected material and puts at risk our intell capabilities in order to derail a legitimate criminal investigation. This is unheard of - it is dangerous and it is irresponsible.” Trump signaled his intention to release the memo during his departure Tuesday night from the House chamber, following his first State of the Union address. Approached by a representative who urged him: “Mr President, let’s release the memo,” Trump was heard to reply: “Don’t worry, 100%. Can you imagine?” Congressional Republicans have aggressively followed Trump’s lead in attacking the Russia investigators, briefly floating allegations last week of a “secret society” at work within the FBI to hobble Trump, before those allegations were retracted. “Let it all out, get it all out there, cleanse the organization,” Ryan told colleagues at a breakfast event Tuesday, referring to the FBI. That sentiment was part of a larger effort to discredit the FBI among Republicans, who cheered the announcement on Monday that McCabe, the deputy FBI director, would step aside earlier than formerly announced. The move was interpreted in some quarters as a power play by Wray, whose interests in the matter were assumed to be aligned with the president who appointed him. That picture was complicated by the release of the FBI statement on Wednesday, and by reports that Wray had sought to dissuade the White House from releasing the Nunes memo in a meeting Monday between Rosenstein and the White House chief of staff, John Kelly. Republicans have likewise echoed Trump’s attacks on Mueller, whom Trump ordered fired in June 2017, according to a New York Times report, only to back down amid resistance from White House lawyers. Mueller reports to Rosenstein, who has testified before Congress that he alone has the power to fire the special counsel. Further complicating the memo’s release, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee said late on Wednesday that his committee’s vote to release the memo was now invalid because it was “secretly altered” by Republicans who wrote it. Adam Schiff said in a letter to Nunes that committee Democrats had discovered changes that were made after the panel voted Monday to send it to Trump for review. “The White House has therefore been reviewing a document since Monday night that the committee never approved for public release,” Schiff said in the letter. A spokesman for Nunes said the changes were “minor edits to the memo, including grammatical fixes and two edits requested by the FBI and by the minority themselves”.

Senior Labour and Conservative members Harriet Harman and Maria Miller had brought a proposal to modernise the way the House of Commons accommodates new mothers and fathers. It was passed by acclamation on Thursday after no one opposed the motion to give new parents in the House a proxy vote. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said the government was in favour of the idea but expressed reservations about introducing the concept of proxy voting into the Commons, where MPs have to vote in person. The Commons procedure committee will now have to come up with firm proposals for MPs to adopt. Earlier, Harman told the Guardian: “There are over 200 women now and many are young women. There are always parliamentary babies in the pipeline and we need to sort out a system. “We need to get on with it. There are two more babies in the offing, more as time goes on and it is long overdue that we deal with this. So, I’m looking to the house to give a real mandate to the procedure committee to get on with implementing it.” Harman and Miller, who is the Conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee, argued that MPs who have young babies are confronted with an outdated system. Currently MPs who want time with newborn babies ask parliamentary whips for “a pair” – under which system it is agreed that an MP from the opposing party will also miss any votes. Harman will argue that this means the “vote to which their constituency is entitled is not cast”. That has led to social media campaigns criticising MPs for not voting on important issues or newspapers drawing up voting “league tables” that portray the politicians as lazy. Lucy Powell, who was elected to Manchester Central in a 2012 byelection when she was 14 weeks’ pregnant, said she faced media criticism because it was not understood that she had taken time off as maternity leave. She said the Sun had branded her Britain’s second laziest MP because it looked at her voting record and didn’t realise she was on leave. “They had to issue a full apology,” she said. Powell returned to Westminster when her baby, Tom, was four months old. Under the proposals, politicians would be able to choose an MP to vote by proxy, but Harman made clear there would be no requirement to do that. Moreover, MPs could still request a pairing, and the issue would not affect pay. In a briefing note, Harman and Miller said: “We set rules for people outside the house to take maternity, paternity and shared parental leave, and yet we ourselves have no system.” The modernisation drive came after Harman warned against parliament portraying what she called the “Rees-Mogg model” of fatherhood. Labour’s former deputy leader hit out at the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, accusing him of being a “deadbeat dad” and a poor example to fathers. She criticised him after he said he was no “modern man” and had never changed a nappy following the birth of his sixth child, Sixtus. Harman said: “What model of fatherhood do we want parliament to portray? The ‘Rees-Mogg model’ or the modern father who – as well as the mother – is involved with a newborn?” Miller told the Guardian: “Introducing proxy voting for new parents is a small step towards bringing the House of Commons into the 21st century. It isn’t enough by itself and needs to go hand in hand with more significant reform.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/01/agents-gravy-train-curb-excessive-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T14:24:00Z","webTitle":"Agents’ runaway gravy train set to be derailed in bid to curb excessive fees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/01/agents-gravy-train-curb-excessive-fees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/01/agents-gravy-train-curb-excessive-fees","fields":{"headline":"Agents’ runaway gravy train set to be derailed in bid to curb excessive fees","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The January transfer window closed with a blizzard of late moves, delivering £50m as the new normal fee for players – £142m for one of the best, Philippe Coutinho – and undisclosed bumper paydays for agents. Supporters are not told how much money agents make on deals or what work they did to secure it but there is a growing recognition among clubs and governing bodies that the role of agents is out of control. Fifa surrendered governance of agents in 2015 but its president, Gianni Infantino, now says the resulting free-for-all is intolerable. Agents are unlicensed “intermediaries” and can be paid by two or even three parties in a transfer. In forthright remarks Infantino, who has set up a Fifa working party to examine how the intermediary and transfer systems can be reformed, said: “I am very concerned about the huge amount of money flowing out of the football industry. “The commissions paid to intermediaries continue to rise while at the same time the money redistributed through the game and spent on training young players is falling. These increasingly larger transactions are often not done in a clean, open manner and raise a lot of questions about potential misuse of funds. We have to tackle this issue.” Uefa, which has calculated that more than €3bn was paid to agents by Europe’s top clubs between 2013 and 2017, is on the working party. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, voiced his concerns last week and acknowledged clubs’ long-standing complaint that agents are no longer working on behalf of players to negotiate the best salary but are intermediaries, who have to be paid by clubs for bringing the players to them. Ceferin said clubs tell him the approach of some agents is: “Look, you will pay me 50% of the transfer or the player goes somewhere else.” Uefa has its own group examining reforms under the auspices of the European Union, including a cap on agents’ fees, importantly in partnership with the top clubs in the European Club Association; the European Professional Football Leagues – of which the Premier League, which is doing its own work on agents, is a member – and the international players’ union, FIFPro. In a firm joint resolution they committed to reforms, stating agents are “disproportionately well-remunerated for their services”. There is no transparency for the money banked by intermediaries, nor for the role they play in transfers. Of the noted deals in January, the agency Wasserman has denied reports it was paid £7m for handling Ross Barkley’s injury-delayed move from Everton for Chelsea. Alexis Sánchez’s agent, Fernando Felicevich, declined to comment when asked if it was true he was asking for a £15m fee himself for the forward to agree a move. Kia Joorabchian, when asked what his fee was for work on Coutinho’s move to Barcelona from Liverpool, and for his views on the criticisms of agents made by Uefa’s joint resolution, replied via his lawyer his fee was confidential and threatened legal action if he was associated with those criticisms. It was only owing to leaked contract documents that light was shone on the still barely believable £41m made by the agent Mino Raiola from all three sides, Juventus, Manchester United and Paul Pogba, when the player moved to Old Trafford for £89m in 2016. Yet the clubs, football associations and governing bodies do possess all the information about the staggering fees and modern transfer practices, and are finally talking seriously about reimposing regulations. Considering that players sign with agents and entrust them with their moves and salary negotiations, FIFPro is notably critical and supportive of reforms. Its director of policy, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, believes agents’ fees are now “very often” a proportion of transfer fees rather than players’ salaries, and it is a “massive problem” for agents to be acting as brokers for multiple parties in a deal. “They can have greater influence over where a player ends up than the player or the clubs,” he said. “Their interest is not only where a player goes but which club will pay them the highest fee.” Many agents say they still represent players and are not paid excessively for finding them opportunities and decent pay at all levels of football. Dan Chapman, the vice-chair of the UK’s reformist Society of Football Intermediaries and Agents, agrees broadly that agents should act for only one party in a deal, usually negotiating for players, although he believes a cap on fees would be too restrictive. The huge transfer fees and the wages players now bank – Sánchez is understood to be on £15m a year basic at United – have always inflated with the game’s escalating TV rights and other earnings, because players are recognised to be the talent who attract the global following. But there is no universal admiration for the talent of agents and there is a new resolve that their takings need to be reined in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/31/robert-rattray-classical-music-has-lost-a-man-of-verve-brilliance-and-generosity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T18:12:14Z","webTitle":"Robert Rattray: classical music has lost a man of verve, brilliance and generosity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/31/robert-rattray-classical-music-has-lost-a-man-of-verve-brilliance-and-generosity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/31/robert-rattray-classical-music-has-lost-a-man-of-verve-brilliance-and-generosity","fields":{"headline":"Robert Rattray: classical music has lost a man of verve, brilliance and generosity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I never knew how to describe Robert Rattray’s role in my life to people outside the world of opera and classical music. He was my agent, undoubtedly, but that always seemed a bit too detached and mercenary. Robert was never interested in money or glamour, but only in making sure that the music he thought really mattered had a place in concert halls and opera houses. Novelty and tradition excited him in equal measure, but he had no time for the meretricious or the routine. The other word is manager. Robert was, indeed, a brilliant manager and businessman, with a keen sense of how to get the best out of people. When I first met him in the early 1990s, Lies Askonas Ltd (the artists management company he had worked in since the mid 1970s, named after its founder, who had escaped the Anschluss on skis) had just lost a large chunk of its list and was operating out of a small office over a shop in Drury Lane. Over the next two decades he built it into an enormous force in the arts world, with a personal style of artists’ management that survived and prospered after the merger with Harold Holt made it into something of a giant in its field. I think Robert (with his tongue in his cheek, as it often was, quite literally) liked to be thought of as an old-fashioned impresario. He didn’t just find work or field requests. He had a very clear sense of how to nurture a career and of how to construct interesting and varied seasons which could stimulate the creative juices of those lucky enough to be on his list. His wider influence on concert and opera performances worldwide over the past few decades has been incalculable, and will be palpably missed. Artist management was a personal thing for Robert, not a mere business transaction. At many periods of my life we spoke every day. When I was struck down with a kidney stone in Vienna, he stayed with me for the scans, keeping me company through the agony and the boredom. After he retired from being an agent, he remained a dear friend. We met often in New York where, with typical energy, he had taken on a new role at the Met. He was a man of the widest taste and culture, impishly funny and very kind. A lover of theatre and art, and a fine linguist, he was also a voracious and insightful reader, always eager to discuss the latest Alan Hollinghurst novel, say, or the new Hilary Mantel, though his favourite book was Middlemarch. Robert, still full of verve and generosity, despite the diabetes he had endured for decades, had a sudden and massive stroke on Sunday and died on Tuesday afternoon in New York."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/31/manchester-city-pull-out-deal-sign-riyad-mahrez-transfer-window","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T17:52:37Z","webTitle":"Manchester City end interest in Riyad Mahrez after rejecting £95m price tag","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/31/manchester-city-pull-out-deal-sign-riyad-mahrez-transfer-window","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/31/manchester-city-pull-out-deal-sign-riyad-mahrez-transfer-window","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City end interest in Riyad Mahrez after rejecting £95m price tag","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester City ended their pursuit of Riyad Mahrez after Leicester City demanded a package valued at a “crazy” £95m, with the Premier League leaders valuing the forward at no more than £60m. It is understood City never made a formal bid for the Algerian. Instead informal talks took place between their chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and his opposite number at Leicester, Susan Whelan, to try to establish a ball-park figure to initiate negotiations. However, on Wednesday morning the Midlands club proposed a deal that would have included a City player as part of the £95m deal. Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, City’s sporting director, balked at the price and decided Mahrez, who is contracted until 2020, was not worth the fee. The City executive felt the valuation was “crazy”. City had turned to the 26-year-old after they decided against signing Alexis Sánchez from Arsenal because of his proposed fee. Pep Guardiola still wanted a wide attacking player and Mahrez was identified as a potential target, rather than as a stop-gap replacement for Leroy Sané, who injured ankle ligaments in Sunday’s 2-0 FA Cup win at Cardiff and is expected to be out until the end of March – an absence of 11 matches. On Tuesday when it first emerged City were interested in Mahrez, Guardiola said it would be difficult to sign him. He referred to the club record signing of Aymeric Laporte that day. “It’s so difficult,” he said. “It happened with Laporte because he had a buy-out clause [at Athletic Bilbao]. When you have to negotiate it’s always so complicated.” The big question for Leicester is how Mahrez will react to the disappointment of missing out on the big move that he has craved since the Premier League title success in 2016. He cut a disillusioned figure for much of last season and made it clear in the summer that he wanted to leave, submitting a transfer request in May and releasing a statement saying that he was “fiercely ambitious” and felt “this is the time for me to move on”. Although Roma were interested, Leicester’s valuation was never met and as the clock ran down on that summer transfer window, Mahrez, rather bizarrely, spent deadline day at an airport, hoping and waiting for news that he should jump on a flight. The call never came, however, forcing Mahrez to return to Leicester after the international break. He has recaptured his best form at times this season, scoring eight times in the Premier League, yet Leicester could be forgiven for having concerns about how Mahrez will respond to the realisation that he could have been playing for Guardiola’s side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/04/winchester-review-helen-mirren","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T08:00:50Z","webTitle":"Winchester review – cliched haunted house horror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/04/winchester-review-helen-mirren","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/04/winchester-review-helen-mirren","fields":{"headline":"Winchester review – cliched haunted house horror","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Set in California in the early 1900s, this tedious horror pitches Australian actor Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty) as a swaggering psychiatrist sent to assess Helen Mirren’s increasingly erratic (or possibly possessed) gun heiress.

There was no need to exaggerate how good things are – low inflation, lower unemployment, soaring stock market. Nonetheless, as usual, he had to inflate his boastful claims with hot air. There were so many encomiums for various Americans in the president’s speech that the personal, anecdotal stories blurred into each other. But there was no word of thanks for the person most responsible for the strong economic winds keeping the Trump administration afloat. Janet Yellen, perhaps the most successful Federal Reserve chair in modern history and the first woman to hold the job, was completely unrecognized. President Trump gave her the boot, making her the first Fed leader not to be renominated for a second term. All of her predecessors were renominated by presidents of the opposite party. But not Yellen, whom President Barack Obama appointed in 2014 and whose last day on the job is 3 February. Yellen was denounced by some of the Republican lawmakers who clapped thunderously as the president bragged about the 2.4m jobs created during the first year of his presidency. Conservatives in the Congress lambasted Yellen in her early days for her singular focus on job creation and her tenacious loyalty to the bond-buying program known as quantitative easing. They were sure she would overheat the economy. They were wrong. But she had to go because President Trump was determined to jettison any remains from the Obama administration. So the president dumped Yellen, replacing her with Jerome Powell, the favored candidate of the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. As a member of the Fed board of governors, Powell had supported virtually all of Yellen’s key decisions. It’s telling that the president had to embroider the already impressive economic gains the country had enjoyed during his first year in office. “Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone,” he boasted. But according to Pro Publica, only 206,000 real jobs have actually been created so far and only 63,000 of those can be attributed to President Trump. As for manufacturing jobs, the president began his tenure by anointing himself as the savior of a Carrier plant in Indianapolis, Indiana. But only two weeks ago, 200 workers at the plant lost their jobs. And it took $7m in tax breaks and other goodies just to get Carrier to back off from its plan to move to Mexico. The New Yorker published the anguished stories of some of those being laid off earlier this month, just as President Trump began drafting his speech. The magazine gathered with a group of about-to-be former Carrier employees at Sully’s, a local bar. They expressed their sense of having been had by Trump. Among those who spoke at the gathering was Chuck Jones, the former president of United Steel Workers Local 1999, in Indianapolis, who disputed Trump’s initial claims about the Carrier deal and was attacked by Trump on Twitter as a result. “Trump is a liar and an idiot,” Jones told the crowd, adding, “He’s a con man, pure and simple, who sold us a bag of shit.” The 2.4m new jobs figure Trump trumpeted for 2017 is accurate. But it’s also less than the 2.7m jobs created during President Obama’s last year in office. The president’s “Happy Days Are Here Again” economic picture hinges on what he described in his address as “the biggest tax cuts and reform in history”. Actually, the Trump tax cuts are only the 12th largest in history. Ronald Reagan’s 1981 rate cuts were the largest. Everyone knows that the tax bill that was the president’s signature achievement in 2017 is a wet kiss to the billionaire class and robs the poor and many members of the middle class. Nonetheless, Trump and the Republican party believe the tax cuts may be the only thing standing between them and Armageddon in the 2018 elections. The Koch Brothers, among the chief beneficiaries of the bill, just announced their intention of asking their donor network to spend $400m to beat back an expected Democratic wave in congressional races. They more or less sat out those races in 2016 and were lukewarm to Trump. With the tax bill gift, they are lukewarm no more. Trump also repeated the most cynical boast of all – that he’s responsible for improving the economic standing of black Americans. He was stung by criticisms from Jay-Z and tweeted: “Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!” Black unemployment has been declining steadily for the past seven years. It is now at its lowest rate – below 7%, but it is still more about double the 3.7% rate for white Americans, hardly something to brag about. Before the speech, pundits debated whether the president would be “Twitter Trump” or “Teleprompter Trump” for his State of the Union. The angry, dark president on view a year ago on Inauguration Day was replaced by the calm reader. Also on display, to good reviews, in Davos. But substance, not presentation, is what’s important. And it was really the same Donald Trump standing in the well of the House of Representatives, the man who regularly does set a record: for untruths uttered by an American president.

The offer came at a difficult time in her children’s schooling and she only accepted when James Harding, then the head of news, went down on bended knee and begged her to take the job. He was desperate. Not just to promote senior women in general but to promote her in particular. She wasn’t just the best qualified person for the job. She was the only qualified person for the job. Gracie relented. She fancied the challenge of telling the China story and was given assurances by Fran Unsworth, then head of news gathering at the BBC, that she would be paid roughly in line with male international news editors. And all was sweet until the middle of last year when the Beeb was forced to publish a list of its highest earning employees. It emerged then that the US editor, Jon Sopel, and the Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, were earning considerably more than both Gracie and Katya Adler, the Europe editor. Pay parity? What pay parity? After a couple of days to consider her position, Gracie put in an equal pay claim that quickly escalated to a Defcon One grievance procedure. She was told that the Beeb would expedite her claim. Which meant that it would get round to giving her an answer on the 89th day of the statutory 90-day period. Its findings were that it had inadvertently underpaid her by £100,000 since 2014 and could they now kiss and make up as the errors had nothing to do with gender pay discrimination? They couldn’t. By now Gracie was struggling to believe a word anyone in a senior managerial post had told her and she refused the handout. “I didn’t want the money,” she said. “I wanted robust data for people’s different salary levels. I wanted acknowledgment that my work was as good as my male colleagues.” What she got was the bizarre explanation that she had been underpaid because she was in “development”. This prompted an outburst of nervous laughter in the room. “I’m getting emotional,” said Gracie, her face a mixture of cold fury and just a hint of tears. This was music to the ears of the committee. So many of their hearings are so excruciatingly dull that to have someone as articulate as Gracie with such a compelling story to tell was pure gold. They determined to make the most of it by asking Gracie to repeat her story over and over again in greater and greater detail. Like the true professional she is, Gracie was happy to oblige. With every new detail her story moved beyond the simply outrageous into the increasingly surreal. A tragicomedy not even dreamed up by the creators of W1A. Strangest of all was that it was a woman at the Beeb who, according to Gracie, had done as much as anyone to perpetuate the gender pay gap. She reserved her most contemptuous remarks for Unsworth, accusing her of misremembering details of their conversations and briefing against her to the press by suggesting she worked part-time. “Our business at the BBC is the truth,” Gracie said. “How can we be trusted to report on anything if we don’t tell the truth?” By the time she finished giving evidence, no one on the committee could complain they weren’t in command of the facts.

In a letter to Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat, the environment secretary said the government was prepared to hand more power to the industry regulator to help it tackle such practices. “The use by some water companies of opaque financial structures based in tax havens and high gearing is deeply concerning. I also share your concern that some water companies have for many years been making excessive profits,” wrote Gove. “Concern about water companies’ behaviour will only deepen if the dry weather experienced in the autumn means that some water companies bring in hosepipe bans or other restrictions on customer use.” Gove said Ofwat had a key role to play and thanked the water industry regulator for pressing companies to change behaviour. But he said more could be done and listed particular activities that undermined consumer trust, including offshore arrangements, securitisation, highly geared structures, excessive salaries and dividend payments. In his response Cox described it as an “immense privilege” for any company to hold a monopoly public service licence and said that must not be taken lightly. “It is entirely reasonable, when companies adopt more aggressive structures than customers are paying for, that Ofwat and customers want companies to be transparent about their financing and returns and explain them clearly.” He said Ofwat was pushing companies on a number of fronts, and engaging intensively with the most highly leveraged, pointing to action taken with Thames Water. Thames, Britain’s largest water and waste water services company, has taken steps to close its controversial Cayman Islands subsidiaries, accepting that it “just looks wrong”. He promised to report on whether further help was needed by April. Gove’s intervention comes as Water UK releases information on average household water and sewerage bill increases in England and Wales for 2018-19. The organisation representing the industry said the new average bill would be £405, a rise of £9, which it stressed was 2%, so below inflation. A breakdown of expected increases finds a range across the country with some firms slightly reducing prices while others are opting for 3% or 4% hikes. Water UK said that £8bn extra would be invested in the industry this year as part of a £44bn commitment from 2015-20. It said the funding would help prevent 370m litres a day leaking from pipes and ensure nearly 5,000 fewer properties would be flooded with sewer water. A spokesman for Water UK suggested it believed any investigations would give the industry a clean bill of health: “Water companies have been busy investing £8bn a year delivering world class services and addressing concerns raised by the regulator. So we look forward to the work by Ofwat bringing some sorely needed facts and balance to the debate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2018/feb/01/yasmin-jetha-joins-guardian-media-group-board","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T11:14:16Z","webTitle":"Yasmin Jetha joins Guardian Media Group board","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2018/feb/01/yasmin-jetha-joins-guardian-media-group-board","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2018/feb/01/yasmin-jetha-joins-guardian-media-group-board","fields":{"headline":"Yasmin Jetha joins Guardian Media Group board","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Guardian Media Group (GMG) is pleased to announce that Yasmin Jetha has joined the GMG board as a non-executive director, with immediate effect.

The outrage, to be honest, is no surprise. McVey is a lightning rod for loathing, as is the department over which she presides – campaigners have called her appointment “a terrible insult” to disabled people. Here is a politician whose fiefdom is responsible for serious mental distress, advising a charity whose purpose is to help people overcome serious mental distress. On first glance, it stinks. Now standing orders are being cancelled, hashtag protests formed, petitions and angry letters drawn up. For charities, this case poses serious questions. How, in an age of political division and instantaneous revolt via social media, are you supposed to navigate the delicate balance of partnering with government to do good? What are the terms on which you should treat the country’s decision-makers without losing the most important thing: the trust of the people you’re trying to help? Charities and government have always had a quid pro quo relationship. Politicians get their photo opportunities. Charities get a seat at the top table, in order to discuss their beneficiaries’ concerns, or bid for grants and contracts. This is not dirty money. A charity’s purpose, after all, is to reach and help as many beneficiaries as possible. Even when no money is involved, this is a healthy and necessary process. No one charity can achieve change on its own. It would be a dereliction of duty for a progressive organisation not to work with governments of any stripe in their pursuit of social change. Smart charities recognise their role in providing information and advice , improving bad policies from the bottom up and the inside. Without this, who knows what progress we might have missed out on. The issue, however, arises when that relationship becomes seedy, unhealthy or abusive. Increasingly, this is what 2018 looks like. The prime minister professes to be a fan of charities – indeed the only seven organisations she follows on Twitter are local charities. Yet at the same time her government presses on with gagging clauses for those who benefit from funding raised via the tampon tax, has turned the Office for Civil Society into an appendage, and generally presided over the huge cuts to state support for the most vulnerable. I would question any charity that claims to have had influence on this from the inside. The Samaritans may contend that it benefits from having, through McVey, a way into the paths of power and influence. But really, it just looks like another example of charity positions being co-opted into a corrupted elite. And indeed, a further, uglier question rears its head: does the association with figures like McVey mean a charity is actually prevented from speaking out, from doing its job for the people that matter? There is no doubt that the silencing of independent voices through bogus promises of influence happens. I have seen, even at the local level, charities rendered dumb by the conditions in the terms and conditions of council funding. A charity I worked with in Scotland refused to call for unity after Brexit for fear of losing its funding from the SNP (the problem word was “unity”). Then there is the case of Mind. Mind has had many high profile policy wins in the field of mental health, and many contracts too, but have been wary of revealing the full extent of its relationship with government. And so the public ask, perhaps unfair, questions. Such as what actual change has been achieved for people with mental health issues as a result of those Downing Street launches and Today programme interviews? And was it a fair price? There is nothing more disheartening than the prospect of independent, grass-roots charities becoming government shills. And there is absolutely no reason for this to happen. For all of this suggests one thing: that charity is held in higher esteem than the politicians it so often courts. The brand is stronger, its social proof greater. We, the people, care about our charities’ values, their ideals and want to be part of a tribe whose badge we wear with pride. Charities, unlike politicians, can depend upon the love and support of the mobilised masses; they don’t need patronage of politicians. The government may have the money but we have the people. It is time to negotiate the kind of society we want to be, on a more even footing. Asheem Singh is author of The Moral Marketplace and co-founder of gotilo.org.

Employees of Scarlet, a women’s glossy on New York’s Upper East Side and part of the Steinem (geddit?) publishing portfolio, all three are working their way up from assistant level and striving to succeed in journalism. As the magazine’s social media director, Kat is currently the frontrunner. “I want to be as confident as her. How did she get to be so confident?” moans Sutton. “She was overpraised as a child,” replies Jane. Operating along the same lines as Sex and the City before it shopped itself to death, The Bold Type prides itself on its vision of female solidarity and feminist principles. “Joan Didion walked through this very same lobby once,” squeals Jane, stopping to take a selfie. Typical Scarlet features include: how to talk to your gynaecologist (“Don’t call it your punani”), how to stalk your ex-boyfriend without social media, rising female political stars and assorted sex confessionals. According to Kat, the magazine practises “stealth feminism … It’s no longer how to please your man or woman in bed. It’s how to please yourself.” This is an office where employees sneak into the fashion stock room to spill their secrets over bottles of wine, and features are written, edited and posted online in less time than it takes their authors’ nails to dry. Editor-in-chief is Jacqueline (Melora Hardin), whose dedication to designer heels means she looks a million dollars but walks as if she’s just peed her pants. Her character is modelled on the former Cosmo editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, who just happens to be executive producer. Accordingly, she’s creative, clever, beautiful, on first name terms with her entire team, and happy to coach her junior writers in being true to themselves. Jacqueline isn’t merely a magazine editor; she’s an actual saint. Of course, The Bold Type isn’t solely about the cut and thrust of magazine publishing; it’s about the lives of three young women and all the messiness that entails. But messy is the wrong word. Despite subsisting on a salary that barely keeps them in green juice, the trio’s clothing outlay could match the annual turnover of Bloomingdale’s. Meanwhile, their lustrous hair and glowing complexions suggest long spa weekends spent having their T-zones titivated by Aphrodite herself. Jane, Kat and Sutton are likable enough; it’s just that their unattainable hotness stretches credulity. In the immortal words of Carrie Fisher in When Harry Met Sally: “Thin. Pretty. Big tits. Your basic nightmare.” In fairness, the camaraderie feels genuine: these women look out for each other in a way the privileged, self-seeking heroines of Sex and the City couldn’t conceive of. But would it be too much to ask that the rest – the swanky office, the daft clothes, the tourist-brochure version of New York – weren’t pure fantasy? I’m not asking for Loachian realism, but show me these women in tracky bottoms weeping over their stiletto-induced bunions and The Bold Type could count on my subscription."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/04/wikie-the-talking-whale-good-audience-stewart-lee","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"How I became the king of cetacean comedy | Stewart Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/04/wikie-the-talking-whale-good-audience-stewart-lee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/04/wikie-the-talking-whale-good-audience-stewart-lee","fields":{"headline":"How I became the king of cetacean comedy","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On my way to pick up fresh cat litter in the car on Wednesday, I suddenly heard the following snippet of radio news: “A hulking and senseless creature, driven only by instinct and self-interest, has nonetheless learned to emit recognisable human words through its blowhole.” But I am sick of hearing about Boris Johnson all the time and quickly turned the radio off. When will people realise that it’s only by denying this lying Brexit oaf the oxygen of publicity that we can finally stem the flow of falsehood that seems to stream endlessly from his filthy blowhole, day after day after day? Back at home I realised LBC’s Nick Ferrari hadn’t been describing Boris Johnson at all, or even himself, but was in fact announcing the arrival on the world stage of Wikie, a sentient and apparently communicative killer whale, living in a French theme park. “Hello,” he says, and “one, two, three.” Oddly, despite being in France, the whale appears to have chosen to communicate in English, observing current EU negotiating protocol. Doubtless all European cetaceans will revert to their original regional dialects when our glorious independence from those Brussels bureaucrat fat cats is finally enacted, unless the traitors triumph. (Remember, though, we will have only our independent British selves to blame if, having capsized a catamaran off the Belgian coast, we are unable to convince local dolphins to tow us to safety, lacking the now requisite Flemish or Walloon.) I have often suspected the cetacean community could understand us a lot better than they let on. In 1993, I began writing my first solo standup hour in the splendid isolation of a remote peat cutter’s bothy on the Isle of Lewis, not far from the Callanish III standing stones, where Ultravox filmed the video to their 1984 single, One Small Day. I had become fixated on the idea that although critics assumed standup audiences were laughing at an alternative comedian’s subject material – farts, periods, Thatcher etc – what was more profound was the extent to which they were actually subconsciously affected by changes in a comedian’s speech rhythms, which subtly tickled the laughter out of them, irrespective of content. (If you’ve ever seen my standup act live and wondered why you found it quite so exciting, well, let me enlighten you. You, dear reader, have a subliminal awareness of how most comedy follows the regular rhythms drilled into us as foetuses by the beating of our mothers’ hearts. My own punchlines and asides, thrillingly, are falling just outside the beats where they might be expected to land, in the style of pioneering free jazz percussionists like Sunny Murray, Tony Oxley and Ronnie Verrell.) But, I wondered, would an audience of sentient, but not culturally literate, beings appreciate this strategy? I rowed out on to the midnight Minch and emptied a bucket of fish into the choppy waves to attract the dolphins, who soon gathered around my boat, already a more appreciative audience than can be found in, say, the entire city of Carlisle. Through a purloined megaphone I performed two routines to the attentive sea creatures; the first a long story of being visited repeatedly by Jehovah’s Witnesses, which relied on the audience knowing who both the actor Robert Powell and the proto-grunge band the Jesus Lizard were; the second a shambling improvisation around a poster of a kitten playing the piano, the actual words largely irrelevant, the humour derived essentially from micro-managed tonal and rhythmical shifts. Needless to say, the patient cetaceans were left cold by the first bit, but clapped their flippers and clacked their tongues enthusiastically to the second, just as an audience of Scots at the Edinburgh fringe were to do the following summer, where, typically, I was overlooked for the main award as usual. Never mind. In the world of the dolphins I was a player. It is the killer whale, however, which has always been my favourite cetacean, ever since an ill-advisedly youthful exposure, at the age of nine, to Dino De Laurentiis’s violent and horrific eco-thriller Orca: The Killer Whale. I duly noted that the pornographic elements of Arthur Herzog’s source novel, which I had already read, were absent from the screen adaptation, but this was more than made up for by Richard Harris’s unexpectedly brilliant portrayal of a drunken Irish fisherman, surely a high-water mark in a career characterised by impossible and unpredictable versatility. By Wednesday night on the day of the whale revelation, I was on a train to France, arriving at the animal park where Wikie was held at around 3am and soon scaling the typically weak French fence. I flopped on to the concrete by the side of his silent pool, my shadow cast against a bank of seating by a lone security spotlight, and suddenly the whale’s great black-and-white head rose from the water to greet me. “You,” the whale Wikie intoned, the syllable echoing from his cavernous blowhole, “your Jehovah’s Witness routine was cheap shit, but your kitten playing the piano bit is still spoken of with reverence in the cetacean community. In the language of the cetaceans, you are called He Who Laughs At Kittens, or Ikky Ikky Ak Ak Bwaaa Auuuuuuk Ka Ka Ka Eeee Eeee Eee Pweeeee Pweeee Pweeeee Urk Urk Fweeeeeeeeeee.” “You can speak,” I whispered in awed reverence. “And I think you always could. Has the proliferation of plastics finally forced you to break your silence? You could all speak, and understand us, all along, couldn’t you? Why did you never say anything before?” “Because,” replied the whale, after a thoughtful pause, “up until fairly recently, everything has been quite satisfactory. Now, if you please, the kitten piano bit.” I got up, stood before the enormous sentience and began.

Under the law, which came into force on Thursday, practitioners are not allowed to carry out or arrange intimate piercings including to the tongue and breasts on anyone under 18. Ears, noses, navels and eyebrows are not covered by the ban. Wales is the first UK country to introduce such a law and those breaking it face prosecution and an unlimited fine. Local authorities are the primary enforcement bodies but police may also be involved. The Labour-controlled government said that as well as posing a potential health risk, intimate piercing could place young people in a vulnerable position. It argued that because children continued to grow during their teenage years, an intimate piercing performed at a young age could result in complications as their bodies developed. Young people might also be less likely to have the experience or knowledge of how to clean or maintain an intimate piercing, leading to an increased risk of infection, it said. During a visit to Frontier tattoo parlour in Cardiff to discuss the law, the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, said it was about protecting young people’s health and wellbeing. “It’s concerning that a third of young people with intimate piercings have reported complications following a procedure. The child protection issues that could also arise from this scenario highlight even further the importance of implementing such a law,” he said. “I hope this piece of legislation will help to reduce these issues, and that practitioners understand the importance of obtaining proof of age beforehand.” One risk of the ban is that intimate piercing could be driven underground and carried out in people’s homes rather than licensed premises. But health officials insisted it was a positive move. At Frontier, customers are charged £20 for a nose piercing, £25 for a nipple (or £40 for two) and £50 for a female genital piercing. The chief dental officer for Wales, Dr Colette Bridgman, raised concerns about tongue piercing. “It can lead to lasting damage to teeth and gums, and can cause serious swelling in the mouth that can affect breathing. Many dentists in Wales have seen patients who have permanent harm following piercing, and dental teams in Wales really welcome this new law.” Police officers and council officials have been trained in how to enforce the law and piercing practitioners have been advised to set up systems to help confirm proof of age, and to obtain signed consent. As well as the tongue and breasts, the ban, under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017, includes eight areas around the genitals and buttocks. The Welsh government flagged up a study that found complications were reported in more than a quarter of body piercings for individuals aged 16-24. It revealed a higher incidence of complications in connection with certain types of piercings, including intimate ones. Problems were most likely to be reported in tongue piercings (50%), followed by genitals (45%) and nipples (38%). Some local authorities in London and Scotland have imposed restrictions on intimate piercings but the Welsh government is the first to impose a nationwide ban. Despite criticism from the UK government over its record on health, which is devolved, the Welsh Labour government has introduced some eye-catching health measures such as bringing in a “deemed consent” organ transplant system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/02/awful-lot-distress-cornelia-parkers-general-election-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T22:30:04Z","webTitle":"'An awful lot of distress': Cornelia Parker's election art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/awful-lot-distress-cornelia-parkers-general-election-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/awful-lot-distress-cornelia-parkers-general-election-art","fields":{"headline":"'An awful lot of distress': Cornelia Parker's election art","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The artist Cornelia Parker has, over her career, crushed a collection of silver artefacts with a steamroller; had the British army blow up a garden shed; wrapped Rodin’s The Kiss in miles of string; and collected dust and fibres from Sigmund Freud’s couch. What, then, would she make of the 2017 general election, for which she was the official artist? She was tempted, she said in Westminster this week, to play on the idea of a hung parliament – perhaps some kind of perilously “teetering sculpture”. But in the end, she felt she could not do otherwise than represent the voices – often anxious, fearful, or angry – of the people she had encountered during her time observing the election campaign. “I was bombarded by so much emotion and visual information I had to have sound, and sensation,” she said. The works, which go on public display in Westminster Hall from Monday, consist of two films and a series of photographs. The shorter of the two films, Election Abstract, acts as a kind of journal of Parker’s experiences, whether watching the Ukip manifesto launch, attending a pro-NHS rally or simply seeing the world around her refracted through the lens of the snap election. Many of the images had a first life on Instagram. “My iPhone has always been my sketchbook,” she said. During the campaign she became an “unofficial member of the press pack”, attending, for example, the leader debates in Scotland and Northern Ireland. But she also simply recorded the world around her: “Everything I pointed my camera at seemed to have a political tinge – rubbish on the street, even my cat facing right or facing left,” she said. After attending the Conservative manifesto launch, for example, she wandered into a chapel in Halifax and was struck by the poignancy of an inscription reading “Remember the poor” – an image that appears in the film. “It is a condensation of all the things that I witnessed and all the feelings I had,” she added. “And a lot of the feelings I had were provoked by the fact that there was an awful lot of distress in the country.” The frantic, speeded-up mood of the work reflects the fraught atmosphere of the campaign, bookended as it was by terrorist attacks in Manchester and London, and the Grenfell Tower disaster. The other film, Left, Right and Centre, has a gothic, elegiac edge. Filmed in the chamber of the House of Commons at night, it shows that room, usually seen bursting with combative argument, as empty and ghostly. Newspapers, piled up on the central table and over the dispatch boxes, are gradually disturbed by the movement of a drone as it flies through the chamber. Eventually they are blown on to the benches and floor. Headlines – “May to Win by a Landslide,” for example – become briefly visible, just as soon to be replaced by, say, a Sun Page 3 model. The 14 photographs – selected from the thousands she took from 1 May, when she started the role, to the election’s aftermath in June – are records of moods or moments. One shows a homeless man sleeping in a doorway; another a press photographer trying to look through the letterbox of Chatham House where, at the time, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was speaking. And one pinpoints the moment of the election that many will remember above all. It is an image of a phone screen, shot at the Sunderland count at 10.17pm on the evening of 8 June. On its screen are the words: “EXIT POLL – HOLY SHIT!!!!” Since the 2001 election, the speaker’s advisory committee on works of art, currently chaired by the Labour MP Alison McGovern, has appointed an official election artist. Parker was the first woman to take the role, following other artists including Adam Dant and Jonathan Yeo. Parker’s works will become part of the parliamentary art collection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/04/pop-star-cookbook-kelis-sheryl-crow-grizzly-bear","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-04T15:00:30Z","webTitle":"Should you cook with Coolio, Sheryl Crow or Kelis?

I tried pop star recipe books (so you don't have to)","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The photographer from the Guardian is wearing a curious expression, in which a slightly strained smile does its best to conceal a look of disappointment. It is unmistakably the face of a woman attempting to spare someone’s feelings by pretending to enjoy a black bean quesadilla that she really isn’t enjoying much. “No, it’s nice,” she says, clearly in no great rush to eat any more. Besides, I know it isn’t nice, because I’ve tried one myself. The filling has a bizarre texture: somehow crumbly and claggy at the same time. The reason I’m cooking black bean quesadillas while a Guardian photographer looks on is because they come with a recommendation from acclaimed Canadian singer-songwriter Leslie Feist. They are one of the recipes in a book she co-authored with chef Adrienne Amato called Pleasures, which details what Feist and her band ate during the making of her 2017 album of the same name. Every track on it has a lunch, dinner and dessert attached to it. And the reason I’m cooking a recipe from Pleasures is because I’m investigating cookbooks written by rock and pop stars. There has been a constant stream of them over the last few years. Rappers, cerebral indie musicians, country music legends and R&amp;B divas alike have felt impelled to share their culinary secrets with the world. What can a music fan and cook of limited abilities learn from them? The first thing is that their authors have quite a mix of cooking abilities. They range from artists who have trained as chefs – R&amp;B star Kelis is a graduate of the prestigious Cordon Bleu cookery school – to artists who have buddied up with chefs to co-write their books, to artists whose interest seems slightly questionable. Something about the cover of Cookin’ with Coolio – a badly-Photoshopped shot of the rapper apparently flambéing bacon and eggs – which even I know is probably not the best technique – suggests that his enthusiasm for the kitchen might have more to do with prolonging his reality TV career than a lifelong passion for cuisine. There are books that claim they’ll improve your wellbeing (Sheryl Crow’s If it Makes You Healthy) and books that look like they could kill you. Rapper Action Bronson’s Fuck, That’s Delicious is by some distance the best-written and most entertaining pop cookbook I come across, bursting with knowledge and enthusiasm. But its author is visibly not a man at home to the ascetic health-giving delights of, say, Crow’s brown basmati rice with soy-sage sausage. Put it this way, there’s a photo of him in Japan, shirtless beside some sumo wrestlers and by comparison, the sumo wrestlers look like the “after” photo in a Special K advert. His recipe for “a butcher sandwich the way a guy like me would eat it” contains half a pound of rib-eye steak and involves both buttering the bread and frying it in steak fat, his method for making “the chicken of all fucking chickens” requires three litres of oil, one of his “incredible pairings” reads simply “ten tubs of ice cream and depression”. Keen to avoid both a physique like Action Bronson’s and/or a visit to the cardiology department, I opt to cook something a little lighter. He claims his two-minute tomato sauce is “the best I ever had”. It’s certainly easy to make – garlic, chillies, basil, tinned tomatoes, salt and pepper – and the end result is fine. If it doesn’t quite live up to its advance billing, perhaps that’s something to do with rappers’ inbuilt capacity for braggadocio. That said, for the purposes of comparison, I make Frank Sinatra’s marinara sauce, from The Sinatra Celebrity Cookbook, and it’s definitely an improvement on that; more garlicky, more flavoursome. Action Bronson 1, Chairman of the Board 0. I confess to abandoning two of the books without cooking anything from them. I just don’t buy Coolio as a gourmet. There’s no USP to the book, beyond a load of really boring recipes spiced up with the odd “mofo” and “pimpin’” in the method descriptions. Loretta Lynn’s 2006 work You’re Cookin’ it Country, meanwhile, deals in a specific kind of old-fashioned, downhome US cooking that either involves ingredients I can’t find – hominy, catfish – or just sounds, to put it politely, not to my taste. There’s a lot of making casseroles by pouring cream of mushroom soup over minced beef or tinned tuna, and some dewy-eyed reminiscences of Lynn’s childhood in rural Kentucky that make mince floating about in mushroom soup seem like haute cuisine: “Possum is a different-tasting meat, but Daddy loved it.” I approach Feist’s book with caution, partly because when I open it I’m confronted by a recipe that involves a soup containing halloumi cheese – I love halloumi, but boiling it in soup seems so wrong – and partly because many of the meals are vegan, and veganism and I have previous. I tried a plant-based diet last year, lured by its health benefits, and abandoned it almost immediately, after an ill-starred dalliance with the cookbooks of blogger Deliciously Ella. The taste of one of her dishes in particular, involving roast sweet potato and tahini-dressed avocado, haunted me for weeks. Every time I thought of it, I went off the idea of eating full stop. Keen to avoid a rerun, I opt for the black bean quesadillas in the hope that Mexican spicing will override the lack of dairy. They are easy enough to knock together, and the song that was apparently recorded fuelled by them – Lost Dreams – is lovely, but the end result is about as far away from the unctuousness of a non-vegan quesadilla as you can get: the only lubrication suggested for the mashed black bean filling is a spritz of lime juice. I have better luck on the vegan front the following day, with a recipe from Sheryl Crow’s book written by the singer and her chef Chuck White after she beat breast cancer. The book is filled with radiant testimony to the antioxidant and immune-system-boosting qualities of the meals within and, less lovably, terrible posed photos of the singer smiling broadly while stirring saucepans and chopping salad. I make the hot and sour miso soup with tofu and bok choi considerably less healthy by frying the tofu rather than boiling it and slathering it with sriracha. The result is good, a decent midweek supper. More successful still is Kelis’s recipe for butternut squash soup. My Life on a Plate is a genuinely interesting cookbook. If I don’t like the look of everything in it (Cordon Bleu-trained chef or not, I cannot countenance her idea of carrot and yam soufflé topped with melted marshmallows), there are a lot of intriguing recipes from Puerto Rico and Colombia, whose food I know next to nothing about. Still, I opt for something more familiar, better suiting my limited culinary skills. The soup is a doddle to make, heavy on the herbs, and the raisin garnish I initially balk at adding is actually really good. But I have my greatest success with Twenty Dinners, a book co-authored by Chris Taylor, bass player with Brooklyn art-rockers Grizzly Bear, whose passion for food led him to intern at London’s celebrated St John restaurant. As befits Grizzly Bear’s faintly cerebral image, some of it is very chef-y – a distant world of dishes involving raw scallops and lavender-infused olive-oil poached cod. But there’s less complex stuff too. Even I can manage the slow-roasted lamb, which involves nothing more complex than poking the meat with garlic, rosemary and anchovies and sticking it in the oven. While it’s cooking, I think about what the preponderance of rock and pop cookbooks might tell you about music itself. A cynic would say it tells you something about musicians looking for new revenue streams in a world of declining sales (although the Feist book benefits charity). But there may be something deeper there, about how our perception of rock and pop has changed over the years. Perhaps it’s become less subversive, cosier, populated not by remote, spectacular, otherworldly figures, but people we like to think of as just like us. There was a time when a rock star would be the last person you’d call on for cookery advice. Think of almost any old-school pop legend – from David Bowie to Sly Stone to the Clash – and ask yourself: is this someone who looks like they’ve spent a lot of time perfecting their recipe for lemon-vanilla panna cotta with a basil-apricot compote? Certainly, those who decry rock music’s loss of edge might find something to wail about in Feist’s description of the sessions for her last album: “When the amps were turned off and the moon lit up the bay below us, we’d share a pot of rooibos tea and compare notes on our day’s work,” she writes. But it also tells you something about how our attitude to cooking has changed. The earliest book in my selection is the Sinatra one, which speaks loud and long about an era before Nigella and Jamie, before Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential, before superstar chefs were photographed looking like, well, rock stars. The contributors are all of advanced years, the meals are either old-fashioned stodge or the province of stuffy formal dinner parties, the male stars who have contributed all write about cooking in a way that suggests they only ever go near a kitchen if their wife is ill. It seems a different world entirely from that depicted in Twenty Dinners, a book that couldn’t be hipper, or rather more hipster-ish, if it tried. You’re never far from a photo of a vinyl collection on some distressed furniture, or an informal lunch party filled with 20- and early 30-somethings with backwoodsman beards and subtly arty tattoos. Perhaps these days, a musician knowing how to cook lavender-infused olive oil-poached cod carries a similar air of rarified cool as knowing about obscure music or literature or art did in the past. Perhaps interning at St John is a latterday equivalent of hanging out with a beat writer or Andy Warhol. Or perhaps I’m overthinking it. Either way, the slow-roast lamb is a minor triumph. I can’t be bothered with the suggested accompaniment, which involves something I’ve never heard of called rutabaga, but I dish it up with salad, and it’s still a hit; moist, delicious and as good an argument for rock musicians writing cookbooks as any.

Charlie studied demand and identified patterns, especially in foreign sports news that was not being reported in the UK and which he thought might interest his readers. The more outlandish, quirky, funny or tongue-in-cheek the story the better. Charlie had a real knack for knowing what readers wanted, not least because he was a sports enthusiast himself, a huge Chelsea fan with a tremendous knowledge of football, says his brother Joe. Charlie was born in Chichester, West Sussex, son of Andrew Golder, a singer and narrator, and Lucy Strachan, a librarian. While he was still a child, the family moved to Thiviers, a small town in south-western France, where Charlie went to school. As well as sport, he loved wildlife and music. He learned the oboe at the age of seven, and later played acoustic, electric and bass guitars. He was 15 when he was diagnosed with the rare and potentially fatal Pompe disease, which wastes the muscles and the heart. This required fortnightly intravenous treatment for the rest of his life, but that did not stop Charlie from obtaining a first degree and then a master’s in linguistics from Nottingham Trent University. He then moved to Vienna where he became fluent in German, obtained a teaching diploma, and worked at the University of Vienna’s Language Centre, before realising his dream of living in Japan. He had taught himself Mandarin Chinese and Japanese as a child, and had a lifelong fascination with Japanese culture. In 2014, Charlie was given the all-clear after treatment for a tumour behind his nose, and immediately started a full-time job with the Central European News (CEN) agency, rising rapidly to be chief subeditor. He met his soulmate Benedetta Tamburini at a party, and enjoyed life. With CEN’s approval, in 2017 he hived off its sports coverage into Golder’s News and Sports. In December 2016 Charlie was told the cancer had returned, and was metastatic and very aggressive. He was in constant pain but continued to keep an eye on articles from his hospital bed. I met Charlie’s family 15 years ago. Like everyone he came across, I was immensely impressed by his positive attitude, charm, sense of humour and, later, his will to live against odds that would have defeated many people long before. He never complained. He is survived by his parents and his siblings, Joe, Luke, Georgi and Anaïs. Joe will take over the sports news agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/31/larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-sentencing-hearing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T18:58:35Z","webTitle":"2004 Larry Nassar investigation dropped after doctor's PowerPoint presentation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-sentencing-hearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/larry-nassar-sexual-abuse-sentencing-hearing","fields":{"headline":"2004 Larry Nassar investigation dropped after doctor's PowerPoint presentation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police dropped an investigation into disgraced former gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar in 2004 after he told them he was conducting legitimate medical treatment, according to documents released on Wednesday. Brianne Randall-Gay was 17 when she was treated for scoliosis by Nassar, who massaged her breasts and attempted to put his fingers in her vagina. Randall-Gay’s mother subsequently complained to Meridian Township police department. However, Nassar said the treatment was part of “a medical technique known as Sacrotuberous Ligament Release” and gave police a PowerPoint presentation on the subject. Police decided not to send the case to prosectors as they accepted Nassar’s explanation. It would be more than a decade until Nassar was brought to justice, during which time he abused dozens of female athletes under the guise of medical treatment. “We missed it,” Meridian Township’s manager, Frank Walsh, said on Wednesday. “We’re not going to hide it. We were deceived.” The release of the documents came as Nassar appeared on Wednesday in a Michigan courtroom for the start of his final sentencing hearing, and a judge said that a total of 265 people have come forward to declare that they were abused. That number included the 150-plus victims who offered statements at a different hearing last week, as well as scores of new ones who are expected to speak over the next several days. Nassar, the disgraced former gymnastics doctor, faces another prison sentence – his third – for molesting gymnasts at an elite Michigan club run by an Olympic coach. “You took advantage of my innocence and trust,” 17-year-old Jessica Thomashow told Nassar, who sat at the defense table with his lawyers. “You were my doctor. Why? I ask myself that question all the time. What you did to me was twisted. You manipulated me and my entire family. How dare you.” Judge Janice Cunningham has set aside several days for more than 60 women and girls who want to confront Nassar or have their statement read in court. The hearing could unfold much the same as last week’s proceedings in another county. That hearing ended with Nassar getting to 40 to 175 years in prison, a sentence that judge described as Nassar’s “death warrant”. Annie Labrie said what Nassar did to her made her “skin crawl”, but every adult around her assured her he was the only option, and she hid the abuse from her parents. She said it was imperative for society to understand Nassar’s pedophilia was not an isolated incident, and gymnastics and gyms like Twistars have a “specific culture” that allows people like him to flourish. The practice of allowing accusers to speak even if they are not tied directly to a case has raised questions about fairness. But attorneys say the victim statements probably pose little risk on appeal, especially since Nassar pleaded guilty, agreed to allow the statements and is expected to get another long prison sentence as part of his deal with prosecutors. “If you get what you bargained for, then you really can’t argue that you were prejudiced in any way,” said Margaret Raben, former leader of a Michigan association of criminal defense attorneys. It’s not uncommon for prosecutors to introduce “aggravating” evidence at sentencing to support their request for a severe punishment. But a parade of victims offering emotional accounts of their abuse to the face of an abuser goes beyond the typical hearing. Raben said there was a “horrible dynamic” last week in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina’s courtroom, even if the judge had the option to allow so many people to speak in a case that involved just seven victims. “Her obvious delight was just off the wall,” Raben said, referring to Aquilina’s “death warrant” remark and others. “I am not defending Larry Nassar at all, but what I saw with her was a real abandonment of judicial demeanor … The process doesn’t change because everybody hates the defendant. That is the absolute glory, or should be, of the American justice system.” A fellow Ingham County judge, William Collette, said Aquilina’s handling of the hearing was “outrageous”. Others, however, have praised her treatment of victims and their parents. The case on Cunningham’s docket on Wednesday in Eaton County centers on Nassar’s assaults at Twistars, a Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert. Nassar admits penetrating three girls with his hands when he was supposed to be treating them for injuries. So far, 65 victims want to speak in court or submit statements. Attorney Mick Grewal said 11 of his clients have signed up, including some who were inspired by the 150-plus young women and girls who appeared in Aquilina’s court. He called it a “cathartic experience”. “Now they’re at a point in their healing process where they want to confront Larry, and they want to show the world that they are survivors and they are strong and they are part of this movement,” Grewal said. “It helps them through the healing process.” He said the Nassar cases are extraordinary in the number of victims who have come forward. “The only case that’s out there that’s even similar in stature is Penn State, and this is now six times as big as Penn State, maybe seven times,” Grewal said, referring to boys who said they were sexually abused by assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/cornelia-parker-when-a-deadline-looms-you-have-to-come-up-with-the-goods","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-17T08:00:52Z","webTitle":"Cornelia Parker: ‘When a deadline looms, you have to come up with the goods’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/cornelia-parker-when-a-deadline-looms-you-have-to-come-up-with-the-goods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/17/cornelia-parker-when-a-deadline-looms-you-have-to-come-up-with-the-goods","fields":{"headline":"Cornelia Parker: ‘When a deadline looms, you have to come up with the goods’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sleep I need eight hours of sleep, but I never get it, except at weekends. I have anxiety dreams, usually about putting up an exhibition and not having the work. Sometimes work comes to me in a dream. You can be gnawing away at something for months, years even, and suddenly wake up and it gels. I do 10 minutes of Pilates every morning, if I’m in the mood.

Since I had Lily, 16 years ago, my place in the kitchen has been taken by my husband [the artist Jeff McMillan]. We have an evening family meal, anything from risotto to polenta to sausages, and I have a glass of wine. I did an exclusion diet last year; gluten makes me feel sick. Work My routine is disparate. I am trying to juggle projects, and people ask me to be a patron or contribute to charity auctions; I get one or two requests a day. A lot of what I do isn’t studio-oriented – making a film, curating, working long-distance – so all parts of my brain are needed. When a deadline looms, you have to come up with the goods. As you get older, that pressure becomes demanding. Family My parents were always doubtful about my making a living as an artist. Even when I was up for the Turner prize, my mum suggested I apply for a curator’s job. We were a little nonplussed when Lily dropped A-level art for art history, but it has freed her up. We used to have to drag her to exhibitions, but she is much more keen now. Fun I love antiques and food markets. I used to swim every Sunday, but I bailed out because of a recent knee operation.

There were some really heartwarming moments. Some amazing people were there in the gallery.” Colbert then listed some of them, including Congressman Steve Scalise, who was shot last June, and police officer Ryan Holets, who adopted a child born to a heroin addict. “Honestly some of the most beautiful, impressive Americans you can imagine,” the host said. “And the president was there too.” Colbert noted how Trump began with a message to those still suffering from the aftermath of recent natural disasters. “To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together,” Trump said. “That is going to be a comforting message to the people of Puerto Rico once they have electricity to turn on their TVs,” Colbert shot back. The host also showed a clip of the parts of the address intended to inspire, including one in which Trump said: “If there is a mountain, we climb it; if there is a frontier, we cross it; if there is an opportunity, we seize it.” Colbert, impersonating the president, replied: “If there is a burger, we eat it. If there is a porn star, we bone it. If there is an immigrant, we deport it. If there is an investigation, we undermine it.” Trevor Noah also reacted to the address, “which started,” the host said, in reference to the GOP’s tax legislation which Trump called the biggest cut in history, “with Donald Trump praising himself for the one thing he actually got done this year.” “Needless to say, like most of Trump’s biggest things, these tax cuts were not in fact the biggest tax cuts in American history,” the host explained. “This is a lie. It’s nowhere near it. But this wasn’t a night for facts. If you came here for facts, you came here for the wrong thing.” “Tonight was all about celebrating President Trump,” Noah continued. “And he was in such a good mood that he even reached across the aisle, and not just to grope someone, but to try and get things done. “Working together sounds beautiful, but almost every single time Democrats and Republicans have managed to agree on an idea, Trump has come back from the golf course just in time to screw it up,” he explained. “He did it on immigration, Obamacare, but again, I’m getting caught up on the facts. Tonight’s not about the facts.” Noah showed a clip of the president vouching for a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers, but also an end to what he calls “chain migration” and to the visa lottery system. “Although earlier in his speech, Trump talked about finding common ground on immigration reform, what he was really saying was ‘I’ll give you the Dreamers and then we shut everything else down,” Noah said. “Basically: Dreamers, close the door behind you.” Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who Trump reportedly paid off to keep silent about their affair. “I know Trump supporters are upset about us booking Stormy Daniels on the show,” he began. “They say it’s disrespectful to the president and I get that, I guess.” “But let’s jump in the time machine to go back to October of 2016, to the presidential debate in St Louis, Missouri, when then-candidate Donald Jennifer Trump showed up at Washington University two hours before the debate with three women who accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior,” Kimmel responded fiercely. “He live-streamed a press conference with those women and then sat them in the audience for the debate in the front row so they could be directly in the eye-line of Bill Clinton’s wife, Hillary.” “So for those of you whose magical thinking allows them to say it’s disrespectful for me to have Stormy Daniels on the show, I give you exhibit A,” the host said, showing a photo from the Washington University debate before discussing Trump’s address. “The speech comes at a difficult time for the president,” said Kimmel. “His approval rating is below 40% and that was before his speech preempted a new episode of This is Us.” Kimmel then discussed reports that Melania Trump was unhappy with her husband over the Stormy Daniels story, which caused her to cancel her trip to Davos. “If there was any question about the first lady’s enthusiasm for her husband, she put those rumors to rest tonight,” Kimmel quipped, showing Melania applauding unenthusiastically during her husband’s speech. “That was Melania wearing a tasteful white pantsuit in tribute to the president she voted for.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/das-rheingold-review-jurowski-lpo-royal-festival-hall-ring-cycle","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T11:20:39Z","webTitle":"Das Rheingold review – superb Jurowski hits awesome anvils","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/das-rheingold-review-jurowski-lpo-royal-festival-hall-ring-cycle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/das-rheingold-review-jurowski-lpo-royal-festival-hall-ring-cycle","fields":{"headline":"Das Rheingold review – superb Jurowski hits awesome anvils","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Jurowski became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic just over 10 years ago and celebrated the anniversary with a semi-staging of Wagner’s Das Rheingold. The concert also marked the start of his first Ring Cycle, in which he will present one opera a year until 2021. Jurowski is no stranger to Wagner: his Glyndebourne performances, also with the LPO, of Tristan und Isolde in 2009, and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg two years later, were notable interpretations for their dramatic insight and orchestral lucidity – qualities his Rheingold unquestionably shares. He has a fine understanding of the relationship between span and pace in Wagner: we’re continuously aware of the organic evolution of the whole and the narrative twists and psychological fluctuations within it. His conducting had great urgency but was never unduly swift, leaving space for the cumulative tensions to register and climactic moments to hit home. The LPO’s playing was often formidable in its detail and dramatic fire and there were numerous high points. The Rhinemaidens’ apostrophe to the gold – the final moment of joy before the work plunges towards catastrophe – swirled and danced. The descent to Nibelheim, complete with nine percussionists playing the anvils on the platform, generated a tremendous sense of awe and excitement. And the ambiguities of the closing pages, with their precarious triumph and bombast, were superbly captured and conveyed. Keenly aware of the demands Wagner places on his singers, Jurowski never allows his orchestra to swamp them. There were, however, some vocal anomalies, principally Matthias Goerne’s curious Wotan. This is a role he has already recorded, though here he used a score, which both set him apart from the rest of the cast, who sang from memory, and left him perilously adrift in a semi-staging that effectively took place around him and into which he was never fully integrated. His voice, with its dark, burnished tone is unquestionably beautiful, and his sense of line continues to impress. But for a singer usually noted for intensity, he seemed cool and detached. There were considerable compensations. Robert Hayward, himself a fine Wotan for ENO some years ago, sang his first Alberich in a performance of committed ferocity shot through with malign humour and keeping us just the right side of empathy, even as he becomes ever more despotic and monstrous. Brindley Sherratt and Matthew Rose were similarly excellent as Fafner and Fasolt: Sherratt, baleful in tone and scarily duplicitous, was an ideal foil for Rose, who was sonorous and deeply touching in his fondness for Lyubov Petrova’s Freia. Vsevolod Grivnov, meanwhile, made a nicely acerbic Loge, withering in his scorn. Michelle DeYoung’s Fricka and Anna Larsson’s Erda were perhaps less successful: Larsson has been in better voice: DeYoung admirably captured Fricka’s hauteur, though her diction was at times occluded. Allan Clayton and Stephen Gadd were luxury casting as Froh and Donner. Adrian Thompson made a suitably funny, obsequious Mime, and the voices of the three Rhinemaidens – Sofia Fomina, Rowan Hellier and Lucie Špičková – blended together beautifully in their trios. Ultimately, though, the evening belonged to Jurowski and his orchestra, who were simply outstanding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/28/salford-block-residents-must-pay-fire-wardens-grenfell","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T10:04:44Z","webTitle":"Salford block residents must pay £100,000 for fire wardens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/28/salford-block-residents-must-pay-fire-wardens-grenfell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/28/salford-block-residents-must-pay-fire-wardens-grenfell","fields":{"headline":"Salford block residents must pay £100,000 for fire wardens","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Residents in an upmarket apartment block with cladding similar to Grenfell Tower have been told they must foot a £100,000 bill for fire wardens. Leaseholders said they feared they would no longer be able to afford to live in the new-build Fresh building in Salford following a court ruling on Friday. A tribunal judge ruled in favour of the freeholder E&amp;J Estates, owned by the property tycoon James Tuttiett, to enforce the charges to pay for interim fire wardens. The ruling, which could affect leaseholders across Britain, came after cladding on the Fresh building was found to be unsafe following the Grenfell fire. Some of the more than 120 residents in the Fresh building said their service charges would triple after the ruling, meaning they may be forced to move. Matthew Crisp, 29, said his service charge had increased from £125 to £360 a month to pay for the interim fire marshals. “I’m worried this now sets a precedent for us to foot the bill for the cladding too, and that’s devastating, as I don’t know if I’ll be able to continue living in my home,” he told Manchester Evening News. “If I have to keep paying this, it’s going to change my life. Most of my income will go on this. Ultimately, I don’t know if I’ll be able to carry on living here.” A spokesman for E&amp;J said: “These works are essential and urgent, but we absolutely recognise the significant cost to leaseholders. We will do everything we can to keep costs to a minimum, but the safety of the residents is our absolute priority. “We are now loaning short-term funds to the service charge account to help cover the additional costs currently being incurred, and we are working with a number of stakeholders to try to find a longer term solution to help leaseholders in meeting these costs.” Residents in the Fresh building are the latest to be hit with a large bill for fire safety works since Grenfell. Last week, residents in another upmarket apartment block in Manchester said they had been billed £175,000 for measures. Cladding stripped from their building had “non fire retardant” written on the back, it emerged. An spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Keeping people safe in their homes is paramount. We are clear we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential fire safety works to leaseholders. We are keeping the situation under review and will consider this judgment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/28/gui-minhai-us-calls-on-china-to-release-swedish-bookseller","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T03:23:37Z","webTitle":"Gui Minhai: US calls on China to release Swedish bookseller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/gui-minhai-us-calls-on-china-to-release-swedish-bookseller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/28/gui-minhai-us-calls-on-china-to-release-swedish-bookseller","fields":{"headline":"Gui Minhai: US calls on China to release Swedish bookseller","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The United States has called on Beijing to free the missing Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai after he was snatched last weekend by Chinese agents while travelling to Beijing with two European diplomats. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Washington was deeply concerned about the detention of Gui, 53, a Hong Kong-based publisher who specialised in often thinly sourced tabloid-style books about China’s leadership. Chinese agents are suspected of abducting Gui from his holiday home in Thailand in October 2015 during a roundup of booksellers – including one British citizen – with whom he had worked. The publisher, who was born in China but has been a Swedish citizen since 1992, subsequently resurfaced in mainland China where he was held in the eastern city of Ningbo and made what supporters said was a forced confession. Last autumn Gui had appeared close to release amid reports that he was “half-free” and living under surveillance. However, on 20 January he was taken for a second time, on this occasion while taking a train to Beijing with two Swedish diplomats. Gui’s current whereabouts are a mystery and China’s foreign ministry this week rebuffed calls for it to explain his detention. Nauer, the state department spokeswoman, said: “We call on Chinese authorities to explain the reasons and legal basis for Mr Gui’s arrest and detention, disclose his whereabouts, and allow him freedom of movement and the freedom to leave China.” Beijing has attempted to cast growing outrage over Gui’s treatment as a western media conspiracy to undermine China’s one-party political system. “The police are not obliged ... to please western media,” Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times, a Communist party tabloid, wrote on Twitter this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/29/daniel-arzani-towers-over-his-melbourne-city-team-mates","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Daniel Arzani towers over his Melbourne City team-mates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/29/daniel-arzani-towers-over-his-melbourne-city-team-mates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/29/daniel-arzani-towers-over-his-melbourne-city-team-mates","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Arzani towers over his Melbourne City team-mates","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the ball helplessly rolled out of bounds, Melbourne City’s Warren Joyce barked from the touchline, “That’s fuckin’ schoolboy stuff!” After his attempted dummy in City’s 5-0 win over Adelaide United, Daniel Arzani felt the wrath of his nearby coach, who then demanded the young attacker win possession back. It could seem small amid countless isolated moments over the course of a football match, but in context of City’s season, this moment was far from insignificant. Principally, Ryan Strain’s close defensive attention prior to the dummy showed just how much the 19-year-old is affecting his side’s ability to threaten the opposition. It is conceptually parallel to what is known as gravity in the NBA. In this era of pace-and-space basketball, reliable three-point shooters can stretch the floor and opposition defences in turn for their team-mates to capitalise upon. Though hard to quantify, it is an increasingly pivotal aspect of collective fluidity. In football, those who can consistently beat their defender in one-on-one scenarios create this gravity and it was evident in last December’s Clásico in Spain, when Mateo Kovačić stayed with Lionel Messi, seemingly preferring Ivan Rakitić to dribble up the pitch before Luis Suárez’s opening goal. It is no comparison in an individual sense, but the theory is the same – getting past his primary defender is Arzani’s strongest attribute, forcing the opposition to weigh their attention towards him and thus creating space for others. This fundamental facet in modern attack is what City have otherwise lacked under Joyce and where Arzani differs even further. He can beat his defender and distribute the ball from a standing start. Aside from his coolly taken penalty in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle on Thursday, Arzani’s dribbling ability was critical in City’s goals against Wellington, Adelaide and Perth. Left on an island for the opening 60 minutes, it also led to Ivan Vujica’s early substitution for the Jets. Despite the smaller sample size, the diminutive attacker is towering over his team-mates from a statistical standpoint. Having only played 335 out of an available 1,620 minutes, Arzani already leads City in successful dribbles (31), accounting for 17.3% of the team’s total of 179. The gulf when calculating per 90 minutes is gargantuan. Arzani’s successful dribble rate is 8.33 while the injured Nathaniel Atkinson is next best at 2.02. For key passes – passes directly leading to a shot – Arzani also leads the team at 2.15 with Luke Brattan second (1.64). Yet, the failed dummy attempt against Adelaide is important for another reason. With Strain aggressively applying pressure to Arzani, space had opened for Atkinson to overlap into and run towards goal unattended. Atkinson was on his heels however, and City lost possession. Although Arzani’s fluid response to Strain’s coverage was the right play in principle, he was condemned for “schoolboy stuff” due to the outcome. Joyce’s focus on outcomes is based on conservatism and defensive shape, meaning he started the season with Michael Jakobsen and Osama Malik – players who are arguably more natural at centre-back – in central midfield. Although City were able to dictate tempo without the ball against Sydney in December, their lack of penetration was exposed during respective four and three-game winless streaks, when they had to chase the result in the second half. Iacopo La Rocca’s injury, along with suspensions to Bart Schenkeveld and Malik, forced Brattan to return to central midfield from initially advanced positions, with Arzani only receiving minutes out of necessity. Ultimately, considering City’s personnel, he has been good enough to start throughout this season. For some, Arzani’s part in Newcastle’s opening goal on Thursday night could be seen as an affirmation of tactical naivety, or lack of game sense as Joyce put it. Still, his positives far outweigh the negatives in context of collective impact for City. Although the teenager is far from the finished article, when does a primary focus on what he can’t do – as opposed to what he can – become stifling? For Joyce, this question of balance could determine whether City have a legitimate chance for the ultimate outcome of silverware, or not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/28/australia-v-england-fifth-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T11:32:04Z","webTitle":"Australia v England: fifth one-day international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/28/australia-v-england-fifth-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/28/australia-v-england-fifth-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia v England: fifth one-day international – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So there we go; that’s another series done, with just the T20 left. We’ll be back for that, so join us then. Otherwise, thanks for your company and comments; enjoy the rest of your weekends. Read Vithushan Ehantharajah’s report here: It’s still very odd to contemplate the reality that England are good at one-day cricket, but good at one-day cricket England are. They’ve been far too good for Australia over the last few weeks, and as well as their first XI, their strength in depth is serious too. I said at half-time that this was a test for England, to see if their bowlers could defend a total that wasn’t quite there in the same way their batters can attack a total that’s more than there. And they rose to the challenge; their second-string pace attack rose to the challenge, as did their spinners and captain, who deployed his resources with typical expertise. This win, coming off a loss and coming from behind, will please him more than the other three, I’d venture. What a pleasure it is to see a young talent impose himself, to see him broadcast his attitude with freedom and joy. I like Tom Curran. 48.2 WICKET! Paine b Curran 34 (Australia all out 247) Curran has fifer, another beauty, full of length, zooming in, and far too good for Paine. He has phenomenal confidence, as you’d need with that Shelby barnet, and he’s backed it up with a terrific performance! 48.1 Curran has some useful forearms, and a yorker yields a dot. Very nicely done, 13 from 11 required. Let’s go ball-by ball, yeah. 48th over: Australia 247-9 ( Paine 34, Hazlewood 0) Target 260 Paine is going to have to go here, because he’s on strike, Curran is in the field, and Ball has the ball. But two dots open the over ... but then Paine makes room backing away and applies a perfect bottom-edge for four! And have a look! HE’S ONLY GONE AND TIMED A SIX OVER HIS SHOULDER! What a shot that is, a late move inside to flip a maximum! Should England have given Root a go? Kept Ball for the end, if they needed him? Paine then grabs a single, and Australia are back in charge! Australia require 13 runs from 12 balls. 47th over: Australia 236-9 ( Paine 23, Hazlewood 0) Target 260 Tell you what, Curran gets full value for his wickets, he’s got celebrations for weeks. His first delivery, from around, is too good for Hazlewood, who fences and misses, and the next two are dots. Australia require 24 runs from 18 balls. Curran loves pressure! In he charges and Zampa goes for something expansive but the only thing expanding are his stumps, middle bashed back and England are nearly there while Curran has four! 47th over: Australia 236-8 ( Paine 23, Zampa 11) Target 260 Back comes Curran, who will have to win this for England. He’s absolutely flying in, but Paine back-cuts his second delivery for one... Australia require 24 runs from 21 balls. 46th over: Australia 235-8 ( Paine 22, Zampa 11) Target 260 Well, Jake Ball. He’s back, he’s got the sphere, and Zampa takes a single with a baseball swing that loops up, but safe. Paine, though, knows what he’s doing and creams the next delivery for four to square leg, then backs it up with a single. This is breathless stuff! Australia require 25 runs from 24 balls. 45th over: Australia 228-8 ( Paine 16, Zampa 10) Target 260 One from the over makes for a very decent effort from David Willey. Australia require 32 runs from 30 balls. The ball pitched outside leg, and Zampa is retrieved! They go upstairs! 45th over: Australia 228-8 ( Paine 16, Zampa 10) Target 260 Joe Root is freeing his arms, grimacing after being nailed in the body when batting. Meantime Willey, back over the wicket, opens with three dots before Paine takes a single. Off goes Ball. Hopefully he’s ok, but suddenly England have some overs to make up; do they try and slide them in now, or try and finish the match now? It’s not quite clear whether Ball is injured or ill, but given how long this is taking to sort, my guess is the latter. There’s a meeting going on and I think he’s given a tablet of some sort. We’ve a break in play - Ball’s ankle buckled and he’s down, looking fair crook. 44th over: Australia 227-8 ( Paine 15, Zampa 10) Target 260 Ball returns, and looks to have hurt hisself as Zampa takes his second delivery for one to midwicket. Paine then eases backward of square on the off side and Ball grimaces some more. AND SOME MORE! Zampa cuts and Moeen runs past it, diddled by the spin on second bounce; gulled by his own bowling, he played for the one that went straight on. That’s the first boundary in time, two singles follow, and I think Australia are back favourites. What a game this is to break in the new ground! 43rd over: Australia 219-8 ( Paine 13, Zampa 4) Target 260 Morgan decides to keep Curran for the death instead of seeking to hasten the death, bringing back Willey. Paine guides two to point, where of course Hales is to collect as the crowd whoop. Another single to Zampa makes it four from the over, and the rate is now at 5.85; Australia won’t mind that, because they’ll back themselves to make up the shortfall with a boundary of three somewhere along the line. 42nd over: Australia 215-8 ( Paine 10, Zampa 3) Target 260 The attendance is 53,81; that’s not bad at all. Paine turns the ball into the leg side but sends Zampa back, then cuts two and nurdles one. And oh dear! Zampa goes over the top and picks out Hales, who moves in and drops exactly what he’s there to pouch! That is very naughty indeed and he thoroughly deserves the ball finding him next ball and the generous sympathies of the crowd which accompany it. 41st over: Australia 210-8 ( Paine 6, Zampa 2) Target 260 Curran races in and strikes Paine’s pad, racing off Stuart Broad-style. Not out says the umpire; no review says the captain. Paine then nudges a single, and when two dots follow suddenly the run rate is getting on top. Zampa turns a single to square leg, Paine adds one more to mid off, and this is boiling. 40th over: Australia 207-8 ( Paine 4, Zampa 1) Target 260 Zampa gets a single, then Paine flips over his shoulder for two and bunts one to keep strike. “Nice to see the hand of Morgan being recognised,” tweets William Hargreaves. “Captaincy ain’t just a twelfth player, it can go all the way up to fifteenth.” Agreed, he’s brilliant at this. I think ... I think ... I think England are going to win! Moeen pushes Tye back with a dart, he plays for the spin which doesn’t come, and a leading edge rears up to cover! 39th over: Australia 202-7 ( Paine 1, Tye 8) Target 260 Curran has four overs to go, and opens his latest one with a slower ball; he’s got all the tricks for this version. Tye is looking for big hits, which can only work for so long because Curran is swinging it and he’s going every time. And he catches one, hoicking a slower ball towards wide long-on; Bairstow is after it, but doesn’t pick it up so runs around it, and the lost time is crucial. He dives forward but is a split-second too late and they run two. Curran then responds with a jaffa, only for tow leg-byes to complete things. 38th over: Australia 198-7 ( Paine 1, Tye 6) Target 260 There’s not much batting after these two; can England break them up? Moeen returns, and his over yields just one, to Tye. Up creeps the required rate, to 5.16. 37th over: Australia 197-7 ( Paine 1, Tye 5) Target 260 The man of the previous moment, AJ Tye, swings hard and inside-edges four through cover! A single follows, and this is going to be some finish! What an over! There’s our reverses-wing! Another jaffa from Currany, whizzing across Starc, kissing his edge, and winding up in the hands of Buttler who dives well to grab. “Quack” says Daddles. 37th over: Australia 192-6 (Paine 1, Starc 0) Target 260 In comms, Michael Clarke is praising Curran, but also Morgan’s commentary; he brought him back, and also brought up the field, prompting Maxwell to try over the top. Now we have waselves a ball game! This is a jazzer of a delivery, reverse-swinging in, pitching middle and off, hitting in front of leg, and Australia are in a bind! 37th over: Australia 192-5 (Maxwell 34, Paine 1) Target 260 Cuzza returns to sling down a wide but his second ball is much better, ramming Maxwell on the pad. They appeal! Not out! They go upstairs! 36th over: Australia 191-5 (Maxwell 34, Paine 1) Target 260 Paine forces a single down the ground to open his account and Maxwell then toes a ramp, words which mean nothing but in a cricketing context; I love this game. Two from the over, and that’s Rashid done with 1-55 off his ten. 35th over: Australia 189-5 (Maxwell 33, Paine 0) Target 260 England need one more: can David Willey supply it? Not yet, but he sends down what I think is the first maiden of the innings. The required run rate is only 4.73, so it’s not really increasing the pressure, but it’s something. 34th over: Australia 189-5 (Maxwell 33, Paine 0) Target 260 The wicket came with the final delivery of the over. Stoinis comes down and gives a full toss what for, swatting over the top. But the bat spins in his hand and Curran moves forward and around to catch low. That’s a really excellent grab, and he celebrates well with some shoulder-wiggling; it’s also the end of a really excellent innings from Stoinis, who will now spend the rest of the day wrestling crocodiles. 34th over: Australia 189-4 (Stoinis 87, Maxwell 33) Target 260 Rashid continues after drinks, and after Stoinis takes a single, Maxwell reverse-chips over point for four. He is so good. 33rd over: Australia 183-4 (Stoinis 86, Maxwell 28) Target 260 England are paying the price for having no pace; all the clever changes and placings in the world can’t compensate for that. Willey bowls a tight enough over, but five still come from it, the final single bringing up an easy fifty partnership. “Was it a brace as in teeth-correction or as in brace-and-bit? I know nobody uses the latter any more, but it just could be if it happened in your childhood.” The former. To my unrestrained joy, 20 years later I have dreams about aching jaws and facial gozz, thanks to my head brace and retainer days. I’m not sure what this tells me about myself. 32nd over: Australia 178-4 (Stoinis 82, Maxwell 27) Target 260 Eoin Morgan isn’t letting things slide, reintroducing Rashid, so Stonis dinks him over long off and just over Willey on the rope, for six! One more follows, and Australia are cruising ... but only for as long as these two stay together, lovin’ you whether, whether, times are good or bad, happy or sad. 31st over: Australia 171-4 (Stoinis 75, Maxwell 27) Target 260 Willey, unsold in the IPL auction, returns to the attack and goes around to Maxwell who guides him around the corner for one. Unsurprisingly given the angle, a wide follows, and Stonis recognises the 4.6 run rate so patiently negotiates the remainder of the over, doing really well to jab out a yorker before guiding a single to third man. 30th over: Australia 168-4 (Stoinis 74, Maxwell 26) Target 260 These two look in perfect control, milking Moeen for singles until Maxwell cuts a brace. This is, I imagine, better than being cut by a brace, a feature of my teenage years and even my dreams now. Sorry, I think I’m oversharing. 29th over: Australia 161-4 (Stoinis 72, Maxwell 21) Target 260 England are back to urgently needing a wicket as Ball barrels in, and Maxwell sees his third delivery coming, rocking back to ramp over Buttler for four. That was pretty nice you know, better than grilled cheese on the rad-y-ator, and three singles follow. 28th over: Australia 154-4 (Stoinis 71, Maxwell 15) Target 260 Stoinis dabs a single, then Maxwell takes two behind square on the leg side. So he looks to tempt Maxwell with some air and Maxwell is duly tempted, into slamming him into the stands. Meanwhile, in commentary they talk about AJ Tye, which reminds me of one of my favourite things of the last bit. Feel free to educate us with yours! 27th over: Australia 144-4 (Stoinis 70, Maxwell 6) Target 260 Maxwell drives Ball to cover and looking to prevent a second run that he’s never preventing, Moeen runs in and looks to pick up one-handed, on the move. He misses and concedes four, which is obviously pretty hilarious; two balls later Maxwell finds him again and this time he copes, sending in a return as the batsmen run one. 26th over: Australia 138-4 (Stoinis 69, Maxwell 1) Target 260 Maxwell, who has very well developed forearms, hits hard to cover and gets off the mark, then Stoinis reverse-sweeps for two more. 25th over: Australia 135-4 (Stoinis 67, Maxwell 0) Target 260 Ball returns and has Stoinis on strike. If England can lozz him, it’ll take a big effort from Australia, and so far this has been a real team effort from the tourists. Four dots, then Stoinis gets under one but it goes safe and they run two “I just heard Michael Clarke opine on TV that ‘teams aren’t picked on personality’, emails Newcastle Person, “and nearly choked in my cup of tea ... Simon Katich anyone?” Maybe he’s thinking of his own experience, etc etc. 24th over: Australia 133-4 (Stoinis 65, Maxwell 0) Target 260 Out comes yerman, who knocks his first ball up and down into the off side. If England get one more wicket, they’ll be favourites. He puts up his thumb and pulls out a plum and says what a good boy am I! Marsh, who’s in the mood, absolutely massacres one back at Moeen, who leans back, chucks up a hand, and SOMEHOW CATCHES THE BALL BETWEEN THEM AND FOREFINGER AS THE UMPIRE DIVES FOR COVER! HEE HEE HEE LOOK AT HIM IN HIS RED SHIRT! ENGLAND ARE IN THE GAME! 24th over: Australia 133-3 (Stoinis 65, Marsh 13) Target 260 Moeen gives one some air and Marsh flings arms at it, edging hard through gully. 23rd over: Australia 127-3 (Stoinis 65, Marsh 7) Target 260 Marsh doesn’t wait to be asked, punishing Rashid’s second ball back dahn the grahnd for four. Sorry, blame Ray Winston, who wants you to give away your money carefully. Marsh adds two more singles, and Stonis helps himself to one. 22nd over: Australia 120-3 (Stoinis 64, Marsh 1) Target 260 There’s a big row as Mitchell Marsh comes out and I remember that in my discussion with myself about which of England’s one-dayers might move into the Test side, I neglected to mention Buttler who is far too much of a genius never to be given another go. Except it seems to be near enough impossible to get dropped from that; England’s problem was that they convinced themselves it was close and they just lost the big moments, when in fact they only avoided a 5-0 because they were playing a less good side than in previous humiliations. And anyway, what message were the selectors trying to send? That 4-0 is ok? Hello! Hello! Stephen Smith fails again! He expected some turn and came forward, the ball went straight on, and in a trice did the bails come off. 21st over: Australia 117-2 (Stoinis 63, Smith 11) Target 260 Here we go. Rashid gives Stoinis some width, so he cuts it hard to the fence, then seizes upon a short wrongun, zetzing it into the stands. He is seeing it. 20th over: Australia 106-2 (Stoinis 53, Smith 10) Target 260 A quietly effective over for Australia as Moeen returns, four singles from it. 19th over: Australia 102-2 (Stoinis 51, Smith 8) Target 260 Smith and Maxwell have had a little sit down and resolved their personal issue, we’re told, though we’re also told that it shouldn’t matter if Maxwell is deemed good enough. Smith then takes a single and Stoinis does too, which raises his fifty, and fine one it’s been too. One more to Smith follows, and England need another wicket. 18th over: Australia 98-2 (Stoinis 49, Smith 6) Target 260 Rashid looks to have Smith, so perhaps he’ll try to get something going against Ball. After Stoinis, who’s now becalmed, forces a single, Smith paddles one of his own before a high wide arrives. 17th over: Australia 95-2 (Stoinis 48, Smith 5) Target 260 A drinks break, and then Smith whips Rashid away for three as a streaker christens the new ground; what a tale to enshrine in his family history! What poise, what élan! I’m choking up here! We get to see a bit of him as Michael Slater, to his credit, commentates like it’s part of the game, then we’re not allowed as though a naked body is more offensive than Graeme Swann’s fringe. I don’t know. 16th over: Australia 89-2 (Stoinis 46, Smith 1) Target 260 England need to rustle through some quick overs here while Australia recalibrate, trying to impose even a modicum of scoreboard pressure. Head takes a single, then Smith does to get off the mark; it’s taken him seven balls. 15th over: Australia 87-2 (Stoinis 45, Smith 0) Target 260 So will England make any special provisions for Smith? Rashid continues but the field is up; Morgan will know that they can’t get him early, they lose. AND WHAT’S THIS! First ball Rashid flights one down, nicely done, and Smith takes a big stride, misses, and Buttler whips off the bails! England think it’s out, the unshakeable confidence of desperation, and off upstairs they toddle ... but from every angle we can see foot down and behind line. Damn you optical illusions; the third umpire falls for it. My days, England needed that. Brilliant from Morgan, not so brilliant from Stoinis who sold his mate out there. N3 in the house! 14th over: Australia 86-1 (Head 22, Stoinis 44) Target 260 Marcus Stoinis is a muscular and dextrous lover. Ball serves him a short, wide one so he shakes out his arms and helps it over third man for six. Three dots follow, then the batsmen steal a single, Stoinis dropping to mid off and running, Morgan colletcs, shies, hits, they turn and take another, BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT... 13th over: Australia 80-1 (Head 22, Stoinis 38) Target 260 This is a tighter over from Rashid, two singles from it, but England need wickets. “WICKET” begins Andrew Benton. “Go on, Daniel. Start a paragraph headline with WICKET!!! would you please? We can refresh our pages if you decide it was premature.” I’m not sure my heart can take the intensity of bantz. 12th over: Australia 78-1 (Head 21, Stoinis 37) Target 260 Who in England’s one-day side should be given a shy in the longer format? You can make a case for Roy and Hales in the middle order; Rashid is better than Moeen, all the more so if Moeen isn’t scoring runs; and I don’t really know why Ball and Curran were deemed better options than Plunkett, who looked a Test player before he got injured. Anyway, Ball replaces Cuzza – I’m assuming that’s his nickname but the reality is that it’s more likely to be Currany – and Stoinis takes him for a single. Buttler then does well to parry a bottom edge, and Head opens the face to guide four through third man; that’s the fifty partnership, raised in short order. Australia are rolling, in their five point o, with their rag top down so their hair can blow. 11th over: Australia 72-1 (Head 16, Stoinis 36) Target 260 I wonder what it is Joe Root doesn’t like about Adil Rashid, who is a far better spinner than Moeen and might have offered an alternative during the Test series. Anyway, he’s into the attack and Stoinis puts a big foot down and slices hard through deep point fo fo. The batsmen then exchange singles, before Stoinis muscles three through that same cover point. Digested read: England are in the brown stuff. 10th over: Australia 63-1 (Head 15, Stoinis 28) Target 260 Curran is going full and mid on and mid off are up, Morgan offering Stoinis out; will he take on the challenge and go over the top? He really doesn’t need to, because Australia have plenty of time, and he has plenty of time to nurdle a nice match-definer which keeps him up the order. 9th over: Australia 59-1 (Head 12, Stoinis 27) Target 260 Moeen into the attack and immediately Stoinis runs him down for two, then properly sees one so carts it to the square-leg fence. Moeen responds well with two dots, so Stoinis quicksteps down and tickles him two-thirds of the way into the second tier, a full 119 metres! What a shot that is! Through the process, he doesn’t even stop chewing his gum! 8th over: Australia 47-1 (Head 12, Stoinis 15) Target 260 A slower ball from Curran is picked up fast by Stoinis who holds his back before dismissing it from his countenance with four down the ground. A single follows, Curran just missing with a thrown, and England are getting to the really need a wicket stage. “It’s generally accepted that the white ball doesn’t swing as much as a red one,” emails John Starbuck, “but it may also be that it’s a Kookaburra, which says it all. England bowlers perform best in English conditions, which is why we may see changes in New Zealand, with a similar climate. Do we know what ball they will use there?” The Kookaburra, I believe. I’m really looking forward to that series, which shouldn’t be much fun for the batsmen on either side; tangentially, I wonder if South Africa will dare give Australia the tracks prepared for India. 7th over: Australia 41-1 (Head 11, Stoinis 10) Target 260 Two decent stops in the field, one at backward point and and one at cover, turn fours into a two and a dot. A single then brings Stoinis on strike, and he nudges two off his legs then stoinises the final delivery of the over down the ground for four. 6th over: Australia 32-1 (Head 8, Stoinis 4) Target 260 Talking of swing, what’s happened to England’s mastery of reverse? It’s been so crucial to their key wins, but we saw almost none in the Test series. Is it that their bowlers aren’t quick enough? Anyhow, Curran floats down a half-volley onto Stoinis’s pads, and off it goes to the fence, the only runs off the over. He looks very nicely balanced. 5th over: Australia 28-1 (Head 8, Stoinis 0) Target 260 Willey, who looks more like Nacho Monreal than I’d previously grasped, finds a better off stump line in this over. The problem is that the ball appears to have stopped swinging, so he’ll take the two twos which Head scores. 4th over: Australia 24-0 (Head 4, Stoinis 0) Target 260 Warner has scored just 73 runs in five innings this series, and that’s a big reason England stormed to victory in the manner that they did. Curran follows up his wicket with four dots, to Stoinis who’s up the order. Well he can go and get it now! Curran hurls down an inswinging yorker that’s far too good for Warner! What a response that is, and out comes the aeroplane! Catch that! 4th over: Australia 24-0 (Warner 15, Head 4) Target 260 Colonel Mustard has a train to catch, and he helps Curran around to leg and off to the fence. 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Warner 11, Head 4) Target 260 Willey gives Warner a bit of medium-paced width, and that he is absolutely not having, caning it over the top for a one-bounce four 2nd over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 6, Head 4) Target 260 I wonder about Tom Curran, who looks to have plenty of moxie but perhaps not enough pace and nous ... yet. Warner turns his loosener off the pads for two, then thunks a drive past point for three, and four leg-byes follow when the swing is too much. Oh. But this is better ... well it’s not better, it’s miles wide, and Head slashes at it, straight to Bairstow at one. It’s true that Buttler moves across towards it then doesn’t go, and it’s true that Bairsterr doesn’t field there often, but even so, it’s not easy to excuse him putting that down. But that’s what he does. I’ve seen better overs. 1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 1, Head 4) Target 260 Swing first up for Willey ... swing which takes the ball wide. There’s no much going on in the way of pace, so he’ll need to keep Warner tucked up to avoid being clobbered. Warner then dabs him into the offside and they trot a single which brings Head on strike; a outswinger greets him, and then a wide half-volley which he rams to the fence with minimum effort and maximum prejudice. Good start for Australia. Willey has the cherry... Right then, the boyz are on the baize... “It’s sensational,” says Andrew Tye of himself. He’s from Perth and loves the new ground, and generally life and everything about it. He reckons he’s got 17 different deliveries, and tells Tubby Taylor that he’s spent a lot of summers sat in front of the cricket with a ball in his hands. Er, I’m not entirely certain what to say or think about this. But it does remind me that the Ask Jimmy bit on TMS at half-time in Friday’s ODI was excellent on the topic of his white line fever which comes roughly halfway through. How many terrible headlines can we right. Hopefully he’ll hit the runs which level the scores off the last ball, and we can go with DREW TYE. A popular web streaming service is silent on the matter of Another Day, would you believe, so have this instead. Good morning, good afternoon, good night, as Talib Kweli once said. Over the next four hours or so, we’ll see if England have the get out of jail bowling to go with their get out of jail batting; they need to make their runs last, because they sure as you like don’t have enough of them. The headline writes itself: England Tyed up in knots. They started menacingly, with Jason Roy relishing the short straight boundaries at this new ground. After nine overs, they were 65-0, but Australia came back into the game through dynamic captaincy from Steve Smith, thrifty bowling from Mitch Marsh, and then a succession of superb slower balls from AJ Tye. He and Marsh took 7-70 between them, while the big guns, Starc and Hazlewood, managed only 1-114. England’s top four all got going, then got out, with only Root, the least explosive of them, sticking around, and the lower middle order had little to add. Still, it’s a measure of England’s drastic improvement in the past two years that 250 feels like a flop. And they did hit six sixes. Will Davey Warner better that by himself, I wonder. “Why,” asks Zaph Mann, “did they drop Woakes?” They may well be asking themselves that question. It’s a case of resting, not dropping, as far as we know, but it’s a gamble that hasn’t paid off – yet. If Willey can bowl as well as Tye, all will be forgiven. And Willey, like Tye, knows this surface, which has pace and carry even if the bounce is a little uneven. Daniel Harris will guide you through the second half of the day. Thanks for your company. No, they can’t. Tye’s slower ball, a yorker this time, is far too good for Jake Ball, who hasn’t batted since about 2014. England’s innings has just dribbled away. Fed up with playing the anchor, Root goes for broke with a one-handed slog, but it’s Tye’s slower ball, yet again, and the consequence is a good catch by Warner. Can England go the distance? 47th over: England 258-8 (Root 62, Curran 10) Tom Curran is a character. After missing a couple of big heaves, some No.9s would go into their shell. Curran jumps outside off, waits for Starc’s attempted yorker, gets a full toss and helps it over the keeper for six. An OBO wouldn’t be an OBO without an email from John Starbuck. “Moeen’s sad decline has been one of the stories of this tour, but there were so many others too,” he says. “I reckon England and Australia should go round the world with this contest, in a version of the Never-Ending Battle of myth, but will have to take it in turns to play the Harlem Globetrotters role.” Nice. 46th over: England 248-8 (Root 61, Curran 0) So that’s another wicket for Tye, who took three on Australia Day and has three more here. England badly need Root to go bananas. “Morning Tim.” Morning, Harry Lang. “These early starts/ all nighters catching up with the weary English fans it seems... Do we put that last game down as an anomaly or were more troubling frailties exposed?” A bit of both, I’d say: 8-5 is a freak, and they recovered well and nearly won. But every team has its DNA, and even this brave new England have, written on their cells, a tendency to collapse. The procession continues as Willey goes for a big mow and offers only a meek catch. 44th over: England 239-7 (Root 56, Willey 0) Another handy over from Tye, who has 2-39 off eight. He and the incoming batsman, Willey, are the only players involved today who have played on this ground before. A tiny hesitation from Rashid as he pushes Tye into the covers, and Smith pulls off a direct hit. He’s been so up for it today. 43rd over: England 234-6 (Root 54, Rashid 9) Root upper-cuts Halewood, almost gets caught at third man, but the ball squirts away for four, and that’s the first international fifty at this ground. He’s had an excellent series in a quiet way: still no hundred, but only twice out for 218. Those IPL teams may be missing a trick, though England, and Root’s young family, won’t be sorry if he gets a decent rest. Andrew Benton is back on email. “It’s really sad about Moeen – I’m a huge fan, and I hope he can get his Mojo back this coming UK summer. Or maybe that should be his MoAl.” 42nd over: England 226-6 (Root 48, Rashid 7) Zampa concedes only three and finishes with 10-1-46-1. Kevin Pietersen reckons this is the best he’s bowled in the series, because he’s been getting drift. I’m not sure England have put him under much pressure. On Twitter, Phil Withall is throwing up his arms in frustration. “I suspect Ali might have given up on this tour now. Very poor decision making.” 41st over: England 223-6 (Root 47, Rashid 5) Rashid does his best to impersonate Woakes, getting off the mark with a crisp upper-cut for four off Starc. Seven off the over, but England need 12 or 15. 40th over: England 216-6 (Root 46, Rashid 0) So it’s goodnight from Moeen, who seems to be reverting to his Ashes persona, a shadow of his summer-2017 self. England could send in Willey to have a bash, but instead they opt for Rashid’s more sober presence: a triumph of experience over hope. Oh dear. Moeen’s dopeyness continues with a half-hearted slog, straight to long-off. Where’s Woakes when England need him? 39th over: England 210-5 (Root 42, Moeen 5) Moeen lives dangerously against Starc. He seems to nick a ball heading down leg, which is given as a wide, with no appeal, let alone a review. And then he dawdles over a single and would be out if Smith’s swoop ended in a direct hit. If this was the Under-10s, a grumpy coach would be muttering “wake up”. 38th over: England 205-5 (Root 39, Moeen 3) Zampa keeps it tight enough, conceding five. “I’ll have a bacon sandwich and a cuppa please,” says Joanne Vickers on Twitter. Don’t torture me: the bacon sarnie is what I was hoping my son would bring back from McDonalds. You just can’t get the staff. 37th over: England 200-5 (Root 35, Moeen 2) The 200 comes up, but it’s not much to shout about. Root almost perishes with a wafty hook at Tye’s bouncer. England need composure from him and a breezy cameo from Moeen. 36th over: England 194-5 (Root 31, Moeen 1) Buttler hit a glorious six off the first ball of Tye’s over, but when he tried a reprise, he hit the wrong note. Off the last 14 overs, England have scored 62-3: too old-school to be cool. Tye’s slower ball does the trick again, as Buttler tries to clonk him for six and only succeeds in giving catching practice. England are throwing this away. 34th over: England 183-4 (Root 29, Buttler 13) Now Smith sends for Zampa, which isn’t such a good move. He continues to look listless, and every ball goes for a run or two. 33rd over: England 177-4 (Root 25, Buttler 11) Tye returns, and hits Root in the ribs with a slower bouncer, as Smith maintains his bid for the world record for most bowling changes in a single Sunday morning. The legendary Gary Naylor is on Twitter, picking up on my remark about Smith being like a madman in a cathedral. “Like this?” he says, and adds a link, which I hope will work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NguSHnOWik&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=28s Apologies for the old-school tech. 32nd over: England 172-4 (Root 24, Buttler 9) Just when it feels as if England will never find the rope again, Hazlewood tries a bouncer and Buttler pulls him for four, imperiously. “Help us Obi-wan,” says Andrew Benton on Twitter. “You’re our only hope.” Forgive my ignorance, but is that Buttler or Root? 31st over: England 166-4 (Root 23, Buttler 4) Marsh has conceded only three boundaries, and 12 other runs, in seven overs. The crocked Cummins could hardly have done better. 30th over: England 162-4 (Root 21, Buttler 3) Yet another tight over from Hazlewood. The middle of this innings has been a throwback to England in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. 29th over: England 159-4 (Root 20, Buttler 1) Marsh has 2-21 off six overs, sensational stuff. England have thrown away that strong start, and with no Woakes to come they badly need one of Buttler’s rapid 70s. Morgan gives Marsh the charge and picks the wrong ball because it’s short. He does well to make contact with an airy swat, and it’s well held just off the turf. Mitch Marsh is heading for Man of the Match. 28th over: England 155-3 (Root 18, Morgan 2) Smith is ringing the changes like a madman in a cathedral, but it’s working. Hazlewood, replacing Zampa, ties down Morgan, often a slow starter, and only 16 have come off the last five overs. The force is with the Aussies. 27th over: England 152-3 (Root 17, Morgan 1) So Marsh, who restored order early on, gets a big wicket too, and he now has excellent figures, 5-0-17-1. Out comes Eoin Morgan, which means that England have two captains at the crease. They could do with a captain’s innings. Hales again botches a pull, top-edging the ball onto his helmet and offering a simple chance to Maxwell at short cover. And England lose another batsman who was well set. 26th over: England 151-2 (Hales 35, Root 17) Four singles off Zampa, who has done OK here, whatever Healy says. 25th over: England 147-2 (Hales 33, Root 15) Hales gets a stroke of luck as he pulls a short one from Marsh and it flies over the keeper’s head for four. That’s the halfway stage, with England going nicely but not running away with it. Steve Smith has been so busy in the field, you suspect he’s going to be back to form with the bat. 24th over: England 142-2 (Hales 29, Root 14) Yet another bowling change as Zampa replaces Starc. He keeps things quiet, but Ian Healy, who knows a bit about leg spin, isn’t happy with his energy. 23rd over: England 139-2 (Hales 28, Root 12) Mitch Marsh returns, to be greeted by a leg glance from Root, which goes for four because Hazlewood fields the way fast bowlers used to. The outfield is rock-hard, so you can’t blame him for not hurling himself onto it. 22nd over: England 134-2 (Hales 28, Root 7) Root clips Starc for a classy three. If he’s bothered about being a wallflower in India, it’s not showing in his strokeplay. 21st over: England 127-2 (Hales 25, Root 3) Hales dances down the track to Maxwell and lofts him for a straight six. “Just really a flick of the wrists,” says Mark Taylor, with the air of a man who certainly didn’t do that sort of thing himself. 20th over: England 118-2 (Hales 18, Root 1) Root plays and misses at his first ball, inelegantly by his standards, before pushing a wideish one into the covers for a single. Good over from Starc. The bowling change pays off as Bairstow, trying to glide Starc for a single to third man, chops onto his stumps. Another good innings, but again not a big one. The Aussies are right back in this. Here comes Joe Root, or as he seems to be in the IPL, Billy No Mates. 19th over: England 117-1 (Hales 18, Bairstow 44) Hales is warming to the task now. He rocks back to cut Maxwell for a well-run two, then sees a short one so well that he cuts over mid-off for four. 18th over: England 111-1 (Hales 12, Bairstow 44) Smith, who is making plenty of changes, takes Tye off after a fine spell of 4-0-15-1, and brings back Starc. He starts with a string of dots but then drops short, so Bairstow pops him over third man for another six. If you’re going to flash, flash hard. 17th over: England 105-1 (Hales 12, Bairstow 38) Glenn Maxwell comes on with his off-breaks, and Jonny Bairstow deposits him over the boards at long-off for six. That’s a handsome way to bring up England’s hundred. 16th over: England 97-1 (Hales 11, Bairstow 31) Tye continues and Bairstow plays his shot of the day, a classic off drive, eased through a small gap. “Lovely cricket shot,” says Kevin Pietersen. And that’s drinks, with England on top, as far as you can tell on a new ground, but Australia back in it. Andrew Benton is back. “Don’t leave us in suspense, Tim. Did you get a MacDonalds?” Kind of you to ask. I did not: my son didn’t get the email in time. Anyone got a Four’n’Twenty pie? 15th over: England 92-1 (Hales 10, Bairstow 27) Zampa goes for some more ones and twos before Bairstow sweeps for four. That puts the rate back up above a run a ball. 14th over: England 82-1 (Hales 7, Bairstow 20) Tye finally concedes a four as Hales punches down the ground. The straight boundary is only 63 metres, as against 80 square: shades of the Waca. 13th over: England 76-1 (Hales 2, Bairstow 19) Zampa keeps up the pressure with a tidy over. 12th over: England 73-1 (Hales 1, Bairstow 17) Hales replaces Roy, like for like, and gets off the mark with a push to third man. Off the last five overs, England have only managed 19-1, and, as so often, the squeeze brought a wicket. Got him! Tye’s knuckle ball deceives Roy, whose attempted punch turns into an airy chip, well held by Hazlewood running back from mid-on. A good knock, but not a long one: game on. 10th over: England 66-0 (Roy 47, Bairstow 13) Andrew Tye replaces Hazlewood and instantly beats Roy’s outside edge, or even takes it – Tim Paine wants a review, but Smith is harder to convince than some captains. A fine start by Tye, who concedes only one, so the Aussies have stopped Roy in his tracks. 9th over: England 64-0 (Roy 46, Bairstow 13) Marsh concedes his first boundary as Roy punches down the ground, but still manages a few dots. The new Optus Stadium is now just about full. As it’s nearly three times the size of the Waca, this must be the biggest crowd ever for international cricket in Western Australia. 8th over: England 60-0 (Roy 41, Bairstow 13) Hazlewood takes his cue from Marsh, mixing dots with singles, before Bairstow plays a dreamy straight drive for two. 7th over: England 55-0 (Roy 39, Bairstow 10) Steve Smith needs to do something, so he takes off one Mitchell (Starc) and brings on another (Marsh). It does the trick, as Marsh finds a good length and a tight line, becomes the first man to tie Roy down, and even has a good shout for lbw as Bairstow is pinned in front of the leg bail. Well bowled. 6th over: England 54-0 (Roy 38, Bairstow 10) This time it’s Roy who takes the early single and Bairstow who cashes in, with a classy tuck and a streaky inside edge. The outfield is fast, but England are making full use of it. And the second email of the morning is from Daniel de Lisle. “Hi Dad.” Er, hi darling. “Would you like anything from McDonalds on the way back? Should be home in about half an hour.” This is the life of the OBOer: I’ve started work, and my son’s not yet back from his night out. 5th over: England 44-0 (Roy 37, Bairstow 2) Groundhog over: another single for Bairstow, again to third man, and two more fours for Roy, driven through mid-off and flicked to square leg. Starc, who has bowled pretty well, has none for 26 off three overs. “Tim.” Yes, Andrew Benton. “The once great Moeen has been everything but, down under. His finger problem has clearly precipitated a huge loss of form - but shouldn’t the coaching set up be ready and able to deal with this? Is it curtains for him now? Or does what happens in Australia stay in Australia?” Nice line, but he’s been much more himself in this series, hasn’t he? Consistently economical, and he helped steady the ship in Adelaide. 4th over: England 34-0 (Roy 28, Bairstow 1) Bairstow finally gets off the mark with a guide to third man, as if to confirm that he is playing the straight man in this double act. Roy drives through mid-off, where Warner fails to get down, and then through the covers. His 28 has come off 20 balls, Bairstow’s 1 off 5. Shiny new ground, but still a funny old game. 3rd over: England 21-0 (Roy 20, Bairstow 0) It’s all happening here at the non-Waca. Another ball jags past the bat as Starc deceives Roy, but then there’s a short one which is pulled imperiously for four, followed by a full one which Roy flat-bats for six over long-off. Next ball, he’s walking off, apparently caught behind, only to be recalled because Starc has overstepped the marc. There’s a free hit, but Roy connects with thin air. Start has Roy caught behind, beautifully, by Paine, but it’s a no-ball. 2nd over: England 10-0 (Roy 10, Bairstow 0) Roy slashes Hazlewood’s first ball for four, not far from either of the men at cover point. He edges a single, whereupon Bairstow plays and misses again. So far, the curator will be a lot happier than the batsmen. 1st over: England 5-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 0) Roy adds a single with a push to mid-on, but the story the scoreboard doesn’t tell is that Starc has already beaten both batsmen. Still, compared to 8 for 5, this is riches. The pitch looks mottled – you wouldn’t choose it as wallpaper – but the carry is good. 1st ball: England 4-0 (Roy 4, Bairstow 0) Mitchell Starc bowls the first ball at the new ground, a fullish inswinger, and Jason Roy clips it for an all-run four. So it’s true about the long square boundaries. Pat Cummins, star of the show the other day, has pulled up lame, but there’s a decent understudy in a fellow called Starc. Cameron White’s painful recall seems to be over as Glenn Maxwell gets the call. England leave out their man of the moment, Chris Woakes, and their fastest bowler, Mark Wood – thus confirming that we’re not at the Waca now. They bring in David Willey and Jake Ball, perhaps in recognition that this is the first day game of the series and you’ve got to make an effort to amuse small children. No change to the top order which so distinguished itself in Adelaide, which means that Dawid Malan, who was exceptional in the Perth Test, will carry the drinks again. Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Marcus Stoinis, 4 Steve Smith (capt), 5 Mitchell Marsh, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Tim Paine (wkt), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Andrew Tye, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood. England 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 Jos Buttler (wkt), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 David Willey, 9 Tom Curran, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Jake Ball. Steve Smith wins the toss and opts to have a bowl, which is no surprise as there’s a green tinge to the pitch. Before the Melbourne Test, Jason Gillespie said there was no such thing as a dead rubber in the Ashes. His point holds good for this one-day series: Australia still have some pride to salvage and England would love to finish with a resounding 4-1 victory rather than a muted 3-2. The day should really begin not with anthems but with both teams singing “ooh ooh ooh, I wanna be like you”. Eoin Morgan covets some of that Aussie ruthlessness, while Steve Smith longs for his batsmen to play with English-style freedom. This paradox shows up in the scoreline, if you go back a few years. In this series, England are 3-1 up, but in Australia, in the 21st century, in 50-over cricket, the Aussies lead 24-8. So who, exactly, is three times as good as whom? Today’s game, unlike any of the previous 32, is being played at the Perth Stadium – shiny and new, across the river from the Waca and nearly three times the capacity (55,000 rather than 20,000). The light will be just as bright, the heat just as dry, but it remains to be seen whether the bounce will be as steep – presumably not, as the pitch is a drop-in – or the wind as influential. If you’re mourning the Waca, I recommend this long read by Chris Ryan, which is every bit as quirky as the place it depicts. I’ll be back shortly with news from the toss in Perth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/05/marks-rocks-since-bronze-age-ilkley-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-05T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"People have been leaving their marks on these rocks since the bronze age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/05/marks-rocks-since-bronze-age-ilkley-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/05/marks-rocks-since-bronze-age-ilkley-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"People have been leaving their marks on these rocks since the bronze age","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On the horizons surrounding Wharfedale, snow, sky and space are warring in spectacular ways; white clouds roll over the white moors like billows of steam, vaporising the distinction between both, and the sun occasionally provides episodes of dazzling icy brightness. Winter’s sorcery has turned Rombald’s Moor into a convincing impression of blizzard-swept Arctic tundra a few miles from the middle of Bradford. Undeterred, the weekend visitors are out in force around the great millstone grit forms of the Cow and Calf above Ilkley. Like many of the tors, outcrops and escarpments dotting the gritstone Pennines, this imposing crag and its smaller counterpart together act as a natural gathering point for the surrounding civilisation. Climbers climb them; children instinctively recognise them as venues for play; adults stride to the lip of boulders and strike noble poses for phone cameras. Spend any time people-watching at the nearby Brimham Rocks, Almscliffe Crag or the Chevin and see further evidence of how we are innately drawn towards wild rock formations. On the Cow and Calf, the historical evidence for this instinct is indelibly marked: parts of them are covered in a huge ad hoc tattoo of mostly Victorian chiselled graffiti, dating from Ilkley’s spa town heyday. There are occasional declarations of love and outbreaks of Wesleyan religiosity, but the typical format is a simple name and date; enough to record an individual life and make a stab at immortality. A contemporary environmental sensibility would rightly discourage this; you can trace its growth by the relative paucity of recent dates. But in the context of an area with 400 known rock carvings dating from the bronze age – a time when the moor was inhabited, not just visited – it can be seen as an expression of something intrinsic to the human experience. Ilkley Moor’s Twelve Apostles stone circle is an example of people using rock to create cultural significance, harnessing its aura of longevity to underpin their own presence. On the Cow and Calf, the rocks are “humanised” not through rearrangement but by a piecemeal process of defacement. Like it or not, they have become monuments to our longing to anchor ourselves in the world, and at least in part to our ageless fascination with wild stone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/28/chelsea-v-newcastle-fa-cup-fourth-round-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T15:29:27Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 3-0 Newcastle - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/28/chelsea-v-newcastle-fa-cup-fourth-round-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/28/chelsea-v-newcastle-fa-cup-fourth-round-live","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 3-0 Newcastle - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thanks for joining me here for this wonderfully easy game. Surely, Cardiff v Man City will be closer. Luckily, you can follow all that with the lovely Nick Ames who is back from two days of galavanting in Yeovil and Newport. Newcastle still want Jorgensen but he might have to be a world beater if he is to make a difference to that attacking force. Rafa’s side offered almost nothing going forward whether it was with Gayle or Joselu. It will not be a fun final few months for fans watching their season. That was all delightfully relaxing for anyone in blue. Newcastle will not be bothered about being out of the cup, let’s be honest. They tried for a bit bit one the first went in, it was all over. A great advertisement for walking football here at Stamford Bridge as it was rarely a contest for the majority of the game. The game was over before half-time but at least they played out the final 45 minutes for everyone. Batshuayi should get some confidence from two goals and it was a lovely free-kick from Alonso to cap it all off. Newcastle really need some new players and, if you ask their fans, a new owner. It’s OK, Rudiger is up and walks off following the earlier concern. Not really worth either coming back onto the pitch. 90+2 min: A nasty clash of heads between Joselu and Rudiger as they challenged for the ball. The Chelsea defender looks like he has come off worse and is out cold on the ground. 90 min: Sutton has just given Batshuayi the Man of the Match awarded as the co-comm wants to give the striker some more confidence. That’s nice. Two minutes of injury-time for us all to get through. 88 min: Batshuayi picks up a throw out the left, drops his shoulder in order to leave Saivet on his arse but Darlow stays big to stop his shot from close range. 86 min: Chelsea are passing it around because there is no need to do much else in the final few minutes. I think this has been the FA Cup’s testimonial. Hudson-Odoi is quite good... Your dream has come true, Nate. “Can we have a bit of Hudson-Odoi?” 83 min: Now Newcastle are making a change as Chelsea legend Atsu comes on for Hayden. 81 min: Barkley plays the ball out to Zappacosta on the right, he cuts in onto his left and fires in a shot from 25 yards, which Darlow tips over. Hudson-Odoi is now on for Pedro, so we will not get to see Fabregas in the end. 79 min: Newcastle won a corner, which is about as good as it has got for them in this half. It does not clear the first man but Murphy volleys the clearance back, alas straight at Caballero. 77 min: Jacob Murphy is coming on for Manquillo. We can assume he is not coming on at right-back. Kante off for Ampadu, too. 76 min: Now we are getting to see the return of Fabregas. Everyone is getting a runout here. It is all very slow at Stamford Bridge. I think Newcastle would accept leaving Karl Darlow with the ball for the final 15 minutes and wait it out. 74 min: Zappacosta gets his on back on Haidara for the challenge in the first-half but the left-back gets back up eventually, so no harm. GOAL! Alonso is at again. On this occasion he lifts a free-kick up and over the wall from 20 yards, and to put the icing on the cake he curls wonderfully into the top corner. Oooooof! A great free-kick from Alonso! 70 min: Newcastle do some rare attacking as Ritchie puts in an early cross from deep but, despite good movement, Joselu just can’t get on the end of it and Chelsea manage to clear. Barkley is coming on... 68 min: Chelsea have a good spell in and around the box but neither Hazard nor Zappacosta can find anything other than a Newcastle player with their crosses. Chelsea do get a corner in the end. 66 min: Darlow is now just kicking for territory as he sends a goal-kick 70 yards up the pitch but straight out of play. There is not much up there for him to aim for in a black and white shirt, to be fair to the goalkeeper. 64 min: Joselu is coming on for Newcastle, which might result in a turnaround in fortunes for Newcastle but almost certainly will not. But we can all find out together. Obviously, Gayle is the man going off. He tried, which is the key. 62 min: The lull in the game just allows the Newcastle fans to open up their lungs and sing about their owner, Mr Michael Ashley. The words are still the same and quite negative. Will he sell up? 60 min: Newcastle win a free-kick out wide, which Shlevey bends in but it’s slow and looping, so it really isn’t too hard to clear. The visitors look like they are going through the motions now. 58 min: Hazard is called offside after he chases a pass through the middle but it turns out he was in his own half. Where’s the wonderful VAR when you need it? 56 min: Alonso once again proves how wonderful his left foot can be when he steadies himself to receive a cross from Zappacosta, and when the ball does arrive he smashes a shot which deflects off Manquillo, helping Darlow to get to the ball and palm it away. 55 min: Gayle goes down after flicking on a pass when being challenged by Cahill. The defender catches Gayle near the ankle. Everyone shakes hands at the end and they are all friends again. 53 min: Shelvey has looked good on the ball for Newcastle today, if only they had someone ahead of him worth passing to. Clark is the next man to realise there is no one worth passing to and then shouts at Gayle as the ball heads out of play. 51 min: The tempo has certainly dropped in the half both on the pitch and in the crowd. It livens up as Newcastle clear a cross from Rudiger straight to Pedro who whips the ball over the bar from 18 yards. 49 min: If you fly on Delta you can great free wifi to use for messaging on iMessage, Facebook and something else. That is all I have found out in this half so far and that came from the hoardings. 47 min: Nothing has happened so far. Maybe both teams have accepted the result and will just save their legs. But...wait! Chris Sutton says 2-0 is a “dangerous scoreline” so it’s game on! Here we go again! The teams are back out. And all 22 players are the same as the ones who finished the first-half. A great day for Michy stats. Is there a way back for Newcastle? Probably not. But at least we will get another 45 minutes to find out. Dwight Gayle really is a Championship striker. Surely Rafa will bring someone in before the deadline. Batshuayi is on fire (in the FA Cup). Newcastle looked to be Chelsea’s equals for the majority of the half but the home team have shown their quality thanks to a superb pass from Pedro to help with the first and then a clinical break, helped by the final movement of Batshuayi. Newcastle have had a few chances but Gayle has looked lost up top and he needs more support if they are to get back into the game. 45+2 min: Shelvey smashes a low shot from 25 yards, which is deflected but Caballero reacts well to push it behind. The corner also results in a great save as he gets down to palm a toe-poked shot from Mbemba. GOAL! The combination of Hazard and Batshuayi works again as Chelsea break down the pitch with the former playing in the latter, allowing the striker to smash one at goal, Lascelles slides in to block the ball but it bounces off the defender and over the goalkeeper, looping into the net. A good break ends in the second. 43 min: Chelsea set their own downfall by trying to play out the back when under pressure from a number of Newcastle players, with Drinkwater eventually being dispossessed by Shelvey who takes the ball forward and fires in a shot from 20 yards straight at Caballero. 40 min: Rudiger decides to surprise everyone by jogging up to 30 yards from goal, controlling a pass and then putting the ball onto his left foot and curling it just past the post and a despairing Darlow. That would have been a stunning goal. 38 min: Hazard sends in a corner which Darlow gets nowhere near, the goalkeeper tries to dive at the feet of a Chelsea attacker before retreating to his goal, as his defenders clear the danger. 36 min: Gayle does well to spin Rudiger 25 yards from goal, the striker then dribbles into the box and fires a shot across Caballero but the goalkeeper gets down to it easily. 35 min: Chris Sutton claims “there’s nothing wrong with the Checkatrade Trophy”. I would beg to differ. Now they are talking about George Weah. An anecdote about Sutton naming an animal after him has emerged. Now back to the football. 33 min: Newcastle could have been back in it but Gayle fails to anticipate Haidara’s great cross into the six-yard box which bounces through as the striker fails to make any movement towards the ball. WHAT A PASS! Pedro sends a wonderful 30-yard pass over the top for Hazard to get on the end of. He pulls the Newcastle defence apart and then lays it into his compatriot, Batshuayi, to tap into an empty net from a few yards. A tap in for Batshuayi. 30 min: Drinkwater decides to prove my point by sending a 40-yard pass straight at the goalkeeper. Speed it up, Danny. 29 min: Drinkwater and Kante are not providing the dynamism needed in central midfield. Everything is looking very slow in the centre of the park, currently. Conte might be looking to make a change sooner rather than later. 27 min: Chelsea are trying to pepper the goal but Alonso and Pedro both have shots blocked inside the area. Alonso is claiming he was fouled when he took his shot but there was nothing in it. 25 min: Shelvey sends the ball out to Haidara who does very well to work some space on the wing, he then sends in a cross to the front post where Shelvey has made a run to, he diverts the ball towards the bottom corner but Caballero reacts well to send it behind. 23 min: Oh Marcos Alonso! The Spaniard tries to send a pass across the pitch but instead just thwacks the ball into the face of Hayden who is a couple of yards away. The Newcastle man hits the deck and is now receiving treatment from the medics. That has got to hurt! 21 min: Ritchie intercepts a poor pass 25 yards from goal, lays the ball into Gayle inside the area but the striker decides against shooting for some reason and instead fails to give it back to Ritchie, who was not happy with his team-mate. Newcastle need to do better in those situations. 20 min: The Newcastle fans are singing with some gusto about Mike Ashley. They want him to sell the club. I will not repeat the words here as they are not very nice - they make reference to his weight and then swear a little. 18 min: Hazard gets up off the ground but might feel like he should not have bothered as he curls the free-kick from 18 yards straight into the wall. 16 min: Mbemba slides in and gets the ball from Hazard but the referee decides it was a foul for some reason or other. The same happens again a few moments later on the edge of the box but it definitely was a foul on this occasion. The second one results in the Chelsea man being hurt and Mbemba going in the book. 15 min: Zappacosta is currently hobbling around the right-wing as he looks to rid himself of discomfort. Moses is warming up, just in case. 13 min: Zappacosta is getting some treatment to his right ankle and his sock. Haidara caught him trying to block the cross and there was certainly no malice involved. 12 min: Shelvey commits another foul, this time by just pushing Pedro over as the Spaniard tried to drive towards the box. The result was couple of crosses being sent into the box by Chelsea and Zappacosta getting a rip in his sock following a late challenge. 10 min: Manquillo is flagged offside after receiving a long, cross-field pass. It shows that Newcastle have some intent when their right-back is being flagged. Nate has been in touch... “I can’t wait to hear days of media opprobrium over that Dwight Gayle dive, like we heard for Pedro and Morata.” It was hilarious, to be fair. Will he get a ban? 8 min: Rudiger and Cahill tackle one another on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area. Cahill is stronger in the 50:50, so he gets the right to clear the ball following the confusion. Newcastle are looking good on the ball, especially when it goes out wide. Although I am not sure Gayle is the ran man to have in the box. 6 min: Hayden races down the right and sends in a very deep cross to the back post but it completely misses everyone as it heads out to the left. Chelsea win the ball back when Kante is fouled by Shelvey, much to the relief of the home fans. 4 min: Alonso sends one down the line for Batshuayi to chase but he only succeeds in passing the ball straight out of play. Newcastle counter from the throw but Gayle fails to control a Ritchie pass on the edge of the area. Gayle decides to make up for it by chucking himself down in the box. 2 min: A very mild and sunny day in that there London today. Absolutely perfect for football, as Chelsea are proving as they have not given Newcastle a kick so far. Let’s get ready to rumble! And we’re off (after a rare change of ends). Chris Sutton is on co-comms so this really is the only place to follow the game now. The players are in the tunnel. Chelsea are showing off some jackets they are desperate to sell in the club shop, while Newcastle forget what capitalism is and instead just walk out in the shirts they plan on playing in. The PA announcer at Stamford Bridge welcomes Newcastle winger Christian Atsu back to Chelsea, where he spent four years, had five spells out on loan and played exactly zero games for the club. WELCOME BACK CHRISTIAN! Jenas and Hoddle give Rafa their full backing. It touch worrying that Mike Ashley is not willing to do the same with some money. Will they sign anyone before Wednesday’s deadline? I have pre-empted Konstantin’s question here... “do you know why David Luiz is once again left out of the squad? Do you think he’ll leave before January 31? Plus, it was really unnecessary mentioning that chicken sandwich as I’m really hungry right now.” Conte complains that his squad is not big enough but at the time does not fancy the talented - but flawed - Luiz. My instinct is that he might try to involve him in a swap deal over the coming days. I have just finished my sandwich and it was very tasty. Loads of garlic used in the roasting. David Luiz is missing today for Chelsea after suffering an ankle knock in training. Is it a transfer window-related injury? Could he be on his way out of the club? We shall see. BT are about to explain how awful Newcastle have been in the FA Cup over the years. It will not be great viewing for Geordies under the age of 70. Conte is just telling Des Kelly about his sleep patterns. He has managed to sleep last night, which is reassuring. Chelsea and Newcastle have enjoyed a close relationship this week as they have agreed a deal for international relations expert Kenedy to spend the rest of the season in the north-east. Will he fit in at left-back or further forward? We will not find out today as is not available. Antonio Conte is playing a strong side as “Chelsea need to win football matches”, according to Glenn Hoddle. Not too surprising a statement there from Glenn. Michy Batshuayi looked handy at Brighton and could be the answer to problems at Chelsea if they need a new striker, especially as Dzeko’s arrival does not look to be imminent. He just needs to add a few more goals to his repertoire. News just in from Stamford Bridge... A request from Matt on Twitter... I am not sure I can really provide such abilities to sort this. I once had a lecturer who explained that I would never need to write anything from the first half of football matches as nothing happened in them, so it would need him to be wrong for all the goals to be before the break. Good news! You can get in touch with me on Twitter or via email. The details are provided above *points upwards*. Your input would be welcomed while I chomp on a chicken sandwich. I woke up at 8am to roast the chicken. Leading the line for Newcastle today is Dwight Gayle who has scored three in 22 appearances this season and they all came in the space of four games at the end of November and the start of December, which could be the reason Newcastle want a new striker. Obviously, there is a chance Newcastle will in the game. All they need is for something like this to happen again. Papiss Cisse is currently banging in similar goals, one assumes, at Shandong Luneng. Rafa is not against signing a new contract at Newcastle despite the odd issue in 10. The former Liverpool boss has told Mike Ashley what he needs to do in order to get him to ink the paper. “I told Mike what I thought about that (the contract extension),” said Benitez. “He knows my opinion, and we don’t have to talk now. I don’t have any problem with my future. I’m really pleased to be here and I love the city, the fans, the potential, everything. “I can give my opinion in terms of football operations. But everything is subject to the financial position of the club. I give names, have some information, feedback from (managing director) Lee Charnley, and then give my opinion. “The main thing is that we have to be on the same page. That’s pretty simple.” Conte does not think one can last too long as Chelsea boss. Does he have a point? Fair play to Antonio Conte, he has put out a pretty strong team today. Barkley’s performance against Arsenal did not do enough to earn him a place in the starting line-up today, which is no surprise, although it might have been a good way to help him bed in. Newcastle are not resting too many. Haïdara gets a chance to show what he can do at left-back in what is his first appearance of the season. It should not be too tough for him up against Hazard or Pedro... Chelsea: Caballero; Rudiger, Christensen, Cahill ; Zappacosta, Drinkwater, Kante, Alonso; Pedro, Batshuayi, Hazard. Subs: Eduardo, Ampadu, Moses, Fabregas, Barkley, Musonda, Hudson-Odoi. Newcastle: Darlow, Manquillo, Mbemba, Lascelles, Clark, Haïdara; Shelvey, Saivet, Hayden, Ritchie; Gayle. Subs: Woodman, Yedlin, Dummett, Diamé, Atsu, Murphy, Joselu. Referee: Kevin Friend It’s the one they’ve all been waiting for. Chelsea take on Newcastle in a competition the latter have little interest in and the former only do out of necessity. Who will make more changes? Whose goalkeeper will be more out of nick? These are the questions we much ask ourselves ahead of the game at Stamford Bridge. Rafa is Newcastle’s most successful manager of the Mike Ashley era, which is not saying much as they only won three matches in the first nine years of his reign. The Spaniard has now won twice in two years since settling into the hot seat, taking Ashley to five match wins in competition, which is great news for him. Newcastle have bigger fish to fry this season, mainly the need to stay up and to sell up, so losing today will not be too bad. Liverpool fell at home to a team struggling at the wrong end of the Premier League yesterday, so Chelsea will not want to do the same. Their chances of winning the league are non-existent and the Champions League looks a bit tricky, not to mention the fact they lost to Arsenal in the Rumbelows Cup last week, so they really need to progress beyond the fourth round today. Will will be along shortly.

Simon Dudley, who has been the Conservative head of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) since May 2016, is expected to survive the challenge on Monday. The Tories have an overwhelming majority on the council, despite the resignation from the Conservative group of three councillors in the past week. Paul Brimacombe and Asghar Majeed quit immediately after their fellow Conservatives backed Dudley at a party meeting last Monday. Geoff Hill, the chair of Maidenhead Conservative association, resigned a few days later, saying he “declined to serve in the Conservative group” while Dudley was leader. Earlier this month, Dudley called on Thames Valley police to use powers under the 1824 Vagrancy Act and the 2014 Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act to remove rough sleepers and people begging from Windsor before the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. His letter referred to “aggressive begging and intimidation” and “bags and detritus” accumulating on the streets. He claimed some people made a “voluntary choice” to be homeless. “The whole situation also presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavourable light. As leader of the royal borough, this situation is totally unacceptable to me and my fellow councillors,” he wrote. It followed a series of tweets sent by Dudley while on holiday in the US over Christmas, in which he referred to “an epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy in Windsor” and said “residents have had enough of this exploitation”. His comments were criticised by Theresa May and national and local homeless charities. Last week, in an answer to a freedom of information request from a local resident, the RBWM said it had received three complaints in 2017. Two came from “residents who are unhappy with the current situation with vagrancy/rough sleepers on the streets of Windsor town centre. RBWM have also received details of a further complaint relating to rough sleeping”, the council said. Claire Stretton, who quit as a Conservative councillor last June to become an independent and proposed the no-confidence motion, said she felt Dudley had brought the council into disrepute. The council leader had not sought evidence from council officials, nor the views of colleagues, before sending the letter in the council’s name to Thames Valley police, she said, adding: “This was typical of Dudley’s Trump-esque behaviour, and it was the final straw.” The fact that the no-confidence motion stands little chance of success, with a 48-9 Conservative majority on the council, was “not the point”, she said. “It’s about drawing a line in the sand. We have to say this is not in our name. “There is no democracy and no scrutiny [of Dudley’s actions]. The whole of democracy is broken in the royal borough. If you sit back and don’t do anything, you’re complicit.” More than 274,000 people have signed an online petition calling for Dudley to withdraw his demand for police action and “offer a suitable long-term solution for these people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/29/exclusive-marin-alsop-appointed-first-female-artistic-director-of-orf-orchestra","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Marin Alsop appointed first female artistic director of top Vienna orchestra","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/29/exclusive-marin-alsop-appointed-first-female-artistic-director-of-orf-orchestra","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/29/exclusive-marin-alsop-appointed-first-female-artistic-director-of-orf-orchestra","fields":{"headline":"Marin Alsop appointed first female artistic director of top Vienna orchestra","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The American conductor Marin Alsop has been appointed artistic director of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, becoming the first woman to take up the prestigious role. Alsop, one of the world’s leading conductors, and the first woman to conduct the Last Night of the Proms, said she was honoured to be assuming the post in Vienna, which she called “the seat of classical music”. Acknowledging how groundbreaking the appointment was for the classical music capital of the world, which has often been shockingly slow to welcome female musicians, let alone promote them to leadership roles, Alsop said she welcomed the chance to “push the envelope” for women in music. But she said she hoped the time would soon come when being “the first woman” would no longer be news. “I’m very honoured to be the first,” she admitted, “but I’m also rather shocked that we can be in this year, in this century, and there can still be ‘firsts’ for women.” She said she was determined to see her appointment as the ORF (Austrian Broadcasting Corporation) Radio Symphony Orchestra’s chief conductor as “an opportunity to try to push this issue forward past being ‘the first’ and more about how we can create many more opportunities for a wide range of women in these roles and how we can change the landscape for future generations”. The Vienna music world has frequently made headlines for its fusty attitude towards women. Only 20 years ago the Vienna Philharmonic bowed to public pressure and announced it would officially accept female musicians for the first time. What it was reluctant to admit was that it had had a female musician – the harpist Anna Lelkes, for the previous 26 years, but had never acknowledged her presence, and only allowed for her hands to be visible during television broadcasts. Even after officially opening up to women, the orchestra was extremely slow to appoint them and even today it remains overwhelmingly male dominated. Alsop described the Vienna RSO, which celebrates its 50th birthday next year, as an innovative and cutting-edge orchestra which saw its responsibility in “doing the unexpected”. She said she was “very heartened” to have been chosen by the musicians themselves to succeed Cornelius Meister who has led the orchestra since 2010. “It’s great that the orchestra is stepping out like this,” Alsop said. “It’s wonderful for us to be able to show a woman in a leadership role like this, although I obviously hope that was low down on the list of why I was engaged. “This will be a relationship born out of a shared goal, to create the best music and find the highest artistic level of excellence we can together,” she added. Much was made of Alsop’s role as the first woman in 118 years to conduct the Last Night of the Proms in September 2013. That night she said in her speech she hoped the evening would be seen “as a natural progression toward more inclusion in classical music ... here’s to the second, third, fourth, fifth, hundreds (of women) to come.” Born in New York, Alsop wanted to be a conductor from the age of nine and studied under Leonard Bernstein. Known for a fervent but sober conducting style, and her ardent belief in outreach programmes for young people, she is also chief conductor at both the São Paulo and Baltimore Symphony Orchestras. In 2007 she became the first woman to lead a major US orchestra. She is currently artist in residence at London’s Southbank Centre and has a pivotal role in the global celebrations this year for Bernstein’s centenary. Calling the classical music world a “microcosm of our greater society, and a very conservative one at that”, Alsop, 61, said the lack of female conductors was a “reflection of the broader world”. “I think it has more to do with a lack of opportunity and then a comfort level in society of seeing women in certain roles. It takes a long time for us (as a society) to adapt ... we’re very slow to become comfortable. And if there are on top of that very few opportunities to even see a range of women (in leadership roles) the hope of changing society’s comfort level is really minimal.” Alsop said now that the #MeToo debate had reached the world of classical music, after the suspension of conductor James Levine from New York’s Metropolitan Opera and the decision by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and other ensembles to drop conductor Charles Dutoit over sexual harassment claims, she hoped it would lead to encouraging a greater awareness of the importance of promoting women. “I think #MeToo is a great step forward, but I worry about the danger that it’s just a short-lived flame. I think we have to also be out there and proactively creating opportunities for women to get the experience they need and for them to be seen. And that applies to women in every field, of every colour, shape, size, age, so that it can turn into a positive movement that is able to educate women and men on how we can move forward in equality terms,” she said. She added she expected there to be “probably a lot more revelations” of sexual harassment in the classical music world “because it’s historically been the way”, and called on those protecting perpetrators to break their silence. “Because it takes a lot of people to protect and keep these things quiet. I say we all have to be able to have the courage to stand up and try to help change the landscape for the future.” Alsop, speaking in Copenhagen where she had been conducting the Danish Symphony Orchestra at the weekend, said she recognised the importance of her role as a cultural ambassador working in Austria at a time when the country is under scrutiny following the recent entry of the far-right Freedom party into government. “What’s going on in Austria is obviously reflected in what’s going on in the US, in the UK and everywhere,” she said. “People think we in the classical music world are just living in a museum, but that’s a fallacy. Classical musicians tend to be very engaged in the world around them [and] the wonderful thing about classical music is that it really can transcend politics because it’s wordless, so we’re able to reach out across those barriers and these differences and build bridges of communal experience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/28/brothers-size-review-young-vic-sheibani-alvin-mccraney-brotherhood-dirisu-ajayi","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T12:34:53Z","webTitle":"The Brothers Size review – magical and bracing portrait of southern masculinity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/28/brothers-size-review-young-vic-sheibani-alvin-mccraney-brotherhood-dirisu-ajayi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/28/brothers-size-review-young-vic-sheibani-alvin-mccraney-brotherhood-dirisu-ajayi","fields":{"headline":"The Brothers Size review – magical and bracing portrait of southern masculinity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the decade since The Brothers Size premiered at the Young Vic, playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney has achieved acclaim (and an Oscar) with Moonlight, while director Bijan Sheibani’s star has continued to rise. Now, the play’s story of the complexities around biological and non-biological black brotherhood returns to the London stage, in a production as magical and mysterious as its Yoruba mythology-soaked script. Straight from prison and on parole, fun-loving Oshoosi Size is living with his older brother Ogun, the latter named after the Yoruba god of hard work. Enter Elegba, Oshoosi’s Creole ex-prison mate, whom Ogun does not trust. McCraney’s 90-minute script for his story, part-parable, about reunion and separation, fizzes and snaps. As the actors announce their own stage directions and occasionally break into song, the language treads the lines between poetry and prose, comedy and drama. The action dances between the dreams of the men as they sleep and their waking realities, from love long lost to harassment from Uncle Tom-type black cops. The actors dance, too, with movements ranging from precise acrobatics to loose-limbed hip-thrusts. Each action creates the world around them, on a stage bare but for a white chalk circle and a smattering of red powder. Fresh from a sold-out run at the National Theatre in London with Barber Shop Chronicles, Sheibani again shows how well he (and choreographer Aline David) directs movement. There are moments, such as the play’s opening song or Oshoosi’s jog through the hot southern US sun, where the three actors move so well together that the director might as well be a puppeteer. The acting is a gift. Sope Dirisu’s Ogun mixes exasperation and deep fraternal love with every shake of his head, and Anthony Welsh’s Elegba embodies the trickster god he is named after with each slow-rising smile. Jonathan Ajayi’s Oshoosi is the comedic centre of the play, but the way Dirisu and Welsh also use their physicality to fire up the humour is commendable. Ajayi, still a drama student, plays Oshoosi with the besieged optimism one expects from a character named after a deity associated with humanity’s struggles. Ajayi’s expressive southern drawl and tired, laid-back energy make Oshoosi’s standout moments – singing Otis Redding with his brother, Elegba’s hand resting heavily on his thigh – feel thrillingly, painfully real. Manuel Pinheiro’s soundtrack is perfectly pitched; Mike Gunning’s lighting is simple but effective. The Brothers Size is a bracing but beautiful snapshot of southern masculinity, and Londoners should feel grateful the Young Vic has brought it back. At Young Vic, London, 29 January to 14 February.

Speaking after a series of open spats, Lidington, who works closely with the prime minister in Downing Street, told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show that all sides of the “broad church” should unite to confront Labour. “I think what I’d say to all my colleagues is that the Conservative family – left, right and centre, because we’re a broad church – has to come together in a spirit of mutual respect,” he said. “There are differences in any broad church, but look at what the bigger picture is showing. The bigger picture is showing that after eight years in government, we’re neck and neck with the Labour party in the polls.” The latest confrontation over Brexit saw the former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers warn Britain was in danger of remaining in the EU “in all but name”. Villiers, one of six cabinet ministers from David Cameron’s team who campaigned for leave in the 2016 EU referendum, used a Sunday Telegraph article to warn against a “dilution of Brexit”. It comes after Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, accused the government of being “cowed” by Brussels last week. Leavers are concerned about the nature of the implementation period after March 2019, which is expected to involve the UK accepting the jurisdiction of European court of justice, and they have been alarmed by reports that officials are seeking to extend the period beyond two years. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, enraged pro-Brexit ministers and backbenchers last week by saying in a speech in Davos that Britain’s trading relationship with the EU would change only “very modestly” after Brexit. A backlash in Westminster later forced Downing Street to distance the prime minister from the remarks. Villiers said she supports “compromise and moderation” in the UK’s approach to the negotiations, but added: “I understand why some are becoming nervous about the current situation. “Since the prime minister set out a bold vision in her Lancaster House speech, the direction of travel seems to have gone in only one single direction: towards a dilution of Brexit. “If the government goes too much further down that path, there is a real danger that it will sign up to an agreement which could keep us in the EU in all but name, and which would therefore fail to respect the referendum result.” She urged May to resist the “immense pressure” to “water down” the approach set out last January, when the prime minister said Britain would be outside the single market and customs union. May has so far largely managed to keep a lid on the divisions within her party over Brexit, but ministers privately admit there are deep differences at cabinet level about how much the UK should hope to diverge from the EU in future. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, plans to deliver a speech on what he calls the liberal case for Brexit in the next few weeks, which could cause fresh discord if it appears to differ from the prime minister’s approach. Johnson was rebuked by May and several cabinet ministers last week after allies briefed a series of newspapers that he planned to confront the prime minister to demand a funding increase for the NHS. Jeremy Corbyn, also appearing on Marr on Sunday, denied that Labour’s position on Brexit was muddled. “What we wanted to do was say we’ll protect jobs and supply chains on both sides of the Channel,” he said. “There has to be the closest possible trading relationship with Europe, there has to be a tariff-free access to European markets. That’s where we’re going to with the objective.” Asked whether Labour would be willing to accept aligning its regulations with the EU to win such tariff-free access, he said: “We would have a regulatory environment that is commensurate with European levels of regulation – obviously, because half our trade is with Europe.“The point has to be about the regulatory environment and above all, the ability to influence those regulations that come.” But he insisted Labour would not want to remain within the existing customs union with the EU. “We would want a form of customs union, obviously; whether it would be the customs union, answer: no, because it would require being a member of the EU, which we’re not.“We would need to be sure that any relationship with the EU gives us the chance to influence the situation we’re in and any trading relationships we want.” A vocal group of Labour backbenchers is urging Corbyn and his team to advocate remaining inside the existing customs union. The Labour leader also confirmed that his party did not plan to throw its weight behind Liberal Democrat calls for a second referendum. “We’re not asking for a second referendum,” he said. Asked “and you’re not going to?”, he replied: “No.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/28/russian-police-raid-alexi-navalnys-office-on-day-of-anti-putin-rallies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T09:31:54Z","webTitle":"Alexei Navalny ‘detained’ at anti-Putin election protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/russian-police-raid-alexi-navalnys-office-on-day-of-anti-putin-rallies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/28/russian-police-raid-alexi-navalnys-office-on-day-of-anti-putin-rallies","fields":{"headline":"Alexei Navalny detained at anti-Putin protest in Moscow","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Russian opposition figurehead Alexei Navalny and 15 others have been arrested in Moscow after he attempted to lead a protest before a presidential election that is expected to return Vladimir Putin to power for another six years. Navalny, 41, was wrestled to the ground by officers on Sunday as he walked up Tverskaya, Moscow’s main thoroughfare. Amid chaotic scenes, police with truncheons fought off supporters who attempted to pull him free. His arrest came shortly after police had forced their way into his headquarters in Moscow in an apparent attempt to disrupt an online broadcast of nationwide opposition rallies. Police said they were looking for a bomb. Navalny, tweeting from a police van, said: “I have been detained. This means nothing. You are not rallying for me, but for yourselves and your future.” He was later released without charge, his lawyer told Reuters, although he will have face court at a later date. The anti-corruption campaigner, who has a large social media following, had called for rallies in support of an opposition boycott of the election. The Kremlin critic is barred from standing for public office after being convicted on fraud charges that he says were trumped up to prevent him from challenging Putin at the ballot box. Authorities in Moscow and St Petersburg refused to give permission for the protests. In Moscow, about 2,000 people defied bitter cold and a heavy police presence to gather in Pushkin Square, a short walk from the Kremlin. “Putin is a thief!” the protesters chanted. “Six more years? No thanks!” read one sign. Pyotr Kuvshinov, a 20-year-old student, said: “These are not elections, if there is no choice. They have stolen our candidate from us.” Youthful opposition members at one point scaled lampposts on the square and unfurled a Russian flag to cheers from the crowd. Protesters later briefly marched towards the Kremlin. Scattered protests continued across Moscow into Sunday night, including outside the White House, the Russian government building. Vladimir, a 70-year-old academic who attended the rally in Moscow, said: “We want to live in a democratic country. But people in our country have been taught not to think.” In St Petersburg, where police cracked down hard on an opposition rally in October on Putin’s 65th birthday, about 2,000 people demonstrated in the centre of the city. Ten people were arrested. Navalny supporters also rallied in about 100 cities across Russia, from Vladivostok to Kaliningrad. In Cheboksary, central Russia, 50 people were detained, while 45 people were taken into custody at a rally in Ufa, according to OVD-Info, a non-governmental group that tracks arrests. Other opposition supporters braved temperatures of minus 45C to attend a protest in Yakutsk, Siberia. However, numbers at the rallies were far down on March and June, when Navalny brought tens of thousands of people out on to the streets to protest over alleged corruption by Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister. Police were also far more restrained, detaining about 250 people nationwide compared with more than 1,000 in June. Navalny has already served three protest-related prison sentences since March, and he was nearly blinded in one eye last year when a Kremlin supporter with alleged links to the security services threw a chemical in his face. Although Navalny has huge support among Russian liberals, many opposition members remain suspicious of him because of his links to Russia’s nationalist movement. Yulia, a protester in Moscow, said: “I’m here because I hate Putin, not because I like Navalny.” Navalny says Putin is afraid to face genuine challengers at elections, and accuses the Kremlin of handpicking and approving rival candidates. Although Navalny is polling at about 2%, his supporters say an election campaign would have allowed him to capitalise on growing discontent over corruption and rising poverty. There is precedent for this: Navalny unexpectedly took almost 30% of the vote at Moscow’s mayoral election in 2013, securing second place and almost forcing the Kremlin’s candidate into an embarrassing run-off. The rallies on Sunday are unlikely to set alarm bells ringing in the Kremlin, which is keen to present a positive image of Russia before the World Cup in June. They also present Navalny with the challenge of rejuvenating his protest movement before the election. Speaking in an interview before the rallies, Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin spin doctor who now supports the opposition, said: “Navalny has done a very important thing – he has returned politics to Russia. But Navalny has a big problem – he is unable to capitalise on his success.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/28/australian-open-2018-mens-singles-final-marin-cilic-v-roger-federer-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T12:01:02Z","webTitle":"Roger Federer beats Marin Cilic to win Australian Open 2018 men's singles final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/28/australian-open-2018-mens-singles-final-marin-cilic-v-roger-federer-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/28/australian-open-2018-mens-singles-final-marin-cilic-v-roger-federer-live","fields":{"headline":"Roger Federer beats Marin Cilic to win Australian Open 2018 men's singles final – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Federer sounds like he’s about to burst into tears as he thanks the crowd. He’s getting more emotional as he thanks Marin Cilic’s team. “I have to stop,” he says. Here come the waterworks. His dad’s crying in the crowd. Rod Laver is taking photos on his phone. Cilic is trying to make Federer look on the bright side. He’ll need to compose himself before his lap of honour with the trophy. That’s all from me. Thanks for reading and emailing over the past fortnight. The Australian Open is over for another year. Roger Federer, the first man to win 20 grand slam titles, goes up to collect the Australian Open title for a sixth time. He’s got as many as Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson now. “I’m so happy,” he beams. “Winning is an absolute dream come true. The fairytale continues for us, for me. After the great year I had last year, it’s incredible. I’d like to thank Marin, another great tournament. World No3, that’s a hell of an achievement.” Read Kevin Mitchell’s report from Melbourne Park: Marin Cilic, who is set to replace Grigor Dimitrov as the world No3, speaks! “Big congratulations to Roger and his team. It’s amazing what you do year after year. All the best for 2018. It was an amazing journey for me to come to the final. Today was a tough match. I had a slight chance at the start of the fifth set. But Roger played an unbelievable fifth set.” Roger Federer is 155 ranking points behind Rafael Nadal. He’ll return to world No1 on 5 March if Nadal fails to make it to the Acapulco semi-finals. We’re hearing from the sponsors. It’s fascinating stuff. That was a strange match. It feels like Federer should have won it in three sets. Instead he had to do it in five. Cilic was outplayed for most of the match, but the way he kept fighting was so admirable. For a brief spell at the start of the fifth it even looked like he might go on to win it. Instead he has to settle for another runners-up trinket. Since his comeback from a knee injury, Roger Federer has won three of the past five grand slams. He’s astonishing. Federer clips an ace out wide for 15-0. He’s so close now. He moves to 30-0, Cilic sending a forehand wide. Cilic misses another forehand. Here come three championship points. We’re on the verge of seeing history made. Federer misses a first serve. He sends the second to the Cilic backhand, though, and the Croatian can’t do anything with his return. Cilic challenges, but the ball was in. It’s all over! Federer embraces Cilic, accepts the acclaim of the crowd and then sits down for another good old weep. He’s won his sixth Australian Open title and his 20th grand slam title! He’s 36 years old. Fifth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 1-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic chips a backhand slice wide to make it 0-15. Then he nets a backhand. He frowns. It’s 0-30. Cilic’s game has completely gone to pot here. Another errant backhand makes it 0-40. He saves the first, but then he nets a forehand. Federer will serve for the title! Fifth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 1-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer moves to 30-0. An ace makes it 40-0. He holds to love. The serve’s back. Fifth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 1-3 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic keeps hope alive, holding to love with an ace. Federer can’t relax yet. Fifth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 0-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic shakes off the disappointment of being broken, hammering a backhand down the line for 0-15. He’s still not giving up. After a Federer ace makes it 30-15, Cilic reaches a drop shot by the Swiss before chipping a gorgeous forehand down the line for 30-all. Cilic clenches his fist. He’s annoyed with himself after spooning a backhand wide off a second serve, but the game goes to deuce when Federer sends a forehand long. Federer looks unusually flustered. He bellows when Cilic, stretching, sends a return long. He’s happier when Cilic crashes a forehand wide. Fifth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 0-2 Federer (*denotes server): At 15-all, Cilic double-faults. The applause from the crowd is urgent and a little ungenerous. Cilic drowns it out and makes it 30-all. He’s so up for this now, working Federer over with the forehand to make it 40-30. The game goes to deuce after a splendid Federer return, though, and then he challenges a Cilic second serve. It was long. It’s a break point. Federer’s backhand return is sharp and Cilic nets a forehand to drop his serve. What next? Fifth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer, of course, won last year’s final in five sets. He also beat Cilic in five at Wimbledon in 2016. But while there’s no doubt who most fans are backing, Cilic is swinging freely. The game goes to 30-all. Federer is mightily relieved to see Cilic swipe a forehand wide. But the game goes to deuce after a Cilic smash. You know, this reminds me of Federer’s five-set defeat to Juan Martin del Potro in the 2009 US Open final. Federer slaps a forehand into the net to give up a break point. He’s teetering here. Cilic lets him off the hook, netting a forehand return off a second serve, but he has another chance after Federer sends a backhand long. Federer saves it, though, serving well. Mirka’s on her feet now. This is the first time Federer’s been tested in the entire tournament. You feel he’s having to rouse himself. So he pings a backhand from left to right to hold. What an angle. Cilic’s challenge is in vain. They were getting ready to put Federer’s name on the trophy 20 minutes ago. But now look. The break’s disappeared and now Cilic is serving for a fifth set. He begins the task by volleying brilliantly for 15-0. Then Federer nets a backhand. The crowd sounds disappointed. The applause is almost muted when Cilic sends a serve out wide to earn three set points. Another booming serve down the middle forces Federer to hit long and, incredibly, we’re heading into a fifth set. Don’t pretend you saw this coming. What a comeback from Cilic! Fourth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 5-3 Federer* (*denotes server): This is a weird match. Cilic has looked down and out on several occasions, yet he keeps managing to clamber off the ropes to land a few blows on Federer. A huge forehand takes him to 0-30. Then he rushes Federer into a forehand error to earn two break points. A Federer forehand almost lands long. It stays in, though, and Cilic overcooks a backhand. Then Cilic misses a return off a second serve. The game goes to deuce. Federer is under severe pressure at the moment. He’s facing another break point after sending a backhand wide, challenging to no avail. Cilic is ruthless this time, slapping a forehand past Federer. He’s won four straight games and will serve to force a decider! Fourth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 4-3 Federer (*denotes server): I’ve just noticed the last few entries have had the third-set score the wrong way round. Easy explanation: Rafa Nadal took over my laptop. Unfortunately for Cilic, he didn’t win it. Sorry, Marin. Not that he cares. He survives a double-fault and a break point to hold. Federer needs to react quickly. Fourth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Or does he know? Do we know? Two big shots take Cilic to 0-30. Then Federer chucks in a double-fault. Three break points. Cilic turns up the power with his forehand and Federer cracks. It isn’t over yet! Fourth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is doing his best not to give up, holding to 15. But he knows. We all know. At least he hasn’t got a blister. Fourth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 1-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer holds to love with a ridiculous drop shot. Fourth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 1-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic’s first double-fault makes it 15-all. Soon it’s 15-30, Federer’s forehand return so very good. It’s draining. At 30-all, Cilic double-faults again. But he’s still battling, thumping a forehand down the line to force deuce. He clings on to his serve. Can he break? Fourth set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 0-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer gambols into a 40-0 lead, belief draining from Cilic with every point that gets away from him. He holds to 15. Fourth set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 0-1 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic looks disheartened. At 30-all, he nets a backhand to give Federer a break point. Federer’s chopped sliced return pulls Cilic forward. The big man stoops and dribbles a slice into the net. Federer is closing in on victory. Federer easily wins the first point, giving a short return the necessary treatment. He swiftly earns three set points. He only needs one: an ace out wide means he’s one set away from winning his 20th grand slam title. Third set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 3-5 Federer (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Cilic holds to love. Federer will serve for it. Third set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 2-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer butchers a backhand to make it 0-15, drawing a wince from the crowd. But an ace makes it 15-all. Then he comes up with a vintage moment, peeling backwards to hit a deep forehand on the half-volley, surprising Cilic, who nets his forehand. Another ace makes it 40-15. Federer holds to 30. He’s a game away from regaining his lead. Third set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 2-4 Federer (*denotes server): At 0-15, Cilic makes a poor choice, sending a backhand approach shot down the line. Federer’s easy crosscourt forehand forces Cilic to send a volley wide for 0-30. Then Cilic nets a backhand to give Federer three break points. This is a return to Cilic’s form in the early part of the match. Federer nets a backhand on the first, but Cilic lazily sends a forehand wide. Federer’s celebration is exuberant. Third set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 2-3 Federer* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. This has become a little more reminiscent of the 2014 US Open semi-final, with Cilic’s strength starting to ask Federer a few questions. At 40-15, a whipcrack forehand return from Cilic is a warning. Federer has to make sure, serving crisply to hold to 30. Third set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 2-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic clobbers a forehand into the left corner for 15-0. He’s really starting to give it some. An ace moves him to 40-15. Federer nets a backhand. Third set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 1-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic really fancies this now, swiping a forehand return past Federer for 0-15. Federer hits back with two aces, though, moving to 30-15. He holds to 30. Third set: Cilic* 2-6, 7-6, 1-1 Federer (*denotes server): At 15-0, Cilic loses a long battle of the backhands. Then he nets one to make it 15-30. He can’t afford a dip here. Good serving takes him to 40-30. He holds with a fine backhand. We’ve finally got a fight on our hands. Third set: Cilic 2-6, 7-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer holds to 15 with an ace. He must be livid. He had a lot of chances to take a two-set lead. Now there are doubts. He hadn’t dropped a set all tournament. Second-set tie-break: Cilic* 7-5 Federer (*denotes server): It’s Cilic to serve. Federer’s never really in the rally. He blocks a ball high into the air and Cilic watches it carefully before crushing a smash past the Swiss! Against all the odds, the final’s level! Cilic has stolen the set, but it’s up for grabs now! Second-set tie-break: Cilic 6-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer saves the first set point with an ace. Second-set tie-break: Cilic 6-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic returns deep before pummelling a forehand past Federer to earn two set points! Second-set tie-break: Cilic* 5-4 Federer (*denotes server): Federer blocks a return long. He challenges the serve. It was well in. Second-set tie-break: Cilic* 4-4 Federer (*denotes server): Federer nets a forehand. The tension is rising. Second-set tie-break: Cilic 3-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic awkwardly knocks a backhand return well wide. Second-set tie-break: Cilic 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic hits back, punishing a second serve with a heavy forehand winner! Second-set tie-break: Cilic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Federer softens Cilic up with a stinging crosscourt backhand before moving forward to clip a forehand into the open court. Second-set tie-break: Cilic* 2-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic wrongfoots Federer before putting a deft volley away. Second-set tie-break: Cilic 1-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer swings another ace out wide. Second-set tie-break: Cilic 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): After two lets, Federer’s third attempt at a first serve is an ace. Second-set tie-break: Cilic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): A tight rally ends with Federer slicing long. Second set: Cilic 2-6, 6-6 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer holds to love. Tie-break. Second set: Cilic* 2-6, 6-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds to love, nailing an ace down the middle. He’s got a tie-break at least. He’ll want more. Second set: Cilic 2-6, 5-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Suddenly Cilic is glaring at his box, feeling that this could be his moment after dragging the game to 15-30. Federer, of course, responds with an ace. But perhaps he’s starting to feel the heat. A double-fault gifts Cilic a set point. Yet the Croat can’t take it, stiffing a tame backhand into the net. What a miss. He’ll be kicking himself. Federer holds. “Come on!” he cries. Second set: Cilic* 2-6, 5-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic nets a backhand to make it 0-15. He’s under pressure. All these errors are causing him problems. He’s fortunate that Federer goes too cute with a drop shot down the line after reaching a Cilic volley, the spin taking it wide. The game goes to 30-all and Federer, so light on his feet, earns a break point when he picks off Cilic with a stunning backhand down the line. This is gutsy from Cilic, though, a sliced second-serve ace down the middle to fool Federer and earn a reprieve. Somehow he keeps finding the will and he thumps a forehand past Federer to hold. Federer’s had so many chances. It feels weird that he’s about to serve to keep the set going. Second set: Cilic 2-6, 4-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Cilic has a glimmer of hope after taking the first point. But he needs to be more consistent. He still can’t quite find his range. Federer holds to 30 when Cilic spanks a forehand long. Second set: Cilic* 2-6, 4-3 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic has done really well to hang in there. He could have collapsed after that horror first set. Instead he’s fighting. He holds again, coming up with an ace at 40-15. This is more of a contest now. Second set: Cilic 2-6, 3-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer speeds through another service game. Second set: Cilic* 2-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): At 0-15, Cilic needs three smashes to put Federer away. Federer looked like he was wearing an invisible jetpack there. It; not long before he has a break point, flashing a forehand down the line for 30-40. Cilic comes up with a big serve, though, and he manages to hold. Second set: Cilic 2-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer holds to 15. Nothing to see here. Second set: Cilic* 2-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic looks comfortable at 40-15. Think again. Brilliant returning lures Cilic into two scratchy errors, bringing the game to deuce. Then Cilic nets a limp backhand, handing Federer a break point. He needs a first serve here. He gets one, brushing the line with a wide ace, challenging correctly when the serve’s called out. But he’s struggling to get out of this game. He’s making life hard for himself. Eventually Cilic holds. He’s hanging in there. Second set: Cilic 2-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): After the first two points are shared, Cilic moves into a lead on the Federer serve for the first time, drawing an error with a powerful return for 15-30. Here’s a chance. He needs to take it. All of a sudden, Cilic is looking sharp, clipping a backhand down the line to earn his first two break points. Federer saves the first with an ace for 30-40. Then he bangs a forehand down the line to force deuce. “Come on!” he cries. Federer holds. Crisis averted. Second set: Cilic* 2-6, 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. There might still be plenty of tennis left in this yet. Cilic will certainly hope so. He’ll be desperate to salvage some pride - and he makes a promising start to this set, holding to 15. Serving for the set, Federer skips into a 15-0 lead. Cilic punches back, whipping a diagonal forehand pass beyond Federer for 15-all. That’s better. But it’s not enough. Federer fizzes two aces away to earn two set points. He serves down the middle and Cilic’s stiff backhand drops wide. That took 24 minutes and it was thoroughly forgettable stuff. At the moment, it’s looking like another miserably one-sided final. First set: Cilic* 2-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic clips a serve down the middle. Out! Or is it? Cilic challenges. It clipped the line. It’s an ace! 15-0! Another one makes it 30-0. We’ve got a match on our hands! Soon it’s 40-0! Federer nets a backhand and Cilic holds! That’s two straight service games! First set: Cilic 1-5 Federer* (*denotes server): At 15-0, Cilic smashes a forehand wide. Federer pings an ace down the middle to make it 40-0. He holds to love when Cilic nets a return. Nineteen minutes have passed and Cilic is about to serve to stay in the set. First set: Cilic* 1-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic badly needs to win this game. He looks like he’s on his way when he wallops an ace past Federer for 30-0. But then he sticks one backhand wide and another into the net, letting Federer drift to 30-all. Cilic needs to shake those two misses out of his system. Fortunately that’s precisely what he does, volleying accurately for 40-30, then clambering to an edgy hold. He’s on the scoreboard. He’s in the final at last. But it might be too late, at least as far as this set is concerned. First set: Cilic 0-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer hasn’t had to do much to get into this position. He’s simply had to be Federer. That’s been enough. Perhaps the sheer weight of his aura has made the difference. He hasn’t needed much inspiration to break twice. Instead it’s been all about Cilic’s nerves. He’s spraying the ball all over the court and another wide forehand makes it 15-0. Soon it’s 40-0. Cilic makes himself better when he clobbers a forehand away for 40-15, but Federer holds comfortably. First set: Cilic* 0-3 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic isn’t with us at the moment. He loses the first point. Then Federer frames a return. The ball drops short, but Cilic moves forward and blooters a forehand miles long, making it 0-30. This is a nightmarish start, akin to Andy Murray’s no-show in the first set of the 2016 final against Novak Djokovic. Soon Federer has three break points, Cilic knocking a forehand wide. Cilic saves the first, nailing a backhand down the line, but he’s broken for a second time when he pulls another wide. This is grim. First set: Cilic 0-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer rumbles into a 40-0 lead. He’s moving well. He polishes off a love hold with a dreamy forehand. The signs are already worrying for Cilic. First set: Cilic* 0-1 Federer (*denotes server): The 2018 Australian Open final opens with Marin Cilic, the affable Croatian giant, serving. He bounces. And bounces. And bounces. And bounces. And ... bounces. Then he serves. He wins the first point. The umpire gives him a look. Cilic moves to 30-15. An error makes it 30-all. More bouncing. A missed first serve. A second serve down the middle. It’s got a kick on it, but it bounces up nicely for Federer to flay a backhand away, bringing up the first break point. Then rally for a short while. Cilic miscues a backhand and the call is late. He challenges - and the ball was on the line, meaning he gets another first serve. But he’s all over the place. Federer, defending magnificently, hoicks a defensive lob high into the air. Cilic, in no man’s land, dumps a dismal smash into the net! That was a shocker. He couldn’t have made a worse start. Marin Cilic wins the toss and elects to serve. Roger Federer is playing for history. The 36-year-old is the oldest finalist in Melbourne since Ken Rosewall, 37, and Mal Anderson, 36, met 46 years ago, and he’s hoping to win his 20th grand slam title. If he gets it, he’ll draw level with Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson on six Australian Open titles. On this day in 2007, he won his third, beating Chile’s Fernando Gonzalez in three sets. “Will this be the ding dong battle like we had last year or will it be Fed pounding Cilic?” says John McEnerney. “Fed normally has a hiccup during the HC Slams so far he’s been immaculate he reminds me of Gregory Peck in Cape Fear. Fed in 4 or Cilic in 5. My head &amp; heart say Fed, my gut says Cilic.” Here come the players. Their last meeting was an indoor affair too, Federer beating Cilic 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 in London a couple of months ago. The conditions will favour the Swiss. There won’t be any wind to disrupt his smooth game. Cilic’s odds just dropped a little. The decision to shut the roof is being criticised. Pat Cash has called it ridiculous, saying that this is supposed to be an open-air tournament. In the Eurosport studio, Greg Rusedski is similarly unimpressed, pointing out that while it’s 38C at the moment, the temperature will dip as the evening progresses. Roger Federer speaks! “I expect him to be ready, two days off after an easy semi against Edmund. I expecy him to be extremely aggressive, serving big, big forehand, big backhand. I expect a similar match-up to the World Tour Finals, which I won in three close sets. I love winning. There are many reasons I’m still playing.” Marin Cilic speaks! “I’m feeling excited. I know it’s a big challenge to play Roger, but it’s a beautiful way for me to start 2018. I know it’s a big challenge to play him but I know I have beaten him at grand slam level in the past. I know I can do it.” The referee has implemented the heat policy and ruled that the roof on Rod Laver Arena must be shut for the final. It’s an indoor match. Federer will be pleased. Pre-match reading Our tennis correspondent, Kevin Mitchell, is the man with the statistics you need to know. Cilic is tied for eighth in unreturned serves with 41% (254 of 624). Federer is not far behind him in a group of four in 19th place with 37% (174/468). Cilic, though, has had considerably more free points with 107 aces – 19 behind the awesome Ivo Karlovic – to Federer’s 71, which is still good enough to put him in sixth place on the board. If it comes to sheer pace, Cilic also has the edge, having struck a high 133.6mph – 15th fastest of the fortnight – while Federer has cranked it up to 128mph. It is winning the point that matters and again Cilic edges it with 335 from 408 to Federer’s 243 from 296. Both, though, are at 82%. It is just that Cilic has played way more service games in the 17 hours and three minutes he has spent on court in reaching the final. Federer has had one of the easiest runs of his career. From beating Aljaz Bedene for the loss of 10 games in the first round through to seeing Hyeon Chung quit with blistered feet seven games into the second set of their semi-final on Friday night, Federer has spent a mere 10 hours and 50 minutes on court. That is just short of an hour more than his stroll of nine hours and 56 minutes at Wimbledon last summer. Hello. You’re unlikely to find anyone with a bad word to say about Marin Cilic. Everyone in tennis agrees that he’s one of the nicest men on the tour, that he’s the kind of person who shows no ego, is generous with his time and is capable of connecting with whoever he comes across. Let’s not be trite and label him a rarity in modern sport – get this, elite athletes are people too and are capable of displaying being normal – but it does make it hard not to warm to him, even if he isn’t your favourite tennis player. Yet he’s unlikely to be too popular with the crowd on Rod Laver Arena during the next few hours. Sorry, Marin. You seem like a decent guy. They’d love to root for you a bit more. Really, they would. Honest! But unfortunately it’s just the way it is for whoever plays Roger Federer these days. Maybe they can give you a few cheers now and then, some generous applause here and there. Save for the Croatian fans, though, the majority in the stands have come to see another Federer coronation. The smart money says it’s going to happen. A year since his remarkable return to the tour after six months out with a knee injury, Federer is the hot favourite to defend his title and win his 20th major. His main rivals, after all, are nowhere to be seen. Rafa Nadal, his adversary in last year’s five-set final, retired hurt in the fifth set of his quarter-final against Cilic. Novak Djokovic, the man who once ruled Melbourne, is contemplating elbow surgery. Andy Murray has already gone under the knife. Stan Wawrinka has a bad knee. But Federer, who turns 37 later this year, keeps going. He hasn’t dropped a set yet and he hasn’t even had to sustain a particularly high level of tennis over the past two weeks. His semi-final against Hyeon Chung ended when the young Korean’s blisters proved too painful for him to continue. Blisters, of course, are the last thing you need when you’re trying to deal with Federer’s variety and invention, as Cilic discovered when he limped to a tear-sodden defeat to the Swiss in last year’s Wimbledon final. That match will be on the mind of both men. Federer destroyed Cilic on that July afternoon, showing his stricken opponent no mercy at all, and leads the former US Open champion 8-1 in their head-to-head. Not that he’ll take the big man’s threat lightly this time. Cilic displayed a strong mentality to fight back against Nadal and he had a light workout in his semi-final with Kyle Edmund. He’s had a few days to prepare for this and he has the weapons to trouble Federer. Let’s just hope he’s packed the right ammunition. After three pretty forgettable grand slam finals, men’s tennis could do with these two putting on a bit of a show here. Play begins at: 8.30am GMT, 7.30pm in Melbourne."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/28/hottest-100-kendrick-lamar-wins-triple-j-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T21:30:28Z","webTitle":"Hottest 100: Californian rapper Kendrick Lamar wins Triple J poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/28/hottest-100-kendrick-lamar-wins-triple-j-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/28/hottest-100-kendrick-lamar-wins-triple-j-poll","fields":{"headline":"Hottest 100: Californian rapper Kendrick Lamar wins Triple J poll","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kendrick Lamar has become the first person of colour to win the Triple J Hottest 100, a milestone for the annual countdown after it was moved from its broadcast on Australia Day for the first time since 2004. Lamar’s incendiary hit Humble was widely tipped to come in at No 1 on the list of Triple J listeners’ favourite songs of the year. The California rapper has released three critically acclaimed and uncompromisingly political albums, and his highly anticipated 2016 record Damn, intended to be “a hybrid” of his first two albums, became his most commercially successful. Lamar came close to topping the Hottest 100 in 2015 with King Kunta, but was pipped at the post – controversially in some quarters – by New South Wales group the Rubens, who scraped in this year at No 77 this year with Million Man. Lamar becomes the first ever artist to make a leap from No 2 to No 1 in the countdown, and the second hip-hop artist to hit No 1. Two tracks by the Aria-sweeping Australian rock group Gang Of Youths came in at No 2 (Let Me Down Easy) and No 5 (The Deepest Sighs, The Frankest Shadows) this year. With band members of Samoan, Fijian and Korean backgrounds, there are more Australian people of colour in the now London-based band than there have been in all previous Hottest 100 top tens put together. And while an Indigenous artist is yet to break into the top 10 , Yolngu rapper Baker Boy came the closest ever, with Marryuna at No 17 and Cloud 9 at No 76. The enthusiastic embrace of the 21-year-old from north-east Arnhem Land is testament to both Triple J’s more deliberate efforts to include more Indigenous artists on its playlist and the openness of its audience to music it might have found challenging 10 years ago. Last year was a benchmark year for the countdown, with seven tracks featuring women included in the top 10 – including the top three. On Saturday, only four tracks by or featuring women placed that high, including Green Light by New Zealand pop star Lorde at No 6, and Chateau by Angus and Julia Stone, which came in at No 3. Mataya and Kira Divine appeared as featured artists on Thundamental’s Sally (No 8) and PNAU’s Go Bang (No 7) respectively. Some of the year’s most successful Australian female performers made it to the top 20, including major-label artist Vera Blue, indie artist Alex Lahey, and breakout singer-songwriter Alex the Astronaut. Lorde also came in at No 14 with Homemade Dynamite. According to data provided by the broadcaster, 51 songs in this year’s Hottest 100 came from male artists or groups, 25 from female solo artists and groups, and 24 from acts including both male and female members. The countdown was moved to Saturday 27 January as part of the country’s ongoing reckoning with the political resonance of Australia Day. The current date of Australia Day is considered a day of mourning for the country’s Indigenous communities, with record-breaking Invasion Day protests and Survival Day events held around the country on Friday. In recent years the call to move the countdown to a date more appropriate for the celebration had reached critical mass. AB Original’s #ChangeTheDate anthem January 26 hit No 19 on last year’s Hottest 100 after a pointed campaign, underlining the shift in the voters’ mood. After an extensive internal discussion and a public consultation process, where a majority of listeners indicated they either supported or were indifferent to the prospect of a date change, the youth broadcaster announced late last year that the countdown would be held on the last Saturday in January, beginning in 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/27/dubai-desert-classic-rory-mcilroy-li-haotong-slow-play","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T16:47:24Z","webTitle":"Rory McIlroy battles back to stand one off the Dubai Desert Classic lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/27/dubai-desert-classic-rory-mcilroy-li-haotong-slow-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/27/dubai-desert-classic-rory-mcilroy-li-haotong-slow-play","fields":{"headline":"Rory McIlroy battles back to stand one off the Dubai Desert Classic lead","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On the day when debate raged over the supposed simplicity of this Dubai Desert Classic setup, Rory McIlroy spent nine holes delivering an unwanted counterpoint. That McIlroy recovered so strongly during the inward half of his third round means a nod is due towards the stamina of a player who had been hampered by injury for most of last year. Make that another question answered: now for the most important one. With 18 holes to play, McIlroy’s 19-under-par is one adrift of Li Haotong. The Chinese player’s 64 in round three was all the more impressive because Li had McIlroy for company. Nonetheless, it would be remiss not to mention the painfully slow nature of his play; a matter that will surely only intensify over the closing straight. If the European Tour is serious about eliminating slow play, someone will have a word in Li’s ear. The 22-year-old is clearly a wonderful talent but demonstrates too much of the procrastination that dulls golf as a spectacle. “I thought if I just stayed patient, I’ll play good,” said Li. “So I just stayed patient all day.” The trouble was, nobody else had any option but to do likewise. McIlroy had returned at first light to make short work of the closing stretch of the second round. He played the seven holes in five under par, affording himself a two-shot lead. Thoughts of a procession ensued. Such sentiment was boosted by the general standard of scoring. The cut had fallen at five under par – a tournament record – with Spain’s Pablo Larrazábal taking to social media to bemoan course conditions. Larrazábal, who had fallen on the wrong side of the cut, called for more narrow fairways, thicker rough and firmer greens “to make it tougher”. Matt Fitzpatrick was among those to shout in agreement. When McIlroy produced a birdie three at the second, his advantage was three. An unforeseen wobble was to follow, with the 28-year-old reaching the turn in a one-over-par 36 to hand the initiative to Li. It took a McIlroy eagle at the 10th to prompt a revival, his back nine of 32 ensuring a 68 that looked highly unlikely for so long. McIlroy is seeking a third Desert Classic success. “I’ll probably need to play a bit better tomorrow to win. It’s two weeks into the season and I’ve given myself a second chance to win a tournament,” he said. “I feel like if I play my game I should be able to shoot something a bit lower and I feel like I’ll need something a bit lower to win.” Alexander Lévy has the hardly insignificant motivation of a Ryder Cup in his native France this year. His hole-in-one at the fourth kick-started his 65 and he is now 17 under, where he has Haydn Porteous for company. Andy Sullivan, a former runner-up here, has been scrambling desperately for good form that rendered his 63 even more welcome than normal. Sullivan is at 16 under. “I’ve worked very hard,” he said. “With seven weeks off to the start of the year, I really put in some work in the gym and effort on the course. I want to get back to my best. “It’s Ryder Cup year and when you’ve played in one of them, you don’t want to miss another one. It’s important for me to get back to where I belong and get back on the leaderboards to try to pick up some of these tournaments.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/30/sectioned-donald-trump-nutter-dangerous-psychiatry-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T13:09:32Z","webTitle":"Trump may be many things but he’s not a ‘nutter’ – and I should know | Clare Allan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/30/sectioned-donald-trump-nutter-dangerous-psychiatry-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/30/sectioned-donald-trump-nutter-dangerous-psychiatry-politics","fields":{"headline":"Trump may be many things but he’s not a ‘nutter’ – and I should know","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is no question that Donald Trump makes many people, myself included, profoundly uncomfortable. His politics are repulsive enough, but it’s more the way he conducts himself personally. Above all, it’s the apparent belief that he can bulldoze his version of reality through clear evidence to the contrary – that, a year on from his inauguration, has many still struggling to process the fact that this man is US president. Those of us who have been diagnosed with mental health problems face an additional head-twister. We are repeatedly told by friends and colleagues and commentators in the media that the man is “barking”, a certified “nutter”, a “lunatic”, and any number of other choice terms used to describe the tribe of which I am officially a member. For I am indeed a certified nutter. I have been sectioned, and it doesn’t get more certified than that. And yet, among the hundreds of “nutters” I’ve known, both on the wards and in the community, I have yet to meet one who even vaguely resembles Trump. Indeed, while the range of personalities on the wards is as varied as in the world outside, in my experience, self-doubt and lack of confidence are far more common among “nutters” than any sort of Trumpish bombast. You are much more likely to encounter empathy, compassion and a sense of solidarity than playground bullying. I remember one woman who had lived through the most hideous childhood imaginable. All her brothers were in prison and both her sisters were receiving psychiatric care. One day she presented me with a small, wooden box she had made and hand-painted, because, she said, she could see that I was having a hard time. Twenty years later, I still have the box. In fact, it is sitting on my desk. The woman who made it is no longer alive, but if she were, would she really belong in the same camp as Trump? For me, the answer to that question is, perhaps surprisingly, “yes”. But only because I do not believe that there is any “Camp Nutter”. Or if there is, then we are all of us in it. Mental health problems are human problems, and neither they, nor the people who experience them (which is everyone to varying degrees) belong in a separate category, however reassuring it might be to be able to banish there those who disappoint, outrage, or repulse us – if only to make clear how fundamentally they differ from ourselves. None of which is to suggest that it is inappropriate to question Trump’s mental fitness for office, a different matter entirely from laughing and shouting “nutter”. But even so, it seems to me that those professionals who do, would be wise to tread carefully. The history of the relationship between psychiatry and politics is chequered to say the least. The use of psychiatric detention for political ends in the Nazi era, the Soviet Union and China is well known. Less so, are instances in the US. In The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease, psychiatrist Jonathan Metzl describes how African-Americans were diagnosed with schizophrenia at the Ionia state hospital in Michigan in response to their civil rights ideas. The cause here is, of course, very different, but we must bear in mind that what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/28/benjamin-zephaniah-abuse-crime-peoples-poet-autobiography","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:03:24Z","webTitle":"‘I went off the rails’: how Benjamin Zephaniah went from borstal to poet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/28/benjamin-zephaniah-abuse-crime-peoples-poet-autobiography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/28/benjamin-zephaniah-abuse-crime-peoples-poet-autobiography","fields":{"headline":"‘I went off the rails’: how Benjamin Zephaniah went from borstal to poet","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Benjamin Zephaniah, the Rastafarian acclaimed as Britain’s “people’s laureate”, has revealed the abuse he suffered as a child, and the pressure he came under as a gang member to commit crimes – even to take part in an attack on a gay man. He has made no secret of serving time in borstal and prison, but now he is revealing details of his troubled early life in a forthcoming autobiography and tour. Speaking to the Observer, Zephaniah, born in Handsworth, Birmingham, almost 60 years ago, recalled how being in a gang made him feel like Robin Hood “redistributing wealth”, and how they were “frequently in trouble with the police”. There was peer pressure to commit crimes, from burglary to stealing cars, even beating up a man for being “queer”: “They were all beating him up. I didn’t want to … One of the kids looked at me, saying, ‘Go on, give him one’.” Zephaniah gave the terrified man what he describes as “a little token kick”. It was enough to satisfy the young thugs, but he sensed gratitude in the man’s eyes. He became so good at picking pockets that he saw it as an “art”: “There’s something about going into someone’s wallet when they’ve got it inside their jacket when you bump into them and taking it without them knowing. My trick was to take the wallet, take what I wanted and put [the wallet] back.” Beaten regularly by his late father, a postman from Barbados, his mother tried in vain to escape with young Zephaniah, seeking shelter at women’s refuges but being turned away: “They wouldn’t help her because she was a coloured lady. They were not used to seeing ‘people like you’. So I’m angry at the lack of help that she had.” In borstal he faced a different horror – the threat of sexual abuse. He cannot forget the boy who left their dormitory every night “almost like a ghost … to be fiddled by the teacher”. “One night, we all got up and tried to stop him. He begged us to let him go [because] this teacher knows some member of his family and is going to blackmail him … The people in these places were supposed to look after us. Most of them wanted to sexually abuse us.” Zephaniah left school at 13 without qualifications, partly because of his dyslexia. But his love of poetry was inspired by his mother and going to church, where he heard “charismatic preachers” deliver “a kind of performance poetry”. He taught himself to read and discovered a publishing co-operative that brought his work to the notice of mainstream publishers. He made his name through performance poetry with a political edge, as well as novels and plays. Appointed professor of poetry at Brunel University in London, he has 16 honorary degrees and was a candidate for the post of professor of poetry at Oxford. “My life went off the rails, but I turned it round. I learned not to steal. I learned to be trustworthy. I learned to help other people.” His autobiography, The Life and Rhymes of Benjamin Zephaniah, will be published by Simon and Schuster on 3 May, and he will be touring 19 towns and cities in May and June. Seeing his autobiography as “a social history of Britain” that also charts the struggle for racial equality, he begins with his mother, to whom he remains close: “There’s not many stories about the plight of Caribbean women leaving Jamaica. My mother saw a poster that said: come to the mother country, you’re really welcome here.” After working as a cleaner in Sheffield, she became a nurse in Birmingham. But life was tough at home. She repeatedly tried to run away from Zephaniah’s violent father, hiding in rented rooms and giving her son a “false name”. But he always found them because he worked for the post office, said Zephaniah. He would beat her and “drag her home”. He added that his siblings stayed with their father, and think he is a hero: “I said to mum, ‘Am I exaggerating?’ She said, ‘You only saw a bit of it’. God, I saw what I thought was pretty bad.” In his BBC Radio 4 play, Listen to your Parents, Zephaniah wrote of a boy who, “night after night, listens to his father beating his mother”: “People in the BBC tried to get me to say this was my story. I said, it’s not.” Far from mellowing with age, he is “angrier” than ever and despairs for today’s youth. In the Lincolnshire village where he lives they have been “robbed of facilities” and street-lights are switched off at night: “Teenagers can’t even sit on the streets and talk.” He is not surprised some turn to crime. In the mid-1990s, he felt optimistic: “I knew kids that just didn’t see race at all.” But optimism has evaporated: “In the Asian community, it used to be ‘just Asian’. Now it’s Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus – and they’re all suspicious of each other. The black community just used to be ‘the black community’. Now it’s Trinidadians and Jamaicans… We were all united, men and women. Now women are saying ‘we want safe spaces in our universities’. “I feel we’ve taken so many steps backwards and so quickly. I used to say that, when I get to 60, it’s not going to be a perfect world, but it’s going to be so cool, I can relax, I can turn into a Rastafarian comedian. No way, I’ve got to be the angry black poet again.” Born 15 April 1958, Birmingham, the son of a Barbadian postman and a Jamaican Jamaican. He was dyslexic, attended an approved school but left at 13 unable to read or write. Career Aged 22 he moved to London and published his first poetry collection, Pen Rhythm. His second collection of poetry, The Dread Affair: Collected Poems (1985) contained a number of poems attacking the British legal system, while his third, Rasta Time in Palestine (1990), was an account of a visit to the Palestinian occupied territories. He went on to write books for children and young adults, produce music records and act or write in television, film and radio productions. He was the first person to record with the Wailers after the death of Bob Marley in a musical tribute to Nelson Mandela. He was also poet in residence at the chambers of Michael Mansfield QC, and sat in on the inquiry into Bloody Sunday and other cases, these experiences leading to his Too Black, Too Strong poetry collection (2001). Awards Further honorary doctorates by London South Bank University, the University of Exeter and the University of Westminster. He was offered an OBE in 2003, which he rejected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/jacob-rees-mogg-maverick-brings-much-to-party-apparently-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:03:19Z","webTitle":"Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ‘maverick’ who brings so much to the party, apparently | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/jacob-rees-mogg-maverick-brings-much-to-party-apparently-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/jacob-rees-mogg-maverick-brings-much-to-party-apparently-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ‘maverick’ who brings so much to the party, apparently","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Jacob Rees-Mogg, that Slytherin Walter the Softy, has a knack for lurking in the shadows of party infighting and using resulting tensions to promote a kind of firm but fair version of himself, in which he is the only person who could possibly be talking sense. He’s now got his own podcast, the Moggcast, a title that makes me think of that kid at school who insisted that his name was K-Dogg when in fact it was Keith. The accompanying thumbnail appears to have been put through an Instagram filter called Keep Calm and Carry On. It’s a cartoon of Rees-Mogg, apparently cosplaying The King’s Speech with a union jack in the background but a smartphone in the foreground, because, with apologies to Mean Girls, he’s a cool Tory, not a regular Tory. As Philip Hammond failed to get away from Davos unscathed (after trying to wing his way to a soft Brexit), Rees-Mogg gave a speech accusing UK negotiators of being “cowed by the EU” and, whenever he has a public huff, talk inevitably turns to whether he’ll end up in Downing Street. But if Rees-Mogg is in with a shot of becoming prime minister because he’s got a podcast, and because Toff from I’m a Celebrity called him sexy, and because he makes historically dubious jokes about giving flags to the French, then we should remember how hilarious it is that he opposes gay marriage, that he shrugs at climate change and that he is anti-choice in all circumstances, including rape. Perhaps his greatest achievement is not capitalising on his party’s struggles, but in the fact that he’s managed to become the Tories’ maverick simply by being as much of a Tory as it is possible to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"inequality/2018/jan/31/human-rights-new-rule-of-law-index-reveals-global-fall-basic-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-31T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"'A crisis for human rights': new index reveals global fall in basic justice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/31/human-rights-new-rule-of-law-index-reveals-global-fall-basic-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/jan/31/human-rights-new-rule-of-law-index-reveals-global-fall-basic-justice","fields":{"headline":"'A crisis for human rights': new index reveals global fall in basic justice","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fundamental human rights are reported to have diminished in almost two-thirds of the 113 countries surveyed for the 2018 Rule of Law Index, amid concerns over a worldwide surge in authoritarian nationalism and a retreat from international legal obligations. “All signs point to a crisis not just for human rights, but for the human rights movement,” said Professor Samuel Moyn of Yale University. “Within many nations, these fundamental rights are falling prey to the backlash against a globalising economy in which the rich are winning. But human rights movements have not historically set out to name or shame inequality.” The 2018 index, published by the World Justice Project (WJP), gathers data from more than 110,000 households and 3,000 experts to compare their experiences of legal systems worldwide, by calculating weighted scores across eight separate categories. While Venezuela retains its unwanted position at the bottom of the index – just behind Cambodia and Afghanistan – the Philippines is this year’s biggest faller, dropping 18 places to 88th in the table, on top of a slump of nine places in the 2016 survey. President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration has put a “palpable strain upon established countervailing institutions of society”, according to Jose Luis Martin Gascon, chairman of the Philippine Commission on Human Rights. He said there had been a “chilling effect” on the country’s opposition in the wake of attacks against personalities who have criticised Duterte’s policies. Non-discrimination, freedom of expression and religion, the right to privacy and workers’ rights were all taken into account in calculating observance of people’s fundamental rights across the world. Respondents’ belief in the protections afforded by such rights has dropped in 71 of the 113 countries surveyed for the latest index. “The WJP’s findings provide worrying confirmation that we live in very dangerous times for the rule of law and human rights,” said Murray Hunt, director of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law. “The worldwide resurgence of populism, authoritarian nationalism and the general retreat from international legal obligations are trends which, if not checked, pose an existential threat to the rule of law. Preventing violations of the rule of law and human rights is always better than curing them after the event,” Hunt said. While the Nordic trio of Denmark, Norway and Finland again rank first to third in the index, the United Kingdom has dropped out of the top 10 to 11th place overall. In all, 38 countries have seen their overall Rule of Law score diminish since the last index. Of the 35 countries classified as “high-income” in the report, the United States ranks 19th, just ahead of Korea and behind France. But in the fundamental rights category, the US falls five places to 26th, with worsening levels of discrimination and due process of law plus decreased guarantees of the right to life all contributing to this downward trajectory. Around the world, criminal justice systems have again performed poorly. Few countries were considered to have a penal system that is effective in reducing criminal behaviour, with only four scoring 0.80 or above in this category (on the rating scale of 0–1). An equal number scored below 0.10. “We are witnessing a global deterioration in fundamental aspects of the rule of law,” said William H Neukom, the WJP’s founder. Venezuela (113th out of 113) Venezuela remains rooted to the bottom of the Rule Of Law Index, with its scores in all aspects of criminal justice especially low. In a country where the economy no longer functions and citizens have surrendered to hyperinflation – with an annualised rate of nearly 2,000% – the complete collapse of the rule of law may perpetuate a crisis that has already impoverished more than a third of the country’s households. Despite the government’s iron fist, street crime continued to grow in what is the most homicidal country in Latin America and the Caribbean. While the interior ministry reported 53 people a day were killed last year, the independent Venezuelan Observatory for Violence estimated that 26,616 murders occurred (a daily average of 73). The capital, Caracas, was again named the most violent city in the world last year, with an estimated homicide rate of 130 per 100,000 inhabitants. Venezuela’s prison system is also one of the most violent in the world, with 6,472 murders registered between 1999 and 2014. According to Transparency International, it is also the most corrupt country in Latin America: military leaders have long used their powers over food imports for personal enrichment, skimming millions in public funds. State jobs and benefits were used to pressure public workers to support the government during elections; according to human rights advocates, those who didn’t vote in favour of President Nicolás Maduro’s new congress were barred from public employment. Over the past year – especially during a wave of protests against Maduro that lasted four months – security forces detained 5,475 people, more than 100 of whom remain behind bars, according to legal aid group Foro Penal. Mariana Zuñiga Scandinavia (1st to 4th) Fans of Nordic noir crime fiction may be struck by the irony that Scandinavian countries again top the WJP’s Rule Of Law Index. This part of the world apparently has little need for crusading investigative reporters, depressive policemen or detectives in chunky sweaters, with Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland jostling for top spot in each of the eight categories which together assess the ease with which countries’ justice systems tackle iniquity and wrongdoing. Denmark again heads the overall ranking, thanks to its strong constraints on ruling politicians, the absence of corruption, strong fundamental freedoms and low civil strife. The country gets a perfect score for protecting its people from armed conflict and terrorism – but ranks least well (significantly below its Nordic neighbours) in the effectiveness of its correctional system. To score high on this measure, as Sweden does, prisons and probation services need to be secure, respect prisoners’ rights, and be effective in preventing reoffending, the WJP says. Denmark is closely followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden. Iceland, the other member of the Nordic quintet, does not feature in the survey – which is perhaps a pity; the revelation in the Panama Papers two years ago that the country’s president was sheltering money offshore might offer some support for the myths of Nordic noir. David Crouch Grenada (36th) Grenada, an independent Caribbean country consisting of Grenada and six smaller islands, has seen the largest overall drop (by a score of –0.05) of the 113 countries in this year’s index, with particularly sharp declines in the areas of criminal justice, open government and fundamental rights. “This may be the downside of a recent referendum on constitutional reform which proposed transformative amendments on human rights and access to justice,” said Lady Anande Trotman-Joseph, president of the Grenada Bar Association. “It failed to pass, in part because the process got mired in anti-gender orientation and administrative distraction.” Last November, Grenadians voted by an almost three-to-one margin against constitutional reform legislation that included a “promotion of gay marriage” bill. As in the vast majority of Caribbean countries, male homosexuality is illegal here (punishable by up to 10 years in prison) and gay marriage is not recognised. “There has also been an uptick in reported cases of drug activity,” said Joseph, “while the state of older records kept at court registries may be another issue that impacted on the responses.” Grenada has at least made significant strides in its integrity and corruption efforts. Its Integrity Commission – “one of the more active ones in the Caribbean region”, according to Joseph – has implemented the Anti-Corruption Roundtable: a national mechanism tasked with monitoring white collar and financial crimes, procurement and the performance and discipline of public officers. Alison Bethel McKenzie Philippines (88th) It’s no surprise that the Philippines recorded the biggest year-on-year fall in the index – dropping 18 places – given the notoriety of President Rodrigo Duterte and his brutal anti-drug campaign, which has so far killed thousands of Filipinos. Last year was especially bloody because of months-long clashes between the military and Islamic State-linked armed groups. Martial law was declared in the island of Mindanao as the military repelled attempts to establish an Islamic caliphate in Marawi City; at the height of the clashes, nearly 400,000 civilians were displaced. Gascon talked of a “chilling effect” on the country’s opposition in the wake of attacks against personalities who have criticised Duterte’s policies, including the arrest of key government critic Senator Leila de Lima and threats of impeachment against the country’s supreme court chief justice and its ombudsman. Duterte, who has been in power for 18 months, has also threatened to abolish Gascon’s office. The Philippines ranks among the the worst performers in a region – East Asia and Pacific – where more than two-thirds of countries experienced a decrease in their overall rule of law score. Thailand and Vietnam also dropped significantly (seven places each), while Cambodia remains bottom of the region, and second bottom overall after Venezuela. Carmela Fonbuena Nepal (58th) Nepal is the leading South Asian country on the index, climbing five places to keep ahead of fast-rising Sri Lanka (59th) and India (62nd). It is the second in the world among low-income countries, after Senegal (49th). Analysts point to last year’s elections as one reason for the rise: local elections were held for the first time in 20 years, beginning the process of devolution promised in the 2015 constitution. Provincial and general elections followed, raising hopes of an end to the chronic political instability that has seen 26 governments come and go in the past 27 years. However, some legal and political experts say the elections only highlighted how far Nepal still has to go strengthen the rule of law. At least 77 improvised explosive devices were planted during the general election campaign, injuring 26 people. Political parties were accused of fielding notorious gangsters as candidates and sinking vast amounts of cash into their election campaigns, often with the support of business people keen to secure favours after the election. “It is not rule of law, but rule by law,” said Om Prakash Aryal, a prominent Nepali lawyer. “It is rule for the sake of interest groups, not the common good. Corrupt people are controlling the state apparatus; political leaders are close to the business mafia and work for their interests. But civil society is strong – somehow it may stop the situation from getting worse.” Pete Pattisson Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa is not quite the worst performing region for rule of law – beaten narrowly to the bottom spot by South Asia – but this may be little cause for celebration. The WJP’s researchers were unable to gather data on a majority of countries – including those where indicators are likely to be the worst, such as South Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and the Central African Republic. Of the 18 sub-Saharan countries that were ranked, Ghana is the region’s best performer, supplanting South Africa from 2016 and taking 43rd place globally. While Burkina Faso (70th) and Kenya (95th) have also made significant gains in the global rankings, the latter’s low overall ranking may anger its leaders as much as it encourages the many civil society actors who are fighting to preserve respect for judicial process and legal rights there. In terms of individual categories, Ethiopia scores very poorly for open government while South Africa does well. Zimbabwe is at the bottom of the list for fundamental human rights, though there will be hopes this can be improved now the rule of Robert Mugabe is over. Nigeria, hit by multiple insurgencies and conflicts, sits just above Afghanistan on order and security, three from the bottom of the list; Botswana, peaceful and stable, scores well here. If the lack of data for much of the continent is set aside, some more positive trends are visible. Could Africa be starting to win the battle against corruption? Four countries in sub-Saharan Africa showed improvements in tackling corruption, while none worsened. Jason Burke United Kingdom (11th) The UK fell out of the top 10 in this year’s index, with its score for the accessibility and affordability of civil justice notably lower than comparable countries such as Denmark and Germany, and much closer to the United States. The UK’s biggest decline is in the effectiveness of its correctional system, recorded at 0.53 – a figure lower than in the US (0.58). This may not come as a surprise given the ongoing prisons crisis and a series of highly critical inspection reports, such as the recent report on HMP Liverpool which highlighted “the worst conditions inspectors had ever seen”. The index also records reductions in the UK’s right to information and effectiveness of complaint mechanisms ratings, compared to 2016, and a worsening in the government’s respect for private property rights. A high point is the UK’s open government ranking (eighth overall), while all scores in the regulatory enforcement category exceed the average for high-income countries. Will Bordell United States (19th) The checks and balances on the American government have faced stern tests over the past year, with all aspects of the index’s constraints on government powers category showing a downward trend for the US. The biggest fall was for the integrity of electoral process and whether government officials are appointed using the correct rules and procedures. The US’s score of 0.76 in this category compares very unfavourably with 0.95 in Germany. The report also suggests Americans generally believe they are not going to be treated fairly where crime is concerned, with the US performing poorly on due process of law and, in particular, protection of the rights of the accused. Equal treatment and the absence of discrimination was a particular problem for the US in the fundamental rights category; its score of 0.50 is well below the average for high-income countries, with France and the UK scoring 0.61 and 0.71 respectively. But perhaps a surprising high point came in the absence of corruption category, where the index suggests a decreasing number of officials use public office for private gain. Will Bordell Poland (25th) While Turkey (101st), Uzbekistan (91st) and Russia (89th) sit at the bottom of the Eastern Europe and Asia region, it is Poland and Georgia whose scores have dropped most precipitously of all European countries in the latest Rule of Law Index. In Poland, concerns centre on the ruling Law and Justice party’s rapid capture of democratic institutions in recent years – in particular, the overt attempt by politicians to assert direct control over the judiciary. By giving itself the power to appoint a majority of members on the National Judiciary Council (KRS), combined with its reforms to the supreme and ordinary courts, Law and Justice now effectively has the power to appoint, promote, incentivise and discipline judges from top to bottom and at all stages of their careers. Ironically, given the justification for this power of oversight was judicial corruption, the index finds that in Poland, the judiciary is freer from corruption than either the country’s governing executive or its legislature. The picture painted of Poland by the report is of a relatively successful system moving rapidly in the wrong direction, with a downward trend in categories such as constraints on government powers, open government, fundamental rights and criminal justice.

Two days later, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Two weeks after that, the tumour was cut out. Six months on, she can’t say she was cured, but she sure as hell could speak this week. “I don’t think I immediately leapt to the inevitability of cancer,” she told Nick Robinson on the Today programme on Wednesday. “To begin with, I thought I would have this tumour, that it would be operated on and that would be it.” That, it turned out, was not it. Now her life, she said, was “affected” by her tumour. “How do I know,” she asked, “how long it’s going to last.” She was talking to Nick Robinson about the speech she was going to give to the House of Lords. She would, she said, be talking about the importance of adaptive trials – trials that allow you to try more than one treatment. If one wasn’t working, she said, you should be free to try a different one, even if it hadn’t yet been fully tried and tested. That, she explained, was how you got the “pace of change”. It was a risk that patients should be free to take, because risks look different when time is like a ticking clock that’s about to wind down. When she finished giving that speech on Thursday, every single person in that chamber leapt to their feet. The standing ovation lasted for a full minute. Doreen Lawrence was among the people seen wiping away a tear. Doreen Lawrence, whose son was slaughtered by thugs at the age of 18. At the end of her speech, Tessa Jowell quoted the poet Seamus Heaney. “Noli timere, he said in a text to his beloved wife, Marie – the last words of a man who won a Nobel prize for his words. ‘Do not be afraid.’” Tessa Jowell’s blue eyes blazed as she repeated his words. “I am not,” she said, “afraid.” She didn’t want the room’s pity. She didn’t even want the room’s respect, though it certainly makes a nice change to get it when you’ve spent most of your professional life as a politician. What she wanted was more help for other people with cancer: more shared knowledge, faster diagnosis, wider access to experimental treatments, better survival rates (we currently have the worst in western Europe) and for us all to be part of a “human-sized picture”, where the “community of love” created by patients was mirrored in the NHS. You couldn’t argue with any of it. Well, perhaps you could argue about the experimental treatments. This is a difficult area, as we all know from the tragic case last summer of Charlie Gard. Public money has to be geared towards what has been tested to save us from snake oil and expensive false hope. But the point was not the technicalities. This was not a policy speech. It was a cry from the heart to all of us for more kindness, more humanity and more compassion. It was a cry from a woman who embodies the qualities she would like us all to seek. In every life, there are moments of clarity. For those of us who have had cancer, that clarity sometimes comes sooner than we think. Sometimes, as treatments work and the years pass, it fades. Sometimes, you can almost have nostalgia for the piercing intensity of that time before it fades. When I was recovering from cancer for the second time, and was afraid that I would die alone, I learned how much I was loved. I also learned that nothing is more precious. Being brave, said the poet Philip Larkin in his poem Aubade, “lets no one off the grave”. We are all going to die, and about half of us will get cancer first. “In the end,” said Jowell, “what gives a life meaning is not only how it is loved, but how it draws to a close.” Well, Amen to that. • Christina Patterson is a writer, broadcaster and columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/10/quiz-ode-to-aphrodite-waterloo-veteran-doctor-who-dog","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Whose only complete surviving poem is her Ode To Aphrodite?

Rather than being the start of a bad joke, Jorge Mendes, Mino Raiola, Jonathan Barnett, Fernando Felicevich and Kia Joorabchian have emerged from their varied backgrounds to become five of the most powerful “super agents” in modern football. In total, they are estimated to have received more than £200m from fees and commissions in the past 12 months, with a group of players under their control worth more than £2bn. And rising. Uefa’s wide-ranging club licensing benchmarking report last week found that from 2,000 deals reviewed between 2014 and 2017, agents’ fees averaged 12.6% of the transfer fee with that figure continuing to increase as Mr 10% has increasingly become Mr Name Your Price. Last year, leaked documents revealed that Raiola, who grew up waiting tables at his family’s pizza restaurant in the Dutch city of Haarlem, earned £42m from Paul Pogba’s then world‑record £89m move to Manchester United – almost 50%. United are also thought to have shelled out up to £15m to Felicevich – an Argentinian whose first love is rugby and who gained a master’s degree in advertising after studying in Paris – to sign Alexis Sánchez from Arsenal, with Raiola’s client Henrikh Mkhitaryan going in the other direction. Pippo Russo, a sociologist at the University of Florence who specialises in the business of football, says: “The amount of money that is going to agents is increasing and this is a reflection of the financial resources now in the game. In my opinion, the super agents are the people who are most responsible for this madness. They are no longer intermediaries for clubs but are in a sort of joint venture with them – they are not brokers and are actually part of the deal. But the clubs don’t really want to stop this – to spend a great bulk of money on their services is for some reason convenient for them as well.” The Football Association’s latest figures published in April showed the Premier League spent a combined £220m on agents’ fees between February 2016 and the end of January 2017 – a 38% rise on the previous year. That is expected to increase by an even greater proportion when the new figures are published as further evidence of the soaring costs of the transfer market. But while some emerging superstars such as Kylian Mbappé and Paulo Dybala – who has recently left another Argentinian agent, Pierpaolo Triulzi, and enlisted his own brother instead – are following the examples of Neymar and Lionel Messi by turning to family members, super agents are still largely dominating the market. Transfermarkt, a website based in Germany which collects data from the majority of clubs on the planet, estimates that Gestifute – the agency owned by the Portuguese Jorge Mendes and that boasts Cristiano Ronaldo and José Mourinho on its books – is the most valuable, with a portfolio of players worth nearly £700m. Next up is Stellar Football Ltd, established by Barnett and his partner, David Manasseh, in 1992 and now with more than 200 clients around the world, including Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale. Raiola is just behind in third, with Unique Sports Management – another English company, which is gaining ground quickly on its competitors – fourth, thanks to its association with Harry Kane. There is, however, no sign of Joorabchian’s Sports Invest UK Ltd – the company established in 2006 by the boyhood Arsenal supporter who attended Shiplake college, a boarding school near Henley in Oxfordshire. Together with his Brazilian associate Giuliano Bertolucci’s Euro Export Assessoria e Propaganda Ltda, Joorabchian oversaw the £142m deal that took Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona this month – the second most expensive transfer of all time – but has been a controversial figure since his role in the transfers of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to West Ham in 2006, when the club were fined £5.5m by the Premier League for entering into illegal third-party contracts. Pini Zahavi, a former journalist whose first deal was to broker Avi Cohen’s transfer from Maccabi Tel Aviv to Liverpool in 1978, was also involved in that deal. “Zahavi is always there,” Russo says. “He has a broad network throughout football and is really skilled in maintaining a strong relationship with everyone. This makes him an eternal agent who is involved in so many different deals. For instance, he was one of the key people in the deal that took Neymar to Paris and he has a lot of alliances – he’s a friend of Mendes, he’s never had a struggle with Raiola. In my opinion, he is the agent with the highest political sensibilities.” In a cut-throat market that has often been described as resembling the wild west, where each client is potentially worth millions of pounds, that kind of diplomacy is a key asset. Accusations made at the end of 2016 against several of Mendes’s key clients in the Football Leaks scandal – which alleged Mourinho and Ronaldo had used tax havens to handle tens of millions of euros in earnings – have, Russo believes, harmed his standing. “This has done great damage to his image,” he says. “Until a few months ago I would have said Mendes was the most powerful man in football but in perspective of continuity, you can say Zahavi is the man who had dominated for longest.” But with Zahavi now 74 and Mendes’s ageing stable increasingly out of favour with several major clubs, including Paris Saint‑Germain and Real Madrid, the race is on to emerge as the new force in an expanding market. Those who already work closely with the biggest spenders, as Raiola does at United or Zahavi has at Chelsea in the past, are the most likely to emerge victorious in football’s own game of thrones. Matias Lipman, who works as an intermediary for South American players, says: “Sometimes there can be several people involved in a deal and that is why the costs have become so high. But you always have to remember that the player is the most important part – if he sees that another agent can help him get a better contract, then he will leave. It’s a fair market where the more intelligent wins over the weaker ones – that’s just business.” This article was amended on 1 February 2018 to clarify that Mr Joorabchian’s father was a businessman from north London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/28/migos-culture-ii-review-packed-with-stars-and-cliches","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:05:32Z","webTitle":"Migos: Culture II review – packed with star power, bragging and bling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/migos-culture-ii-review-packed-with-stars-and-cliches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/28/migos-culture-ii-review-packed-with-stars-and-cliches","fields":{"headline":"Migos: Culture II review – packed with star power, bragging and bling","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"How big is the third Migos album, the follow-up to their Grammy-winning Culture of 2017? Culture II is so loaded with star power, the Atlanta trio are just using one Kanye West-produced track on it, when several were recorded. Migos don’t need his endorsement. “Bigger than Oprah!” quips Takeoff, on Higher We Go, the album’s intro. This hip-hop event album of the year is so long – 24 tracks, no skits – it is effectively a double. It is a victory lap around the genre for an outfit whose distinctive styling – a hurricane in a Versace factory, plus all of the diamonds – and distinctive, muttery “Migos flow” has been extensively copied since the two cousins and a nephew first established themselves in 2013 with their breakout mixtape, YRN. Culture II has ample room for more than half a dozen further A-list rappers, among them Cardi B, who is engaged to Migos’s Offset. The list of producers fills a side of A4, as Instagrammed by Quavo. If anything, Culture II is overpopulated, as Migos return the favour to collaborators like assiduous parents inviting over everyone who’s asked their kid to a party. The job of this vast endeavour is to affirm Migos’s place in the pantheon, and put doubters in their place (“this real rap, no mumble,” they huff on Narcos). It also allows the trio to throw some curveballs. Out-and-out pop songs like Gang Gang and the previously released Stir Fry (produced by Pharrell Williams) stray far from Migos’s core kaleidoscopic trap sound. The group’s gruffest growler, Takeoff, has no trouble crooning. Most surprisingly of all, there’s even room here for jazz. Too Playa features not only 2 Chainz but a saxophone, while producer Zaytoven brings in flutes and elegant piano runs. The outro, Culture National Anthem, finds a supper-club pianist accompanying Quavo – the group’s unofficial leader and, increasingly, producer – as he boasts about Migos’s success: “Believe me when I say we create our own sound.” The grandstanding does not stop there. Culture II was never going to be a modest affair, in which three self-effacing twentysomethings quietly enumerated their blessings. Apart from some anxiety (“Tryna be like the Carters/Gotta be like the Carters” – Too Playa) and exhaustion (Work Hard), Culture II is wall-to-wall diamonds, watches, cars, chains, brands, fashion houses and exotic fauna. “Buy me a zoo/I got elephants,” huffs Takeoff on Crown the Kings. Other subplots include drugs (see the overcrowded White Sand, featuring three guest rappers to no real gain) and being less than complimentary to women, most egregiously on Beast. Quavo’s mum is obviously exempt. Cumulatively, the charms of these themes wear thin – Narcos, for one, is a series of Pablo Escobar-themed gangsta cliches. But often, the grandstanding is persuasive. The Drake-assisted Walk It Talk It finds the group exchanging their signature rapped triplets, exclamations and repetitions to the point of abstraction. Too Much Jewelry, meanwhile, features a bridge so robotically Auto-Tuned and excessive (“this ain’t even aaalll my jewelryyyy!”) that it must have had everyone in the room crying with laughter as they played it back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/26/daniel-sturridge-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-loan-internazionale","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T22:30:42Z","webTitle":"Sturridge not certain to play more if he stays at Liverpool, says Jürgen Klopp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/26/daniel-sturridge-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-loan-internazionale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/26/daniel-sturridge-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-loan-internazionale","fields":{"headline":"Sturridge not certain to play more if he stays at Liverpool, says Jürgen Klopp","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp has said Daniel Sturridge is not assured of more game time should he stay at Liverpool for the rest of the season and that he expects a quiet end to the transfer window. Liverpool sold Philippe Coutinho for £142m to Barcelona this month but are not expected to make further signings before Wednesday’s deadline having bolstered their defence with the £75m Virgil van Dijk. “I don’t think a lot will happen in the next few days,” Klopp said on Friday when asked about incomings, although there could be further departures with Internazionale keen on Sturridge and Lazar Markovic a target for Spartak Moscow. The Italian club have offered Liverpool a loan fee and a financial package to cover Sturridge’s wages until the end of the season but the striker favours a move to Sevilla, who have not had a loan proposal accepted by the club. Liverpool maintain the 28-year-old will either join Inter or remain at Anfield but, as the stalemate continues, Klopp has told Sturridge his first-team prospects may not improve. The England international has started only five games this season and last appeared in the Champions League rout of Spartak on 6 December. “I have never in my life promised a player game time for the next few months – it is not possible,” the Liverpool manager said. “When Daniel is fit, training and in shape he is still an outstanding striker, there is no doubt about that. But he did not play the last few weeks for different reasons. One of them was of course Roberto Firmino’s performances, then Dom Solanke’s development. And Daniel has been in and out of training [through injury]. In general more in than out of training but the time he was in he was a little unlucky with games. That was the situation, not more.” Klopp was circumspect on the prospect of Sturridge leaving, as he was throughout the Coutinho deal, saying: “When we have something to say about it we will say something, but so far we needed him and we will see what happens in the next few days. I would say wait a little bit.” Liverpool remain interested in the France international Thomas Lemar, albeit not at Monaco’s £90m asking price, and Klopp said he was not looking for a “specific” signing in this window. He added: “Our situation is always the same, we look all year, so why should I stop now only because the 31st is here? “We do that all the time, the only thing is with one or two players is we make a decision on is it for now or is it for the summer? That is the only difference. But look we are always constantly looking, my iPad is full of players from all over the world. But specific? No. It is not that we now say we need exactly that or we cannot play football any more. But in general? Of course.” Klopp said the Belgian goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who has fallen behind Loris Karius in the pecking order, would play in the FA Cup tie against West Brom on Saturday evening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/29/ms-john-lewis-sainsburys-bangladesh-factory-safety-accord","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T07:15:29Z","webTitle":"M&S one of UK retailers yet to renew safety deal in Bangladesh factories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/ms-john-lewis-sainsburys-bangladesh-factory-safety-accord","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/ms-john-lewis-sainsburys-bangladesh-factory-safety-accord","fields":{"headline":"M&S one of UK retailers yet to renew safety deal in Bangladesh factories","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Debenhams, Next and Sainsbury’s are among a group of British retailers yet to join international rivals in renewing their commitment to a factory safety deal in Bangladesh. The legally binding Bangladesh accord on fire and building safety was set up after the fatal collapse of the Rana Plaza textile factory complex in 2013, which killed 1,135 people and is considered the world’s worst garment-industry accident. Bringing together more than 200 international fashion brands, factory owners and unions, it has seen more than $55m (£39m) invested in safety monitoring, training of health and safety committees, and site inspections by 200 trained engineers. Its signatories have also contributed funds for safety measures including improving structural design and installing fire doors and sprinkler systems. More than 1,600 factories are covered by the programme, which comes to an end in May, with just over 80% of the necessary safety work identified by initial inspections. About 60 major international brands using 1,200 Bangladeshi factories – including H&amp;M, Zara’s owner Inditex and Primark – have signed up to a new version of the accord. With only weeks to go until the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy, at least one major British company, Sainsbury’s, has decided not to sign up to the new deal. Several others are holding back amid concerns over costs and possible lack of support from factory owners and the Bangladeshi government. Two industry sources said the tough retail environment in the UK meant retailers were looking to limit corporate social responsibility spending. The original accord cost the largest brands $500,000 a year before further commitments to support any work needed in factories from which they source. The new deal will last for three years maximum with reviews every six months to assess whether the Bangladeshi government is ready to take over its work. Contributions will be capped at €300,000 (£263,000) annually. Sainsbury’s said while it would not be signing up, it remained supportive of progress in Bangladesh. “We remain committed to this issue and will continue to support local manufacturers, helping them reach the highest standards in safety,” a spokesperson said. M&amp;S, John Lewis, Debenhams and Next said they were in discussions and still considering their options ahead of May. Jenny Holdcroft, assistant general secretary of the international union IndustriALL, said: “Brands need to stay with the accord otherwise all the hard work and money they have invested will quickly be undermined.” She said that those brands that did not contribute were letting other more responsible companies “carry the can” for continuing the safety work. Holdcroft added that the deal was important as there was not yet a “credible regulatory system in place in Bangladesh that can take over the work of the accord and guarantee the safety of the factories”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/28/hundreds-of-thousands-living-in-squalid-rented-homes-in-england","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T16:33:28Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of thousands living in squalid rented homes in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/28/hundreds-of-thousands-living-in-squalid-rented-homes-in-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/28/hundreds-of-thousands-living-in-squalid-rented-homes-in-england","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of thousands living in squalid rented homes in England","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rented housing so squalid it is likely to leave tenants requiring medical attention is being endured by hundreds of thousands of young adults in England, an analysis of government figures has revealed. Rats, mouldy walls, exposed electrical wiring, leaking roofs and broken locks are among problems blighting an estimated 338,000 homes rented by people under 35 that have been deemed so hazardous they are likely to cause harm. It is likely to mean that over half a million people are starting their adult lives in such conditions, amid a worsening housing shortage and rising rents, which are up 15% across the UK in the last seven years. Visits by the Guardian to properties where tenants are paying private landlords up to £1,100 a month have revealed holes in external walls, insect-infested beds, water pouring through ceilings and mould-covered kitchens. A 30-year-old mother near Bristol said her home is so damp that her child’s cot rotted. A 34-year-old woman in Luton told of living with no heating and infestations of rats and cockroaches, while a 24-year-old mother from Kent said she lived in a damp flat with no heating and defective wiring for a year before it was condemned. “Young adults have very little option but to rent from a private landlord, so we should at least expect a decent home in return for what we pay,” said Dan Wilson Craw, director of the Generation Rent campaign group. “Relying on cash-strapped councils to enforce our rights means that too many of us are stuck with unsafe housing.” The extent of the impact on young people emerged as a cross-party bid to give tenants new powers to hit back against rogue landlords gathers strength. The government has backed a private member’s bill going through parliament that would allow tenants to take direct legal action instead of relying on local authorities to do so. Research by Shelter published last week found that 48% of families in social housing who reported issues about poor or unsafe conditions felt ignored or were refused help. The issue has gained greater political impetus in the wake of the fire at Grenfell Tower where tenants had complained publicly about safety conditions but nothing was done before the blaze claimed 71 lives last June. Seven months before the blaze, Ed Daffern, a member of Grenfell Action Group, warned of “dangerous living conditions” and wrote in a blogpost that “only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord”. Government figures suggest as many as 2.4 million people in England live in rented homes, both in the private and social sectors, with category 1 hazards. That includes 756,000 households living in private rented properties – almost one in five of the whole private rented stock – and 244,000 households in social housing. The worst affected regions are the east and west Midlands, which features large numbers of Victorian homes, where about a quarter of a million rental properties suffer from category 1 hazards, according to the figures compiled by Labour based on the English Housing Survey. These hazards include exposed wiring or overloaded electrical sockets, dangerous or broken boilers, very cold bedrooms, leaking roofs, mould, vermin and broken stairs. “One million homes in this country are currently unfit, putting the health and in some cases safety of tenants at risk,” said Karen Buck, the Labour MP for North Westminster who drafted the fitness for human habitation bill that is going through parliament. “Yet at the moment landlords have no obligation to their tenants to put or keep the property in a condition fit for habitation.” About half of councils in England have served no or just one enforcement notice under the Housing Act in the last year, Buck said. The London Borough of Newham estimates 10,000 private rented homes within its boundaries in the category – equivalent to one in four. Its inspectors have photographed rats in larders, baths and beds in kitchens, bedrooms in cupboards and homes with plastic sheets in place of roofs. “In practice you have fewer rights renting a family home than you do buying a fridge-freezer,” said John Healey MP, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for housing. “Too many people are forced to put up with downright dangerous housing. After the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower, it’s even more important that ministers back Labour’s plan to make all homes fit for human habitation.” Sajid Javid, the housing secretary, said he was determined “to do everything possible to protect tenants” and pledged government support for new legislation that requires all landlords to ensure properties are safe and give tenants the right to take legal action if landlords fail in their duties. Since April landlords have faced fines of up to £30,000 and as an alternative to prosecution the government is planning banning orders for the most serious and prolific offenders with a database of convicted rogue landlords and letting agents. “The Grenfell tragedy exposed the catastrophic consequences of unsafe housing in the most devastating way, and how our laws fail to protect people’s right to a safe and decent home,” said Shelter’s chief executive, Polly Neate. “Too many private and social renters are forced to live in poor and sometimes dangerous conditions, unable to tackle safety concerns or legally challenge their landlord.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/27/jewish-nazi-holocaust-memorial-day-murdered-buchenwald-hitler-youth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T06:00:59Z","webTitle":"My family is Jewish.

My penpal’s has a Nazi past. Such is friendship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was born in Berlin, in the British military hospital next door to Spandau prison. My parents were refugees from Nazi Germany who came to England as children, and I was only born in Germany because my father, an actor, was then working with Bertolt Brecht’s theatre company. I was aware of my background from as early as I can remember. My grandfather, Werner Scholem, was a communist, a member of the Reichstag, and a Jew. He was murdered in Buchenwald. As a child, growing up in England with a British passport, I felt neither fully German nor fully English. I was confused when kids in my primary school, on finding out where I’d been born, pretended to shoot me, shrieking, “Nazi! Nazi!” After my grandmother died, when I no longer had any relatives in Germany, I asked my mother to find me a German pen friend. Ironically it was my Israeli Jewish “godmother” who came up with a girl of my age. Vicky and I began writing to each other. Her English was better than my German, so we wrote in English. A couple of years into our correspondence, I received an invitation to visit Vicky in Munich. “How lovely,” my mother replied. “What’s her full name?” When I said “Viktoria von Schirach” my mother went white, and appeared to fold in on herself. It turned out that Vicky’s grandfather, Baldur von Schirach, had been leader of the Hitler Youth. I was devastated at the thought that I might never meet my pen friend. Serious conversations took place. Eventually, due in part to our stubborn refusal to see our friendship terminated, it was agreed that our families should meet. I can’t remember where the meeting took place, but I do remember how odd it was – Vicky and I looking each other over shyly as our parents had sombre discussions. I went to stay when I was 15 and we had a wonderful time, hanging out in cafes and riding around on her Vespa. We took a sauna together one day, and I don’t know if it was the intimacy of sitting together wearing nothing but towels, but we finally acknowledged our grandfathers. It was a brief, awkward conversation. We’re still in touch. Vicky has had a tough time reconciling herself with her family’s past. A couple of years ago she visited Auschwitz and was profoundly affected by it. Today is Holocaust Memorial Day. This year the official theme is the power of words – it is one that resonates strongly with me. My own experience shows how powerful words, including those written by children, can be. Politicians and public events often dictate how we interact with each other, but everyone has a choice. Even after a year that saw the disheartening resurgence of prejudices and hatreds, we can choose to see each other through fresh eyes. • Leonie Mellinger is an actor and communication skills coach"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/26/england-six-nations-ben-teo-in-line-to-face-italy-rehab","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T22:00:32Z","webTitle":"Ben Te’o gives England Six Nations boost after funding own rehab regime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/26/england-six-nations-ben-teo-in-line-to-face-italy-rehab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/26/england-six-nations-ben-teo-in-line-to-face-italy-rehab","fields":{"headline":"Ben Te’o gives England Six Nations boost after funding own rehab regime","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The return of Ben Te’o is a rare shining light in England’s injury gloom and the Worcester centre has revealed he dug into his own pocket to fund a six‑week rehab programme in Australia and ensure he is fighting fit for the Six Nations Championship. Te’o spent thousands of pounds to fly to Brisbane in December and team with two highly regarded former NRL colleagues, embarking on an intensive training regime and adopting a strict diet to boost his recovery from ankle surgery in October. “It was important for me to go away. I didn’t mind picking up the tab because I know it is going to pay me back one day,” said Te’o, who has not played since sustaining his injury in Worcester’s Challenge Cup win against Brive on 14 October. “It was something I wanted to do. When you get injuries there is not just the physical side but the mental side as well. To come back really motivated and refreshed is a big plus. Physio, trainers, flights, food – we’re probably looking at thousands – but it’s worth it.” The centre, who is 31 on Saturday, has revealed he is two kilograms lighter as a result but he still provides the kind of gain-line presence England lack without Billy Vunipola or Nathan Hughes, and when Eddie Jones was asked about Te’o this week he said: “He’s absolutely flying.” Despite being named at inside centre for the first British &amp; Irish Lions Test against New Zealand, Te’o has started only once for England – in the Six Nations victory against Italy last year. He is firmly in contention to make his second start against the Azzurri on 4 February, however, with Jones set to hand the No 13 jersey to either the former Samoa rugby league international or Jonathan Joseph. Henry Slade would also have been in the mix but he is among a raft of players unavailable through injury – Jones may be without as many as 16 in Rome – but Te’o believes his 20,000‑mile round trip can kickstart his England career, having teamed with Rob Godbolt, the Queensland State of Origin physiotherapist, and the North Queensland Cowboys strength and conditioning coach, Andrew Croll. “Being a little bit lighter is going to be good for getting around the field,” Te’o said. “The game is getting really fast now so if you can get a bit fitter and stronger in the collisions it will help. I needed to find some nice firm surfaces to run on. The weather was another factor and just getting right away. I knew I had some good guys over there who I could work with. I’ve done stuff like this before and I’ve always found it does pay me back eventually. “I tidied up the diet and tried to drop a few kilos. This game’s not getting any slower and I need to keep up with the times. Sometimes when you’re rehabilitating at a club, there are other players too and you need to fit in. There it was all tailored for me. “I was up about 6am, got brekkie, my treatment and physio then on to rehab running, have a break, do weights, have a break and then I was going to see a boxing trainer to get a bit of conditioning. You can only do so much on a lower limb as it would get swollen so boxing was the only thing I could do to try and trim a bit of fat off.” Denny Solomona has emerged as the favourite to start on the right wing against Italy after training alongside Anthony Watson and Jonny May in the final session of England’s camp in Portugal on Friday. Solomona has won two England caps to date – both from the bench – but with Elliot Daly, Jack Nowell and Semesa Rokoduguni all out of action, and Mike Brown “borderline” to face Italy, the Sale wing is in line to get the nod."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/26/antonio-conte-long-term-manager-chelsea-impossible","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T22:30:33Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte suggests being long-term manager at Chelsea is impossible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/26/antonio-conte-long-term-manager-chelsea-impossible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/26/antonio-conte-long-term-manager-chelsea-impossible","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte suggests being long-term manager at Chelsea is impossible","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has suggested that being the manager of Chelsea for the long term is the impossible job. The Italian referenced the high number of his predecessors who had been sacked from the post under Roman Abramovich’s ownership – which is now in its 15th season – and he did not deny that he was set to depart in the summer. Conte won the Premier League title in his first season last time out and he currently has the team in third place – albeit 15 points behind the leaders, Manchester City. He has got them to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they face Barcelona, while they entertain Newcastle United in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday. His tenure has come to be mired in escalating levels of conflict, with Conte protesting to the board about the thinness of his squad and how he does not have a sufficient say in transfer targets. The club maintain that they work to Conte’s recommendations. There was a degree of I-told-you-so from Conte when he brought up how he had predicted last summer that this would be his most difficult season in management. He will continue to give his all yet it was jarring, to say the least, when he refused to take issue with a question that stated he was at war with the board, he was not talking to the director, Marina Granovskaia, and he was waiting to leave in the summer. “I can tell you that I continue to work very hard for this club, for the players, for our fans,” Conte replied. “But I saw a bit the history of this club in the past and it was the same also for the other coaches. I don’t see a difference between me and other coaches that managed this situation. “If I remember, at the start of the season, I said maybe this will be the most difficult season for me. I think that I have a great capacity to see very long [into the future]. “This is a great capacity I have. But we must be focused and give everything and know that we have to face great difficulties. If you know this, you are more ready to face this type of situation.” Conte was asked whether he had come to realise what it was like for his predecessors. “As I said before, my only worry is to work very hard but, for sure, if you look at the stats, you can see that in 14 years, 10 managers were sacked in this club. The stats are this. But, at the same time, when you are sure about your work and that you are doing everything to improve this club – I am very relaxed and I don’t have this type of worry.” Conte got his numbers wrong. Abramovich has overseen eight managerial sackings, including two for José Mourinho, while he has employed a handful of caretakers. But the point that Conte sought to make stood. Nobody lasts particularly long. Mourinho made it a couple of months into his fourth season during his first spell and that remains the record under Abramovich. This time last season, Chelsea had played 26 matches; now, the number is 38 and Conte does not believe he has resources to cope. What he did make plain was that his passion for the job had not waned; he is so consumed by his work that he is struggling to sleep at night. “It is not simple, for sure, but people who know me very well know that I live this job with great passion,” Conte said. “For this reason, sometimes I don’t sleep, especially when you have to face difficult situations. It is right to dream at the start of the season and then, there is the reality. You have to try to overcome the reality, like we did last season.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
